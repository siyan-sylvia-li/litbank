part one    chapter i the bertolini  the signora had no business to do it said miss bartlett no business at all
she promised us south rooms with a view close together instead of which here are north rooms looking into a courtyard and a long way apart
oh lucy  and a cockney besides said lucy who had been further saddened by the signoras unexpected accent
it might be london she looked at the two rows of english people who were sitting at the table at the row of white bottles of water and red bottles of wine that ran between the english people at the portraits of the late queen and the late poet laureate that hung behind the english people heavily framed at the notice of the english church rev
cuthbert eager m a
oxon
 that was the only other decoration of the wall
charlotte dont you feel too that we might be in london
i can hardly believe that all kinds of other things are just outside
i suppose it is ones being so tired  this meat has surely been used for soup said miss bartlett laying down her fork
i want so to see the arno
the rooms the signora promised us in her letter would have looked over the arno
the signora had no business to do it at all
oh it is a shame  any nook does for me miss bartlett continued but it does seem hard that you shouldnt have a view  lucy felt that she had been selfish
charlotte you mustnt spoil me of course you must look over the arno too
i meant that
the first vacant room in the front you must have it said miss bartlett part of whose travelling expenses were paid by lucys mothera piece of generosity to which she made many a tactful allusion
no no
you must have it  i insist on it
your mother would never forgive me lucy  she would never forgive me  the ladies voices grew animated andif the sad truth be owneda little peevish
they were tired and under the guise of unselfishness they wrangled
some of their neighbours interchanged glances and one of themone of the illbred people whom one does meet abroadleant forward over the table and actually intruded into their argument
he said  i have a view i have a view  miss bartlett was startled
generally at a pension people looked them over for a day or two before speaking and often did not find out that they would do till they had gone
she knew that the intruder was illbred even before she glanced at him
he was an old man of heavy build with a fair shaven face and large eyes
there was something childish in those eyes though it was not the childishness of senility
what exactly it was miss bartlett did not stop to consider for her glance passed on to his clothes
these did not attract her
he was probably trying to become acquainted with them before they got into the swim
so she assumed a dazed expression when he spoke to her and then said a view
oh a view
how delightful a view is  this is my son said the old man his names george
he has a view too  ah said miss bartlett repressing lucy who was about to speak
what i mean he continued is that you can have our rooms and well have yours
well change  the better class of tourist was shocked at this and sympathized with the newcomers
miss bartlett in reply opened her mouth as little as possible and said thank you very much indeed that is out of the question  why said the old man with both fists on the table
because it is quite out of the question thank you  you see we dont like to take began lucy
her cousin again repressed her
but why he persisted
women like looking at a view men dont and he thumped with his fists like a naughty child and turned to his son saying george persuade them  its so obvious they should have the rooms said the son
theres nothing else to say  he did not look at the ladies as he spoke but his voice was perplexed and sorrowful
lucy too was perplexed but she saw that they were in for what is known as quite a scene and she had an odd feeling that whenever these illbred tourists spoke the contest widened and deepened till it dealt not with rooms and views but withwell with something quite different whose existence she had not realized before
now the old man attacked miss bartlett almost violently why should she not change
what possible objection had she
they would clear out in half an hour
miss bartlett though skilled in the delicacies of conversation was powerless in the presence of brutality
it was impossible to snub any one so gross
her face reddened with displeasure
she looked around as much as to say are you all like this and two little old ladies who were sitting further up the table with shawls hanging over the backs of the chairs looked back clearly indicating we are not we are genteel  eat your dinner dear she said to lucy and began to toy again with the meat that she had once censured
lucy mumbled that those seemed very odd people opposite
eat your dinner dear
this pension is a failure
tomorrow we will make a change  hardly had she announced this fell decision when she reversed it
the curtains at the end of the room parted and revealed a clergyman stout but attractive who hurried forward to take his place at the table cheerfully apologizing for his lateness
lucy who had not yet acquired decency at once rose to her feet exclaiming oh oh
why its mr beebe
oh how perfectly lovely
oh charlotte we must stop now however bad the rooms are
oh  miss bartlett said with more restraint  how do you do mr beebe
i expect that you have forgotten us miss bartlett and miss honeychurch who were at tunbridge wells when you helped the vicar of st peters that very cold easter  the clergyman who had the air of one on a holiday did not remember the ladies quite as clearly as they remembered him
but he came forward pleasantly enough and accepted the chair into which he was beckoned by lucy
i am so glad to see you said the girl who was in a state of spiritual starvation and would have been glad to see the waiter if her cousin had permitted it
just fancy how small the world is
summer street too makes it so specially funny  miss honeychurch lives in the parish of summer street said miss bartlett filling up the gap and she happened to tell me in the course of conversation that you have just accepted the living  yes i heard from mother so last week
she didnt know that i knew you at tunbridge wells but i wrote back at once and i said mr
beebe is  quite right said the clergyman
i move into the rectory at summer street next june
i am lucky to be appointed to such a charming neighbourhood  oh how glad i am
the name of our house is windy corner mr beebe bowed
there is mother and me generally and my brother though its not often we get him to ch the church is rather far off i mean  lucy dearest let mr beebe eat his dinner  i am eating it thank you and enjoying it  he preferred to talk to lucy whose playing he remembered rather than to miss bartlett who probably remembered his sermons
he asked the girl whether she knew florence well and was informed at some length that she had never been there before
it is delightful to advise a newcomer and he was first in the field
dont neglect the country round his advice concluded
the first fine afternoon drive up to fiesole and round by settignano or something of that sort  no cried a voice from the top of the table
mr
beebe you are wrong
the first fine afternoon your ladies must go to prato  that lady looks so clever whispered miss bartlett to her cousin
we are in luck  and indeed a perfect torrent of information burst on them
people told them what to see when to see it how to stop the electric trams how to get rid of the beggars how much to give for a vellum blotter how much the place would grow upon them
the pension bertolini had decided almost enthusiastically that they would do
whichever way they looked kind ladies smiled and shouted at them
and above all rose the voice of the clever lady crying prato
they must go to prato
that place is too sweetly squalid for words
i love it i revel in shaking off the trammels of respectability as you know  the young man named george glanced at the clever lady and then returned moodily to his plate
obviously he and his father did not do
lucy in the midst of her success found time to wish they did
it gave her no extra pleasure that any one should be left in the cold and when she rose to go she turned back and gave the two outsiders a nervous little bow
the father did not see it the son acknowledged it not by another bow but by raising his eyebrows and smiling he seemed to be smiling across something
she hastened after her cousin who had already disappeared through the curtainscurtains which smote one in the face and seemed heavy with more than cloth
beyond them stood the unreliable signora bowing goodevening to her guests and supported by enery her little boy and victorier her daughter
it made a curious little scene this attempt of the cockney to convey the grace and geniality of the south
and even more curious was the drawingroom which attempted to rival the solid comfort of a bloomsbury boardinghouse
was this really italy
miss bartlett was already seated on a tightly stuffed armchair which had the colour and the contours of a tomato
she was talking to mr beebe and as she spoke her long narrow head drove backwards and forwards slowly regularly as though she were demolishing some invisible obstacle
we are most grateful to you she was saying
the first evening means so much
when you arrived we were in for a peculiarly mauvais quart dheure  he expressed his regret
do you by any chance know the name of an old man who sat opposite us at dinner  emerson  is he a friend of yours  we are friendlyas one is in pensions  then i will say no more  he pressed her very slightly and she said more
i am as it were she concluded the chaperon of my young cousin lucy and it would be a serious thing if i put her under an obligation to people of whom we know nothing
his manner was somewhat unfortunate
i hope i acted for the best  you acted very naturally said he
he seemed thoughtful and after a few moments added all the same i dont think much harm would have come of accepting  no harm of course
but we could not be under an obligation  he is rather a peculiar man again he hesitated and then said gently i think he would not take advantage of your acceptance nor expect you to show gratitude
he has the meritif it is oneof saying exactly what he means
he has rooms he does not value and he thinks you would value them
he no more thought of putting you under an obligation than he thought of being polite
it is so difficultat least i find it difficultto understand people who speak the truth  lucy was pleased and said i was hoping that he was nice i do so always hope that people will be nice  i think he is nice and tiresome
i differ from him on almost every point of any importance and so i expecti may say i hopeyou will differ
but his is a type one disagrees with rather than deplores
when he first came here he not unnaturally put peoples backs up
he has no tact and no mannersi dont mean by that that he has bad mannersand he will not keep his opinions to himself
we nearly complained about him to our depressing signora but i am glad to say we thought better of it  am i to conclude said miss bartlett that he is a socialist  mr beebe accepted the convenient word not without a slight twitching of the lips
and presumably he has brought up his son to be a socialist too  i hardly know george for he hasnt learnt to talk yet
he seems a nice creature and i think he has brains
of course he has all his fathers mannerisms and it is quite possible that he too may be a socialist  oh you relieve me said miss bartlett
so you think i ought to have accepted their offer
you feel i have been narrowminded and suspicious  not at all he answered i never suggested that  but ought i not to apologize at all events for my apparent rudeness  he replied with some irritation that it would be quite unnecessary and got up from his seat to go to the smokingroom
was i a bore said miss bartlett as soon as he had disappeared
why didnt you talk lucy
he prefers young people im sure
i do hope i havent monopolized him
i hoped you would have him all the evening as well as all dinnertime  he is nice exclaimed lucy
just what i remember
he seems to see good in everyone
no one would take him for a clergyman  my dear lucia  well you know what i mean
and you know how clergymen generally laugh mr beebe laughs just like an ordinary man  funny girl
how you do remind me of your mother
i wonder if she will approve of mr beebe  im sure she will and so will freddy  i think everyone at windy corner will approve it is the fashionable world
i am used to tunbridge wells where we are all hopelessly behind the times  yes said lucy despondently
there was a haze of disapproval in the air but whether the disapproval was of herself or of mr beebe or of the fashionable world at windy corner or of the narrow world at tunbridge wells she could not determine
she tried to locate it but as usual she blundered
miss bartlett sedulously denied disapproving of any one and added i am afraid you are finding me a very depressing companion  and the girl again thought i must have been selfish or unkind i must be more careful
it is so dreadful for charlotte being poor  fortunately one of the little old ladies who for some time had been smiling very benignly now approached and asked if she might be allowed to sit where mr beebe had sat
permission granted she began to chatter gently about italy the plunge it had been to come there the gratifying success of the plunge the improvement in her sisters health the necessity of closing the bedroom windows at night and of thoroughly emptying the waterbottles in the morning
she handled her subjects agreeably and they were perhaps more worthy of attention than the high discourse upon guelfs and ghibellines which was proceeding tempestuously at the other end of the room
it was a real catastrophe not a mere episode that evening of hers at venice when she had found in her bedroom something that is one worse than a flea though one better than something else
but here you are as safe as in england
signora bertolini is so english  yet our rooms smell said poor lucy
we dread going to bed  ah then you look into the court she sighed
if only mr emerson was more tactful
we were so sorry for you at dinner  i think he was meaning to be kind  undoubtedly he was said miss bartlett
mr
beebe has just been scolding me for my suspicious nature
of course i was holding back on my cousins account  of course said the little old lady and they murmured that one could not be too careful with a young girl
lucy tried to look demure but could not help feeling a great fool
no one was careful with her at home or at all events she had not noticed it
about old mr emersoni hardly know
no he is not tactful yet have you ever noticed that there are people who do things which are most indelicate and yet at the same timebeautiful  beautiful said miss bartlett puzzled at the word
are not beauty and delicacy the same  so one would have thought said the other helplessly
but things are so difficult i sometimes think  she proceeded no further into things for mr beebe reappeared looking extremely pleasant
miss bartlett he cried its all right about the rooms
im so glad
mr emerson was talking about it in the smokingroom and knowing what i did i encouraged him to make the offer again
he has let me come and ask you
he would be so pleased  oh charlotte cried lucy to her cousin we must have the rooms now
the old man is just as nice and kind as he can be  miss bartlett was silent
i fear said mr beebe after a pause that i have been officious
i must apologize for my interference  gravely displeased he turned to go
not till then did miss bartlett reply my own wishes dearest lucy are unimportant in comparison with yours
it would be hard indeed if i stopped you doing as you liked at florence when i am only here through your kindness
if you wish me to turn these gentlemen out of their rooms i will do it
would you then mr beebe kindly tell mr emerson that i accept his kind offer and then conduct him to me in order that i may thank him personally  she raised her voice as she spoke it was heard all over the drawingroom and silenced the guelfs and the ghibellines
the clergyman inwardly cursing the female sex bowed and departed with her message
remember lucy i alone am implicated in this
i do not wish the acceptance to come from you
grant me that at all events  mr beebe was back saying rather nervously  mr
emerson is engaged but here is his son instead  the young man gazed down on the three ladies who felt seated on the floor so low were their chairs
my father he said is in his bath so you cannot thank him personally
but any message given by you to me will be given by me to him as soon as he comes out  miss bartlett was unequal to the bath
all her barbed civilities came forth wrong end first
young mr emerson scored a notable triumph to the delight of mr beebe and to the secret delight of lucy
poor young man said miss bartlett as soon as he had gone
how angry he is with his father about the rooms
it is all he can do to keep polite  in half an hour or so your rooms will be ready said mr beebe
then looking rather thoughtfully at the two cousins he retired to his own rooms to write up his philosophic diary
oh dear breathed the little old lady and shuddered as if all the winds of heaven had entered the apartment
gentlemen sometimes do not realize her voice faded away but miss bartlett seemed to understand and a conversation developed in which gentlemen who did not thoroughly realize played a principal part
lucy not realizing either was reduced to literature
taking up baedekers handbook to northern italy she committed to memory the most important dates of florentine history
for she was determined to enjoy herself on the morrow
thus the halfhour crept profitably away and at last miss bartlett rose with a sigh and said  i think one might venture now
no lucy do not stir
i will superintend the move  how you do do everything said lucy
naturally dear
it is my affair  but i would like to help you  no dear  charlottes energy
and her unselfishness
she had been thus all her life but really on this italian tour she was surpassing herself
so lucy felt or strove to feel
and yetthere was a rebellious spirit in her which wondered whether the acceptance might not have been less delicate and more beautiful
at all events she entered her own room without any feeling of joy
i want to explain said miss bartlett why it is that i have taken the largest room
naturally of course i should have given it to you but i happen to know that it belongs to the young man and i was sure your mother would not like it  lucy was bewildered
if you are to accept a favour it is more suitable you should be under an obligation to his father than to him
i am a woman of the world in my small way and i know where things lead to
however mr beebe is a guarantee of a sort that they will not presume on this  mother wouldnt mind im sure said lucy but again had the sense of larger and unsuspected issues
miss bartlett only sighed and enveloped her in a protecting embrace as she wished her goodnight
it gave lucy the sensation of a fog and when she reached her own room she opened the window and breathed the clean night air thinking of the kind old man who had enabled her to see the lights dancing in the arno and the cypresses of san miniato and the foothills of the apennines black against the rising moon
miss bartlett in her room fastened the windowshutters and locked the door and then made a tour of the apartment to see where the cupboards led and whether there were any oubliettes or secret entrances
it was then that she saw pinned up over the washstand a sheet of paper on which was scrawled an enormous note of interrogation
nothing more
what does it mean she thought and she examined it carefully by the light of a candle
meaningless at first it gradually became menacing obnoxious portentous with evil
she was seized with an impulse to destroy it but fortunately remembered that she had no right to do so since it must be the property of young mr emerson
so she unpinned it carefully and put it between two pieces of blottingpaper to keep it clean for him
then she completed her inspection of the room sighed heavily according to her habit and went to bed
chapter ii in santa croce with no baedeker  it was pleasant to wake up in florence to open the eyes upon a bright bare room with a floor of red tiles which look clean though they are not with a painted ceiling whereon pink griffins and blue amorini sport in a forest of yellow violins and bassoons
it was pleasant too to fling wide the windows pinching the fingers in unfamiliar fastenings to lean out into sunshine with beautiful hills and trees and marble churches opposite and close below the arno gurgling against the embankment of the road
over the river men were at work with spades and sieves on the sandy foreshore and on the river was a boat also diligently employed for some mysterious end
an electric tram came rushing underneath the window
no one was inside it except one tourist but its platforms were overflowing with italians who preferred to stand
children tried to hang on behind and the conductor with no malice spat in their faces to make them let go
then soldiers appearedgoodlooking undersized menwearing each a knapsack covered with mangy fur and a greatcoat which had been cut for some larger soldier
beside them walked officers looking foolish and fierce and before them went little boys turning somersaults in time with the band
the tramcar became entangled in their ranks and moved on painfully like a caterpillar in a swarm of ants
one of the little boys fell down and some white bullocks came out of an archway
indeed if it had not been for the good advice of an old man who was selling buttonhooks the road might never have got clear
over such trivialities as these many a valuable hour may slip away and the traveller who has gone to italy to study the tactile values of giotto or the corruption of the papacy may return remembering nothing but the blue sky and the men and women who live under it
so it was as well that miss bartlett should tap and come in and having commented on lucys leaving the door unlocked and on her leaning out of the window before she was fully dressed should urge her to hasten herself or the best of the day would be gone
by the time lucy was ready her cousin had done her breakfast and was listening to the clever lady among the crumbs
a conversation then ensued on not unfamiliar lines
miss bartlett was after all a wee bit tired and thought they had better spend the morning settling in unless lucy would at all like to go out
lucy would rather like to go out as it was her first day in florence but of course she could go alone
miss bartlett could not allow this
of course she would accompany lucy everywhere
oh certainly not lucy would stop with her cousin
oh no
that would never do
oh yes
at this point the clever lady broke in
if it is mrs grundy who is troubling you i do assure you that you can neglect the good person
being english miss honeychurch will be perfectly safe
italians understand
a dear friend of mine contessa baroncelli has two daughters and when she cannot send a maid to school with them she lets them go in sailorhats instead
every one takes them for english you see especially if their hair is strained tightly behind  miss bartlett was unconvinced by the safety of contessa baroncellis daughters
she was determined to take lucy herself her head not being so very bad
the clever lady then said that she was going to spend a long morning in santa croce and if lucy would come too she would be delighted
i will take you by a dear dirty back way miss honeychurch and if you bring me luck we shall have an adventure  lucy said that this was most kind and at once opened the baedeker to see where santa croce was
tut tut
miss lucy
i hope we shall soon emancipate you from baedeker
he does but touch the surface of things
as to the true italyhe does not even dream of it
the true italy is only to be found by patient observation  this sounded very interesting and lucy hurried over her breakfast and started with her new friend in high spirits
italy was coming at last
the cockney signora and her works had vanished like a bad dream
miss lavishfor that was the clever ladys nameturned to the right along the sunny lung arno
how delightfully warm
but a wind down the side streets cut like a knife didnt it
ponte alle grazieparticularly interesting mentioned by dante
san miniatobeautiful as well as interesting the crucifix that kissed a murderermiss honeychurch would remember the story
the men on the river were fishing
untrue but then so is most information
then miss lavish darted under the archway of the white bullocks and she stopped and she cried  a smell
a true florentine smell
every city let me teach you has its own smell  is it a very nice smell said lucy who had inherited from her mother a distaste to dirt
one doesnt come to italy for niceness was the retort one comes for life
buon giorno
buon giorno bowing right and left
look at that adorable winecart
how the driver stares at us dear simple soul  so miss lavish proceeded through the streets of the city of florence short fidgety and playful as a kitten though without a kittens grace
it was a treat for the girl to be with any one so clever and so cheerful and a blue military cloak such as an italian officer wears only increased the sense of festivity
buon giorno
take the word of an old woman miss lucy you will never repent of a little civility to your inferiors
that is the true democracy
though i am a real radical as well
there now youre shocked  indeed im not exclaimed lucy
we are radicals too out and out
my father always voted for mr gladstone until he was so dreadful about ireland  i see i see
and now you have gone over to the enemy  oh please
if my father was alive i am sure he would vote radical again now that ireland is all right
and as it is the glass over our front door was broken last election and freddy is sure it was the tories but mother says nonsense a tramp  shameful
a manufacturing district i suppose  noin the surrey hills
about five miles from dorking looking over the weald  miss lavish seemed interested and slackened her trot
what a delightful part i know it so well
it is full of the very nicest people
do you know sir harry otwaya radical if ever there was  very well indeed  and old mrs butterworth the philanthropist  why she rents a field of us
how funny  miss lavish looked at the narrow ribbon of sky and murmured oh you have property in surrey  hardly any said lucy fearful of being thought a snob
only thirty acresjust the garden all downhill and some fields  miss lavish was not disgusted and said it was just the size of her aunts suffolk estate
italy receded
they tried to remember the last name of lady louisa someone who had taken a house near summer street the other year but she had not liked it which was odd of her
and just as miss lavish had got the name she broke off and exclaimed  bless us
bless us and save us
weve lost the way  certainly they had seemed a long time in reaching santa croce the tower of which had been plainly visible from the landing window
but miss lavish had said so much about knowing her florence by heart that lucy had followed her with no misgivings
lost
lost
my dear miss lucy during our political diatribes we have taken a wrong turning
how those horrid conservatives would jeer at us
what are we to do
two lone females in an unknown town
now this is what i call an adventure  lucy who wanted to see santa croce suggested as a possible solution that they should ask the way there
oh but that is the word of a craven
and no you are not not not to look at your baedeker
give it to me i shant let you carry it
we will simply drift  accordingly they drifted through a series of those greybrown streets neither commodious nor picturesque in which the eastern quarter of the city abounds
lucy soon lost interest in the discontent of lady louisa and became discontented herself
for one ravishing moment italy appeared
she stood in the square of the annunziata and saw in the living terracotta those divine babies whom no cheap reproduction can ever stale
there they stood with their shining limbs bursting from the garments of charity and their strong white arms extended against circlets of heaven
lucy thought she had never seen anything more beautiful but miss lavish with a shriek of dismay dragged her forward declaring that they were out of their path now by at least a mile
the hour was approaching at which the continental breakfast begins or rather ceases to tell and the ladies bought some hot chestnut paste out of a little shop because it looked so typical
it tasted partly of the paper in which it was wrapped partly of hair oil partly of the great unknown
but it gave them strength to drift into another piazza large and dusty on the farther side of which rose a blackandwhite facade of surpassing ugliness
miss lavish spoke to it dramatically
it was santa croce
the adventure was over
stop a minute let those two people go on or i shall have to speak to them
i do detest conventional intercourse
nasty
they are going into the church too
oh the britisher abroad  we sat opposite them at dinner last night
they have given us their rooms
they were so very kind  look at their figures laughed miss lavish
they walk through my italy like a pair of cows
its very naughty of me but i would like to set an examination paper at dover and turn back every tourist who couldnt pass it  what would you ask us  miss lavish laid her hand pleasantly on lucys arm as if to suggest that she at all events would get full marks
in this exalted mood they reached the steps of the great church and were about to enter it when miss lavish stopped squeaked flung up her arms and cried  there goes my localcolour box
i must have a word with him  and in a moment she was away over the piazza her military cloak flapping in the wind nor did she slacken speed till she caught up an old man with white whiskers and nipped him playfully upon the arm
lucy waited for nearly ten minutes
then she began to get tired
the beggars worried her the dust blew in her eyes and she remembered that a young girl ought not to loiter in public places
she descended slowly into the piazza with the intention of rejoining miss lavish who was really almost too original
but at that moment miss lavish and her localcolour box moved also and disappeared down a side street both gesticulating largely
tears of indignation came to lucys eyes partly because miss lavish had jilted her partly because she had taken her baedeker
how could she find her way home
how could she find her way about in santa croce
her first morning was ruined and she might never be in florence again
a few minutes ago she had been all high spirits talking as a woman of culture and half persuading herself that she was full of originality
now she entered the church depressed and humiliated not even able to remember whether it was built by the franciscans or the dominicans
of course it must be a wonderful building
but how like a barn
and how very cold
of course it contained frescoes by giotto in the presence of whose tactile values she was capable of feeling what was proper
but who was to tell her which they were
she walked about disdainfully unwilling to be enthusiastic over monuments of uncertain authorship or date
there was no one even to tell her which of all the sepulchral slabs that paved the nave and transepts was the one that was really beautiful the one that had been most praised by mr ruskin
then the pernicious charm of italy worked on her and instead of acquiring information she began to be happy
she puzzled out the italian noticesthe notices that forbade people to introduce dogs into the churchthe notice that prayed people in the interest of health and out of respect to the sacred edifice in which they found themselves not to spit
she watched the tourists their noses were as red as their baedekers so cold was santa croce
she beheld the horrible fate that overtook three papiststwo hebabies and a shebabywho began their career by sousing each other with the holy water and then proceeded to the machiavelli memorial dripping but hallowed
advancing towards it very slowly and from immense distances they touched the stone with their fingers with their handkerchiefs with their heads and then retreated
what could this mean
they did it again and again
then lucy realized that they had mistaken machiavelli for some saint hoping to acquire virtue
punishment followed quickly
the smallest hebaby stumbled over one of the sepulchral slabs so much admired by mr ruskin and entangled his feet in the features of a recumbent bishop
protestant as she was lucy darted forward
she was too late
he fell heavily upon the prelates upturned toes
hateful bishop exclaimed the voice of old mr emerson who had darted forward also
hard in life hard in death
go out into the sunshine little boy and kiss your hand to the sun for that is where you ought to be
intolerable bishop  the child screamed frantically at these words and at these dreadful people who picked him up dusted him rubbed his bruises and told him not to be superstitious
look at him said mr emerson to lucy
heres a mess a baby hurt cold and frightened
but what else can you expect from a church  the childs legs had become as melting wax
each time that old mr emerson and lucy set it erect it collapsed with a roar
fortunately an italian lady who ought to have been saying her prayers came to the rescue
by some mysterious virtue which mothers alone possess she stiffened the little boys backbone and imparted strength to his knees
he stood
still gibbering with agitation he walked away
you are a clever woman said mr emerson
you have done more than all the relics in the world
i am not of your creed but i do believe in those who make their fellowcreatures happy
there is no scheme of the universe  he paused for a phrase
niente said the italian lady and returned to her prayers
im not sure she understands english suggested lucy
in her chastened mood she no longer despised the emersons
she was determined to be gracious to them beautiful rather than delicate and if possible to erase miss bartletts civility by some gracious reference to the pleasant rooms
that woman understands everything was mr emersons reply
but what are you doing here
are you doing the church
are you through with the church  no cried lucy remembering her grievance
i came here with miss lavish who was to explain everything and just by the doorit is too badshe simply ran away and after waiting quite a time i had to come in by myself  why shouldnt you said mr emerson
yes why shouldnt you come by yourself said the son addressing the young lady for the first time
but miss lavish has even taken away baedeker  baedeker said mr emerson
im glad its that you minded
its worth minding the loss of a baedeker
thats worth minding  lucy was puzzled
she was again conscious of some new idea and was not sure whither it would lead her
if youve no baedeker said the son youd better join us was this where the idea would lead
she took refuge in her dignity
thank you very much but i could not think of that
i hope you do not suppose that i came to join on to you
i really came to help with the child and to thank you for so kindly giving us your rooms last night
i hope that you have not been put to any great inconvenience  my dear said the old man gently i think that you are repeating what you have heard older people say
you are pretending to be touchy but you are not really
stop being so tiresome and tell me instead what part of the church you want to see
to take you to it will be a real pleasure  now this was abominably impertinent and she ought to have been furious
but it is sometimes as difficult to lose ones temper as it is difficult at other times to keep it
lucy could not get cross
mr emerson was an old man and surely a girl might humour him
on the other hand his son was a young man and she felt that a girl ought to be offended with him or at all events be offended before him
it was at him that she gazed before replying
i am not touchy i hope
it is the giottos that i want to see if you will kindly tell me which they are  the son nodded
with a look of sombre satisfaction he led the way to the peruzzi chapel
there was a hint of the teacher about him
she felt like a child in school who had answered a question rightly
the chapel was already filled with an earnest congregation and out of them rose the voice of a lecturer directing them how to worship giotto not by tactful valuations but by the standards of the spirit
remember he was saying the facts about this church of santa croce how it was built by faith in the full fervour of medievalism before any taint of the renaissance had appeared
observe how giotto in these frescoesnow unhappily ruined by restorationis untroubled by the snares of anatomy and perspective
could anything be more majestic more pathetic beautiful true
how little we feel avails knowledge and technical cleverness against a man who truly feels  no exclaimed mr emerson in much too loud a voice for church
remember nothing of the sort
built by faith indeed
that simply means the workmen werent paid properly
and as for the frescoes i see no truth in them
look at that fat man in blue
he must weigh as much as i do and he is shooting into the sky like an air balloon  he was referring to the fresco of the ascension of st john inside the lecturers voice faltered as well it might
the audience shifted uneasily and so did lucy
she was sure that she ought not to be with these men but they had cast a spell over her
they were so serious and so strange that she could not remember how to behave
now did this happen or didnt it
yes or no  george replied  it happened like this if it happened at all
i would rather go up to heaven by myself than be pushed by cherubs and if i got there i should like my friends to lean out of it just as they do here  you will never go up said his father
you and i dear boy will lie at peace in the earth that bore us and our names will disappear as surely as our work survives  some of the people can only see the empty grave not the saint whoever he is going up
it did happen like that if it happened at all  pardon me said a frigid voice
the chapel is somewhat small for two parties
we will incommode you no longer  the lecturer was a clergyman and his audience must be also his flock for they held prayerbooks as well as guidebooks in their hands
they filed out of the chapel in silence
amongst them were the two little old ladies of the pension bertolinimiss teresa and miss catherine alan
stop cried mr emerson
theres plenty of room for us all
stop  the procession disappeared without a word
soon the lecturer could be heard in the next chapel describing the life of st francis
george i do believe that clergyman is the brixton curate  george went into the next chapel and returned saying perhaps he is
i dont remember  then i had better speak to him and remind him who i am
its that mr
eager
why did he go
did we talk too loud
how vexatious
i shall go and say we are sorry
hadnt i better
then perhaps he will come back  he will not come back said george
but mr emerson contrite and unhappy hurried away to apologize to the rev
cuthbert eager
lucy apparently absorbed in a lunette could hear the lecture again interrupted the anxious aggressive voice of the old man the curt injured replies of his opponent
the son who took every little contretemps as if it were a tragedy was listening also
my father has that effect on nearly everyone he informed her
he will try to be kind  i hope we all try said she smiling nervously
because we think it improves our characters
but he is kind to people because he loves them and they find him out and are offended or frightened  how silly of them said lucy though in her heart she sympathized i think that a kind action done tactfully  tact  he threw up his head in disdain
apparently she had given the wrong answer
she watched the singular creature pace up and down the chapel
for a young man his face was rugged anduntil the shadows fell upon ithard
enshadowed it sprang into tenderness
she saw him once again at rome on the ceiling of the sistine chapel carrying a burden of acorns
healthy and muscular he yet gave her the feeling of greyness of tragedy that might only find solution in the night
the feeling soon passed it was unlike her to have entertained anything so subtle
born of silence and of unknown emotion it passed when mr emerson returned and she could reenter the world of rapid talk which was alone familiar to her
were you snubbed asked his son tranquilly
but we have spoilt the pleasure of i dont know how many people
they wont come back  full of innate sympathyquickness to perceive good in othersvision of the brotherhood of man scraps of the lecture on st francis came floating round the partition wall
dont let us spoil yours he continued to lucy
have you looked at those saints  yes said lucy
they are lovely
do you know which is the tombstone that is praised in ruskin  he did not know and suggested that they should try to guess it
george rather to her relief refused to move and she and the old man wandered not unpleasantly about santa croce which though it is like a barn has harvested many beautiful things inside its walls
there were also beggars to avoid and guides to dodge round the pillars and an old lady with her dog and here and there a priest modestly edging to his mass through the groups of tourists
but mr emerson was only half interested
he watched the lecturer whose success he believed he had impaired and then he anxiously watched his son
why will he look at that fresco he said uneasily
i saw nothing in it  i like giotto she replied
it is so wonderful what they say about his tactile values
though i like things like the della robbia babies better  so you ought
a baby is worth a dozen saints
and my babys worth the whole of paradise and as far as i can see he lives in hell  lucy again felt that this did not do
in hell he repeated
hes unhappy  oh dear said lucy
how can he be unhappy when he is strong and alive
what more is one to give him
and think how he has been brought upfree from all the superstition and ignorance that lead men to hate one another in the name of god
with such an education as that i thought he was bound to grow up happy  she was no theologian but she felt that here was a very foolish old man as well as a very irreligious one
she also felt that her mother might not like her talking to that kind of person and that charlotte would object most strongly
what are we to do with him he asked
he comes out for his holiday to italy and behaveslike that like the little child who ought to have been playing and who hurt himself upon the tombstone
eh
what did you say  lucy had made no suggestion
suddenly he said  now dont be stupid over this
i dont require you to fall in love with my boy but i do think you might try and understand him
you are nearer his age and if you let yourself go i am sure you are sensible
you might help me
he has known so few women and you have the time
you stop here several weeks i suppose
but let yourself go
you are inclined to get muddled if i may judge from last night
let yourself go
pull out from the depths those thoughts that you do not understand and spread them out in the sunlight and know the meaning of them
by understanding george you may learn to understand yourself
it will be good for both of you  to this extraordinary speech lucy found no answer
i only know what it is thats wrong with him not why it is  and what is it asked lucy fearfully expecting some harrowing tale
the old trouble things wont fit  what things  the things of the universe
it is quite true
they dont  oh mr emerson whatever do you mean  in his ordinary voice so that she scarcely realized he was quoting poetry he said    from far from eve and morning    and yon twelvewinded sky    the stuff of life to knit me    blew hither here am i  george and i both know this but why does it distress him
we know that we come from the winds and that we shall return to them that all life is perhaps a knot a tangle a blemish in the eternal smoothness
but why should this make us unhappy
let us rather love one another and work and rejoice
i dont believe in this world sorrow  miss honeychurch assented
then make my boy think like us
make him realize that by the side of the everlasting why there is a yesa transitory yes if you like but a yes  suddenly she laughed surely one ought to laugh
a young man melancholy because the universe wouldnt fit because life was a tangle or a wind or a yes or something
im very sorry she cried
youll think me unfeeling butbut  then she became matronly
oh but your son wants employment
has he no particular hobby
why i myself have worries but i can generally forget them at the piano and collecting stamps did no end of good for my brother
perhaps italy bores him you ought to try the alps or the lakes  the old mans face saddened and he touched her gently with his hand
this did not alarm her she thought that her advice had impressed him and that he was thanking her for it
indeed he no longer alarmed her at all she regarded him as a kind thing but quite silly
her feelings were as inflated spiritually as they had been an hour ago esthetically before she lost baedeker
the dear george now striding towards them over the tombstones seemed both pitiable and absurd
he approached his face in the shadow
he said  miss bartlett  oh good gracious me said lucy suddenly collapsing and again seeing the whole of life in a new perspective
where
where  in the nave  i see
those gossiping little miss alans must have she checked herself
poor girl exploded mr emerson
poor girl  she could not let this pass for it was just what she was feeling herself
poor girl
i fail to understand the point of that remark
i think myself a very fortunate girl i assure you
im thoroughly happy and having a splendid time
pray dont waste time mourning over me
theres enough sorrow in the world isnt there without trying to invent it
goodbye
thank you both so much for all your kindness
ah yes
there does come my cousin
a delightful morning
santa croce is a wonderful church  she joined her cousin
chapter iii music violets and the letter s  it so happened that lucy who found daily life rather chaotic entered a more solid world when she opened the piano
she was then no longer either deferential or patronizing no longer either a rebel or a slave
the kingdom of music is not the kingdom of this world it will accept those whom breeding and intellect and culture have alike rejected
the commonplace person begins to play and shoots into the empyrean without effort whilst we look up marvelling how he has escaped us and thinking how we could worship him and love him would he but translate his visions into human words and his experiences into human actions
perhaps he cannot certainly he does not or does so very seldom
lucy had done so never
she was no dazzling executante her runs were not at all like strings of pearls and she struck no more right notes than was suitable for one of her age and situation
nor was she the passionate young lady who performs so tragically on a summers evening with the window open
passion was there but it could not be easily labelled it slipped between love and hatred and jealousy and all the furniture of the pictorial style
and she was tragical only in the sense that she was great for she loved to play on the side of victory
victory of what and over whatthat is more than the words of daily life can tell us
but that some sonatas of beethoven are written tragic no one can gainsay yet they can triumph or despair as the player decides and lucy had decided that they should triumph
a very wet afternoon at the bertolini permitted her to do the thing she really liked and after lunch she opened the little draped piano
a few people lingered round and praised her playing but finding that she made no reply dispersed to their rooms to write up their diaries or to sleep
she took no notice of mr emerson looking for his son nor of miss bartlett looking for miss lavish nor of miss lavish looking for her cigarettecase
like every true performer she was intoxicated by the mere feel of the notes they were fingers caressing her own and by touch not by sound alone did she come to her desire
mr beebe sitting unnoticed in the window pondered this illogical element in miss honeychurch and recalled the occasion at tunbridge wells when he had discovered it
it was at one of those entertainments where the upper classes entertain the lower
the seats were filled with a respectful audience and the ladies and gentlemen of the parish under the auspices of their vicar sang or recited or imitated the drawing of a champagne cork
among the promised items was miss honeychurch
piano
beethoven and mr beebe was wondering whether it would be adelaida or the march of the ruins of athens when his composure was disturbed by the opening bars of opus iii
he was in suspense all through the introduction for not until the pace quickens does one know what the performer intends
with the roar of the opening theme he knew that things were going extraordinarily in the chords that herald the conclusion he heard the hammer strokes of victory
he was glad that she only played the first movement for he could have paid no attention to the winding intricacies of the measures of ninesixteen
the audience clapped no less respectful
it was mr beebe who started the stamping it was all that one could do
who is she he asked the vicar afterwards
cousin of one of my parishioners
i do not consider her choice of a piece happy
beethoven is so usually simple and direct in his appeal that it is sheer perversity to choose a thing like that which if anything disturbs  introduce me  she will be delighted
she and miss bartlett are full of the praises of your sermon  my sermon cried mr beebe
why ever did she listen to it  when he was introduced he understood why for miss honeychurch disjoined from her music stool was only a young lady with a quantity of dark hair and a very pretty pale undeveloped face
she loved going to concerts she loved stopping with her cousin she loved iced coffee and meringues
he did not doubt that she loved his sermon also
but before he left tunbridge wells he made a remark to the vicar which he now made to lucy herself when she closed the little piano and moved dreamily towards him  if miss honeychurch ever takes to live as she plays it will be very exciting both for us and for her  lucy at once reentered daily life
oh what a funny thing
some one said just the same to mother and she said she trusted i should never live a duet  doesnt mrs honeychurch like music  she doesnt mind it
but she doesnt like one to get excited over anything she thinks i am silly about it
she thinksi cant make out
once you know i said that i liked my own playing better than any ones
she has never got over it
of course i didnt mean that i played well i only meant  of course said he wondering why she bothered to explain
music said lucy as if attempting some generality
she could not complete it and looked out absently upon italy in the wet
the whole life of the south was disorganized and the most graceful nation in europe had turned into formless lumps of clothes
the street and the river were dirty yellow the bridge was dirty grey and the hills were dirty purple
somewhere in their folds were concealed miss lavish and miss bartlett who had chosen this afternoon to visit the torre del gallo
what about music said mr beebe
poor charlotte will be sopped was lucys reply
the expedition was typical of miss bartlett who would return cold tired hungry and angelic with a ruined skirt a pulpy baedeker and a tickling cough in her throat
on another day when the whole world was singing and the air ran into the mouth like wine she would refuse to stir from the drawingroom saying that she was an old thing and no fit companion for a hearty girl
miss lavish has led your cousin astray
she hopes to find the true italy in the wet i believe  miss lavish is so original murmured lucy
this was a stock remark the supreme achievement of the pension bertolini in the way of definition
miss lavish was so original
mr beebe had his doubts but they would have been put down to clerical narrowness
for that and for other reasons he held his peace
is it true continued lucy in awestruck tone that miss lavish is writing a book  they do say so  what is it about  it will be a novel replied mr beebe dealing with modern italy
let me refer you for an account to miss catharine alan who uses words herself more admirably than any one i know  i wish miss lavish would tell me herself
we started such friends
but i dont think she ought to have run away with baedeker that morning in santa croce
charlotte was most annoyed at finding me practically alone and so i couldnt help being a little annoyed with miss lavish  the two ladies at all events have made it up  he was interested in the sudden friendship between women so apparently dissimilar as miss bartlett and miss lavish
they were always in each others company with lucy a slighted third
miss lavish he believed he understood but miss bartlett might reveal unknown depths of strangeness though not perhaps of meaning
was italy deflecting her from the path of prim chaperon which he had assigned to her at tunbridge wells
all his life he had loved to study maiden ladies they were his specialty and his profession had provided him with ample opportunities for the work
girls like lucy were charming to look at but mr beebe was from rather profound reasons somewhat chilly in his attitude towards the other sex and preferred to be interested rather than enthralled
lucy for the third time said that poor charlotte would be sopped
the arno was rising in flood washing away the traces of the little carts upon the foreshore
but in the southwest there had appeared a dull haze of yellow which might mean better weather if it did not mean worse
she opened the window to inspect and a cold blast entered the room drawing a plaintive cry from miss catharine alan who entered at the same moment by the door
oh dear miss honeychurch you will catch a chill
and mr beebe here besides
who would suppose this is italy
there is my sister actually nursing the hotwater can no comforts or proper provisions  she sidled towards them and sat down selfconscious as she always was on entering a room which contained one man or a man and one woman
i could hear your beautiful playing miss honeychurch though i was in my room with the door shut
doors shut indeed most necessary
no one has the least idea of privacy in this country
and one person catches it from another  lucy answered suitably
mr beebe was not able to tell the ladies of his adventure at modena where the chambermaid burst in upon him in his bath exclaiming cheerfully fa niente sono vecchia he contented himself with saying i quite agree with you miss alan
the italians are a most unpleasant people
they pry everywhere they see everything and they know what we want before we know it ourselves
we are at their mercy
they read our thoughts they foretell our desires
from the cabdriver down toto giotto they turn us inside out and i resent it
yet in their heart of hearts they arehow superficial
they have no conception of the intellectual life
how right is signora bertolini who exclaimed to me the other day ho mr beebe if you knew what i suffer over the childrens edjucaishion
hi wont ave my little victorier taught by a hignorant italian what cant explain nothink  miss alan did not follow but gathered that she was being mocked in an agreeable way
her sister was a little disappointed in mr beebe having expected better things from a clergyman whose head was bald and who wore a pair of russet whiskers
indeed who would have supposed that tolerance sympathy and a sense of humour would inhabit that militant form
in the midst of her satisfaction she continued to sidle and at last the cause was disclosed
from the chair beneath her she extracted a gunmetal cigarettecase on which were powdered in turquoise the initials e
l  that belongs to lavish said the clergyman
a good fellow lavish but i wish shed start a pipe  oh mr beebe said miss alan divided between awe and mirth
indeed though it is dreadful for her to smoke it is not quite as dreadful as you suppose
she took to it practically in despair after her lifes work was carried away in a landslip
surely that makes it more excusable  what was that asked lucy
mr beebe sat back complacently and miss alan began as follows it was a noveland i am afraid from what i can gather not a very nice novel
it is so sad when people who have abilities misuse them and i must say they nearly always do
anyhow she left it almost finished in the grotto of the calvary at the capuccini hotel at amalfi while she went for a little ink
she said can i have a little ink please but you know what italians are and meanwhile the grotto fell roaring on to the beach and the saddest thing of all is that she cannot remember what she has written
the poor thing was very ill after it and so got tempted into cigarettes
it is a great secret but i am glad to say that she is writing another novel
she told teresa and miss pole the other day that she had got up all the local colourthis novel is to be about modern italy the other was historicalbut that she could not start till she had an idea
first she tried perugia for an inspiration then she came herethis must on no account get round
and so cheerful through it all
i cannot help thinking that there is something to admire in everyone even if you do not approve of them  miss alan was always thus being charitable against her better judgement
a delicate pathos perfumed her disconnected remarks giving them unexpected beauty just as in the decaying autumn woods there sometimes rise odours reminiscent of spring
she felt she had made almost too many allowances and apologized hurriedly for her toleration
all the same she is a little tooi hardly like to say unwomanly but she behaved most strangely when the emersons arrived  mr beebe smiled as miss alan plunged into an anecdote which he knew she would be unable to finish in the presence of a gentleman
i dont know miss honeychurch if you have noticed that miss pole the lady who has so much yellow hair takes lemonade
that old mr emerson who puts things very strangely  her jaw dropped
she was silent
mr beebe whose social resources were endless went out to order some tea and she continued to lucy in a hasty whisper  stomach
he warned miss pole of her stomachacidity he called itand he may have meant to be kind
i must say i forgot myself and laughed it was so sudden
as teresa truly said it was no laughing matter
but the point is that miss lavish was positively attracted by his mentioning s and said she liked plain speaking and meeting different grades of thought
she thought they were commercial travellersdrummers was the word she usedand all through dinner she tried to prove that england our great and beloved country rests on nothing but commerce
teresa was very much annoyed and left the table before the cheese saying as she did so there miss lavish is one who can confute you better than i and pointed to that beautiful picture of lord tennyson
then miss lavish said tut
the early victorians just imagine
tut
the early victorians my sister had gone and i felt bound to speak
i said miss lavish i am an early victorian at least that is to say i will hear no breath of censure against our dear queen it was horrible speaking
i reminded her how the queen had been to ireland when she did not want to go and i must say she was dumbfounded and made no reply
but unluckily mr emerson overheard this part and called in his deep voice quite so quite so
i honour the woman for her irish visit the woman
i tell things so badly but you see what a tangle we were in by this time all on account of s having been mentioned in the first place
but that was not all
after dinner miss lavish actually came up and said miss alan i am going into the smokingroom to talk to those two nice men
come too needless to say i refused such an unsuitable invitation and she had the impertinence to tell me that it would broaden my ideas and said that she had four brothers all university men except one who was in the army who always made a point of talking to commercial travellers  let me finish the story said mr beebe who had returned
miss lavish tried miss pole myself everyone and finally said i shall go alone she went
at the end of five minutes she returned unobtrusively with a green baize board and began playing patience  whatever happened cried lucy
no one knows
no one will ever know
miss lavish will never dare to tell and mr emerson does not think it worth telling  mr
beebeold mr emerson is he nice or not nice
i do so want to know  mr beebe laughed and suggested that she should settle the question for herself
no but it is so difficult
sometimes he is so silly and then i do not mind him
miss alan what do you think
is he nice  the little old lady shook her head and sighed disapprovingly
mr beebe whom the conversation amused stirred her up by saying  i consider that you are bound to class him as nice miss alan after that business of the violets  violets
oh dear
who told you about the violets
how do things get round
a pension is a bad place for gossips
no i cannot forget how they behaved at mr eagers lecture at santa croce
oh poor miss honeychurch
it really was too bad
no i have quite changed
i do not like the emersons
they are not nice  mr beebe smiled nonchalantly
he had made a gentle effort to introduce the emersons into bertolini society and the effort had failed
he was almost the only person who remained friendly to them
miss lavish who represented intellect was avowedly hostile and now the miss alans who stood for good breeding were following her
miss bartlett smarting under an obligation would scarcely be civil
the case of lucy was different
she had given him a hazy account of her adventures in santa croce and he gathered that the two men had made a curious and possibly concerted attempt to annex her to show her the world from their own strange standpoint to interest her in their private sorrows and joys
this was impertinent he did not wish their cause to be championed by a young girl he would rather it should fail
after all he knew nothing about them and pension joys pension sorrows are flimsy things whereas lucy would be his parishioner
lucy with one eye upon the weather finally said that she thought the emersons were nice not that she saw anything of them now
even their seats at dinner had been moved
but arent they always waylaying you to go out with them dear said the little lady inquisitively
only once
charlotte didnt like it and said somethingquite politely of course  most right of her
they dont understand our ways
they must find their level  mr beebe rather felt that they had gone under
they had given up their attemptif it was oneto conquer society and now the father was almost as silent as the son
he wondered whether he would not plan a pleasant day for these folk before they leftsome expedition perhaps with lucy well chaperoned to be nice to them
it was one of mr beebes chief pleasures to provide people with happy memories
evening approached while they chatted the air became brighter the colours on the trees and hills were purified and the arno lost its muddy solidity and began to twinkle
there were a few streaks of bluishgreen among the clouds a few patches of watery light upon the earth and then the dripping facade of san miniato shone brilliantly in the declining sun
too late to go out said miss alan in a voice of relief
all the galleries are shut  i think i shall go out said lucy
i want to go round the town in the circular tramon the platform by the driver  her two companions looked grave
mr beebe who felt responsible for her in the absence of miss bartlett ventured to say  i wish we could
unluckily i have letters
if you do want to go out alone wont you be better on your feet  italians dear you know said miss alan
perhaps i shall meet someone who reads me through and through  but they still looked disapproval and she so far conceded to mr beebe as to say that she would only go for a little walk and keep to the street frequented by tourists
she oughtnt really to go at all said mr beebe as they watched her from the window and she knows it
i put it down to too much beethoven    chapter iv fourth chapter  mr beebe was right
lucy never knew her desires so clearly as after music
she had not really appreciated the clergymans wit nor the suggestive twitterings of miss alan
conversation was tedious she wanted something big and she believed that it would have come to her on the windswept platform of an electric tram
this she might not attempt
it was unladylike
why
why were most big things unladylike
charlotte had once explained to her why
it was not that ladies were inferior to men it was that they were different
their mission was to inspire others to achievement rather than to achieve themselves
indirectly by means of tact and a spotless name a lady could accomplish much
but if she rushed into the fray herself she would be first censured then despised and finally ignored
poems had been written to illustrate this point
there is much that is immortal in this medieval lady
the dragons have gone and so have the knights but still she lingers in our midst
she reigned in many an early victorian castle and was queen of much early victorian song
it is sweet to protect her in the intervals of business sweet to pay her honour when she has cooked our dinner well
but alas
the creature grows degenerate
in her heart also there are springing up strange desires
she too is enamoured of heavy winds and vast panoramas and green expanses of the sea
she has marked the kingdom of this world how full it is of wealth and beauty and wara radiant crust built around the central fires spinning towards the receding heavens
men declaring that she inspires them to it move joyfully over the surface having the most delightful meetings with other men happy not because they are masculine but because they are alive
before the show breaks up she would like to drop the august title of the eternal woman and go there as her transitory self
lucy does not stand for the medieval lady who was rather an ideal to which she was bidden to lift her eyes when feeling serious
nor has she any system of revolt
here and there a restriction annoyed her particularly and she would transgress it and perhaps be sorry that she had done so
this afternoon she was peculiarly restive
she would really like to do something of which her wellwishers disapproved
as she might not go on the electric tram she went to alinaris shop
there she bought a photograph of botticellis birth of venus venus being a pity spoilt the picture otherwise so charming and miss bartlett had persuaded her to do without it
a pity in art of course signified the nude
giorgiones tempesta the idolino some of the sistine frescoes and the apoxyomenos were added to it
she felt a little calmer then and bought fra angelicos coronation giottos ascension of st john some della robbia babies and some guido reni madonnas
for her taste was catholic and she extended uncritical approval to every wellknown name
but though she spent nearly seven lire the gates of liberty seemed still unopened
she was conscious of her discontent it was new to her to be conscious of it
the world she thought is certainly full of beautiful things if only i could come across them it was not surprising that mrs honeychurch disapproved of music declaring that it always left her daughter peevish unpractical and touchy
nothing ever happens to me she reflected as she entered the piazza signoria and looked nonchalantly at its marvels now fairly familiar to her
the great square was in shadow the sunshine had come too late to strike it
neptune was already unsubstantial in the twilight half god half ghost and his fountain plashed dreamily to the men and satyrs who idled together on its marge
the loggia showed as the triple entrance of a cave wherein many a deity shadowy but immortal looking forth upon the arrivals and departures of mankind
it was the hour of unrealitythe hour that is when unfamiliar things are real
an older person at such an hour and in such a place might think that sufficient was happening to him and rest content
lucy desired more
she fixed her eyes wistfully on the tower of the palace which rose out of the lower darkness like a pillar of roughened gold
it seemed no longer a tower no longer supported by earth but some unattainable treasure throbbing in the tranquil sky
its brightness mesmerized her still dancing before her eyes when she bent them to the ground and started towards home
then something did happen
two italians by the loggia had been bickering about a debt
cinque lire they had cried cinque lire they sparred at each other and one of them was hit lightly upon the chest
he frowned he bent towards lucy with a look of interest as if he had an important message for her
he opened his lips to deliver it and a stream of red came out between them and trickled down his unshaven chin
that was all
a crowd rose out of the dusk
it hid this extraordinary man from her and bore him away to the fountain
mr george emerson happened to be a few paces away looking at her across the spot where the man had been
how very odd
across something
even as she caught sight of him he grew dim the palace itself grew dim swayed above her fell on to her softly slowly noiselessly and the sky fell with it
she thought oh what have i done  oh what have i done she murmured and opened her eyes
george emerson still looked at her but not across anything
she had complained of dullness and lo
one man was stabbed and another held her in his arms
they were sitting on some steps in the uffizi arcade
he must have carried her
he rose when she spoke and began to dust his knees
she repeated  oh what have i done  you fainted  ii am very sorry  how are you now  perfectly wellabsolutely well and she began to nod and smile
then let us come home
theres no point in our stopping  he held out his hand to pull her up
she pretended not to see it
the cries from the fountainthey had never ceasedrang emptily
the whole world seemed pale and void of its original meaning
how very kind you have been
i might have hurt myself falling
but now i am well
i can go alone thank you  his hand was still extended
oh my photographs she exclaimed suddenly
what photographs  i bought some photographs at alinaris
i must have dropped them out there in the square she looked at him cautiously
would you add to your kindness by fetching them  he added to his kindness
as soon as he had turned his back lucy arose with the running of a maniac and stole down the arcade towards the arno
miss honeychurch  she stopped with her hand on her heart
you sit still you arent fit to go home alone  yes i am thank you so very much  no you arent
youd go openly if you were  but i had rather  then i dont fetch your photographs  i had rather be alone  he said imperiously the man is deadthe man is probably dead sit down till you are rested she was bewildered and obeyed him
and dont move till i come back  in the distance she saw creatures with black hoods such as appear in dreams
the palace tower had lost the reflection of the declining day and joined itself to earth
how should she talk to mr emerson when he returned from the shadowy square
again the thought occurred to her oh what have i donethe thought that she as well as the dying man had crossed some spiritual boundary
he returned and she talked of the murder
oddly enough it was an easy topic
she spoke of the italian character she became almost garrulous over the incident that had made her faint five minutes before
being strong physically she soon overcame the horror of blood
she rose without his assistance and though wings seemed to flutter inside her she walked firmly enough towards the arno
there a cabman signalled to them they refused him
and the murderer tried to kiss him you sayhow very odd italians areand gave himself up to the police
mr beebe was saying that italians know everything but i think they are rather childish
when my cousin and i were at the pitti yesterdaywhat was that  he had thrown something into the stream
what did you throw in  things i didnt want he said crossly
mr
emerson  well  where are the photographs  he was silent
i believe it was my photographs that you threw away  i didnt know what to do with them he cried and his voice was that of an anxious boy
her heart warmed towards him for the first time
they were covered with blood
there
im glad ive told you and all the time we were making conversation i was wondering what to do with them he pointed downstream
theyve gone the river swirled under the bridge i did mind them so and one is so foolish it seemed better that they should go out to the seai dont know i may just mean that they frightened me then the boy verged into a man
for something tremendous has happened i must face it without getting muddled
it isnt exactly that a man has died  something warned lucy that she must stop him
it has happened he repeated and i mean to find out what it is  mr
emerson  he turned towards her frowning as if she had disturbed him in some abstract quest
i want to ask you something before we go in  they were close to their pension
she stopped and leant her elbows against the parapet of the embankment
he did likewise
there is at times a magic in identity of position it is one of the things that have suggested to us eternal comradeship
she moved her elbows before saying  i have behaved ridiculously  he was following his own thoughts
i was never so much ashamed of myself in my life i cannot think what came over me  i nearly fainted myself he said but she felt that her attitude repelled him
well i owe you a thousand apologies  oh all right  andthis is the real pointyou know how silly people are gossipingladies especially i am afraidyou understand what i mean  im afraid i dont  i mean would you not mention it to any one my foolish behaviour  your behaviour
oh yes all rightall right  thank you so much
and would you  she could not carry her request any further
the river was rushing below them almost black in the advancing night
he had thrown her photographs into it and then he had told her the reason
it struck her that it was hopeless to look for chivalry in such a man
he would do her no harm by idle gossip he was trustworthy intelligent and even kind he might even have a high opinion of her
but he lacked chivalry his thoughts like his behaviour would not be modified by awe
it was useless to say to him and would you and hope that he would complete the sentence for himself averting his eyes from her nakedness like the knight in that beautiful picture
she had been in his arms and he remembered it just as he remembered the blood on the photographs that she had bought in alinaris shop
it was not exactly that a man had died something had happened to the living they had come to a situation where character tells and where childhood enters upon the branching paths of youth
well thank you so much she repeated how quickly these accidents do happen and then one returns to the old life  i dont  anxiety moved her to question him
his answer was puzzling i shall probably want to live  but why mr emerson
what do you mean  i shall want to live i say  leaning her elbows on the parapet she contemplated the river arno whose roar was suggesting some unexpected melody to her ears
chapter v possibilities of a pleasant outing  it was a family saying that you never knew which way charlotte bartlett would turn she was perfectly pleasant and sensible over lucys adventure found the abridged account of it quite adequate and paid suitable tribute to the courtesy of mr george emerson
she and miss lavish had had an adventure also
they had been stopped at the dazio coming back and the young officials there who seemed impudent and desoeuvre had tried to search their reticules for provisions
it might have been most unpleasant
fortunately miss lavish was a match for any one
for good or for evil lucy was left to face her problem alone
none of her friends had seen her either in the piazza or later on by the embankment
mr beebe indeed noticing her startled eyes at dinnertime had again passed to himself the remark of too much beethoven but he only supposed that she was ready for an adventure not that she had encountered it
this solitude oppressed her she was accustomed to have her thoughts confirmed by others or at all events contradicted it was too dreadful not to know whether she was thinking right or wrong
at breakfast next morning she took decisive action
there were two plans between which she had to choose
mr beebe was walking up to the torre del gallo with the emersons and some american ladies
would miss bartlett and miss honeychurch join the party
charlotte declined for herself she had been there in the rain the previous afternoon
but she thought it an admirable idea for lucy who hated shopping changing money fetching letters and other irksome dutiesall of which miss bartlett must accomplish this morning and could easily accomplish alone
no charlotte cried the girl with real warmth
its very kind of mr beebe but i am certainly coming with you
i had much rather  very well dear said miss bartlett with a faint flush of pleasure that called forth a deep flush of shame on the cheeks of lucy
how abominably she behaved to charlotte now as always
but now she should alter
all morning she would be really nice to her
she slipped her arm into her cousins and they started off along the lung arno
the river was a lion that morning in strength voice and colour
miss bartlett insisted on leaning over the parapet to look at it
she then made her usual remark which was how i do wish freddy and your mother could see this too  lucy fidgeted it was tiresome of charlotte to have stopped exactly where she did
look lucia
oh you are watching for the torre del gallo party
i feared you would repent you of your choice  serious as the choice had been lucy did not repent
yesterday had been a muddlequeer and odd the kind of thing one could not write down easily on paperbut she had a feeling that charlotte and her shopping were preferable to george emerson and the summit of the torre del gallo
since she could not unravel the tangle she must take care not to reenter it
she could protest sincerely against miss bartletts insinuations
but though she had avoided the chief actor the scenery unfortunately remained
charlotte with the complacency of fate led her from the river to the piazza signoria
she could not have believed that stones a loggia a fountain a palace tower would have such significance
for a moment she understood the nature of ghosts
the exact site of the murder was occupied not by a ghost but by miss lavish who had the morning newspaper in her hand
she hailed them briskly
the dreadful catastrophe of the previous day had given her an idea which she thought would work up into a book
oh let me congratulate you said miss bartlett
after your despair of yesterday
what a fortunate thing  aha
miss honeychurch come you here i am in luck
now you are to tell me absolutely everything that you saw from the beginning lucy poked at the ground with her parasol
but perhaps you would rather not  im sorryif you could manage without it i think i would rather not  the elder ladies exchanged glances not of disapproval it is suitable that a girl should feel deeply
it is i who am sorry said miss lavish literary hacks are shameless creatures
i believe theres no secret of the human heart into which we wouldnt pry  she marched cheerfully to the fountain and back and did a few calculations in realism
then she said that she had been in the piazza since eight oclock collecting material
a good deal of it was unsuitable but of course one always had to adapt
the two men had quarrelled over a fivefranc note
for the fivefranc note she should substitute a young lady which would raise the tone of the tragedy and at the same time furnish an excellent plot
what is the heroines name asked miss bartlett
leonora said miss lavish her own name was eleanor
i do hope shes nice  that desideratum would not be omitted
and what is the plot  love murder abduction revenge was the plot
but it all came while the fountain plashed to the satyrs in the morning sun
i hope you will excuse me for boring on like this miss lavish concluded
it is so tempting to talk to really sympathetic people
of course this is the barest outline
there will be a deal of local colouring descriptions of florence and the neighbourhood and i shall also introduce some humorous characters
and let me give you all fair warning i intend to be unmerciful to the british tourist  oh you wicked woman cried miss bartlett
i am sure you are thinking of the emersons  miss lavish gave a machiavellian smile
i confess that in italy my sympathies are not with my own countrymen
it is the neglected italians who attract me and whose lives i am going to paint so far as i can
for i repeat and i insist and i have always held most strongly that a tragedy such as yesterdays is not the less tragic because it happened in humble life  there was a fitting silence when miss lavish had concluded
then the cousins wished success to her labours and walked slowly away across the square
she is my idea of a really clever woman said miss bartlett
that last remark struck me as so particularly true
it should be a most pathetic novel  lucy assented
at present her great aim was not to get put into it
her perceptions this morning were curiously keen and she believed that miss lavish had her on trial for an ingenue
she is emancipated but only in the very best sense of the word  continued miss bartlett slowly
none but the superficial would be shocked at her
we had a long talk yesterday
she believes in justice and truth and human interest
she told me also that she has a high opinion of the destiny of womanmr
eager
why how nice
what a pleasant surprise  ah not for me said the chaplain blandly for i have been watching you and miss honeychurch for quite a little time  we were chatting to miss lavish  his brow contracted
so i saw
were you indeed
andate via
sono occupato the last remark was made to a vender of panoramic photographs who was approaching with a courteous smile
i am about to venture a suggestion
would you and miss honeychurch be disposed to join me in a drive some day this weeka drive in the hills
we might go up by fiesole and back by settignano
there is a point on that road where we could get down and have an hours ramble on the hillside
the view thence of florence is most beautifulfar better than the hackneyed view of fiesole
it is the view that alessio baldovinetti is fond of introducing into his pictures
that man had a decided feeling for landscape
decidedly
but who looks at it today
ah the world is too much for us  miss bartlett had not heard of alessio baldovinetti but she knew that mr
eager was no commonplace chaplain
he was a member of the residential colony who had made florence their home
he knew the people who never walked about with baedekers who had learnt to take a siesta after lunch who took drives the pension tourists had never heard of and saw by private influence galleries which were closed to them
living in delicate seclusion some in furnished flats others in renaissance villas on fiesoles slope they read wrote studied and exchanged ideas thus attaining to that intimate knowledge or rather perception of florence which is denied to all who carry in their pockets the coupons of cook
therefore an invitation from the chaplain was something to be proud of
between the two sections of his flock he was often the only link and it was his avowed custom to select those of his migratory sheep who seemed worthy and give them a few hours in the pastures of the permanent
tea at a renaissance villa
nothing had been said about it yet
but if it did come to thathow lucy would enjoy it
a few days ago and lucy would have felt the same
but the joys of life were grouping themselves anew
a drive in the hills with mr
eager and miss bartletteven if culminating in a residential teapartywas no longer the greatest of them
she echoed the raptures of charlotte somewhat faintly
only when she heard that mr beebe was also coming did her thanks become more sincere
so we shall be a partie carree said the chaplain
in these days of toil and tumult one has great needs of the country and its message of purity
andate via
andate presto presto
ah the town
beautiful as it is it is the town  they assented
this very squareso i am toldwitnessed yesterday the most sordid of tragedies
to one who loves the florence of dante and savonarola there is something portentous in such desecrationportentous and humiliating  humiliating indeed said miss bartlett
miss honeychurch happened to be passing through as it happened
she can hardly bear to speak of it  she glanced at lucy proudly
and how came we to have you here asked the chaplain paternally
miss bartletts recent liberalism oozed away at the question
do not blame her please mr
eager
the fault is mine i left her unchaperoned  so you were here alone miss honeychurch his voice suggested sympathetic reproof but at the same time indicated that a few harrowing details would not be unacceptable
his dark handsome face drooped mournfully towards her to catch her reply
practically  one of our pension acquaintances kindly brought her home said miss bartlett adroitly concealing the sex of the preserver
for her also it must have been a terrible experience
i trust that neither of you was at allthat it was not in your immediate proximity  of the many things lucy was noticing today not the least remarkable was this the ghoulish fashion in which respectable people will nibble after blood
george emerson had kept the subject strangely pure
he died by the fountain i believe was her reply
and you and your friend  were over at the loggia  that must have saved you much
you have not of course seen the disgraceful illustrations which the gutter pressthis man is a public nuisance he knows that i am a resident perfectly well and yet he goes on worrying me to buy his vulgar views  surely the vendor of photographs was in league with lucyin the eternal league of italy with youth
he had suddenly extended his book before miss bartlett and mr
eager binding their hands together by a long glossy ribbon of churches pictures and views
this is too much cried the chaplain striking petulantly at one of fra angelicos angels
she tore
a shrill cry rose from the vendor
the book it seemed was more valuable than one would have supposed
willingly would i purchase began miss bartlett
ignore him said mr
eager sharply and they all walked rapidly away from the square
but an italian can never be ignored least of all when he has a grievance
his mysterious persecution of mr
eager became relentless the air rang with his threats and lamentations
he appealed to lucy would not she intercede
he was poorhe sheltered a familythe tax on bread
he waited he gibbered he was recompensed he was dissatisfied he did not leave them until he had swept their minds clean of all thoughts whether pleasant or unpleasant
shopping was the topic that now ensued
under the chaplains guidance they selected many hideous presents and mementoesflorid little pictureframes that seemed fashioned in gilded pastry other little frames more severe that stood on little easels and were carven out of oak a blotting book of vellum a dante of the same material cheap mosaic brooches which the maids next christmas would never tell from real pins pots heraldic saucers brown artphotographs eros and psyche in alabaster st peter to matchall of which would have cost less in london
this successful morning left no pleasant impressions on lucy
she had been a little frightened both by miss lavish and by mr
eager she knew not why
and as they frightened her she had strangely enough ceased to respect them
she doubted that miss lavish was a great artist
she doubted that mr
eager was as full of spirituality and culture as she had been led to suppose
they were tried by some new test and they were found wanting
as for charlotteas for charlotte she was exactly the same
it might be possible to be nice to her it was impossible to love her
the son of a labourer i happen to know it for a fact
a mechanic of some sort himself when he was young then he took to writing for the socialistic press
i came across him at brixton  they were talking about the emersons
how wonderfully people rise in these days sighed miss bartlett fingering a model of the leaning tower of pisa
generally replied mr
eager one has only sympathy for their success
the desire for education and for social advancein these things there is something not wholly vile
there are some working men whom one would be very willing to see out here in florencelittle as they would make of it  is he a journalist now miss bartlett asked
he is not he made an advantageous marriage  he uttered this remark with a voice full of meaning and ended with a sigh
oh so he has a wife  dead miss bartlett dead
i wonderyes i wonder how he has the effrontery to look me in the face to dare to claim acquaintance with me
he was in my london parish long ago
the other day in santa croce when he was with miss honeychurch i snubbed him
let him beware that he does not get more than a snub  what cried lucy flushing
exposure hissed mr
eager
he tried to change the subject but in scoring a dramatic point he had interested his audience more than he had intended
miss bartlett was full of very natural curiosity
lucy though she wished never to see the emersons again was not disposed to condemn them on a single word
do you mean she asked that he is an irreligious man
we know that already  lucy dear said miss bartlett gently reproving her cousins penetration
i should be astonished if you knew all
the boyan innocent child at the timei will exclude
god knows what his education and his inherited qualities may have made him  perhaps said miss bartlett it is something that we had better not hear  to speak plainly said mr
eager it is
i will say no more for the first time lucys rebellious thoughts swept out in wordsfor the first time in her life
you have said very little  it was my intention to say very little was his frigid reply
he gazed indignantly at the girl who met him with equal indignation
she turned towards him from the shop counter her breast heaved quickly
he observed her brow and the sudden strength of her lips
it was intolerable that she should disbelieve him
murder if you want to know he cried angrily
that man murdered his wife  how she retorted
to all intents and purposes he murdered her
that day in santa crocedid they say anything against me  not a word mr
eagernot a single word  oh i thought they had been libelling me to you
but i suppose it is only their personal charms that makes you defend them  im not defending them said lucy losing her courage and relapsing into the old chaotic methods
theyre nothing to me  how could you think she was defending them said miss bartlett much discomfited by the unpleasant scene
the shopman was possibly listening
she will find it difficult
for that man has murdered his wife in the sight of god  the addition of god was striking
but the chaplain was really trying to qualify a rash remark
a silence followed which might have been impressive but was merely awkward
then miss bartlett hastily purchased the leaning tower and led the way into the street
i must be going said he shutting his eyes and taking out his watch
miss bartlett thanked him for his kindness and spoke with enthusiasm of the approaching drive
drive
oh is our drive to come off  lucy was recalled to her manners and after a little exertion the complacency of mr
eager was restored
bother the drive exclaimed the girl as soon as he had departed
it is just the drive we had arranged with mr beebe without any fuss at all
why should he invite us in that absurd manner
we might as well invite him
we are each paying for ourselves  miss bartlett who had intended to lament over the emersons was launched by this remark into unexpected thoughts
if that is so dearif the drive we and mr beebe are going with mr
eager is really the same as the one we are going with mr beebe then i foresee a sad kettle of fish  how  because mr beebe has asked eleanor lavish to come too  that will mean another carriage  far worse
mr
eager does not like eleanor
she knows it herself
the truth must be told she is too unconventional for him  they were now in the newspaperroom at the english bank
lucy stood by the central table heedless of punch and the graphic trying to answer or at all events to formulate the questions rioting in her brain
the wellknown world had broken up and there emerged florence a magic city where people thought and did the most extraordinary things
murder accusations of murder a lady clinging to one man and being rude to anotherwere these the daily incidents of her streets
was there more in her frank beauty than met the eyethe power perhaps to evoke passions good and bad and to bring them speedily to a fulfillment
happy charlotte who though greatly troubled over things that did not matter seemed oblivious to things that did who could conjecture with admirable delicacy where things might lead to but apparently lost sight of the goal as she approached it
now she was crouching in the corner trying to extract a circular note from a kind of linen nosebag which hung in chaste concealment round her neck
she had been told that this was the only safe way to carry money in italy it must only be broached within the walls of the english bank
as she groped she murmured whether it is mr beebe who forgot to tell mr
eager or mr
eager who forgot when he told us or whether they have decided to leave eleanor out altogetherwhich they could scarcely dobut in any case we must be prepared
it is you they really want i am only asked for appearances
you shall go with the two gentlemen and i and eleanor will follow behind
a onehorse carriage would do for us
yet how difficult it is  it is indeed replied the girl with a gravity that sounded sympathetic
what do you think about it asked miss bartlett flushed from the struggle and buttoning up her dress
i dont know what i think nor what i want  oh dear lucy
i do hope florence isnt boring you
speak the word and as you know i would take you to the ends of the earth tomorrow  thank you charlotte said lucy and pondered over the offer
there were letters for her at the bureauone from her brother full of athletics and biology one from her mother delightful as only her mothers letters could be
she had read in it of the crocuses which had been bought for yellow and were coming up puce of the new parlourmaid who had watered the ferns with essence of lemonade of the semidetached cottages which were ruining summer street and breaking the heart of sir harry otway
she recalled the free pleasant life of her home where she was allowed to do everything and where nothing ever happened to her
the road up through the pinewoods the clean drawingroom the view over the sussex wealdall hung before her bright and distinct but pathetic as the pictures in a gallery to which after much experience a traveller returns
and the news asked miss bartlett
mrs
vyse and her son have gone to rome said lucy giving the news that interested her least
do you know the vyses  oh not that way back
we can never have too much of the dear piazza signoria  theyre nice people the vyses
so clevermy idea of whats really clever
dont you long to be in rome  i die for it  the piazza signoria is too stony to be brilliant
it has no grass no flowers no frescoes no glittering walls of marble or comforting patches of ruddy brick
by an odd chanceunless we believe in a presiding genius of placesthe statues that relieve its severity suggest not the innocence of childhood nor the glorious bewilderment of youth but the conscious achievements of maturity
perseus and judith hercules and thusnelda they have done or suffered something and though they are immortal immortality has come to them after experience not before
here not only in the solitude of nature might a hero meet a goddess or a heroine a god
charlotte cried the girl suddenly
heres an idea
what if we popped off to rome tomorrowstraight to the vyses hotel
for i do know what i want
im sick of florence
no you said youd go to the ends of the earth
do
do  miss bartlett with equal vivacity replied  oh you droll person
pray what would become of your drive in the hills  they passed together through the gaunt beauty of the square laughing over the unpractical suggestion
chapter vi the reverend arthur beebe the reverend cuthbert eager mr emerson mr george emerson miss eleanor lavish miss charlotte bartlett and miss lucy honeychurch drive out in carriages to see a view italians drive them
it was phaethon who drove them to fiesole that memorable day a youth all irresponsibility and fire recklessly urging his masters horses up the stony hill
mr beebe recognized him at once
neither the ages of faith nor the age of doubt had touched him he was phaethon in tuscany driving a cab
and it was persephone whom he asked leave to pick up on the way saying that she was his sisterpersephone tall and slender and pale returning with the spring to her mothers cottage and still shading her eyes from the unaccustomed light
to her mr
eager objected saying that here was the thin edge of the wedge and one must guard against imposition
but the ladies interceded and when it had been made clear that it was a very great favour the goddess was allowed to mount beside the god
phaethon at once slipped the left rein over her head thus enabling himself to drive with his arm round her waist
she did not mind
mr
eager who sat with his back to the horses saw nothing of the indecorous proceeding and continued his conversation with lucy
the other two occupants of the carriage were old mr emerson and miss lavish
for a dreadful thing had happened mr beebe without consulting mr
eager had doubled the size of the party
and though miss bartlett and miss lavish had planned all the morning how the people were to sit at the critical moment when the carriages came round they lost their heads and miss lavish got in with lucy while miss bartlett with george emerson and mr beebe followed on behind
it was hard on the poor chaplain to have his partie carree thus transformed
tea at a renaissance villa if he had ever meditated it was now impossible
lucy and miss bartlett had a certain style about them and mr beebe though unreliable was a man of parts
but a shoddy lady writer and a journalist who had murdered his wife in the sight of godthey should enter no villa at his introduction
lucy elegantly dressed in white sat erect and nervous amid these explosive ingredients attentive to mr
eager repressive towards miss lavish watchful of old mr emerson hitherto fortunately asleep thanks to a heavy lunch and the drowsy atmosphere of spring
she looked on the expedition as the work of fate
but for it she would have avoided george emerson successfully
in an open manner he had shown that he wished to continue their intimacy
she had refused not because she disliked him but because she did not know what had happened and suspected that he did know
and this frightened her
for the real eventwhatever it washad taken place not in the loggia but by the river
to behave wildly at the sight of death is pardonable
but to discuss it afterwards to pass from discussion into silence and through silence into sympathy that is an error not of a startled emotion but of the whole fabric
there was really something blameworthy she thought in their joint contemplation of the shadowy stream in the common impulse which had turned them to the house without the passing of a look or word
this sense of wickedness had been slight at first
she had nearly joined the party to the torre del gallo
but each time that she avoided george it became more imperative that she should avoid him again
and now celestial irony working through her cousin and two clergymen did not suffer her to leave florence till she had made this expedition with him through the hills
meanwhile mr
eager held her in civil converse their little tiff was over
so miss honeychurch you are travelling
as a student of art  oh dear me nooh no  perhaps as a student of human nature interposed miss lavish like myself  oh no
i am here as a tourist  oh indeed said mr
eager
are you indeed
if you will not think me rude we residents sometimes pity you poor tourists not a littlehanded about like a parcel of goods from venice to florence from florence to rome living herded together in pensions or hotels quite unconscious of anything that is outside baedeker their one anxiety to get done or through and go on somewhere else
the result is they mix up towns rivers palaces in one inextricable whirl
you know the american girl in punch who says say poppa what did we see at rome and the father replies why guess rome was the place where we saw the yaller dog theres travelling for you
ha
ha
ha  i quite agree said miss lavish who had several times tried to interrupt his mordant wit
the narrowness and superficiality of the anglosaxon tourist is nothing less than a menace  quite so
now the english colony at florence miss honeychurchand it is of considerable size though of course not all equallya few are here for trade for example
but the greater part are students
lady helen laverstock is at present busy over fra angelico
i mention her name because we are passing her villa on the left
no you can only see it if you standno do not stand you will fall
she is very proud of that thick hedge
inside perfect seclusion
one might have gone back six hundred years
some critics believe that her garden was the scene of the decameron which lends it an additional interest does it not  it does indeed cried miss lavish
tell me where do they place the scene of that wonderful seventh day  but mr
eager proceeded to tell miss honeychurch that on the right lived mr
someone something an american of the best typeso rareand that the somebody elses were farther down the hill
doubtless you know her monographs in the series of mediaeval byways
he is working at gemistus pletho
sometimes as i take tea in their beautiful grounds i hear over the wall the electric tram squealing up the new road with its loads of hot dusty unintelligent tourists who are going to do fiesole in an hour in order that they may say they have been there and i thinkthinki think how little they think what lies so near them  during this speech the two figures on the box were sporting with each other disgracefully
lucy had a spasm of envy
granted that they wished to misbehave it was pleasant for them to be able to do so
they were probably the only people enjoying the expedition
the carriage swept with agonizing jolts up through the piazza of fiesole and into the settignano road
piano
piano said mr
eager elegantly waving his hand over his head
va bene signore va bene va bene crooned the driver and whipped his horses up again
now mr
eager and miss lavish began to talk against each other on the subject of alessio baldovinetti
was he a cause of the renaissance or was he one of its manifestations
the other carriage was left behind
as the pace increased to a gallop the large slumbering form of mr emerson was thrown against the chaplain with the regularity of a machine
piano
piano said he with a martyred look at lucy
an extra lurch made him turn angrily in his seat
phaethon who for some time had been endeavouring to kiss persephone had just succeeded
a little scene ensued which as miss bartlett said afterwards was most unpleasant
the horses were stopped the lovers were ordered to disentangle themselves the boy was to lose his pourboire the girl was immediately to get down
she is my sister said he turning round on them with piteous eyes
mr
eager took the trouble to tell him that he was a liar
phaethon hung down his head not at the matter of the accusation but at its manner
at this point mr emerson whom the shock of stopping had awoke declared that the lovers must on no account be separated and patted them on the back to signify his approval
and miss lavish though unwilling to ally him felt bound to support the cause of bohemianism
most certainly i would let them be she cried
but i dare say i shall receive scant support
i have always flown in the face of the conventions all my life
this is what i call an adventure  we must not submit said mr
eager
i knew he was trying it on
he is treating us as if we were a party of cooks tourists  surely no said miss lavish her ardour visibly decreasing
the other carriage had drawn up behind and sensible mr beebe called out that after this warning the couple would be sure to behave themselves properly
leave them alone mr emerson begged the chaplain of whom he stood in no awe
do we find happiness so often that we should turn it off the box when it happens to sit there
to be driven by loversa king might envy us and if we part them its more like sacrilege than anything i know  here the voice of miss bartlett was heard saying that a crowd had begun to collect
mr
eager who suffered from an overfluent tongue rather than a resolute will was determined to make himself heard
he addressed the driver again
italian in the mouth of italians is a deepvoiced stream with unexpected cataracts and boulders to preserve it from monotony
in mr eagers mouth it resembled nothing so much as an acid whistling fountain which played ever higher and higher and quicker and quicker and more and more shrilly till abruptly it was turned off with a click
signorina said the man to lucy when the display had ceased
why should he appeal to lucy
signorina echoed persephone in her glorious contralto
she pointed at the other carriage
why
for a moment the two girls looked at each other
then persephone got down from the box
victory at last said mr
eager smiting his hands together as the carriages started again
it is not victory said mr emerson
it is defeat
you have parted two people who were happy  mr
eager shut his eyes
he was obliged to sit next to mr emerson but he would not speak to him
the old man was refreshed by sleep and took up the matter warmly
he commanded lucy to agree with him he shouted for support to his son
we have tried to buy what cannot be bought with money
he has bargained to drive us and he is doing it
we have no rights over his soul  miss lavish frowned
it is hard when a person you have classed as typically british speaks out of his character
he was not driving us well she said
he jolted us  that i deny
it was as restful as sleeping
aha
he is jolting us now
can you wonder
he would like to throw us out and most certainly he is justified
and if i were superstitious id be frightened of the girl too
it doesnt do to injure young people
have you ever heard of lorenzo de medici  miss lavish bristled
most certainly i have
do you refer to lorenzo il magnifico or to lorenzo duke of urbino or to lorenzo surnamed lorenzino on account of his diminutive stature  the lord knows
possibly he does know for i refer to lorenzo the poet
he wrote a lineso i heard yesterdaywhich runs like this dont go fighting against the spring  mr
eager could not resist the opportunity for erudition
non fate guerra al maggio he murmured
war not with the may would render a correct meaning  the point is we have warred with it
look he pointed to the val darno which was visible far below them through the budding trees
fifty miles of spring and weve come up to admire them
do you suppose theres any difference between spring in nature and spring in man
but there we go praising the one and condemning the other as improper ashamed that the same laws work eternally through both  no one encouraged him to talk
presently mr
eager gave a signal for the carriages to stop and marshalled the party for their ramble on the hill
a hollow like a great amphitheatre full of terraced steps and misty olives now lay between them and the heights of fiesole and the road still following its curve was about to sweep on to a promontory which stood out in the plain
it was this promontory uncultivated wet covered with bushes and occasional trees which had caught the fancy of alessio baldovinetti nearly five hundred years before
he had ascended it that diligent and rather obscure master possibly with an eye to business possibly for the joy of ascending
standing there he had seen that view of the val darno and distant florence which he afterwards had introduced not very effectively into his work
but where exactly had he stood
that was the question which mr
eager hoped to solve now
and miss lavish whose nature was attracted by anything problematical had become equally enthusiastic
but it is not easy to carry the pictures of alessio baldovinetti in your head even if you have remembered to look at them before starting
and the haze in the valley increased the difficulty of the quest
the party sprang about from tuft to tuft of grass their anxiety to keep together being only equalled by their desire to go different directions
finally they split into groups
lucy clung to miss bartlett and miss lavish the emersons returned to hold laborious converse with the drivers while the two clergymen who were expected to have topics in common were left to each other
the two elder ladies soon threw off the mask
in the audible whisper that was now so familiar to lucy they began to discuss not alessio baldovinetti but the drive
miss bartlett had asked mr george emerson what his profession was and he had answered the railway she was very sorry that she had asked him
she had no idea that it would be such a dreadful answer or she would not have asked him
mr beebe had turned the conversation so cleverly and she hoped that the young man was not very much hurt at her asking him
the railway gasped miss lavish
oh but i shall die
of course it was the railway she could not control her mirth
he is the image of a porteron on the southeastern  eleanor be quiet plucking at her vivacious companion
hush
theyll hearthe emersons  i cant stop
let me go my wicked way
a porter  eleanor  im sure its all right put in lucy
the emersons wont hear and they wouldnt mind if they did  miss lavish did not seem pleased at this
miss honeychurch listening she said rather crossly
pouf
wouf
you naughty girl
go away  oh lucy you ought to be with mr
eager im sure  i cant find them now and i dont want to either  mr
eager will be offended
it is your party  please id rather stop here with you  no i agree said miss lavish
its like a school feast the boys have got separated from the girls
miss lucy you are to go
we wish to converse on high topics unsuited for your ear  the girl was stubborn
as her time at florence drew to its close she was only at ease amongst those to whom she felt indifferent
such a one was miss lavish and such for the moment was charlotte
she wished she had not called attention to herself they were both annoyed at her remark and seemed determined to get rid of her
how tired one gets said miss bartlett
oh i do wish freddy and your mother could be here  unselfishness with miss bartlett had entirely usurped the functions of enthusiasm
lucy did not look at the view either
she would not enjoy anything till she was safe at rome
then sit you down said miss lavish
observe my foresight  with many a smile she produced two of those mackintosh squares that protect the frame of the tourist from damp grass or cold marble steps
she sat on one who was to sit on the other
lucy without a moments doubt lucy
the ground will do for me
really i have not had rheumatism for years
if i do feel it coming on i shall stand
imagine your mothers feelings if i let you sit in the wet in your white linen she sat down heavily where the ground looked particularly moist
here we are all settled delightfully
even if my dress is thinner it will not show so much being brown
sit down dear you are too unselfish you dont assert yourself enough she cleared her throat
now dont be alarmed this isnt a cold
its the tiniest cough and i have had it three days
its nothing to do with sitting here at all  there was only one way of treating the situation
at the end of five minutes lucy departed in search of mr beebe and mr
eager vanquished by the mackintosh square
she addressed herself to the drivers who were sprawling in the carriages perfuming the cushions with cigars
the miscreant a bony young man scorched black by the sun rose to greet her with the courtesy of a host and the assurance of a relative
dove said lucy after much anxious thought
his face lit up
of course he knew where
not so far either
his arm swept threefourths of the horizon
he should just think he did know where
he pressed his fingertips to his forehead and then pushed them towards her as if oozing with visible extract of knowledge
more seemed necessary
what was the italian for clergyman
dove buoni uomini said she at last
good
scarcely the adjective for those noble beings
he showed her his cigar
unopiupiccolo was her next remark implying has the cigar been given to you by mr beebe the smaller of the two good men  she was correct as usual
he tied the horse to a tree kicked it to make it stay quiet dusted the carriage arranged his hair remoulded his hat encouraged his moustache and in rather less than a quarter of a minute was ready to conduct her
italians are born knowing the way
it would seem that the whole earth lay before them not as a map but as a chessboard whereon they continually behold the changing pieces as well as the squares
any one can find places but the finding of people is a gift from god
he only stopped once to pick her some great blue violets
she thanked him with real pleasure
in the company of this common man the world was beautiful and direct
for the first time she felt the influence of spring
his arm swept the horizon gracefully violets like other things existed in great profusion there would she like to see them  ma buoni uomini  he bowed
certainly
good men first violets afterwards
they proceeded briskly through the undergrowth which became thicker and thicker
they were nearing the edge of the promontory and the view was stealing round them but the brown network of the bushes shattered it into countless pieces
he was occupied in his cigar and in holding back the pliant boughs
she was rejoicing in her escape from dullness
not a step not a twig was unimportant to her
what is that  there was a voice in the wood in the distance behind them
the voice of mr
eager
he shrugged his shoulders
an italians ignorance is sometimes more remarkable than his knowledge
she could not make him understand that perhaps they had missed the clergymen
the view was forming at last she could discern the river the golden plain other hills
eccolo he exclaimed
at the same moment the ground gave way and with a cry she fell out of the wood
light and beauty enveloped her
she had fallen on to a little open terrace which was covered with violets from end to end
courage cried her companion now standing some six feet above
courage and love  she did not answer
from her feet the ground sloped sharply into view and violets ran down in rivulets and streams and cataracts irrigating the hillside with blue eddying round the tree stems collecting into pools in the hollows covering the grass with spots of azure foam
but never again were they in such profusion this terrace was the wellhead the primal source whence beauty gushed out to water the earth
standing at its brink like a swimmer who prepares was the good man
but he was not the good man that she had expected and he was alone
george had turned at the sound of her arrival
for a moment he contemplated her as one who had fallen out of heaven
he saw radiant joy in her face he saw the flowers beat against her dress in blue waves
the bushes above them closed
he stepped quickly forward and kissed her
before she could speak almost before she could feel a voice called lucy
lucy
lucy the silence of life had been broken by miss bartlett who stood brown against the view
chapter vii they return  some complicated game had been playing up and down the hillside all the afternoon
what it was and exactly how the players had sided lucy was slow to discover
mr
eager had met them with a questioning eye
charlotte had repulsed him with much small talk
mr emerson seeking his son was told whereabouts to find him
mr beebe who wore the heated aspect of a neutral was bidden to collect the factions for the return home
there was a general sense of groping and bewilderment
pan had been amongst themnot the great god pan who has been buried these two thousand years but the little god pan who presides over social contretemps and unsuccessful picnics
mr beebe had lost everyone and had consumed in solitude the teabasket which he had brought up as a pleasant surprise
miss lavish had lost miss bartlett
lucy had lost mr
eager
mr emerson had lost george
miss bartlett had lost a mackintosh square
phaethon had lost the game
that last fact was undeniable
he climbed on to the box shivering with his collar up prophesying the swift approach of bad weather
let us go immediately he told them
the signorino will walk  all the way
he will be hours said mr beebe
apparently
i told him it was unwise he would look no one in the face perhaps defeat was particularly mortifying for him
he alone had played skilfully using the whole of his instinct while the others had used scraps of their intelligence
he alone had divined what things were and what he wished them to be
he alone had interpreted the message that lucy had received five days before from the lips of a dying man
persephone who spends half her life in the graveshe could interpret it also
not so these english
they gain knowledge slowly and perhaps too late
the thoughts of a cabdriver however just seldom affect the lives of his employers
he was the most competent of miss bartletts opponents but infinitely the least dangerous
once back in the town he and his insight and his knowledge would trouble english ladies no more
of course it was most unpleasant she had seen his black head in the bushes he might make a tavern story out of it
but after all what have we to do with taverns
real menace belongs to the drawingroom
it was of drawingroom people that miss bartlett thought as she journeyed downwards towards the fading sun
lucy sat beside her mr
eager sat opposite trying to catch her eye he was vaguely suspicious
they spoke of alessio baldovinetti
rain and darkness came on together
the two ladies huddled together under an inadequate parasol
there was a lightning flash and miss lavish who was nervous screamed from the carriage in front
at the next flash lucy screamed also
mr
eager addressed her professionally  courage miss honeychurch courage and faith
if i might say so there is something almost blasphemous in this horror of the elements
are we seriously to suppose that all these clouds all this immense electrical display is simply called into existence to extinguish you or me  noof course  even from the scientific standpoint the chances against our being struck are enormous
the steel knives the only articles which might attract the current are in the other carriage
and in any case we are infinitely safer than if we were walking
couragecourage and faith  under the rug lucy felt the kindly pressure of her cousins hand
at times our need for a sympathetic gesture is so great that we care not what exactly it signifies or how much we may have to pay for it afterwards
miss bartlett by this timely exercise of her muscles gained more than she would have got in hours of preaching or cross examination
she renewed it when the two carriages stopped half into florence
mr
eager called mr beebe
we want your assistance
will you interpret for us  george cried mr emerson
ask your driver which way george went
the boy may lose his way
he may be killed  go mr eager said miss bartlett dont ask our driver our driver is no help
go and support poor mr beebe he is nearly demented  he may be killed cried the old man
he may be killed  typical behaviour said the chaplain as he quitted the carriage
in the presence of reality that kind of person invariably breaks down  what does he know whispered lucy as soon as they were alone
charlotte how much does mr
eager know  nothing dearest he knows nothing
but she pointed at the driverhe knows everything
dearest had we better
shall i she took out her purse
it is dreadful to be entangled with lowclass people
he saw it all tapping phaethons back with her guidebook she said silenzio and offered him a franc
va bene he replied and accepted it
as well this ending to his day as any
but lucy a mortal maid was disappointed in him
there was an explosion up the road
the storm had struck the overhead wire of the tramline and one of the great supports had fallen
if they had not stopped perhaps they might have been hurt
they chose to regard it as a miraculous preservation and the floods of love and sincerity which fructify every hour of life burst forth in tumult
they descended from the carriages they embraced each other
it was as joyful to be forgiven past unworthinesses as to forgive them
for a moment they realized vast possibilities of good
the older people recovered quickly
in the very height of their emotion they knew it to be unmanly or unladylike
miss lavish calculated that even if they had continued they would not have been caught in the accident
mr
eager mumbled a temperate prayer
but the drivers through miles of dark squalid road poured out their souls to the dryads and the saints and lucy poured out hers to her cousin
charlotte dear charlotte kiss me
kiss me again
only you can understand me
you warned me to be careful
and ii thought i was developing  do not cry dearest
take your time  i have been obstinate and sillyworse than you know far worse
once by the riveroh but he isnt killedhe wouldnt be killed would he  the thought disturbed her repentance
as a matter of fact the storm was worst along the road but she had been near danger and so she thought it must be near to everyone
i trust not
one would always pray against that  he is reallyi think he was taken by surprise just as i was before
but this time im not to blame i want you to believe that
i simply slipped into those violets
no i want to be really truthful
i am a little to blame
i had silly thoughts
the sky you know was gold and the ground all blue and for a moment he looked like someone in a book  in a book  heroesgodsthe nonsense of schoolgirls  and then  but charlotte you know what happened then  miss bartlett was silent
indeed she had little more to learn
with a certain amount of insight she drew her young cousin affectionately to her
all the way back lucys body was shaken by deep sighs which nothing could repress
i want to be truthful she whispered
it is so hard to be absolutely truthful  dont be troubled dearest
wait till you are calmer
we will talk it over before bedtime in my room  so they reentered the city with hands clasped
it was a shock to the girl to find how far emotion had ebbed in others
the storm had ceased and mr emerson was easier about his son
mr beebe had regained good humour and mr
eager was already snubbing miss lavish
charlotte alone she was sure ofcharlotte whose exterior concealed so much insight and love
the luxury of selfexposure kept her almost happy through the long evening
she thought not so much of what had happened as of how she should describe it
all her sensations her spasms of courage her moments of unreasonable joy her mysterious discontent should be carefully laid before her cousin
and together in divine confidence they would disentangle and interpret them all
at last thought she i shall understand myself
i shant again be troubled by things that come out of nothing and mean i dont know what  miss alan asked her to play
she refused vehemently
music seemed to her the employment of a child
she sat close to her cousin who with commendable patience was listening to a long story about lost luggage
when it was over she capped it by a story of her own
lucy became rather hysterical with the delay
in vain she tried to check or at all events to accelerate the tale
it was not till a late hour that miss bartlett had recovered her luggage and could say in her usual tone of gentle reproach  well dear i at all events am ready for bedfordshire
come into my room and i will give a good brush to your hair  with some solemnity the door was shut and a cane chair placed for the girl
then miss bartlett said so what is to be done  she was unprepared for the question
it had not occurred to her that she would have to do anything
a detailed exhibition of her emotions was all that she had counted upon
what is to be done
a point dearest which you alone can settle  the rain was streaming down the black windows and the great room felt damp and chilly one candle burnt trembling on the chest of drawers close to miss bartletts toque which cast monstrous and fantastic shadows on the bolted door
a tram roared by in the dark and lucy felt unaccountably sad though she had long since dried her eyes
she lifted them to the ceiling where the griffins and bassoons were colourless and vague the very ghosts of joy
it has been raining for nearly four hours she said at last
miss bartlett ignored the remark
how do you propose to silence him  the driver  my dear girl no mr george emerson  lucy began to pace up and down the room
i dont understand she said at last
she understood very well but she no longer wished to be absolutely truthful
how are you going to stop him talking about it  i have a feeling that talk is a thing he will never do  i too intend to judge him charitably
but unfortunately i have met the type before
they seldom keep their exploits to themselves  exploits cried lucy wincing under the horrible plural
my poor dear did you suppose that this was his first
come here and listen to me
i am only gathering it from his own remarks
do you remember that day at lunch when he argued with miss alan that liking one person is an extra reason for liking another  yes said lucy whom at the time the argument had pleased
well i am no prude
there is no need to call him a wicked young man but obviously he is thoroughly unrefined
let us put it down to his deplorable antecedents and education if you wish
but we are no farther on with our question
what do you propose to do  an idea rushed across lucys brain which had she thought of it sooner and made it part of her might have proved victorious
i propose to speak to him said she
miss bartlett uttered a cry of genuine alarm
you see charlotte your kindnessi shall never forget it
butas you saidit is my affair
mine and his  and you are going to implore him to beg him to keep silence  certainly not
there would be no difficulty
whatever you ask him he answers yes or no then it is over
i have been frightened of him
but now i am not one little bit  but we fear him for you dear
you are so young and inexperienced you have lived among such nice people that you cannot realize what men can behow they can take a brutal pleasure in insulting a woman whom her sex does not protect and rally round
this afternoon for example if i had not arrived what would have happened  i cant think said lucy gravely
something in her voice made miss bartlett repeat her question intoning it more vigorously
what would have happened if i hadnt arrived  i cant think said lucy again
when he insulted you how would you have replied  i hadnt time to think
you came  yes but wont you tell me now what you would have done  i should have she checked herself and broke the sentence off
she went up to the dripping window and strained her eyes into the darkness
she could not think what she would have done
come away from the window dear said miss bartlett
you will be seen from the road  lucy obeyed
she was in her cousins power
she could not modulate out the key of selfabasement in which she had started
neither of them referred again to her suggestion that she should speak to george and settle the matter whatever it was with him
miss bartlett became plaintive
oh for a real man
we are only two women you and i mr beebe is hopeless
there is mr
eager but you do not trust him
oh for your brother
he is young but i know that his sisters insult would rouse in him a very lion
thank god chivalry is not yet dead
there are still left some men who can reverence woman  as she spoke she pulled off her rings of which she wore several and ranged them upon the pin cushion
then she blew into her gloves and said  it will be a push to catch the morning train but we must try  what train  the train to rome she looked at her gloves critically
the girl received the announcement as easily as it had been given
when does the train to rome go  at eight  signora bertolini would be upset  we must face that said miss bartlett not liking to say that she had given notice already
she will make us pay for a whole weeks pension  i expect she will
however we shall be much more comfortable at the vyses hotel
isnt afternoon tea given there for nothing  yes but they pay extra for wine after this remark she remained motionless and silent
to her tired eyes charlotte throbbed and swelled like a ghostly figure in a dream
they began to sort their clothes for packing for there was no time to lose if they were to catch the train to rome
lucy when admonished began to move to and fro between the rooms more conscious of the discomforts of packing by candlelight than of a subtler ill charlotte who was practical without ability knelt by the side of an empty trunk vainly endeavouring to pave it with books of varying thickness and size
she gave two or three sighs for the stooping posture hurt her back and for all her diplomacy she felt that she was growing old
the girl heard her as she entered the room and was seized with one of those emotional impulses to which she could never attribute a cause
she only felt that the candle would burn better the packing go easier the world be happier if she could give and receive some human love
the impulse had come before today but never so strongly
she knelt down by her cousins side and took her in her arms
miss bartlett returned the embrace with tenderness and warmth
but she was not a stupid woman and she knew perfectly well that lucy did not love her but needed her to love
for it was in ominous tones that she said after a long pause  dearest lucy how will you ever forgive me  lucy was on her guard at once knowing by bitter experience what forgiving miss bartlett meant
her emotion relaxed she modified her embrace a little and she said  charlotte dear what do you mean
as if i have anything to forgive  you have a great deal and i have a very great deal to forgive myself too
i know well how much i vex you at every turn  but no  miss bartlett assumed her favourite role that of the prematurely aged martyr
ah but yes
i feel that our tour together is hardly the success i had hoped
i might have known it would not do
you want someone younger and stronger and more in sympathy with you
i am too uninteresting and oldfashionedonly fit to pack and unpack your things  please  my only consolation was that you found people more to your taste and were often able to leave me at home
i had my own poor ideas of what a lady ought to do but i hope i did not inflict them on you more than was necessary
you had your own way about these rooms at all events  you mustnt say these things said lucy softly
she still clung to the hope that she and charlotte loved each other heart and soul
they continued to pack in silence
i have been a failure said miss bartlett as she struggled with the straps of lucys trunk instead of strapping her own
failed to make you happy failed in my duty to your mother
she has been so generous to me i shall never face her again after this disaster  but mother will understand
it is not your fault this trouble and it isnt a disaster either  it is my fault it is a disaster
she will never forgive me and rightly
for instance what right had i to make friends with miss lavish  every right  when i was here for your sake
if i have vexed you it is equally true that i have neglected you
your mother will see this as clearly as i do when you tell her  lucy from a cowardly wish to improve the situation said  why need mother hear of it  but you tell her everything  i suppose i do generally  i dare not break your confidence
there is something sacred in it
unless you feel that it is a thing you could not tell her  the girl would not be degraded to this
naturally i should have told her
but in case she should blame you in any way i promise i will not i am very willing not to
i will never speak of it either to her or to any one  her promise brought the longdrawn interview to a sudden close
miss bartlett pecked her smartly on both cheeks wished her goodnight and sent her to her own room
for a moment the original trouble was in the background
george would seem to have behaved like a cad throughout perhaps that was the view which one would take eventually
at present she neither acquitted nor condemned him she did not pass judgement
at the moment when she was about to judge him her cousins voice had intervened and ever since it was miss bartlett who had dominated miss bartlett who even now could be heard sighing into a crack in the partition wall miss bartlett who had really been neither pliable nor humble nor inconsistent
she had worked like a great artist for a timeindeed for yearsshe had been meaningless but at the end there was presented to the girl the complete picture of a cheerless loveless world in which the young rush to destruction until they learn bettera shamefaced world of precautions and barriers which may avert evil but which do not seem to bring good if we may judge from those who have used them most
lucy was suffering from the most grievous wrong which this world has yet discovered diplomatic advantage had been taken of her sincerity of her craving for sympathy and love
such a wrong is not easily forgotten
never again did she expose herself without due consideration and precaution against rebuff
and such a wrong may react disastrously upon the soul
the doorbell rang and she started to the shutters
before she reached them she hesitated turned and blew out the candle
thus it was that though she saw someone standing in the wet below he though he looked up did not see her
to reach his room he had to go by hers
she was still dressed
it struck her that she might slip into the passage and just say that she would be gone before he was up and that their extraordinary intercourse was over
whether she would have dared to do this was never proved
at the critical moment miss bartlett opened her own door and her voice said  i wish one word with you in the drawingroom mr emerson please  soon their footsteps returned and miss bartlett said goodnight mr emerson  his heavy tired breathing was the only reply the chaperon had done her work
lucy cried aloud it isnt true
it cant all be true
i want not to be muddled
i want to grow older quickly  miss bartlett tapped on the wall
go to bed at once dear
you need all the rest you can get  in the morning they left for rome
part two   chapter viii medieval  the drawingroom curtains at windy corner had been pulled to meet for the carpet was new and deserved protection from the august sun
they were heavy curtains reaching almost to the ground and the light that filtered through them was subdued and varied
a poetnone was presentmight have quoted life like a dome of many coloured glass  or might have compared the curtains to sluicegates lowered against the intolerable tides of heaven
without was poured a sea of radiance within the glory though visible was tempered to the capacities of man
two pleasant people sat in the room
onea boy of nineteenwas studying a small manual of anatomy and peering occasionally at a bone which lay upon the piano
from time to time he bounced in his chair and puffed and groaned for the day was hot and the print small and the human frame fearfully made and his mother who was writing a letter did continually read out to him what she had written
and continually did she rise from her seat and part the curtains so that a rivulet of light fell across the carpet and make the remark that they were still there
where arent they said the boy who was freddy lucys brother
i tell you im getting fairly sick  for goodness sake go out of my drawingroom then cried mrs honeychurch who hoped to cure her children of slang by taking it literally
freddy did not move or reply
i think things are coming to a head she observed rather wanting her sons opinion on the situation if she could obtain it without undue supplication
time they did  i am glad that cecil is asking her this once more  its his third go isnt it  freddy i do call the way you talk unkind  i didnt mean to be unkind then he added but i do think lucy might have got this off her chest in italy
i dont know how girls manage things but she cant have said no properly before or she wouldnt have to say it again now
over the whole thingi cant explaini do feel so uncomfortable  do you indeed dear
how interesting  i feelnever mind  he returned to his work
just listen to what i have written to mrs vyse
i said dear mrs vyse  yes mother you told me
a jolly good letter  i said dear mrs vyse cecil has just asked my permission about it and i should be delighted if lucy wishes it
but she stopped reading i was rather amused at cecil asking my permission at all
he has always gone in for unconventionality and parents nowhere and so forth
when it comes to the point he cant get on without me  nor me  you  freddy nodded
what do you mean  he asked me for my permission also  she exclaimed how very odd of him  why so asked the son and heir
why shouldnt my permission be asked  what do you know about lucy or girls or anything
what ever did you say  i said to cecil take her or leave her its no business of mine  what a helpful answer but her own answer though more normal in its wording had been to the same effect
the bother is this began freddy
then he took up his work again too shy to say what the bother was
mrs honeychurch went back to the window
freddy you must come
there they still are  i dont see you ought to go peeping like that  peeping like that
cant i look out of my own window  but she returned to the writingtable observing as she passed her son still page  freddy snorted and turned over two leaves
for a brief space they were silent
close by beyond the curtains the gentle murmur of a long conversation had never ceased
the bother is this i have put my foot in it with cecil most awfully  he gave a nervous gulp
not content with permission which i did givethat is to say i said i dont mindwell not content with that he wanted to know whether i wasnt off my head with joy
he practically put it like this wasnt it a splendid thing for lucy and for windy corner generally if he married her
and he would have an answerhe said it would strengthen his hand  i hope you gave a careful answer dear  i answered no said the boy grinding his teeth
there
fly into a stew
i cant help ithad to say it
i had to say no
he ought never to have asked me  ridiculous child cried his mother
you think youre so holy and truthful but really its only abominable conceit
do you suppose that a man like cecil would take the slightest notice of anything you say
i hope he boxed your ears
how dare you say no  oh do keep quiet mother
i had to say no when i couldnt say yes
i tried to laugh as if i didnt mean what i said and as cecil laughed too and went away it may be all right
but i feel my foots in it
oh do keep quiet though and let a man do some work  no said mrs honeychurch with the air of one who has considered the subject i shall not keep quiet
you know all that has passed between them in rome you know why he is down here and yet you deliberately insult him and try to turn him out of my house  not a bit he pleaded
i only let out i didnt like him
i dont hate him but i dont like him
what i mind is that hell tell lucy  he glanced at the curtains dismally
well i like him said mrs honeychurch
i know his mother hes good hes clever hes rich hes well connectedoh you neednt kick the piano
hes well connectedill say it again if you like hes well connected she paused as if rehearsing her eulogy but her face remained dissatisfied
she added and he has beautiful manners  i liked him till just now
i suppose its having him spoiling lucys first week at home and its also something that mr beebe said not knowing  mr
beebe said his mother trying to conceal her interest
i dont see how mr beebe comes in  you know mr beebes funny way when you never quite know what he means
he said mr
vyse is an ideal bachelor i was very cute i asked him what he meant
he said oh hes like mebetter detached i couldnt make him say any more but it set me thinking
since cecil has come after lucy he hasnt been so pleasant at leasti cant explain  you never can dear
but i can
you are jealous of cecil because he may stop lucy knitting you silk ties  the explanation seemed plausible and freddy tried to accept it
but at the back of his brain there lurked a dim mistrust
cecil praised one too much for being athletic
was that it
cecil made one talk in ones own way
this tired one
was that it
and cecil was the kind of fellow who would never wear another fellows cap
unaware of his own profundity freddy checked himself
he must be jealous or he would not dislike a man for such foolish reasons
will this do called his mother
dear mrs vysececil has just asked my permission about it and i should be delighted if lucy wishes it then i put in at the top and i have told lucy so i must write the letter out againand i have told lucy so
but lucy seems very uncertain and in these days young people must decide for themselves i said that because i didnt want mrs vyse to think us oldfashioned
she goes in for lectures and improving her mind and all the time a thick layer of flue under the beds and the maids dirty thumbmarks where you turn on the electric light
she keeps that flat abominably  suppose lucy marries cecil would she live in a flat or in the country  dont interrupt so foolishly
where was i
oh yesyoung people must decide for themselves
i know that lucy likes your son because she tells me everything and she wrote to me from rome when he asked her first no ill cross that last bit outit looks patronizing
ill stop at because she tells me everything or shall i cross that out too  cross it out too said freddy
mrs honeychurch left it in
then the whole thing runs dear mrs
vysececil has just asked my permission about it and i should be delighted if lucy wishes it and i have told lucy so
but lucy seems very uncertain and in these days young people must decide for themselves
i know that lucy likes your son because she tells me everything
but i do not know  look out cried freddy
the curtains parted
cecils first movement was one of irritation
he couldnt bear the honeychurch habit of sitting in the dark to save the furniture
instinctively he give the curtains a twitch and sent them swinging down their poles
light entered
there was revealed a terrace such as is owned by many villas with trees each side of it and on it a little rustic seat and two flowerbeds
but it was transfigured by the view beyond for windy corner was built on the range that overlooks the sussex weald
lucy who was in the little seat seemed on the edge of a green magic carpet which hovered in the air above the tremulous world
cecil entered
appearing thus late in the story cecil must be at once described
he was medieval
like a gothic statue
tall and refined with shoulders that seemed braced square by an effort of the will and a head that was tilted a little higher than the usual level of vision he resembled those fastidious saints who guard the portals of a french cathedral
well educated well endowed and not deficient physically he remained in the grip of a certain devil whom the modern world knows as selfconsciousness and whom the medieval with dimmer vision worshipped as asceticism
a gothic statue implies celibacy just as a greek statue implies fruition and perhaps this was what mr beebe meant
and freddy who ignored history and art perhaps meant the same when he failed to imagine cecil wearing another fellows cap
mrs honeychurch left her letter on the writing table and moved towards her young acquaintance
oh cecil she exclaimedoh cecil do tell me  i promessi sposi said he
they stared at him anxiously
she has accepted me he said and the sound of the thing in english made him flush and smile with pleasure and look more human
i am so glad said mrs honeychurch while freddy proffered a hand that was yellow with chemicals
they wished that they also knew italian for our phrases of approval and of amazement are so connected with little occasions that we fear to use them on great ones
we are obliged to become vaguely poetic or to take refuge in scriptural reminiscences
welcome as one of the family said mrs honeychurch waving her hand at the furniture
this is indeed a joyous day
i feel sure that you will make our dear lucy happy  i hope so replied the young man shifting his eyes to the ceiling
we mothers simpered mrs honeychurch and then realized that she was affected sentimental bombasticall the things she hated most
why could she not be freddy who stood stiff in the middle of the room looking very cross and almost handsome
i say lucy called cecil for conversation seemed to flag
lucy rose from the seat
she moved across the lawn and smiled in at them just as if she was going to ask them to play tennis
then she saw her brothers face
her lips parted and she took him in her arms
he said steady on  not a kiss for me asked her mother
lucy kissed her also
would you take them into the garden and tell mrs honeychurch all about it cecil suggested
and id stop here and tell my mother  we go with lucy said freddy as if taking orders
yes you go with lucy  they passed into the sunlight
cecil watched them cross the terrace and descend out of sight by the steps
they would descendhe knew their wayspast the shrubbery and past the tennislawn and the dahliabed until they reached the kitchen garden and there in the presence of the potatoes and the peas the great event would be discussed
smiling indulgently he lit a cigarette and rehearsed the events that had led to such a happy conclusion
he had known lucy for several years but only as a commonplace girl who happened to be musical
he could still remember his depression that afternoon at rome when she and her terrible cousin fell on him out of the blue and demanded to be taken to st peters
that day she had seemed a typical touristshrill crude and gaunt with travel
but italy worked some marvel in her
it gave her light andwhich he held more preciousit gave her shadow
soon he detected in her a wonderful reticence
she was like a woman of leonardo da vincis whom we love not so much for herself as for the things that she will not tell us
the things are assuredly not of this life no woman of leonardos could have anything so vulgar as a story she did develop most wonderfully day by day
so it happened that from patronizing civility he had slowly passed if not to passion at least to a profound uneasiness
already at rome he had hinted to her that they might be suitable for each other
it had touched him greatly that she had not broken away at the suggestion
her refusal had been clear and gentle after itas the horrid phrase wentshe had been exactly the same to him as before
three months later on the margin of italy among the flowerclad alps he had asked her again in bald traditional language
she reminded him of a leonardo more than ever her sunburnt features were shadowed by fantastic rock at his words she had turned and stood between him and the light with immeasurable plains behind her
he walked home with her unashamed feeling not at all like a rejected suitor
the things that really mattered were unshaken
so now he had asked her once more and clear and gentle as ever she had accepted him giving no coy reasons for her delay but simply saying that she loved him and would do her best to make him happy
his mother too would be pleased she had counselled the step he must write her a long account
glancing at his hand in case any of freddys chemicals had come off on it he moved to the writing table
there he saw dear mrs vyse  followed by many erasures
he recoiled without reading any more and after a little hesitation sat down elsewhere and pencilled a note on his knee
then he lit another cigarette which did not seem quite as divine as the first and considered what might be done to make windy corner drawingroom more distinctive
with that outlook it should have been a successful room but the trail of tottenham court road was upon it he could almost visualize the motorvans of messrs shoolbred and messrs
maple arriving at the door and depositing this chair those varnished bookcases that writingtable
the table recalled mrs honeychurchs letter
he did not want to read that letterhis temptations never lay in that direction but he worried about it none the less
it was his own fault that she was discussing him with his mother he had wanted her support in his third attempt to win lucy he wanted to feel that others no matter who they were agreed with him and so he had asked their permission
mrs honeychurch had been civil but obtuse in essentials while as for freddyhe is only a boy he reflected
i represent all that he despises
why should he want me for a brotherinlaw  the honeychurches were a worthy family but he began to realize that lucy was of another clay and perhapshe did not put it very definitelyhe ought to introduce her into more congenial circles as soon as possible
mr
beebe said the maid and the new rector of summer street was shown in he had at once started on friendly relations owing to lucys praise of him in her letters from florence
cecil greeted him rather critically
ive come for tea mr vyse
do you suppose that i shall get it  i should say so
food is the thing one does get heredont sit in that chair young honeychurch has left a bone in it  pfui  i know said cecil
i know
i cant think why mrs honeychurch allows it  for cecil considered the bone and the maples furniture separately he did not realize that taken together they kindled the room into the life that he desired
ive come for tea and for gossip
isnt this news  news
i dont understand you said cecil
news  mr beebe whose news was of a very different nature prattled forward
i met sir harry otway as i came up i have every reason to hope that i am first in the field
he has bought cissie and albert from mr flack  has he indeed said cecil trying to recover himself
into what a grotesque mistake had he fallen
was it likely that a clergyman and a gentleman would refer to his engagement in a manner so flippant
but his stiffness remained and though he asked who cissie and albert might be he still thought mr beebe rather a bounder
unpardonable question
to have stopped a week at windy corner and not to have met cissie and albert the semidetached villas that have been run up opposite the church
ill set mrs honeychurch after you  im shockingly stupid over local affairs said the young man languidly
i cant even remember the difference between a parish council and a local government board
perhaps there is no difference or perhaps those arent the right names
i only go into the country to see my friends and to enjoy the scenery
it is very remiss of me
italy and london are the only places where i dont feel to exist on sufferance  mr beebe distressed at this heavy reception of cissie and albert determined to shift the subject
let me see mr vysei forgetwhat is your profession  i have no profession said cecil
it is another example of my decadence
my attitudequite an indefensible oneis that so long as i am no trouble to any one i have a right to do as i like
i know i ought to be getting money out of people or devoting myself to things i dont care a straw about but somehow ive not been able to begin  you are very fortunate said mr beebe
it is a wonderful opportunity the possession of leisure  his voice was rather parochial but he did not quite see his way to answering naturally
he felt as all who have regular occupation must feel that others should have it also
i am glad that you approve
i darent face the healthy personfor example freddy honeychurch  oh freddys a good sort isnt he  admirable
the sort who has made england what she is  cecil wondered at himself
why on this day of all others was he so hopelessly contrary
he tried to get right by inquiring effusively after mr beebes mother an old lady for whom he had no particular regard
then he flattered the clergyman praised his liberalmindedness his enlightened attitude towards philosophy and science
where are the others said mr beebe at last i insist on extracting tea before evening service  i suppose anne never told them you were here
in this house one is so coached in the servants the day one arrives
the fault of anne is that she begs your pardon when she hears you perfectly and kicks the chairlegs with her feet
the faults of maryi forget the faults of mary but they are very grave
shall we look in the garden  i know the faults of mary
she leaves the dustpans standing on the stairs  the fault of euphemia is that she will not simply will not chop the suet sufficiently small  they both laughed and things began to go better
the faults of freddy cecil continued
ah he has too many
no one but his mother can remember the faults of freddy
try the faults of miss honeychurch they are not innumerable  she has none said the young man with grave sincerity
i quite agree
at present she has none  at present  im not cynical
im only thinking of my pet theory about miss honeychurch
does it seem reasonable that she should play so wonderfully and live so quietly
i suspect that one day she will be wonderful in both
the watertight compartments in her will break down and music and life will mingle
then we shall have her heroically good heroically badtoo heroic perhaps to be good or bad  cecil found his companion interesting
and at present you think her not wonderful as far as life goes  well i must say ive only seen her at tunbridge wells where she was not wonderful and at florence
since i came to summer street she has been away
you saw her didnt you at rome and in the alps
oh i forgot of course you knew her before
no she wasnt wonderful in florence either but i kept on expecting that she would be  in what way  conversation had become agreeable to them and they were pacing up and down the terrace
i could as easily tell you what tune shell play next
there was simply the sense that she had found wings and meant to use them
i can show you a beautiful picture in my italian diary miss honeychurch as a kite miss bartlett holding the string
picture number two the string breaks  the sketch was in his diary but it had been made afterwards when he viewed things artistically
at the time he had given surreptitious tugs to the string himself
but the string never broke  no
i mightnt have seen miss honeychurch rise but i should certainly have heard miss bartlett fall  it has broken now said the young man in low vibrating tones
immediately he realized that of all the conceited ludicrous contemptible ways of announcing an engagement this was the worst
he cursed his love of metaphor had he suggested that he was a star and that lucy was soaring up to reach him
broken
what do you mean  i meant said cecil stiffly that she is going to marry me  the clergyman was conscious of some bitter disappointment which he could not keep out of his voice
i am sorry i must apologize
i had no idea you were intimate with her or i should never have talked in this flippant superficial way
mr vyse you ought to have stopped me and down the garden he saw lucy herself yes he was disappointed
cecil who naturally preferred congratulations to apologies drew down his mouth at the corners
was this the reception his action would get from the world
of course he despised the world as a whole every thoughtful man should it is almost a test of refinement
but he was sensitive to the successive particles of it which he encountered
occasionally he could be quite crude
i am sorry i have given you a shock he said dryly
i fear that lucys choice does not meet with your approval  not that
but you ought to have stopped me
i know miss honeychurch only a little as time goes
perhaps i oughtnt to have discussed her so freely with any one certainly not with you  you are conscious of having said something indiscreet  mr beebe pulled himself together
really mr vyse had the art of placing one in the most tiresome positions
he was driven to use the prerogatives of his profession
no i have said nothing indiscreet
i foresaw at florence that her quiet uneventful childhood must end and it has ended
i realized dimly enough that she might take some momentous step
she has taken it
she has learntyou will let me talk freely as i have begun freelyshe has learnt what it is to love the greatest lesson some people will tell you that our earthly life provides it was now time for him to wave his hat at the approaching trio
he did not omit to do so
she has learnt through you and if his voice was still clerical it was now also sincere let it be your care that her knowledge is profitable to her  grazie tante said cecil who did not like parsons
have you heard shouted mrs honeychurch as she toiled up the sloping garden
oh mr beebe have you heard the news  freddy now full of geniality whistled the wedding march
youth seldom criticizes the accomplished fact
indeed i have he cried
he looked at lucy
in her presence he could not act the parson any longerat all events not without apology
mrs
honeychurch im going to do what i am always supposed to do but generally im too shy
i want to invoke every kind of blessing on them grave and gay great and small
i want them all their lives to be supremely good and supremely happy as husband and wife as father and mother
and now i want my tea  you only asked for it just in time the lady retorted
how dare you be serious at windy corner  he took his tone from her
there was no more heavy beneficence no more attempts to dignify the situation with poetry or the scriptures
none of them dared or was able to be serious any more
an engagement is so potent a thing that sooner or later it reduces all who speak of it to this state of cheerful awe
away from it in the solitude of their rooms mr beebe and even freddy might again be critical
but in its presence and in the presence of each other they were sincerely hilarious
it has a strange power for it compels not only the lips but the very heart
the chief parallel to compare one great thing with anotheris the power over us of a temple of some alien creed
standing outside we deride or oppose it or at the most feel sentimental
inside though the saints and gods are not ours we become true believers in case any true believer should be present
so it was that after the gropings and the misgivings of the afternoon they pulled themselves together and settled down to a very pleasant teaparty
if they were hypocrites they did not know it and their hypocrisy had every chance of setting and of becoming true
anne putting down each plate as if it were a wedding present stimulated them greatly
they could not lag behind that smile of hers which she gave them ere she kicked the drawingroom door
mr beebe chirruped
freddy was at his wittiest referring to cecil as the fiascofamily honoured pun on fiance
mrs honeychurch amusing and portly promised well as a motherinlaw
as for lucy and cecil for whom the temple had been built they also joined in the merry ritual but waited as earnest worshippers should for the disclosure of some holier shrine of joy
chapter ix lucy as a work of art  a few days after the engagement was announced mrs honeychurch made lucy and her fiasco come to a little gardenparty in the neighbourhood for naturally she wanted to show people that her daughter was marrying a presentable man
cecil was more than presentable he looked distinguished and it was very pleasant to see his slim figure keeping step with lucy and his long fair face responding when lucy spoke to him
people congratulated mrs honeychurch which is i believe a social blunder but it pleased her and she introduced cecil rather indiscriminately to some stuffy dowagers
at tea a misfortune took place a cup of coffee was upset over lucys figured silk and though lucy feigned indifference her mother feigned nothing of the sort but dragged her indoors to have the frock treated by a sympathetic maid
they were gone some time and cecil was left with the dowagers
when they returned he was not as pleasant as he had been
do you go to much of this sort of thing he asked when they were driving home
oh now and then said lucy who had rather enjoyed herself
is it typical of country society  i suppose so
mother would it be  plenty of society said mrs honeychurch who was trying to remember the hang of one of the dresses
seeing that her thoughts were elsewhere cecil bent towards lucy and said  to me it seemed perfectly appalling disastrous portentous  i am so sorry that you were stranded  not that but the congratulations
it is so disgusting the way an engagement is regarded as public propertya kind of waste place where every outsider may shoot his vulgar sentiment
all those old women smirking  one has to go through it i suppose
they wont notice us so much next time  but my point is that their whole attitude is wrong
an engagementhorrid word in the first placeis a private matter and should be treated as such  yet the smirking old women however wrong individually were racially correct
the spirit of the generations had smiled through them rejoicing in the engagement of cecil and lucy because it promised the continuance of life on earth
to cecil and lucy it promised something quite differentpersonal love
hence cecils irritation and lucys belief that his irritation was just
how tiresome she said
couldnt you have escaped to tennis  i dont play tennisat least not in public
the neighbourhood is deprived of the romance of me being athletic
such romance as i have is that of the inglese italianato  inglese italianato  e un diavolo incarnato
you know the proverb  she did not
nor did it seem applicable to a young man who had spent a quiet winter in rome with his mother
but cecil since his engagement had taken to affect a cosmopolitan naughtiness which he was far from possessing
well said he i cannot help it if they do disapprove of me
there are certain irremovable barriers between myself and them and i must accept them  we all have our limitations i suppose said wise lucy
sometimes they are forced on us though said cecil who saw from her remark that she did not quite understand his position
how  it makes a difference doesnt it whether we fully fence ourselves in or whether we are fenced out by the barriers of others  she thought a moment and agreed that it did make a difference
difference cried mrs honeychurch suddenly alert
i dont see any difference
fences are fences especially when they are in the same place  we were speaking of motives said cecil on whom the interruption jarred
my dear cecil look here she spread out her knees and perched her cardcase on her lap
this is me
thats windy corner
the rest of the pattern is the other people
motives are all very well but the fence comes here  we werent talking of real fences said lucy laughing
oh i see dearpoetry  she leant placidly back
cecil wondered why lucy had been amused
i tell you who has no fences as you call them she said and thats mr beebe  a parson fenceless would mean a parson defenceless  lucy was slow to follow what people said but quick enough to detect what they meant
she missed cecils epigram but grasped the feeling that prompted it
dont you like mr beebe she asked thoughtfully
i never said so he cried
i consider him far above the average
i only denied and he swept off on the subject of fences again and was brilliant
now a clergyman that i do hate said she wanting to say something sympathetic a clergyman that does have fences and the most dreadful ones is mr
eager the english chaplain at florence
he was truly insincerenot merely the manner unfortunate
he was a snob and so conceited and he did say such unkind things  what sort of things  there was an old man at the bertolini whom he said had murdered his wife  perhaps he had  no  why no  he was such a nice old man im sure  cecil laughed at her feminine inconsequence
well i did try to sift the thing
mr
eager would never come to the point
he prefers it vaguesaid the old man had practically murdered his wifehad murdered her in the sight of god  hush dear said mrs honeychurch absently
but isnt it intolerable that a person whom were told to imitate should go round spreading slander
it was i believe chiefly owing to him that the old man was dropped
people pretended he was vulgar but he certainly wasnt that  poor old man
what was his name  harris said lucy glibly
lets hope that mrs harris there warnt no sich person said her mother
cecil nodded intelligently
isnt mr
eager a parson of the cultured type he asked
i dont know
i hate him
ive heard him lecture on giotto
i hate him
nothing can hide a petty nature
i hate him  my goodness gracious me child said mrs honeychurch
youll blow my head off
whatever is there to shout over
i forbid you and cecil to hate any more clergymen  he smiled
there was indeed something rather incongruous in lucys moral outburst over mr
eager
it was as if one should see the leonardo on the ceiling of the sistine
he longed to hint to her that not here lay her vocation that a womans power and charm reside in mystery not in muscular rant
but possibly rant is a sign of vitality it mars the beautiful creature but shows that she is alive
after a moment he contemplated her flushed face and excited gestures with a certain approval
he forebore to repress the sources of youth
naturesimplest of topics he thoughtlay around them
he praised the pinewoods the deep lasts of bracken the crimson leaves that spotted the hurtbushes the serviceable beauty of the turnpike road
the outdoor world was not very familiar to him and occasionally he went wrong in a question of fact
mrs honeychurchs mouth twitched when he spoke of the perpetual green of the larch
i count myself a lucky person he concluded when im in london i feel i could never live out of it
when im in the country i feel the same about the country
after all i do believe that birds and trees and the sky are the most wonderful things in life and that the people who live amongst them must be the best
its true that in nine cases out of ten they dont seem to notice anything
the country gentleman and the country labourer are each in their way the most depressing of companions
yet they may have a tacit sympathy with the workings of nature which is denied to us of the town
do you feel that mrs honeychurch  mrs honeychurch started and smiled
she had not been attending
cecil who was rather crushed on the front seat of the victoria felt irritable and determined not to say anything interesting again
lucy had not attended either
her brow was wrinkled and she still looked furiously crossthe result he concluded of too much moral gymnastics
it was sad to see her thus blind to the beauties of an august wood
come down o maid from yonder mountain height he quoted and touched her knee with his own
she flushed again and said what height  come down o maid from yonder mountain height what pleasure lives in height the shepherd sang
in height and in the splendour of the hills let us take mrs honeychurchs advice and hate clergymen no more
whats this place  summer street of course said lucy and roused herself
the woods had opened to leave space for a sloping triangular meadow
pretty cottages lined it on two sides and the upper and third side was occupied by a new stone church expensively simple a charming shingled spire
mr beebes house was near the church
in height it scarcely exceeded the cottages
some great mansions were at hand but they were hidden in the trees
the scene suggested a swiss alp rather than the shrine and centre of a leisured world and was marred only by two ugly little villasthe villas that had competed with cecils engagement having been acquired by sir harry otway the very afternoon that lucy had been acquired by cecil
cissie was the name of one of these villas albert of the other
these titles were not only picked out in shaded gothic on the garden gates but appeared a second time on the porches where they followed the semicircular curve of the entrance arch in block capitals
albert  was inhabited
his tortured garden was bright with geraniums and lobelias and polished shells
his little windows were chastely swathed in nottingham lace
cissie was to let
three noticeboards belonging to dorking agents lolled on her fence and announced the not surprising fact
her paths were already weedy her pockethandkerchief of a lawn was yellow with dandelions
the place is ruined said the ladies mechanically
summer street will never be the same again  as the carriage passed cissies door opened and a gentleman came out of her
stop cried mrs honeychurch touching the coachman with her parasol
heres sir harry
now we shall know
sir harry pull those things down at once  sir harry otwaywho need not be describedcame to the carriage and said mrs
honeychurch i meant to
i cant i really cant turn out miss flack  am i not always right
she ought to have gone before the contract was signed
does she still live rent free as she did in her nephews time  but what can i do he lowered his voice
an old lady so very vulgar and almost bedridden  turn her out said cecil bravely
sir harry sighed and looked at the villas mournfully
he had had full warning of mr flacks intentions and might have bought the plot before building commenced but he was apathetic and dilatory
he had known summer street for so many years that he could not imagine it being spoilt
not till mrs flack had laid the foundation stone and the apparition of red and cream brick began to rise did he take alarm
he called on mr flack the local buildera most reasonable and respectful manwho agreed that tiles would have made more artistic roof but pointed out that slates were cheaper
he ventured to differ however about the corinthian columns which were to cling like leeches to the frames of the bow windows saying that for his part he liked to relieve the facade by a bit of decoration
sir harry hinted that a column if possible should be structural as well as decorative
mr flack replied that all the columns had been ordered adding and all the capitals differentone with dragons in the foliage another approaching to the ionian style another introducing mrs flacks initialseveryone different for he had read his ruskin
he built his villas according to his desire and not until he had inserted an immovable aunt into one of them did sir harry buy
this futile and unprofitable transaction filled the knight with sadness as he leant on mrs honeychurchs carriage
he had failed in his duties to the countryside and the countryside was laughing at him as well
he had spent money and yet summer street was spoilt as much as ever
all he could do now was to find a desirable tenant for cissiesome one really desirable
the rent is absurdly low he told them and perhaps i am an easy landlord
but it is such an awkward size
it is too large for the peasant class and too small for any one the least like ourselves  cecil had been hesitating whether he should despise the villas or despise sir harry for despising them
the latter impulse seemed the more fruitful
you ought to find a tenant at once he said maliciously
it would be a perfect paradise for a bank clerk  exactly said sir harry excitedly
that is exactly what i fear mr vyse
it will attract the wrong type of people
the train service has improveda fatal improvement to my mind
and what are five miles from a station in these days of bicycles  rather a strenuous clerk it would be said lucy
cecil who had his full share of mediaeval mischievousness replied that the physique of the lower middle classes was improving at a most appalling rate
she saw that he was laughing at their harmless neighbour and roused herself to stop him
sir harry she exclaimed i have an idea
how would you like spinsters  my dear lucy it would be splendid
do you know any such  yes i met them abroad  gentlewomen he asked tentatively
yes indeed and at the present moment homeless
i heard from them last weekmiss teresa and miss catharine alan
im really not joking
they are quite the right people
mr beebe knows them too
may i tell them to write to you  indeed you may he cried
here we are with the difficulty solved already
how delightful it is
extra facilitiesplease tell them they shall have extra facilities for i shall have no agents fees
oh the agents
the appalling people they have sent me
one woman when i wrotea tactful letter you knowasking her to explain her social position to me replied that she would pay the rent in advance
as if one cares about that
and several references i took up were most unsatisfactorypeople swindlers or not respectable
and oh the deceit
i have seen a good deal of the seamy side this last week
the deceit of the most promising people
my dear lucy the deceit  she nodded
my advice put in mrs honeychurch is to have nothing to do with lucy and her decayed gentlewomen at all
i know the type
preserve me from people who have seen better days and bring heirlooms with them that make the house smell stuffy
its a sad thing but id far rather let to someone who is going up in the world than to someone who has come down  i think i follow you said sir harry but it is as you say a very sad thing  the misses alan arent that cried lucy
yes they are said cecil
i havent met them but i should say they were a highly unsuitable addition to the neighbourhood  dont listen to him sir harryhes tiresome  its i who am tiresome he replied
i oughtnt to come with my troubles to young people
but really i am so worried and lady otway will only say that i cannot be too careful which is quite true but no real help  then may i write to my misses alan  please  but his eye wavered when mrs honeychurch exclaimed  beware
they are certain to have canaries
sir harry beware of canaries they spit the seed out through the bars of the cages and then the mice come
beware of women altogether
only let to a man  really he murmured gallantly though he saw the wisdom of her remark
men dont gossip over teacups
if they get drunk theres an end of themthey lie down comfortably and sleep it off
if theyre vulgar they somehow keep it to themselves
it doesnt spread so
give me a manof course provided hes clean  sir harry blushed
neither he nor cecil enjoyed these open compliments to their sex
even the exclusion of the dirty did not leave them much distinction
he suggested that mrs honeychurch if she had time should descend from the carriage and inspect cissie for herself
she was delighted
nature had intended her to be poor and to live in such a house
domestic arrangements always attracted her especially when they were on a small scale
cecil pulled lucy back as she followed her mother
mrs
honeychurch he said what if we two walk home and leave you  certainly was her cordial reply
sir harry likewise seemed almost too glad to get rid of them
he beamed at them knowingly said aha
young people young people and then hastened to unlock the house
hopeless vulgarian exclaimed cecil almost before they were out of earshot
oh cecil  i cant help it
it would be wrong not to loathe that man  he isnt clever but really he is nice  no lucy he stands for all that is bad in country life
in london he would keep his place
he would belong to a brainless club and his wife would give brainless dinner parties
but down here he acts the little god with his gentility and his patronage and his sham aesthetics and everyoneeven your motheris taken in  all that you say is quite true said lucy though she felt discouraged
i wonder whetherwhether it matters so very much  it matters supremely
sir harry is the essence of that gardenparty
oh goodness how cross i feel
how i do hope hell get some vulgar tenant in that villasome woman so really vulgar that hell notice it
gentlefolks
ugh
with his bald head and retreating chin
but lets forget him  this lucy was glad enough to do
if cecil disliked sir harry otway and mr beebe what guarantee was there that the people who really mattered to her would escape
for instance freddy
freddy was neither clever nor subtle nor beautiful and what prevented cecil from saying any minute it would be wrong not to loathe freddy
and what would she reply
further than freddy she did not go but he gave her anxiety enough
she could only assure herself that cecil had known freddy some time and that they had always got on pleasantly except perhaps during the last few days which was an accident perhaps
which way shall we go she asked him
naturesimplest of topics she thoughtwas around them
summer street lay deep in the woods and she had stopped where a footpath diverged from the highroad
are there two ways  perhaps the road is more sensible as were got up smart  id rather go through the wood said cecil with that subdued irritation that she had noticed in him all the afternoon
why is it lucy that you always say the road
do you know that you have never once been with me in the fields or the wood since we were engaged  havent i
the wood then said lucy startled at his queerness but pretty sure that he would explain later it was not his habit to leave her in doubt as to his meaning
she led the way into the whispering pines and sure enough he did explain before they had gone a dozen yards
i had got an ideai dare say wronglythat you feel more at home with me in a room  a room she echoed hopelessly bewildered
yes
or at the most in a garden or on a road
never in the real country like this  oh cecil whatever do you mean
i have never felt anything of the sort
you talk as if i was a kind of poetess sort of person  i dont know that you arent
i connect you with a viewa certain type of view
why shouldnt you connect me with a room  she reflected a moment and then said laughing  do you know that youre right
i do
i must be a poetess after all
when i think of you its always as in a room
how funny  to her surprise he seemed annoyed
a drawingroom pray
with no view  yes with no view i fancy
why not  id rather he said reproachfully that you connected me with the open air  she said again oh cecil whatever do you mean  as no explanation was forthcoming she shook off the subject as too difficult for a girl and led him further into the wood pausing every now and then at some particularly beautiful or familiar combination of the trees
she had known the wood between summer street and windy corner ever since she could walk alone she had played at losing freddy in it when freddy was a purplefaced baby and though she had been to italy it had lost none of its charm
presently they came to a little clearing among the pinesanother tiny green alp solitary this time and holding in its bosom a shallow pool
she exclaimed the sacred lake  why do you call it that  i cant remember why
i suppose it comes out of some book
its only a puddle now but you see that stream going through it
well a good deal of water comes down after heavy rains and cant get away at once and the pool becomes quite large and beautiful
then freddy used to bathe there
he is very fond of it  and you  he meant are you fond of it but she answered dreamily i bathed here too till i was found out
then there was a row  at another time he might have been shocked for he had depths of prudishness within him
but now
with his momentary cult of the fresh air he was delighted at her admirable simplicity
he looked at her as she stood by the pools edge
she was got up smart as she phrased it and she reminded him of some brilliant flower that has no leaves of its own but blooms abruptly out of a world of green
who found you out  charlotte she murmured
she was stopping with us
charlottecharlotte  poor girl  she smiled gravely
a certain scheme from which hitherto he had shrunk now appeared practical
lucy  yes i suppose we ought to be going was her reply
lucy i want to ask something of you that i have never asked before  at the serious note in his voice she stepped frankly and kindly towards him
what cecil  hitherto nevernot even that day on the lawn when you agreed to marry me  he became selfconscious and kept glancing round to see if they were observed
his courage had gone
yes  up to now i have never kissed you  she was as scarlet as if he had put the thing most indelicately
nomore you have she stammered
then i ask youmay i now  of course you may cecil
you might before
i cant run at you you know  at that supreme moment he was conscious of nothing but absurdities
her reply was inadequate
she gave such a businesslike lift to her veil
as he approached her he found time to wish that he could recoil
as he touched her his gold pincenez became dislodged and was flattened between them
such was the embrace
he considered with truth that it had been a failure
passion should believe itself irresistible
it should forget civility and consideration and all the other curses of a refined nature
above all it should never ask for leave where there is a right of way
why could he not do as any labourer or navvynay as any young man behind the counter would have done
he recast the scene
lucy was standing flowerlike by the water he rushed up and took her in his arms she rebuked him permitted him and revered him ever after for his manliness
for he believed that women revere men for their manliness
they left the pool in silence after this one salutation
he waited for her to make some remark which should show him her inmost thoughts
at last she spoke and with fitting gravity
emerson was the name not harris  what name  the old mans  what old man  that old man i told you about
the one mr
eager was so unkind to  he could not know that this was the most intimate conversation they had ever had
chapter x cecil as a humourist  the society out of which cecil proposed to rescue lucy was perhaps no very splendid affair yet it was more splendid than her antecedents entitled her to
her father a prosperous local solicitor had built windy corner as a speculation at the time the district was opening up and falling in love with his own creation had ended by living there himself
soon after his marriage the social atmosphere began to alter
other houses were built on the brow of that steep southern slope and others again among the pinetrees behind and northward on the chalk barrier of the downs
most of these houses were larger than windy corner and were filled by people who came not from the district but from london and who mistook the honeychurches for the remnants of an indigenous aristocracy
he was inclined to be frightened but his wife accepted the situation without either pride or humility
i cannot think what people are doing she would say but it is extremely fortunate for the children she called everywhere her calls were returned with enthusiasm and by the time people found out that she was not exactly of their milieu they liked her and it did not seem to matter
when mr honeychurch died he had the satisfactionwhich few honest solicitors despiseof leaving his family rooted in the best society obtainable
the best obtainable
certainly many of the immigrants were rather dull and lucy realized this more vividly since her return from italy
hitherto she had accepted their ideals without questioningtheir kindly affluence their inexplosive religion their dislike of paperbags orangepeel and broken bottles
a radical out and out she learnt to speak with horror of suburbia
life so far as she troubled to conceive it was a circle of rich pleasant people with identical interests and identical foes
in this circle one thought married and died
outside it were poverty and vulgarity for ever trying to enter just as the london fog tries to enter the pinewoods pouring through the gaps in the northern hills
but in italy where any one who chooses may warm himself in equality as in the sun this conception of life vanished
her senses expanded she felt that there was no one whom she might not get to like that social barriers were irremovable doubtless but not particularly high
you jump over them just as you jump into a peasants oliveyard in the apennines and he is glad to see you
she returned with new eyes
so did cecil but italy had quickened cecil not to tolerance but to irritation
he saw that the local society was narrow but instead of saying does that very much matter he rebelled and tried to substitute for it the society he called broad
he did not realize that lucy had consecrated her environment by the thousand little civilities that create a tenderness in time and that though her eyes saw its defects her heart refused to despise it entirely
nor did he realize a more important pointthat if she was too great for this society she was too great for all society and had reached the stage where personal intercourse would alone satisfy her
a rebel she was but not of the kind he understooda rebel who desired not a wider dwellingroom but equality beside the man she loved
for italy was offering her the most priceless of all possessionsher own soul
playing bumblepuppy with minnie beebe niece to the rector and aged thirteenan ancient and most honourable game which consists in striking tennisballs high into the air so that they fall over the net and immoderately bounce some hit mrs honeychurch others are lost
the sentence is confused but the better illustrates lucys state of mind for she was trying to talk to mr beebe at the same time
oh it has been such a nuisancefirst he then theyno one knowing what they wanted and everyone so tiresome  but they really are coming now said mr beebe
i wrote to miss teresa a few days agoshe was wondering how often the butcher called and my reply of once a month must have impressed her favourably
they are coming
i heard from them this morning
i shall hate those miss alans mrs honeychurch cried
just because theyre old and silly ones expected to say how sweet i hate their ifing and buting and anding
and poor lucyserve her rightworn to a shadow  mr beebe watched the shadow springing and shouting over the tenniscourt
cecil was absentone did not play bumblepuppy when he was there
well if they are comingno minnie not saturn saturn was a tennisball whose skin was partially unsewn
when in motion his orb was encircled by a ring
if they are coming sir harry will let them move in before the twentyninth and he will cross out the clause about whitewashing the ceilings because it made them nervous and put in the fair wear and tear onethat doesnt count
i told you not saturn  saturns all right for bumblepuppy cried freddy joining them
minnie dont you listen to her  saturn doesnt bounce  saturn bounces enough  no he doesnt  well he bounces better than the beautiful white devil  hush dear said mrs honeychurch
but look at lucycomplaining of saturn and all the times got the beautiful white devil in her hand ready to plug it in
thats right minnie go for herget her over the shins with the racquetget her over the shins  lucy fell the beautiful white devil rolled from her hand
mr beebe picked it up and said the name of this ball is vittoria corombona please but his correction passed unheeded
freddy possessed to a high degree the power of lashing little girls to fury and in half a minute he had transformed minnie from a wellmannered child into a howling wilderness
up in the house cecil heard them and though he was full of entertaining news he did not come down to impart it in case he got hurt
he was not a coward and bore necessary pain as well as any man
but he hated the physical violence of the young
how right it was
sure enough it ended in a cry
i wish the miss alans could see this observed mr beebe just as lucy who was nursing the injured minnie was in turn lifted off her feet by her brother
who are the miss alans freddy panted
they have taken cissie villa  that wasnt the name  here his foot slipped and they all fell most agreeably on to the grass
an interval elapses
wasnt what name asked lucy with her brothers head in her lap
alan wasnt the name of the people sir harrys let to  nonsense freddy
you know nothing about it  nonsense yourself
ive this minute seen him
he said to me ahem
honeychurchfreddy was an indifferent mimicahem
ahem
i have at last procured really deesirerebel tenants i said ooray old boy and slapped him on the back  exactly
the miss alans  rather not
more like anderson  oh good gracious there isnt going to be another muddle mrs honeychurch exclaimed
do you notice lucy im always right
i said dont interfere with cissie villa
im always right
im quite uneasy at being always right so often  its only another muddle of freddys
freddy doesnt even know the name of the people he pretends have taken it instead  yes i do
ive got it
emerson  what name  emerson
ill bet you anything you like  what a weathercock sir harry is said lucy quietly
i wish i had never bothered over it at all  then she lay on her back and gazed at the cloudless sky
mr beebe whose opinion of her rose daily whispered to his niece that that was the proper way to behave if any little thing went wrong
meanwhile the name of the new tenants had diverted mrs honeychurch from the contemplation of her own abilities
emerson freddy
do you know what emersons they are  i dont know whether theyre any emersons retorted freddy who was democratic
like his sister and like most young people he was naturally attracted by the idea of equality and the undeniable fact that there are different kinds of emersons annoyed him beyond measure
i trust they are the right sort of person
all right lucyshe was sitting up againi see you looking down your nose and thinking your mothers a snob
but there is a right sort and a wrong sort and its affectation to pretend there isnt  emersons a common enough name lucy remarked
she was gazing sideways
seated on a promontory herself she could see the pineclad promontories descending one beyond another into the weald
the further one descended the garden the more glorious was this lateral view
i was merely going to remark freddy that i trusted they were no relations of emerson the philosopher a most trying man
pray does that satisfy you  oh yes he grumbled
and you will be satisfied too for theyre friends of cecil soelaborate ironyyou and the other country families will be able to call in perfect safety  cecil exclaimed lucy
dont be rude dear said his mother placidly
lucy dont screech
its a new bad habit youre getting into  but has cecil  friends of cecils he repeated and so really deesirerebel
ahem
honeychurch i have just telegraphed to them  she got up from the grass
it was hard on lucy
mr beebe sympathized with her very much
while she believed that her snub about the miss alans came from sir harry otway she had borne it like a good girl
she might well screech when she heard that it came partly from her lover
mr vyse was a teasesomething worse than a tease he took a malicious pleasure in thwarting people
the clergyman knowing this looked at miss honeychurch with more than his usual kindness
when she exclaimed but cecils emersonsthey cant possibly be the same onesthere is that he did not consider that the exclamation was strange but saw in it an opportunity of diverting the conversation while she recovered her composure
he diverted it as follows  the emersons who were at florence do you mean
no i dont suppose it will prove to be them
it is probably a long cry from them to friends of mr vyses
oh mrs honeychurch the oddest people
the queerest people
for our part we liked them didnt we he appealed to lucy
there was a great scene over some violets
they picked violets and filled all the vases in the room of these very miss alans who have failed to come to cissie villa
poor little ladies
so shocked and so pleased
it used to be one of miss catharines great stories
my dear sister loves flowers it began
they found the whole room a mass of bluevases and jugsand the story ends with so ungentlemanly and yet so beautiful it is all very difficult
yes i always connect those florentine emersons with violets  fiascos done you this time remarked freddy not seeing that his sisters face was very red
she could not recover herself
mr beebe saw it and continued to divert the conversation
these particular emersons consisted of a father and a sonthe son a goodly if not a good young man not a fool i fancy but very immaturepessimism et cetera
our special joy was the fathersuch a sentimental darling and people declared he had murdered his wife  in his normal state mr beebe would never have repeated such gossip but he was trying to shelter lucy in her little trouble
he repeated any rubbish that came into his head
murdered his wife said mrs honeychurch
lucy dont desert usgo on playing bumblepuppy
really the pension bertolini must have been the oddest place
thats the second murderer ive heard of as being there
whatever was charlotte doing to stop
bytheby we really must ask charlotte here some time  mr beebe could recall no second murderer
he suggested that his hostess was mistaken
at the hint of opposition she warmed
she was perfectly sure that there had been a second tourist of whom the same story had been told
the name escaped her
what was the name
oh what was the name
she clasped her knees for the name
something in thackeray
she struck her matronly forehead
lucy asked her brother whether cecil was in
oh dont go he cried and tried to catch her by the ankles
i must go she said gravely
dont be silly
you always overdo it when you play  as she left them her mothers shout of harris shivered the tranquil air and reminded her that she had told a lie and had never put it right
such a senseless lie too yet it shattered her nerves and made her connect these emersons friends of cecils with a pair of nondescript tourists
hitherto truth had come to her naturally
she saw that for the future she must be more vigilant and beabsolutely truthful
well at all events she must not tell lies
she hurried up the garden still flushed with shame
a word from cecil would soothe her she was sure
cecil  hullo he called and leant out of the smokingroom window
he seemed in high spirits
i was hoping youd come
i heard you all beargardening but theres better fun up here
i even i have won a great victory for the comic muse
george merediths rightthe cause of comedy and the cause of truth are really the same and i even i have found tenants for the distressful cissie villa
dont be angry
dont be angry
youll forgive me when you hear it all  he looked very attractive when his face was bright and he dispelled her ridiculous forebodings at once
i have heard she said
freddy has told us
naughty cecil
i suppose i must forgive you
just think of all the trouble i took for nothing
certainly the miss alans are a little tiresome and id rather have nice friends of yours
but you oughtnt to tease one so  friends of mine he laughed
but lucy the whole joke is to come
come here but she remained standing where she was
do you know where i met these desirable tenants
in the national gallery when i was up to see my mother last week  what an odd place to meet people she said nervously
i dont quite understand  in the umbrian room
absolute strangers
they were admiring luca signorelliof course quite stupidly
however we got talking and they refreshed me not a little
they had been to italy  but cecil proceeded hilariously
in the course of conversation they said that they wanted a country cottagethe father to live there the son to run down for weekends
i thought what a chance of scoring off sir harry and i took their address and a london reference found they werent actual blackguardsit was great sportand wrote to him making out  cecil
no its not fair
ive probably met them before  he bore her down
perfectly fair
anything is fair that punishes a snob
that old man will do the neighbourhood a world of good
sir harry is too disgusting with his decayed gentlewomen i meant to read him a lesson some time
no lucy the classes ought to mix and before long youll agree with me
there ought to be intermarriageall sorts of things
i believe in democracy  no you dont she snapped
you dont know what the word means  he stared at her and felt again that she had failed to be leonardesque
no you dont  her face was inartisticthat of a peevish virago
it isnt fair cecil
i blame youi blame you very much indeed
you had no business to undo my work about the miss alans and make me look ridiculous
you call it scoring off sir harry but do you realize that it is all at my expense
i consider it most disloyal of you  she left him
temper he thought raising his eyebrows
no it was worse than tempersnobbishness
as long as lucy thought that his own smart friends were supplanting the miss alans she had not minded
he perceived that these new tenants might be of value educationally
he would tolerate the father and draw out the son who was silent
in the interests of the comic muse and of truth he would bring them to windy corner
chapter xi in mrs vyses wellappointed flat  the comic muse though able to look after her own interests did not disdain the assistance of mr vyse
his idea of bringing the emersons to windy corner struck her as decidedly good and she carried through the negotiations without a hitch
sir harry otway signed the agreement met mr emerson who was duly disillusioned
the miss alans were duly offended and wrote a dignified letter to lucy whom they held responsible for the failure
mr beebe planned pleasant moments for the newcomers and told mrs honeychurch that freddy must call on them as soon as they arrived
indeed so ample was the muses equipment that she permitted mr harris never a very robust criminal to droop his head to be forgotten and to die
lucyto descend from bright heaven to earth whereon there are shadows because there are hillslucy was at first plunged into despair but settled after a little thought that it did not matter the very least
now that she was engaged the emersons would scarcely insult her and were welcome into the neighbourhood
and cecil was welcome to bring whom he would into the neighbourhood
therefore cecil was welcome to bring the emersons into the neighbourhood
but as i say this took a little thinking andso illogical are girlsthe event remained rather greater and rather more dreadful than it should have done
she was glad that a visit to mrs vyse now fell due the tenants moved into cissie villa while she was safe in the london flat
cecilcecil darling she whispered the evening she arrived and crept into his arms
cecil too became demonstrative
he saw that the needful fire had been kindled in lucy
at last she longed for attention as a woman should and looked up to him because he was a man
so you do love me little thing he murmured
oh cecil i do i do
i dont know what i should do without you  several days passed
then she had a letter from miss bartlett
a coolness had sprung up between the two cousins and they had not corresponded since they parted in august
the coolness dated from what charlotte would call the flight to rome and in rome it had increased amazingly
for the companion who is merely uncongenial in the mediaeval world becomes exasperating in the classical
charlotte unselfish in the forum would have tried a sweeter temper than lucys and once in the baths of caracalla they had doubted whether they could continue their tour
lucy had said she would join the vysesmrs vyse was an acquaintance of her mother so there was no impropriety in the plan and miss bartlett had replied that she was quite used to being abandoned suddenly
finally nothing happened but the coolness remained and for lucy was even increased when she opened the letter and read as follows
it had been forwarded from windy corner
tunbridge wells  september
dearest lucia  i have news of you at last
miss lavish has been bicycling in your parts but was not sure whether a call would be welcome
puncturing her tire near summer street and it being mended while she sat very woebegone in that pretty churchyard she saw to her astonishment a door open opposite and the younger emerson man come out
he said his father had just taken the house
he said he did not know that you lived in the neighbourhood 
he never suggested giving eleanor a cup of tea
dear lucy i am much worried and i advise you to make a clean breast of his past behaviour to your mother freddy and mr vyse who will forbid him to enter the house etc
that was a great misfortune and i dare say you have told them already
mr vyse is so sensitive
i remember how i used to get on his nerves at rome
i am very sorry about it all and should not feel easy unless i warned you
believe me  your anxious and loving cousin  charlotte   lucy was much annoyed and replied as follows   beauchamp mansions sw
dear charlotte  many thanks for your warning
when mr emerson forgot himself on the mountain you made me promise not to tell mother because you said she would blame you for not being always with me
i have kept that promise and cannot possibly tell her now
i have said both to her and cecil that i met the emersons at florence and that they are respectable peoplewhich i do thinkand the reason that he offered miss lavish no tea was probably that he had none himself
she should have tried at the rectory
i cannot begin making a fuss at this stage
you must see that it would be too absurd
if the emersons heard i had complained of them they would think themselves of importance which is exactly what they are not
i like the old father and look forward to seeing him again
as for the son i am sorry for him when we meet rather than for myself
they are known to cecil who is very well and spoke of you the other day
we expect to be married in january
miss lavish cannot have told you much about me for i am not at windy corner at all but here
please do not put private outside your envelope again
no one opens my letters
yours affectionately  l
m honeychurch   secrecy has this disadvantage we lose the sense of proportion we cannot tell whether our secret is important or not
were lucy and her cousin closeted with a great thing which would destroy cecils life if he discovered it or with a little thing which he would laugh at
miss bartlett suggested the former
perhaps she was right
it had become a great thing now
left to herself lucy would have told her mother and her lover ingenuously and it would have remained a little thing
emerson not harris it was only that a few weeks ago
she tried to tell cecil even now when they were laughing about some beautiful lady who had smitten his heart at school
but her body behaved so ridiculously that she stopped
she and her secret stayed ten days longer in the deserted metropolis visiting the scenes they were to know so well later on
it did her no harm cecil thought to learn the framework of society while society itself was absent on the golflinks or the moors
the weather was cool and it did her no harm
in spite of the season mrs vyse managed to scrape together a dinnerparty consisting entirely of the grandchildren of famous people
the food was poor but the talk had a witty weariness that impressed the girl
one was tired of everything it seemed
one launched into enthusiasms only to collapse gracefully and pick oneself up amid sympathetic laughter
in this atmosphere the pension bertolini and windy corner appeared equally crude and lucy saw that her london career would estrange her a little from all that she had loved in the past
the grandchildren asked her to play the piano
she played schumann
now some beethoven called cecil when the querulous beauty of the music had died
she shook her head and played schumann again
the melody rose unprofitably magical
it broke it was resumed broken not marching once from the cradle to the grave
the sadness of the incompletethe sadness that is often life but should never be artthrobbed in its disjected phrases and made the nerves of the audience throb
not thus had she played on the little draped piano at the bertolini and too much schumann was not the remark that mr beebe had passed to himself when she returned
when the guests were gone and lucy had gone to bed mrs vyse paced up and down the drawingroom discussing her little party with her son
mrs vyse was a nice woman but her personality like many anothers had been swamped by london for it needs a strong head to live among many people
the too vast orb of her fate had crushed her and she had seen too many seasons too many cities too many men for her abilities and even with cecil she was mechanical and behaved as if he was not one son but so to speak a filial crowd
make lucy one of us she said looking round intelligently at the end of each sentence and straining her lips apart until she spoke again
lucy is becoming wonderfulwonderful  her music always was wonderful  yes but she is purging off the honeychurch taint most excellent honeychurches but you know what i mean
she is not always quoting servants or asking one how the pudding is made  italy has done it  perhaps she murmured thinking of the museum that represented italy to her
it is just possible
cecil mind you marry her next january
she is one of us already  but her music he exclaimed
the style of her
how she kept to schumann when like an idiot i wanted beethoven
schumann was right for this evening
schumann was the thing
do you know mother i shall have our children educated just like lucy
bring them up among honest country folks for freshness send them to italy for subtlety and thennot till thenlet them come to london
i dont believe in these london educations he broke off remembering that he had had one himself and concluded at all events not for women  make her one of us repeated mrs vyse and processed to bed
as she was dozing off a crythe cry of nightmarerang from lucys room
lucy could ring for the maid if she liked but mrs vyse thought it kind to go herself
she found the girl sitting upright with her hand on her cheek
i am so sorry mrs vyseit is these dreams  bad dreams  just dreams  the elder lady smiled and kissed her saying very distinctly you should have heard us talking about you dear
he admires you more than ever
dream of that  lucy returned the kiss still covering one cheek with her hand
mrs vyse recessed to bed
cecil whom the cry had not awoke snored
darkness enveloped the flat
chapter xii twelfth chapter  it was a saturday afternoon gay and brilliant after abundant rains and the spirit of youth dwelt in it though the season was now autumn
all that was gracious triumphed
as the motorcars passed through summer street they raised only a little dust and their stench was soon dispersed by the wind and replaced by the scent of the wet birches or of the pines
mr beebe at leisure for lifes amenities leant over his rectory gate
freddy leant by him smoking a pendant pipe
suppose we go and hinder those new people opposite for a little  mm  they might amuse you  freddy whom his fellowcreatures never amused suggested that the new people might be feeling a bit busy and so on since they had only just moved in
i suggested we should hinder them said mr beebe
they are worth it unlatching the gate he sauntered over the triangular green to cissie villa
hullo he cried shouting in at the open door through which much squalor was visible
a grave voice replied hullo  ive brought someone to see you  ill be down in a minute  the passage was blocked by a wardrobe which the removal men had failed to carry up the stairs
mr beebe edged round it with difficulty
the sittingroom itself was blocked with books
are these people great readers freddy whispered
are they that sort  i fancy they know how to reada rare accomplishment
what have they got
byron
exactly
a shropshire lad
never heard of it
the way of all flesh
never heard of it
gibbon
hullo
dear george reads german
umumschopenhauer nietzsche and so we go on
well i suppose your generation knows its own business honeychurch  mr
beebe look at that said freddy in awestruck tones
on the cornice of the wardrobe the hand of an amateur had painted this inscription mistrust all enterprises that require new clothes  i know
isnt it jolly
i like that
im certain thats the old mans doing  how very odd of him  surely you agree  but freddy was his mothers son and felt that one ought not to go on spoiling the furniture
pictures the clergyman continued scrambling about the room
giottothey got that at florence ill be bound  the same as lucys got  oh bytheby did miss honeychurch enjoy london  she came back yesterday  i suppose she had a good time  yes very said freddy taking up a book
she and cecil are thicker than ever  thats good hearing  i wish i wasnt such a fool mr beebe  mr beebe ignored the remark
lucy used to be nearly as stupid as i am but itll be very different now mother thinks
she will read all kinds of books  so will you  only medical books
not books that you can talk about afterwards
cecil is teaching lucy italian and he says her playing is wonderful
there are all kinds of things in it that we have never noticed
cecil says  what on earth are those people doing upstairs
emersonwe think well come another time  george ran downstairs and pushed them into the room without speaking
let me introduce mr honeychurch a neighbour  then freddy hurled one of the thunderbolts of youth
perhaps he was shy perhaps he was friendly or perhaps he thought that georges face wanted washing
at all events he greeted him with how dye do
come and have a bathe  oh all right said george impassive
mr beebe was highly entertained
how dye do
how dye do
come and have a bathe he chuckled
thats the best conversational opening ive ever heard
but im afraid it will only act between men
can you picture a lady who has been introduced to another lady by a third lady opening civilities with how do you do
come and have a bathe
and yet you will tell me that the sexes are equal  i tell you that they shall be said mr emerson who had been slowly descending the stairs
good afternoon mr beebe
i tell you they shall be comrades and george thinks the same  we are to raise ladies to our level the clergyman inquired
the garden of eden pursued mr emerson still descending which you place in the past is really yet to come
we shall enter it when we no longer despise our bodies  mr beebe disclaimed placing the garden of eden anywhere
in thisnot in other thingswe men are ahead
we despise the body less than women do
but not until we are comrades shall we enter the garden  i say what about this bathe murmured freddy appalled at the mass of philosophy that was approaching him
i believed in a return to nature once
but how can we return to nature when we have never been with her
today i believe that we must discover nature
after many conquests we shall attain simplicity
it is our heritage  let me introduce mr honeychurch whose sister you will remember at florence  how do you do
very glad to see you and that you are taking george for a bathe
very glad to hear that your sister is going to marry
marriage is a duty
i am sure that she will be happy for we know mr vyse too
he has been most kind
he met us by chance in the national gallery and arranged everything about this delightful house
though i hope i have not vexed sir harry otway
i have met so few liberal landowners and i was anxious to compare his attitude towards the game laws with the conservative attitude
ah this wind
you do well to bathe
yours is a glorious country honeychurch  not a bit mumbled freddy
i mustthat is to say i have tohave the pleasure of calling on you later on my mother says i hope  call my lad
who taught us that drawingroom twaddle
call on your grandmother
listen to the wind among the pines
yours is a glorious country  mr beebe came to the rescue
mr
emerson he will call i shall call you or your son will return our calls before ten days have elapsed
i trust that you have realized about the ten days interval
it does not count that i helped you with the staireyes yesterday
it does not count that they are going to bathe this afternoon  yes go and bathe george
why do you dawdle talking
bring them back to tea
bring back some milk cakes honey
the change will do you good
george has been working very hard at his office
i cant believe hes well  george bowed his head dusty and sombre exhaling the peculiar smell of one who has handled furniture
do you really want this bathe freddy asked him
it is only a pond dont you know
i dare say you are used to something better  yesi have said yes already  mr beebe felt bound to assist his young friend and led the way out of the house and into the pinewoods
how glorious it was
for a little time the voice of old mr emerson pursued them dispensing good wishes and philosophy
it ceased and they only heard the fair wind blowing the bracken and the trees
mr beebe who could be silent but who could not bear silence was compelled to chatter since the expedition looked like a failure and neither of his companions would utter a word
he spoke of florence
george attended gravely assenting or dissenting with slight but determined gestures that were as inexplicable as the motions of the treetops above their heads
and what a coincidence that you should meet mr vyse
did you realize that you would find all the pension bertolini down here  i did not
miss lavish told me  when i was a young man i always meant to write a history of coincidence  no enthusiasm
though as a matter of fact coincidences are much rarer than we suppose
for example it isnt purely coincidentally that you are here now when one comes to reflect  to his relief george began to talk
it is
i have reflected
it is fate
everything is fate
we are flung together by fate drawn apart by fateflung together drawn apart
the twelve winds blow uswe settle nothing  you have not reflected at all rapped the clergyman
let me give you a useful tip emerson attribute nothing to fate
dont say i didnt do this for you did it ten to one
now ill crossquestion you
where did you first meet miss honeychurch and myself  italy  and where did you meet mr vyse who is going to marry miss honeychurch  national gallery  looking at italian art
there you are and yet you talk of coincidence and fate
you naturally seek out things italian and so do we and our friends
this narrows the field immeasurably we meet again in it  it is fate that i am here persisted george
but you can call it italy if it makes you less unhappy  mr beebe slid away from such heavy treatment of the subject
but he was infinitely tolerant of the young and had no desire to snub george
and so for this and for other reasons my history of coincidence is still to write  silence
wishing to round off the episode he added we are all so glad that you have come  silence
here we are called freddy
oh good exclaimed mr beebe mopping his brow
in theres the pond
i wish it was bigger he added apologetically
they climbed down a slippery bank of pineneedles
there lay the pond set in its little alp of greenonly a pond but large enough to contain the human body and pure enough to reflect the sky
on account of the rains the waters had flooded the surrounding grass which showed like a beautiful emerald path tempting these feet towards the central pool
its distinctly successful as ponds go said mr beebe
no apologies are necessary for the pond  george sat down where the ground was dry and drearily unlaced his boots
arent those masses of willowherb splendid
i love willowherb in seed
whats the name of this aromatic plant  no one knew or seemed to care
these abrupt changes of vegetationthis little spongeous tract of water plants and on either side of it all the growths are tough or brittleheather bracken hurts pines
very charming very charming  mr
beebe arent you bathing called freddy as he stripped himself
mr beebe thought he was not
waters wonderful cried freddy prancing in
waters water murmured george
wetting his hair firsta sure sign of apathyhe followed freddy into the divine as indifferent as if he were a statue and the pond a pail of soapsuds
it was necessary to use his muscles
it was necessary to keep clean
mr beebe watched them and watched the seeds of the willowherb dance chorically above their heads
apooshoo apooshoo apooshoo went freddy swimming for two strokes in either direction and then becoming involved in reeds or mud
is it worth it asked the other michelangelesque on the flooded margin
the bank broke away and he fell into the pool before he had weighed the question properly
heepoofive swallowed a pollywog mr beebe waters wonderful waters simply ripping  waters not so bad said george reappearing from his plunge and sputtering at the sun
waters wonderful
mr beebe do  apooshoo kouf  mr beebe who was hot and who always acquiesced where possible looked around him
he could detect no parishioners except the pinetrees rising up steeply on all sides and gesturing to each other against the blue
how glorious it was
the world of motorcars and rural deans receded inimitably
water sky evergreens a windthese things not even the seasons can touch and surely they lie beyond the intrusion of man
i may as well wash too and soon his garments made a third little pile on the sward and he too asserted the wonder of the water
it was ordinary water nor was there very much of it and as freddy said it reminded one of swimming in a salad
the three gentlemen rotated in the pool breast high after the fashion of the nymphs in gotterdammerung
but either because the rains had given a freshness or because the sun was shedding a most glorious heat or because two of the gentlemen were young in years and the third young in spiritfor some reason or other a change came over them and they forgot italy and botany and fate
they began to play
mr beebe and freddy splashed each other
a little deferentially they splashed george
he was quiet they feared they had offended him
then all the forces of youth burst out
he smiled flung himself at them splashed them ducked them kicked them muddied them and drove them out of the pool
race you round it then cried freddy and they raced in the sunshine and george took a short cut and dirtied his shins and had to bathe a second time
then mr beebe consented to runa memorable sight
they ran to get dry they bathed to get cool they played at being indians in the willowherbs and in the bracken they bathed to get clean
and all the time three little bundles lay discreetly on the sward proclaiming  no
we are what matters
without us shall no enterprise begin
to us shall all flesh turn in the end  a try
a try yelled freddy snatching up georges bundle and placing it beside an imaginary goalpost
socker rules george retorted scattering freddys bundle with a kick
goal  goal  pass  take care my watch cried mr beebe
clothes flew in all directions
take care my hat
no thats enough freddy
dress now
no i say  but the two young men were delirious
away they twinkled into the trees freddy with a clerical waistcoat under his arm george with a wideawake hat on his dripping hair
thatll do shouted mr beebe remembering that after all he was in his own parish
then his voice changed as if every pinetree was a rural dean
hi
steady on
i see people coming you fellows  yells and widening circles over the dappled earth
hi
hi
ladies  neither george nor freddy was truly refined
still they did not hear mr beebes last warning or they would have avoided mrs honeychurch cecil and lucy who were walking down to call on old mrs butterworth
freddy dropped the waistcoat at their feet and dashed into some bracken
george whooped in their faces turned and scudded away down the path to the pond still clad in mr beebes hat
gracious alive cried mrs honeychurch
whoever were those unfortunate people
oh dears look away
and poor mr beebe too
whatever has happened  come this way immediately commanded cecil who always felt that he must lead women though he knew not whither and protect them though he knew not against what
he led them now towards the bracken where freddy sat concealed
oh poor mr beebe
was that his waistcoat we left in the path
cecil mr beebes waistcoat  no business of ours said cecil glancing at lucy who was all parasol and evidently minded  i fancy mr beebe jumped back into the pond  this way please mrs honeychurch this way  they followed him up the bank attempting the tense yet nonchalant expression that is suitable for ladies on such occasions
well i cant help it said a voice close ahead and freddy reared a freckled face and a pair of snowy shoulders out of the fronds
i cant be trodden on can i  good gracious me dear so its you
what miserable management
why not have a comfortable bath at home with hot and cold laid on  look here mother a fellow must wash and a fellows got to dry and if another fellow  dear no doubt youre right as usual but you are in no position to argue
come lucy they turned
oh lookdont look
oh poor mr beebe
how unfortunate again  for mr beebe was just crawling out of the pond on whose surface garments of an intimate nature did float while george the worldweary george shouted to freddy that he had hooked a fish
and me ive swallowed one answered he of the bracken
ive swallowed a pollywog
it wriggleth in my tummy
i shall dieemerson you beast youve got on my bags  hush dears said mrs honeychurch who found it impossible to remain shocked
and do be sure you dry yourselves thoroughly first
all these colds come of not drying thoroughly  mother do come away said lucy
oh for goodness sake do come  hullo cried george so that again the ladies stopped
he regarded himself as dressed
barefoot barechested radiant and personable against the shadowy woods he called  hullo miss honeychurch
hullo  bow lucy better bow
whoever is it
i shall bow  miss honeychurch bowed
that evening and all that night the water ran away
on the morrow the pool had shrunk to its old size and lost its glory
it had been a call to the blood and to the relaxed will a passing benediction whose influence did not pass a holiness a spell a momentary chalice for youth
chapter xiii how miss bartletts boiler was so tiresome  how often had lucy rehearsed this bow this interview
but she had always rehearsed them indoors and with certain accessories which surely we have a right to assume
who could foretell that she and george would meet in the rout of a civilization amidst an army of coats and collars and boots that lay wounded over the sunlit earth
she had imagined a young mr emerson who might be shy or morbid or indifferent or furtively impudent
she was prepared for all of these
but she had never imagined one who would be happy and greet her with the shout of the morning star
indoors herself partaking of tea with old mrs butterworth she reflected that it is impossible to foretell the future with any degree of accuracy that it is impossible to rehearse life
a fault in the scenery a face in the audience an irruption of the audience on to the stage and all our carefully planned gestures mean nothing or mean too much
i will bow she had thought
i will not shake hands with him
that will be just the proper thing she had bowedbut to whom
to gods to heroes to the nonsense of schoolgirls
she had bowed across the rubbish that cumbers the world
so ran her thoughts while her faculties were busy with cecil
it was another of those dreadful engagement calls
mrs butterworth had wanted to see him and he did not want to be seen
he did not want to hear about hydrangeas why they change their colour at the seaside
he did not want to join the c o s when cross he was always elaborate and made long clever answers where yes or no would have done
lucy soothed him and tinkered at the conversation in a way that promised well for their married peace
no one is perfect and surely it is wiser to discover the imperfections before wedlock
miss bartlett indeed though not in word had taught the girl that this our life contains nothing satisfactory
lucy though she disliked the teacher regarded the teaching as profound and applied it to her lover
lucy said her mother when they got home is anything the matter with cecil  the question was ominous up till now mrs honeychurch had behaved with charity and restraint
no i dont think so mother cecils all right  perhaps hes tired  lucy compromised perhaps cecil was a little tired
because otherwiseshe pulled out her bonnetpins with gathering displeasurebecause otherwise i cannot account for him  i do think mrs butterworth is rather tiresome if you mean that  cecil has told you to think so
you were devoted to her as a little girl and nothing will describe her goodness to you through the typhoid fever
noit is just the same thing everywhere  let me just put your bonnet away may i  surely he could answer her civilly for one halfhour  cecil has a very high standard for people faltered lucy seeing trouble ahead
its part of his idealsit is really that that makes him sometimes seem  oh rubbish
if high ideals make a young man rude the sooner he gets rid of them the better said mrs honeychurch handing her the bonnet
now mother
ive seen you cross with mrs butterworth yourself  not in that way
at times i could wring her neck
but not in that way
no
it is the same with cecil all over  bythebyi never told you
i had a letter from charlotte while i was away in london  this attempt to divert the conversation was too puerile and mrs honeychurch resented it
since cecil came back from london nothing appears to please him
whenever i speak he wincesi see him lucy it is useless to contradict me
no doubt i am neither artistic nor literary nor intellectual nor musical but i cannot help the drawingroom furniture your father bought it and we must put up with it will cecil kindly remember  ii see what you mean and certainly cecil oughtnt to
but he does not mean to be uncivilhe once explainedit is the things that upset himhe is easily upset by ugly thingshe is not uncivil to people  is it a thing or a person when freddy sings  you cant expect a really musical person to enjoy comic songs as we do  then why didnt he leave the room
why sit wriggling and sneering and spoiling everyones pleasure  we mustnt be unjust to people faltered lucy
something had enfeebled her and the case for cecil which she had mastered so perfectly in london would not come forth in an effective form
the two civilizations had clashedcecil hinted that they mightand she was dazzled and bewildered as though the radiance that lies behind all civilization had blinded her eyes
good taste and bad taste were only catchwords garments of diverse cut and music itself dissolved to a whisper through pinetrees where the song is not distinguishable from the comic song
she remained in much embarrassment while mrs honeychurch changed her frock for dinner and every now and then she said a word and made things no better
there was no concealing the fact cecil had meant to be supercilious and he had succeeded
and lucyshe knew not whywished that the trouble could have come at any other time
go and dress dear youll be late  all right mother  dont say all right and stop
go  she obeyed but loitered disconsolately at the landing window
it faced north so there was little view and no view of the sky
now as in the winter the pinetrees hung close to her eyes
one connected the landing window with depression
no definite problem menaced her but she sighed to herself oh dear what shall i do what shall i do it seemed to her that everyone else was behaving very badly
and she ought not to have mentioned miss bartletts letter
she must be more careful her mother was rather inquisitive and might have asked what it was about
oh dear what should she doand then freddy came bounding upstairs and joined the ranks of the illbehaved
i say those are topping people  my dear baby how tiresome youve been
you have no business to take them bathing in the sacred lake its much too public
it was all right for you but most awkward for everyone else
do be more careful
you forget the place is growing half suburban  i say is anything on tomorrow week  not that i know of  then i want to ask the emersons up to sunday tennis  oh i wouldnt do that freddy i wouldnt do that with all this muddle  whats wrong with the court
they wont mind a bump or two and ive ordered new balls  i meant its better not
i really mean it  he seized her by the elbows and humorously danced her up and down the passage
she pretended not to mind but she could have screamed with temper
cecil glanced at them as he proceeded to his toilet and they impeded mary with her brood of hotwater cans
then mrs honeychurch opened her door and said lucy what a noise youre making
i have something to say to you
did you say you had had a letter from charlotte and freddy ran away
yes
i really cant stop
i must dress too  hows charlotte  all right  lucy  the unfortunate girl returned
youve a bad habit of hurrying away in the middle of ones sentences
did charlotte mention her boiler  her what  dont you remember that her boiler was to be had out in october and her bath cistern cleaned out and all kinds of terrible todoings  i cant remember all charlottes worries said lucy bitterly
i shall have enough of my own now that you are not pleased with cecil  mrs honeychurch might have flamed out
she did not
she said come here old ladythank you for putting away my bonnetkiss me and though nothing is perfect lucy felt for the moment that her mother and windy corner and the weald in the declining sun were perfect
so the grittiness went out of life
it generally did at windy corner
at the last minute when the social machine was clogged hopelessly one member or other of the family poured in a drop of oil
cecil despised their methodsperhaps rightly
at all events they were not his own
dinner was at halfpast seven
freddy gabbled the grace and they drew up their heavy chairs and fell to
fortunately the men were hungry
nothing untoward occurred until the pudding
then freddy said  lucy whats emerson like  i saw him in florence said lucy hoping that this would pass for a reply
is he the clever sort or is he a decent chap  ask cecil it is cecil who brought him here  he is the clever sort like myself said cecil
freddy looked at him doubtfully
how well did you know them at the bertolini asked mrs honeychurch
oh very slightly
i mean charlotte knew them even less than i did  oh that reminds meyou never told me what charlotte said in her letter  one thing and another said lucy wondering whether she would get through the meal without a lie
among other things that an awful friend of hers had been bicycling through summer street wondered if shed come up and see us and mercifully didnt  lucy i do call the way you talk unkind  she was a novelist said lucy craftily
the remark was a happy one for nothing roused mrs honeychurch so much as literature in the hands of females
she would abandon every topic to inveigh against those women who instead of minding their houses and their children seek notoriety by print
her attitude was if books must be written let them be written by men and she developed it at great length while cecil yawned and freddy played at this year next year now never with his plumstones and lucy artfully fed the flames of her mothers wrath
but soon the conflagration died down and the ghosts began to gather in the darkness
there were too many ghosts about
the original ghostthat touch of lips on her cheekhad surely been laid long ago it could be nothing to her that a man had kissed her on a mountain once
but it had begotten a spectral familymr harris miss bartletts letter mr beebes memories of violetsand one or other of these was bound to haunt her before cecils very eyes
it was miss bartlett who returned now and with appalling vividness
i have been thinking lucy of that letter of charlottes
how is she  i tore the thing up  didnt she say how she was
how does she sound
cheerful  oh yes i suppose sononot very cheerful i suppose  then depend upon it it is the boiler
i know myself how water preys upon ones mind
i would rather anything elseeven a misfortune with the meat  cecil laid his hand over his eyes
so would i asserted freddy backing his mother upbacking up the spirit of her remark rather than the substance
and i have been thinking she added rather nervously surely we could squeeze charlotte in here next week and give her a nice holiday while plumbers at tunbridge wells finish
i have not seen poor charlotte for so long  it was more than her nerves could stand
and she could not protest violently after her mothers goodness to her upstairs
mother no she pleaded
its impossible
we cant have charlotte on the top of the other things were squeezed to death as it is
freddys got a friend coming tuesday theres cecil and youve promised to take in minnie beebe because of the diphtheria scare
it simply cant be done  nonsense
it can  if minnie sleeps in the bath
not otherwise  minnie can sleep with you  i wont have her  then if youre so selfish mr floyd must share a room with freddy  miss bartlett miss bartlett miss bartlett moaned cecil again laying his hand over his eyes
its impossible repeated lucy
i dont want to make difficulties but it really isnt fair on the maids to fill up the house so  alas
the truth is dear you dont like charlotte  no i dont
and no more does cecil
she gets on our nerves
you havent seen her lately and dont realize how tiresome she can be though so good
so please mother dont worry us this last summer but spoil us by not asking her to come  hear hear said cecil
mrs honeychurch with more gravity than usual and with more feeling than she usually permitted herself replied this isnt very kind of you two
you have each other and all these woods to walk in so full of beautiful things and poor charlotte has only the water turned off and plumbers
you are young dears and however clever young people are and however many books they read they will never guess what it feels like to grow old  cecil crumbled his bread
i must say cousin charlotte was very kind to me that year i called on my bike put in freddy
she thanked me for coming till i felt like such a fool and fussed round no end to get an egg boiled for my tea just right  i know dear
she is kind to everyone and yet lucy makes this difficulty when we try to give her some little return  but lucy hardened her heart
it was no good being kind to miss bartlett
she had tried herself too often and too recently
one might lay up treasure in heaven by the attempt but one enriched neither miss bartlett nor any one else upon earth
she was reduced to saying i cant help it mother
i dont like charlotte
i admit its horrid of me  from your own account you told her as much  well she would leave florence so stupidly
she flurried  the ghosts were returning they filled italy they were even usurping the places she had known as a child
the sacred lake would never be the same again and on sunday week something would even happen to windy corner
how would she fight against ghosts
for a moment the visible world faded away and memories and emotions alone seemed real
i suppose miss bartlett must come since she boils eggs so well  said cecil who was in rather a happier frame of mind thanks to the admirable cooking
i didnt mean the egg was well boiled corrected freddy because in point of fact she forgot to take it off and as a matter of fact i dont care for eggs
i only meant how jolly kind she seemed  cecil frowned again
oh these honeychurches
eggs boilers hydrangeas maidsof such were their lives compact
may me and lucy get down from our chairs he asked with scarcely veiled insolence
we dont want no dessert    chapter xiv how lucy faced the external situation bravely  of course miss bartlett accepted
and equally of course she felt sure that she would prove a nuisance and begged to be given an inferior spare roomsomething with no view anything
her love to lucy
and equally of course george emerson could come to tennis on the sunday week
lucy faced the situation bravely though like most of us she only faced the situation that encompassed her
she never gazed inwards
if at times strange images rose from the depths she put them down to nerves
when cecil brought the emersons to summer street it had upset her nerves
charlotte would burnish up past foolishness and this might upset her nerves
she was nervous at night
when she talked to georgethey met again almost immediately at the rectoryhis voice moved her deeply and she wished to remain near him
how dreadful if she really wished to remain near him
of course the wish was due to nerves which love to play such perverse tricks upon us
once she had suffered from things that came out of nothing and meant she didnt know what  now cecil had explained psychology to her one wet afternoon and all the troubles of youth in an unknown world could be dismissed
it is obvious enough for the reader to conclude she loves young emerson a reader in lucys place would not find it obvious
life is easy to chronicle but bewildering to practice and we welcome nerves  or any other shibboleth that will cloak our personal desire
she loved cecil george made her nervous will the reader explain to her that the phrases should have been reversed
but the external situationshe will face that bravely
the meeting at the rectory had passed off well enough
standing between mr beebe and cecil she had made a few temperate allusions to italy and george had replied
she was anxious to show that she was not shy and was glad that he did not seem shy either
a nice fellow said mr beebe afterwards he will work off his crudities in time
i rather mistrust young men who slip into life gracefully  lucy said he seems in better spirits
he laughs more  yes replied the clergyman
he is waking up  that was all
but as the week wore on more of her defences fell and she entertained an image that had physical beauty
in spite of the clearest directions miss bartlett contrived to bungle her arrival
she was due at the southeastern station at dorking whither mrs honeychurch drove to meet her
she arrived at the london and brighton station and had to hire a cab up
no one was at home except freddy and his friend who had to stop their tennis and to entertain her for a solid hour
cecil and lucy turned up at four oclock and these with little minnie beebe made a somewhat lugubrious sextette upon the upper lawn for tea
i shall never forgive myself said miss bartlett who kept on rising from her seat and had to be begged by the united company to remain
i have upset everything
bursting in on young people
but i insist on paying for my cab up
grant that at any rate  our visitors never do such dreadful things said lucy while her brother in whose memory the boiled egg had already grown unsubstantial exclaimed in irritable tones just what ive been trying to convince cousin charlotte of lucy for the last half hour  i do not feel myself an ordinary visitor said miss bartlett and looked at her frayed glove
all right if youd really rather
five shillings and i gave a bob to the driver  miss bartlett looked in her purse
only sovereigns and pennies
could any one give her change
freddy had half a quid and his friend had four halfcrowns
miss bartlett accepted their moneys and then said but who am i to give the sovereign to  lets leave it all till mother comes back suggested lucy
no dear your mother may take quite a long drive now that she is not hampered with me
we all have our little foibles and mine is the prompt settling of accounts  here freddys friend mr floyd made the one remark of his that need be quoted he offered to toss freddy for miss bartletts quid
a solution seemed in sight and even cecil who had been ostentatiously drinking his tea at the view felt the eternal attraction of chance and turned round
but this did not do either
pleasepleasei know i am a sad spoilsport but it would make me wretched
i should practically be robbing the one who lost  freddy owes me fifteen shillings interposed cecil
so it will work out right if you give the pound to me  fifteen shillings said miss bartlett dubiously
how is that mr vyse  because dont you see freddy paid your cab
give me the pound and we shall avoid this deplorable gambling  miss bartlett who was poor at figures became bewildered and rendered up the sovereign amidst the suppressed gurgles of the other youths
for a moment cecil was happy
he was playing at nonsense among his peers
then he glanced at lucy in whose face petty anxieties had marred the smiles
in january he would rescue his leonardo from this stupefying twaddle
but i dont see that exclaimed minnie beebe who had narrowly watched the iniquitous transaction
i dont see why mr vyse is to have the quid  because of the fifteen shillings and the five they said solemnly
fifteen shillings and five shillings make one pound you see  but i dont see  they tried to stifle her with cake
no thank you
im done
i dont see whyfreddy dont poke me
miss honeychurch your brothers hurting me
ow
what about mr floyds ten shillings
ow
no i dont see and i never shall see why miss whatshername shouldnt pay that bob for the driver  i had forgotten the driver said miss bartlett reddening
thank you dear for reminding me
a shilling was it
can any one give me change for half a crown  ill get it said the young hostess rising with decision
cecil give me that sovereign
no give me up that sovereign
ill get euphemia to change it and well start the whole thing again from the beginning  lucylucywhat a nuisance i am protested miss bartlett and followed her across the lawn
lucy tripped ahead simulating hilarity
when they were out of earshot miss bartlett stopped her wails and said quite briskly have you told him about him yet  no i havent replied lucy and then could have bitten her tongue for understanding so quickly what her cousin meant
let me seea sovereigns worth of silver  she escaped into the kitchen
miss bartletts sudden transitions were too uncanny
it sometimes seemed as if she planned every word she spoke or caused to be spoken as if all this worry about cabs and change had been a ruse to surprise the soul
no i havent told cecil or any one she remarked when she returned
i promised you i shouldnt
here is your moneyall shillings except two halfcrowns
would you count it
you can settle your debt nicely now  miss bartlett was in the drawingroom gazing at the photograph of st john ascending which had been framed
how dreadful she murmured how more than dreadful if mr vyse should come to hear of it from some other source  oh no charlotte said the girl entering the battle
george emerson is all right and what other source is there  miss bartlett considered
for instance the driver
i saw him looking through the bushes at you remember he had a violet between his teeth  lucy shuddered a little
we shall get the silly affair on our nerves if we arent careful
how could a florentine cabdriver ever get hold of cecil  we must think of every possibility  oh its all right  or perhaps old mr emerson knows
in fact he is certain to know  i dont care if he does
i was grateful to you for your letter but even if the news does get round i think i can trust cecil to laugh at it  to contradict it  no to laugh at it but she knew in her heart that she could not trust him for he desired her untouched
very well dear you know best
perhaps gentlemen are different to what they were when i was young
ladies are certainly different  now charlotte she struck at her playfully
you kind anxious thing
what would you have me do
first you say dont tell and then you say tell
which is it to be
quick  miss bartlett sighed i am no match for you in conversation dearest
i blush when i think how i interfered at florence and you so well able to look after yourself and so much cleverer in all ways than i am
you will never forgive me  shall we go out then
they will smash all the china if we dont  for the air rang with the shrieks of minnie who was being scalped with a teaspoon
dear one momentwe may not have this chance for a chat again
have you seen the young one yet  yes i have  what happened  we met at the rectory  what line is he taking up  no line
he talked about italy like any other person
it is really all right
what advantage would he get from being a cad to put it bluntly
i do wish i could make you see it my way
he really wont be any nuisance charlotte  once a cad always a cad
that is my poor opinion  lucy paused
cecil said one dayand i thought it so profoundthat there are two kinds of cadsthe conscious and the subconscious she paused again to be sure of doing justice to cecils profundity
through the window she saw cecil himself turning over the pages of a novel
it was a new one from smiths library
her mother must have returned from the station
once a cad always a cad droned miss bartlett
what i mean by subconscious is that emerson lost his head
i fell into all those violets and he was silly and surprised
i dont think we ought to blame him very much
it makes such a difference when you see a person with beautiful things behind him unexpectedly
it really does it makes an enormous difference and he lost his head he doesnt admire me or any of that nonsense one straw
freddy rather likes him and has asked him up here on sunday so you can judge for yourself
he has improved he doesnt always look as if hes going to burst into tears
he is a clerk in the general managers office at one of the big railwaysnot a porter
and runs down to his father for weekends
papa was to do with journalism but is rheumatic and has retired
there
now for the garden she took hold of her guest by the arm
suppose we dont talk about this silly italian business any more
we want you to have a nice restful visit at windy corner with no worriting  lucy thought this rather a good speech
the reader may have detected an unfortunate slip in it
whether miss bartlett detected the slip one cannot say for it is impossible to penetrate into the minds of elderly people
she might have spoken further but they were interrupted by the entrance of her hostess
explanations took place and in the midst of them lucy escaped the images throbbing a little more vividly in her brain
chapter xv the disaster within  the sunday after miss bartletts arrival was a glorious day like most of the days of that year
in the weald autumn approached breaking up the green monotony of summer touching the parks with the grey bloom of mist the beechtrees with russet the oaktrees with gold
up on the heights battalions of black pines witnessed the change themselves unchangeable
either country was spanned by a cloudless sky and in either arose the tinkle of church bells
the garden of windy corners was deserted except for a red book which lay sunning itself upon the gravel path
from the house came incoherent sounds as of females preparing for worship
the men say they wont gowell i dont blame themminnie says need she gotell her no nonsenseanne
mary
hook me behinddearest lucia may i trespass upon you for a pin for miss bartlett had announced that she at all events was one for church
the sun rose higher on its journey guided not by phaethon but by apollo competent unswerving divine
its rays fell on the ladies whenever they advanced towards the bedroom windows on mr beebe down at summer street as he smiled over a letter from miss catharine alan on george emerson cleaning his fathers boots and lastly to complete the catalogue of memorable things on the red book mentioned previously
the ladies move mr beebe moves george moves and movement may engender shadow
but this book lies motionless to be caressed all the morning by the sun and to raise its covers slightly as though acknowledging the caress
presently lucy steps out of the drawingroom window
her new cerise dress has been a failure and makes her look tawdry and wan
at her throat is a garnet brooch on her finger a ring set with rubiesan engagement ring
her eyes are bent to the weald
she frowns a littlenot in anger but as a brave child frowns when he is trying not to cry
in all that expanse no human eye is looking at her and she may frown unrebuked and measure the spaces that yet survive between apollo and the western hills
lucy
lucy
whats that book
whos been taking a book out of the shelf and leaving it about to spoil  its only the library book that cecils been reading  but pick it up and dont stand idling there like a flamingo  lucy picked up the book and glanced at the title listlessly under a loggia
she no longer read novels herself devoting all her spare time to solid literature in the hope of catching cecil up
it was dreadful how little she knew and even when she thought she knew a thing like the italian painters she found she had forgotten it
only this morning she had confused francesco francia with piero della francesca and cecil had said what
you arent forgetting your italy already and this too had lent anxiety to her eyes when she saluted the dear view and the dear garden in the foreground and above them scarcely conceivable elsewhere the dear sun
lucyhave you a sixpence for minnie and a shilling for yourself  she hastened in to her mother who was rapidly working herself into a sunday fluster
its a special collectioni forget what for
i do beg no vulgar clinking in the plate with halfpennies see that minnie has a nice bright sixpence
where is the child
minnie
that books all warped
gracious how plain you look
put it under the atlas to press
minnie  oh mrs honeychurch from the upper regions
minnie dont be late
here comes the horseit was always the horse never the carriage
wheres charlotte
run up and hurry her
why is she so long
she had nothing to do
she never brings anything but blouses
poor charlottehow i do detest blouses
minnie  paganism is infectiousmore infectious than diphtheria or pietyand the rectors niece was taken to church protesting
as usual she didnt see why
why shouldnt she sit in the sun with the young men
the young men who had now appeared mocked her with ungenerous words
mrs honeychurch defended orthodoxy and in the midst of the confusion miss bartlett dressed in the very height of the fashion came strolling down the stairs
dear marian i am very sorry but i have no small changenothing but sovereigns and half crowns
could any one give me  yes easily
jump in
gracious me how smart you look
what a lovely frock
you put us all to shame  if i did not wear my best rags and tatters now when should i wear them said miss bartlett reproachfully
she got into the victoria and placed herself with her back to the horse
the necessary roar ensued and then they drove off
goodbye
be good called out cecil
lucy bit her lip for the tone was sneering
on the subject of church and so on they had had rather an unsatisfactory conversation
he had said that people ought to overhaul themselves and she did not want to overhaul herself she did not know it was done
honest orthodoxy cecil respected but he always assumed that honesty is the result of a spiritual crisis he could not imagine it as a natural birthright that might grow heavenward like flowers
all that he said on this subject pained her though he exuded tolerance from every pore somehow the emersons were different
she saw the emersons after church
there was a line of carriages down the road and the honeychurch vehicle happened to be opposite cissie villa
to save time they walked over the green to it and found father and son smoking in the garden
introduce me said her mother
unless the young man considers that he knows me already  he probably did but lucy ignored the sacred lake and introduced them formally
old mr emerson claimed her with much warmth and said how glad he was that she was going to be married
she said yes she was glad too and then as miss bartlett and minnie were lingering behind with mr beebe she turned the conversation to a less disturbing topic and asked him how he liked his new house
very much he replied but there was a note of offence in his voice she had never known him offended before
he added we find though that the miss alans were coming and that we have turned them out
women mind such a thing
i am very much upset about it  i believe that there was some misunderstanding said mrs honeychurch uneasily
our landlord was told that we should be a different type of person  said george who seemed disposed to carry the matter further
he thought we should be artistic
he is disappointed  and i wonder whether we ought to write to the miss alans and offer to give it up
what do you think he appealed to lucy
oh stop now you have come said lucy lightly
she must avoid censuring cecil
for it was on cecil that the little episode turned though his name was never mentioned
so george says
he says that the miss alans must go to the wall
yet it does seem so unkind  there is only a certain amount of kindness in the world said george watching the sunlight flash on the panels of the passing carriages
yes exclaimed mrs honeychurch
thats exactly what i say
why all this twiddling and twaddling over two miss alans  there is a certain amount of kindness just as there is a certain amount of light he continued in measured tones
we cast a shadow on something wherever we stand and it is no good moving from place to place to save things because the shadow always follows
choose a place where you wont do harmyes choose a place where you wont do very much harm and stand in it for all you are worth facing the sunshine  oh mr emerson i see youre clever  eh  i see youre going to be clever
i hope you didnt go behaving like that to poor freddy  georges eyes laughed and lucy suspected that he and her mother would get on rather well
no i didnt he said
he behaved that way to me
it is his philosophy
only he starts life with it and i have tried the note of interrogation first  what do you mean
no never mind what you mean
dont explain
he looks forward to seeing you this afternoon
do you play tennis
do you mind tennis on sunday  george mind tennis on sunday
george after his education distinguish between sunday  very well george doesnt mind tennis on sunday
no more do i thats settled
mr emerson if you could come with your son we should be so pleased  he thanked her but the walk sounded rather far he could only potter about in these days
she turned to george and then he wants to give up his house to the miss alans  i know said george and put his arm round his fathers neck
the kindness that mr beebe and lucy had always known to exist in him came out suddenly like sunlight touching a vast landscapea touch of the morning sun
she remembered that in all his perversities he had never spoken against affection
miss bartlett approached
you know our cousin miss bartlett said mrs honeychurch pleasantly
you met her with my daughter in florence  yes indeed said the old man and made as if he would come out of the garden to meet the lady
miss bartlett promptly got into the victoria
thus entrenched she emitted a formal bow
it was the pension bertolini again the diningtable with the decanters of water and wine
it was the old old battle of the room with the view
george did not respond to the bow
like any boy he blushed and was ashamed he knew that the chaperon remembered
he said iill come up to tennis if i can manage it and went into the house
perhaps anything that he did would have pleased lucy but his awkwardness went straight to her heart men were not gods after all but as human and as clumsy as girls even men might suffer from unexplained desires and need help
to one of her upbringing and of her destination the weakness of men was a truth unfamiliar but she had surmised it at florence when george threw her photographs into the river arno
george dont go cried his father who thought it a great treat for people if his son would talk to them
george has been in such good spirits today and i am sure he will end by coming up this afternoon  lucy caught her cousins eye
something in its mute appeal made her reckless
yes she said raising her voice i do hope he will then she went to the carriage and murmured the old man hasnt been told i knew it was all right mrs honeychurch followed her and they drove away
satisfactory that mr emerson had not been told of the florence escapade yet lucys spirits should not have leapt up as if she had sighted the ramparts of heaven
satisfactory yet surely she greeted it with disproportionate joy
all the way home the horses hoofs sang a tune to her he has not told he has not told her brain expanded the melody he has not told his fatherto whom he tells all things
it was not an exploit
he did not laugh at me when i had gone she raised her hand to her cheek
he does not love me
no
how terrible if he did
but he has not told
he will not tell  she longed to shout the words it is all right
its a secret between us two for ever
cecil will never hear she was even glad that miss bartlett had made her promise secrecy that last dark evening at florence when they had knelt packing in his room
the secret big or little was guarded
only three english people knew of it in the world
thus she interpreted her joy
she greeted cecil with unusual radiance because she felt so safe
as he helped her out of the carriage she said  the emersons have been so nice
george emerson has improved enormously  how are my proteges asked cecil who took no real interest in them and had long since forgotten his resolution to bring them to windy corner for educational purposes
proteges she exclaimed with some warmth
for the only relationship which cecil conceived was feudal that of protector and protected
he had no glimpse of the comradeship after which the girls soul yearned
you shall see for yourself how your proteges are
george emerson is coming up this afternoon
he is a most interesting man to talk to
only dont she nearly said dont protect him but the bell was ringing for lunch and as often happened cecil had paid no great attention to her remarks
charm not argument was to be her forte
lunch was a cheerful meal
generally lucy was depressed at meals
some one had to be soothedeither cecil or miss bartlett or a being not visible to the mortal eyea being who whispered to her soul it will not last this cheerfulness
in january you must go to london to entertain the grandchildren of celebrated men but today she felt she had received a guarantee
her mother would always sit there her brother here
the sun though it had moved a little since the morning would never be hidden behind the western hills
after luncheon they asked her to play
she had seen glucks armide that year and played from memory the music of the enchanted gardenthe music to which renaud approaches beneath the light of an eternal dawn the music that never gains never wanes but ripples for ever like the tideless seas of fairyland
such music is not for the piano and her audience began to get restive and cecil sharing the discontent called out now play us the other gardenthe one in parsifal  she closed the instrument
not very dutiful said her mothers voice
fearing that she had offended cecil she turned quickly round
there george was
he had crept in without interrupting her
oh i had no idea she exclaimed getting very red and then without a word of greeting she reopened the piano
cecil should have the parsifal and anything else that he liked
our performer has changed her mind said miss bartlett perhaps implying she will play the music to mr emerson
lucy did not know what to do nor even what she wanted to do
she played a few bars of the flower maidens song very badly and then she stopped
i vote tennis said freddy disgusted at the scrappy entertainment
yes so do i once more she closed the unfortunate piano
i vote you have a mens four  all right  not for me thank you said cecil
i will not spoil the set he never realized that it may be an act of kindness in a bad player to make up a fourth
oh come along cecil
im bad floyds rotten and so i dare says emerson  george corrected him i am not bad  one looked down ones nose at this
then certainly i wont play said cecil while miss bartlett under the impression that she was snubbing george added i agree with you mr vyse
you had much better not play
much better not  minnie rushing in where cecil feared to tread announced that she would play
i shall miss every ball anyway so what does it matter but sunday intervened and stamped heavily upon the kindly suggestion
then it will have to be lucy said mrs honeychurch you must fall back on lucy
there is no other way out of it
lucy go and change your frock  lucys sabbath was generally of this amphibious nature
she kept it without hypocrisy in the morning and broke it without reluctance in the afternoon
as she changed her frock she wondered whether cecil was sneering at her really she must overhaul herself and settle everything up before she married him
mr floyd was her partner
she liked music but how much better tennis seemed
how much better to run about in comfortable clothes than to sit at the piano and feel girt under the arms
once more music appeared to her the employment of a child
george served and surprised her by his anxiety to win
she remembered how he had sighed among the tombs at santa croce because things wouldnt fit how after the death of that obscure italian he had leant over the parapet by the arno and said to her i shall want to live i tell you he wanted to live now to win at tennis to stand for all he was worth in the sunthe sun which had begun to decline and was shining in her eyes and he did win
ah how beautiful the weald looked
the hills stood out above its radiance as fiesole stands above the tuscan plain and the south downs if one chose were the mountains of carrara
she might be forgetting her italy but she was noticing more things in her england
one could play a new game with the view and try to find in its innumerable folds some town or village that would do for florence
ah how beautiful the weald looked
but now cecil claimed her
he chanced to be in a lucid critical mood and would not sympathize with exaltation
he had been rather a nuisance all through the tennis for the novel that he was reading was so bad that he was obliged to read it aloud to others
he would stroll round the precincts of the court and call out i say listen to this lucy
three split infinitives  dreadful said lucy and missed her stroke
when they had finished their set he still went on reading there was some murder scene and really everyone must listen to it
freddy and mr floyd were obliged to hunt for a lost ball in the laurels but the other two acquiesced
the scene is laid in florence  what fun cecil
read away
come mr emerson sit down after all your energy she had forgiven george as she put it and she made a point of being pleasant to him
he jumped over the net and sat down at her feet asking youand are you tired  of course im not  do you mind being beaten  she was going to answer no when it struck her that she did mind so she answered yes she added merrily i dont see youre such a splendid player though
the light was behind you and it was in my eyes  i never said i was  why you did  you didnt attend  you saidoh dont go in for accuracy at this house
we all exaggerate and we get very angry with people who dont  the scene is laid in florence repeated cecil with an upward note
lucy recollected herself
sunset
leonora was speeding  lucy interrupted
leonora
is leonora the heroine
whos the book by  joseph emery prank
sunset
leonora speeding across the square
pray the saints she might not arrive too late
sunsetthe sunset of italy
under orcagnas loggiathe loggia de lanzi as we sometimes call it now  lucy burst into laughter
joseph emery prank indeed
why its miss lavish
its miss lavishs novel and shes publishing it under somebody elses name  who may miss lavish be  oh a dreadful personmr emerson you remember miss lavish  excited by her pleasant afternoon she clapped her hands
george looked up
of course i do
i saw her the day i arrived at summer street
it was she who told me that you lived here  werent you pleased she meant to see miss lavish but when he bent down to the grass without replying it struck her that she could mean something else
she watched his head which was almost resting against her knee and she thought that the ears were reddening
no wonder the novels bad she added
i never liked miss lavish
but i suppose one ought to read it as ones met her  all modern books are bad said cecil who was annoyed at her inattention and vented his annoyance on literature
every one writes for money in these days  oh cecil  it is so
i will inflict joseph emery prank on you no longer  cecil this afternoon seemed such a twittering sparrow
the ups and downs in his voice were noticeable but they did not affect her
she had dwelt amongst melody and movement and her nerves refused to answer to the clang of his
leaving him to be annoyed she gazed at the black head again
she did not want to stroke it but she saw herself wanting to stroke it the sensation was curious
how do you like this view of ours mr emerson  i never notice much difference in views  what do you mean  because theyre all alike
because all that matters in them is distance and air  hm said cecil uncertain whether the remark was striking or not
my fatherhe looked up at her and he was a little flushedsays that there is only one perfect viewthe view of the sky straight over our heads and that all these views on earth are but bungled copies of it  i expect your father has been reading dante said cecil fingering the novel which alone permitted him to lead the conversation
he told us another day that views are really crowdscrowds of trees and houses and hillsand are bound to resemble each other like human crowdsand that the power they have over us is sometimes supernatural for the same reason  lucys lips parted
for a crowd is more than the people who make it up
something gets added to itno one knows howjust as something has got added to those hills  he pointed with his racquet to the south downs
what a splendid idea she murmured
i shall enjoy hearing your father talk again
im so sorry hes not so well  no he isnt well  theres an absurd account of a view in this book said cecil
also that men fall into two classesthose who forget views and those who remember them even in small rooms  mr
emerson have you any brothers or sisters  none
why  you spoke of us  my mother i was meaning  cecil closed the novel with a bang
oh cecilhow you made me jump  i will inflict joseph emery prank on you no longer  i can just remember us all three going into the country for the day and seeing as far as hindhead
it is the first thing that i remember  cecil got up the man was illbredhe hadnt put on his coat after tennishe didnt do
he would have strolled away if lucy had not stopped him
cecil do read the thing about the view  not while mr emerson is here to entertain us  noread away
i think nothings funnier than to hear silly things read out loud
if mr emerson thinks us frivolous he can go  this struck cecil as subtle and pleased him
it put their visitor in the position of a prig
somewhat mollified he sat down again
mr
emerson go and find tennis balls she opened the book
cecil must have his reading and anything else that he liked
but her attention wandered to georges mother whoaccording to mr
eagerhad been murdered in the sight of god andaccording to her sonhad seen as far as hindhead
am i really to go asked george
no of course not really she answered
chapter two said cecil yawning
find me chapter two if it isnt bothering you  chapter two was found and she glanced at its opening sentences
she thought she had gone mad
herehand me the book  she heard her voice saying it isnt worth readingits too silly to readi never saw such rubbishit oughtnt to be allowed to be printed  he took the book from her
leonora he read sat pensive and alone
before her lay the rich champaign of tuscany dotted over with many a smiling village
the season was spring  miss lavish knew somehow and had printed the past in draggled prose for cecil to read and for george to hear
a golden haze he read
he read afar off the towers of florence while the bank on which she sat was carpeted with violets
all unobserved antonio stole up behind her  lest cecil should see her face she turned to george and saw his face
he read there came from his lips no wordy protestation such as formal lovers use
no eloquence was his nor did he suffer from the lack of it
he simply enfolded her in his manly arms  this isnt the passage i wanted he informed them there is another much funnier further on he turned over the leaves
should we go in to tea said lucy whose voice remained steady
she led the way up the garden cecil following her george last
she thought a disaster was averted
but when they entered the shrubbery it came
the book as if it had not worked mischief enough had been forgotten and cecil must go back for it and george who loved passionately must blunder against her in the narrow path
no she gasped and for the second time was kissed by him
as if no more was possible he slipped back cecil rejoined her they reached the upper lawn alone
chapter xvi lying to george  but lucy had developed since the spring
that is to say she was now better able to stifle the emotions of which the conventions and the world disapprove
though the danger was greater she was not shaken by deep sobs
she said to cecil i am not coming in to teatell motheri must write some letters and went up to her room
then she prepared for action
love felt and returned love which our bodies exact and our hearts have transfigured love which is the most real thing that we shall ever meet reappeared now as the worlds enemy and she must stifle it
she sent for miss bartlett
the contest lay not between love and duty
perhaps there never is such a contest
it lay between the real and the pretended and lucys first aim was to defeat herself
as her brain clouded over as the memory of the views grew dim and the words of the book died away she returned to her old shibboleth of nerves
she conquered her breakdown tampering with the truth she forgot that the truth had ever been
remembering that she was engaged to cecil she compelled herself to confused remembrances of george he was nothing to her he never had been anything he had behaved abominably she had never encouraged him
the armour of falsehood is subtly wrought out of darkness and hides a man not only from others but from his own soul
in a few moments lucy was equipped for battle
something too awful has happened she began as soon as her cousin arrived
do you know anything about miss lavishs novel  miss bartlett looked surprised and said that she had not read the book nor known that it was published eleanor was a reticent woman at heart
there is a scene in it
the hero and heroine make love
do you know about that  dear  do you know about it please she repeated
they are on a hillside and florence is in the distance  my good lucia i am all at sea
i know nothing about it whatever  there are violets
i cannot believe it is a coincidence
charlotte charlotte how could you have told her
i have thought before speaking it must be you  told her what she asked with growing agitation
about that dreadful afternoon in february  miss bartlett was genuinely moved
oh lucy dearest girlshe hasnt put that in her book  lucy nodded
not so that one could recognize it
yes  then nevernevernever more shall eleanor lavish be a friend of mine  so you did tell  i did just happenwhen i had tea with her at romein the course of conversation  but charlottewhat about the promise you gave me when we were packing
why did you tell miss lavish when you wouldnt even let me tell mother  i will never forgive eleanor
she has betrayed my confidence  why did you tell her though
this is a most serious thing  why does any one tell anything
the question is eternal and it was not surprising that miss bartlett should only sigh faintly in response
she had done wrongshe admitted it she only hoped that she had not done harm she had told eleanor in the strictest confidence
lucy stamped with irritation
cecil happened to read out the passage aloud to me and to mr emerson it upset mr emerson and he insulted me again
behind cecils back
ugh
is it possible that men are such brutes
behind cecils back as we were walking up the garden  miss bartlett burst into selfaccusations and regrets
what is to be done now
can you tell me  oh lucyi shall never forgive myself never to my dying day
fancy if your prospects  i know said lucy wincing at the word
i see now why you wanted me to tell cecil and what you meant by some other source you knew that you had told miss lavish and that she was not reliable  it was miss bartletts turn to wince
however said the girl despising her cousins shiftiness whats dones done
you have put me in a most awkward position
how am i to get out of it  miss bartlett could not think
the days of her energy were over
she was a visitor not a chaperon and a discredited visitor at that
she stood with clasped hands while the girl worked herself into the necessary rage
he mustthat man must have such a setting down that he wont forget
and whos to give it him
i cant tell mother nowowing to you
nor cecil charlotte owing to you
i am caught up every way
i think i shall go mad
i have no one to help me
thats why ive sent for you
whats wanted is a man with a whip  miss bartlett agreed one wanted a man with a whip
yesbut its no good agreeing
whats to be done
we women go maundering on
what does a girl do when she comes across a cad  i always said he was a cad dear
give me credit for that at all events
from the very first momentwhen he said his father was having a bath  oh bother the credit and whos been right or wrong
weve both made a muddle of it
george emerson is still down the garden there and is he to be left unpunished or isnt he
i want to know  miss bartlett was absolutely helpless
her own exposure had unnerved her and thoughts were colliding painfully in her brain
she moved feebly to the window and tried to detect the cads white flannels among the laurels
you were ready enough at the bertolini when you rushed me off to rome
cant you speak again to him now  willingly would i move heaven and earth  i want something more definite said lucy contemptuously
will you speak to him
it is the least you can do surely considering it all happened because you broke your word  never again shall eleanor lavish be a friend of mine  really charlotte was outdoing herself
yes or no please yes or no  it is the kind of thing that only a gentleman can settle george emerson was coming up the garden with a tennis ball in his hand
very well said lucy with an angry gesture
no one will help me
i will speak to him myself and immediately she realized that this was what her cousin had intended all along
hullo emerson called freddy from below
found the lost ball
good man
want any tea and there was an irruption from the house on to the terrace
oh lucy but that is brave of you
i admire you  they had gathered round george who beckoned she felt over the rubbish the sloppy thoughts the furtive yearnings that were beginning to cumber her soul
her anger faded at the sight of him
ah
the emersons were fine people in their way
she had to subdue a rush in her blood before saying  freddy has taken him into the diningroom
the others are going down the garden
come
let us get this over quickly
come
i want you in the room of course  lucy do you mind doing it  how can you ask such a ridiculous question  poor lucy she stretched out her hand
i seem to bring nothing but misfortune wherever i go lucy nodded
she remembered their last evening at florencethe packing the candle the shadow of miss bartletts toque on the door
she was not to be trapped by pathos a second time
eluding her cousins caress she led the way downstairs
try the jam freddy was saying
the jams jolly good  george looking big and dishevelled was pacing up and down the diningroom
as she entered he stopped and said  nonothing to eat  you go down to the others said lucy charlotte and i will give mr emerson all he wants
wheres mother  shes started on her sunday writing
shes in the drawingroom  thats all right
you go away  he went off singing
lucy sat down at the table
miss bartlett who was thoroughly frightened took up a book and pretended to read
she would not be drawn into an elaborate speech
she just said i cant have it mr emerson
i cannot even talk to you
go out of this house and never come into it again as long as i live here flushing as she spoke and pointing to the door
i hate a row
go please  what  no discussion  but i cant  she shook her head
go please
i do not want to call in mr vyse  you dont mean he said absolutely ignoring miss bartlettyou dont mean that you are going to marry that man  the line was unexpected
she shrugged her shoulders as if his vulgarity wearied her
you are merely ridiculous she said quietly
then his words rose gravely over hers you cannot live with vyse
hes only for an acquaintance
he is for society and cultivated talk
he should know no one intimately least of all a woman  it was a new light on cecils character
have you ever talked to vyse without feeling tired  i can scarcely discuss  no but have you ever
he is the sort who are all right so long as they keep to thingsbooks picturesbut kill when they come to people
thats why ill speak out through all this muddle even now
its shocking enough to lose you in any case but generally a man must deny himself joy and i would have held back if your cecil had been a different person
i would never have let myself go
but i saw him first in the national gallery when he winced because my father mispronounced the names of great painters
then he brings us here and we find it is to play some silly trick on a kind neighbour
that is the man all overplaying tricks on people on the most sacred form of life that he can find
next i meet you together and find him protecting and teaching you and your mother to be shocked when it was for you to settle whether you were shocked or no
cecil all over again
he darent let a woman decide
hes the type whos kept europe back for a thousand years
every moment of his life hes forming you telling you whats charming or amusing or ladylike telling you what a man thinks womanly and you you of all women listen to his voice instead of to your own
so it was at the rectory when i met you both again so it has been the whole of this afternoon
thereforenot therefore i kissed you because the book made me do that and i wish to goodness i had more selfcontrol
im not ashamed
i dont apologize
but it has frightened you and you may not have noticed that i love you
or would you have told me to go and dealt with a tremendous thing so lightly
but thereforetherefore i settled to fight him  lucy thought of a very good remark
you say mr vyse wants me to listen to him mr emerson
pardon me for suggesting that you have caught the habit  and he took the shoddy reproof and touched it into immortality
he said  yes i have and sank down as if suddenly weary
im the same kind of brute at bottom
this desire to govern a womanit lies very deep and men and women must fight it together before they shall enter the garden
but i do love you surely in a better way than he does he thought
yesreally in a better way
i want you to have your own thoughts even when i hold you in my arms he stretched them towards her
lucy be quicktheres no time for us to talk nowcome to me as you came in the spring and afterwards i will be gentle and explain
i have cared for you since that man died
i cannot live without you no good i thought she is marrying someone else but i meet you again when all the world is glorious water and sun
as you came through the wood i saw that nothing else mattered
i called
i wanted to live and have my chance of joy  and mr vyse said lucy who kept commendably calm
does he not matter
that i love cecil and shall be his wife shortly
a detail of no importance i suppose  but he stretched his arms over the table towards her
may i ask what you intend to gain by this exhibition  he said it is our last chance
i shall do all that i can and as if he had done all else he turned to miss bartlett who sat like some portent against the skies of the evening
you wouldnt stop us this second time if you understood he said
i have been into the dark and i am going back into it unless you will try to understand  her long narrow head drove backwards and forwards as though demolishing some invisible obstacle
she did not answer
it is being young he said quietly picking up his racquet from the floor and preparing to go
it is being certain that lucy cares for me really
it is that love and youth matter intellectually  in silence the two women watched him
his last remark they knew was nonsense but was he going after it or not
would not he the cad the charlatan attempt a more dramatic finish
no
he was apparently content
he left them carefully closing the front door and when they looked through the hall window they saw him go up the drive and begin to climb the slopes of withered fern behind the house
their tongues were loosed and they burst into stealthy rejoicings
oh luciacome back hereoh what an awful man  lucy had no reactionat least not yet
well he amuses me she said
either im mad or else he is and im inclined to think its the latter
one more fuss through with you charlotte
many thanks
i think though that this is the last
my admirer will hardly trouble me again  and miss bartlett too essayed the roguish  well it isnt everyone who could boast such a conquest dearest is it
oh one oughtnt to laugh really
it might have been very serious
but you were so sensible and braveso unlike the girls of my day  lets go down to them  but once in the open air she paused
some emotionpity terror love but the emotion was strongseized her and she was aware of autumn
summer was ending and the evening brought her odours of decay the more pathetic because they were reminiscent of spring
that something or other mattered intellectually
a leaf violently agitated danced past her while other leaves lay motionless
that the earth was hastening to reenter darkness and the shadows of those trees over windy corner
hullo lucy
theres still light enough for another set if you twoll hurry  mr
emerson has had to go  what a nuisance
that spoils the four
i say cecil do play do theres a good chap
its floyds last day
do play tennis with us just this once  cecils voice came my dear freddy i am no athlete
as you well remarked this very morning there are some chaps who are no good for anything but books i plead guilty to being such a chap and will not inflict myself on you  the scales fell from lucys eyes
how had she stood cecil for a moment
he was absolutely intolerable and the same evening she broke off her engagement
chapter xvii lying to cecil  he was bewildered
he had nothing to say
he was not even angry but stood with a glass of whiskey between his hands trying to think what had led her to such a conclusion
she had chosen the moment before bed when in accordance with their bourgeois habit she always dispensed drinks to the men
freddy and mr floyd were sure to retire with their glasses while cecil invariably lingered sipping at his while she locked up the sideboard
i am very sorry about it she said i have carefully thought things over
we are too different
i must ask you to release me and try to forget that there ever was such a foolish girl  it was a suitable speech but she was more angry than sorry and her voice showed it
differenthowhow  i havent had a really good education for one thing she continued still on her knees by the sideboard
my italian trip came too late and i am forgetting all that i learnt there
i shall never be able to talk to your friends or behave as a wife of yours should  i dont understand you
you arent like yourself
youre tired lucy  tired she retorted kindling at once
that is exactly like you
you always think women dont mean what they say  well you sound tired as if something has worried you  what if i do
it doesnt prevent me from realizing the truth
i cant marry you and you will thank me for saying so some day  you had that bad headache yesterdayall rightfor she had exclaimed indignantly i see its much more than headaches
but give me a moments time he closed his eyes
you must excuse me if i say stupid things but my brain has gone to pieces
part of it lives three minutes back when i was sure that you loved me and the other parti find it difficulti am likely to say the wrong thing  it struck her that he was not behaving so badly and her irritation increased
she again desired a struggle not a discussion
to bring on the crisis she said  there are days when one sees clearly and this is one of them
things must come to a breakingpoint some time and it happens to be today
if you want to know quite a little thing decided me to speak to youwhen you wouldnt play tennis with freddy  i never do play tennis said cecil painfully bewildered i never could play
i dont understand a word you say  you can play well enough to make up a four
i thought it abominably selfish of you  no i cantwell never mind the tennis
why couldnt youcouldnt you have warned me if you felt anything wrong
you talked of our wedding at lunchat least you let me talk  i knew you wouldnt understand said lucy quite crossly
i might have known there would have been these dreadful explanations
of course it isnt the tennisthat was only the last straw to all i have been feeling for weeks
surely it was better not to speak until i felt certain she developed this position
often before i have wondered if i was fitted for your wifefor instance in london and are you fitted to be my husband
i dont think so
you dont like freddy nor my mother
there was always a lot against our engagement cecil but all our relations seemed pleased and we met so often and it was no good mentioning it untilwell until all things came to a point
they have today
i see clearly
i must speak
thats all  i cannot think you were right said cecil gently
i cannot tell why but though all that you say sounds true i feel that you are not treating me fairly
its all too horrible  whats the good of a scene  no good
but surely i have a right to hear a little more  he put down his glass and opened the window
from where she knelt jangling her keys she could see a slit of darkness and peering into it as if it would tell him that little more his long thoughtful face
dont open the window and youd better draw the curtain too freddy or any one might be outside he obeyed
i really think we had better go to bed if you dont mind
i shall only say things that will make me unhappy afterwards
as you say it is all too horrible and it is no good talking  but to cecil now that he was about to lose her she seemed each moment more desirable
he looked at her instead of through her for the first time since they were engaged
from a leonardo she had become a living woman with mysteries and forces of her own with qualities that even eluded art
his brain recovered from the shock and in a burst of genuine devotion he cried but i love you and i did think you loved me  i did not she said
i thought i did at first
i am sorry and ought to have refused you this last time too  he began to walk up and down the room and she grew more and more vexed at his dignified behaviour
she had counted on his being petty
it would have made things easier for her
by a cruel irony she was drawing out all that was finest in his disposition
you dont love me evidently
i dare say you are right not to
but it would hurt a little less if i knew why  becausea phrase came to her and she accepted ityoure the sort who cant know any one intimately  a horrified look came into his eyes
i dont mean exactly that
but you will question me though i beg you not to and i must say something
it is that more or less
when we were only acquaintances you let me be myself but now youre always protecting me her voice swelled
i wont be protected
i will choose for myself what is ladylike and right
to shield me is an insult
cant i be trusted to face the truth but i must get it secondhand through you
a womans place
you despise my motheri know you dobecause shes conventional and bothers over puddings but oh goodnessshe rose to her feetconventional cecil youre that for you may understand beautiful things but you dont know how to use them and you wrap yourself up in art and books and music and would try to wrap up me
i wont be stifled not by the most glorious music for people are more glorious and you hide them from me
thats why i break off my engagement
you were all right as long as you kept to things but when you came to people she stopped
there was a pause
then cecil said with great emotion  it is true  true on the whole she corrected full of some vague shame
true every word
it is a revelation
it isi  anyhow those are my reasons for not being your wife  he repeated the sort that can know no one intimately it is true
i fell to pieces the very first day we were engaged
i behaved like a cad to beebe and to your brother
you are even greater than i thought she withdrew a step
im not going to worry you
you are far too good to me
i shall never forget your insight and dear i only blame you for this you might have warned me in the early stages before you felt you wouldnt marry me and so have given me a chance to improve
i have never known you till this evening
i have just used you as a peg for my silly notions of what a woman should be
but this evening you are a different person new thoughtseven a new voice  what do you mean by a new voice she asked seized with incontrollable anger
i mean that a new person seems speaking through you said he
then she lost her balance
she cried if you think i am in love with someone else you are very much mistaken  of course i dont think that
you are not that kind lucy  oh yes you do think it
its your old idea the idea that has kept europe backi mean the idea that women are always thinking of men
if a girl breaks off her engagement everyone says oh she had some one else in her mind she hopes to get someone else its disgusting brutal
as if a girl cant break it off for the sake of freedom  he answered reverently i may have said that in the past
i shall never say it again
you have taught me better  she began to redden and pretended to examine the windows again
of course there is no question of someone else in this no jilting or any such nauseous stupidity
i beg your pardon most humbly if my words suggested that there was
i only meant that there was a force in you that i hadnt known of up till now  all right cecil that will do
dont apologize to me
it was my mistake  it is a question between ideals yours and minepure abstract ideals and yours are the nobler
i was bound up in the old vicious notions and all the time you were splendid and new his voice broke
i must actually thank you for what you have donefor showing me what i really am
solemnly i thank you for showing me a true woman
will you shake hands  of course i will said lucy twisting up her other hand in the curtains
goodnight cecil
goodbye
thats all right
im sorry about it
thank you very much for your gentleness  let me light your candle shall i  they went into the hall
thank you
goodnight again
god bless you lucy  goodbye cecil  she watched him steal upstairs while the shadows from three banisters passed over her face like the beat of wings
on the landing he paused strong in his renunciation and gave her a look of memorable beauty
for all his culture cecil was an ascetic at heart and nothing in his love became him like the leaving of it
she could never marry
in the tumult of her soul that stood firm
cecil believed in her she must some day believe in herself
she must be one of the women whom she had praised so eloquently who care for liberty and not for men she must forget that george loved her that george had been thinking through her and gained her this honourable release that george had gone away intowhat was itthe darkness
she put out the lamp
it did not do to think nor for the matter of that to feel
she gave up trying to understand herself and joined the vast armies of the benighted who follow neither the heart nor the brain and march to their destiny by catchwords
the armies are full of pleasant and pious folk
but they have yielded to the only enemy that mattersthe enemy within
they have sinned against passion and truth and vain will be their strife after virtue
as the years pass they are censured
their pleasantry and their piety show cracks their wit becomes cynicism their unselfishness hypocrisy they feel and produce discomfort wherever they go
they have sinned against eros and against pallas athene and not by any heavenly intervention but by the ordinary course of nature those allied deities will be avenged
lucy entered this army when she pretended to george that she did not love him and pretended to cecil that she loved no one
the night received her as it had received miss bartlett thirty years before
chapter xviii lying to mr beebe mrs honeychurch freddy and the servants  windy corner lay not on the summit of the ridge but a few hundred feet down the southern slope at the springing of one of the great buttresses that supported the hill
on either side of it was a shallow ravine filled with ferns and pinetrees and down the ravine on the left ran the highway into the weald
whenever mr beebe crossed the ridge and caught sight of these noble dispositions of the earth and poised in the middle of them windy cornerhe laughed
the situation was so glorious the house so commonplace not to say impertinent
the late mr honeychurch had affected the cube because it gave him the most accommodation for his money and the only addition made by his widow had been a small turret shaped like a rhinoceros horn where she could sit in wet weather and watch the carts going up and down the road
so impertinentand yet the house did for it was the home of people who loved their surroundings honestly
other houses in the neighborhood had been built by expensive architects over others their inmates had fidgeted sedulously yet all these suggested the accidental the temporary while windy corner seemed as inevitable as an ugliness of natures own creation
one might laugh at the house but one never shuddered
mr beebe was bicycling over this monday afternoon with a piece of gossip
he had heard from the miss alans
these admirable ladies since they could not go to cissie villa had changed their plans
they were going to greece instead
since florence did my poor sister so much good wrote miss catharine we do not see why we should not try athens this winter
of course athens is a plunge and the doctor has ordered her special digestive bread but after all we can take that with us and it is only getting first into a steamer and then into a train
but is there an english church and the letter went on to say i do not expect we shall go any further than athens but if you knew of a really comfortable pension at constantinople we should be so grateful  lucy would enjoy this letter and the smile with which mr beebe greeted windy corner was partly for her
she would see the fun of it and some of its beauty for she must see some beauty
though she was hopeless about pictures and though she dressed so unevenlyoh that cerise frock yesterday at churchshe must see some beauty in life or she could not play the piano as she did
he had a theory that musicians are incredibly complex and know far less than other artists what they want and what they are that they puzzle themselves as well as their friends that their psychology is a modern development and has not yet been understood
this theory had he known it had possibly just been illustrated by facts
ignorant of the events of yesterday he was only riding over to get some tea to see his niece and to observe whether miss honeychurch saw anything beautiful in the desire of two old ladies to visit athens
a carriage was drawn up outside windy corner and just as he caught sight of the house it started bowled up the drive and stopped abruptly when it reached the main road
therefore it must be the horse who always expected people to walk up the hill in case they tired him
the door opened obediently and two men emerged whom mr beebe recognized as cecil and freddy
they were an odd couple to go driving but he saw a trunk beside the coachmans legs
cecil who wore a bowler must be going away while freddy a capwas seeing him to the station
they walked rapidly taking the short cuts and reached the summit while the carriage was still pursuing the windings of the road
they shook hands with the clergyman but did not speak
so youre off for a minute mr vyse he asked
cecil said yes while freddy edged away
i was coming to show you this delightful letter from those friends of miss honeychurch he quoted from it
isnt it wonderful
isnt it romance
most certainly they will go to constantinople
they are taken in a snare that cannot fail
they will end by going round the world  cecil listened civilly and said he was sure that lucy would be amused and interested
isnt romance capricious
i never notice it in you young people you do nothing but play lawn tennis and say that romance is dead while the miss alans are struggling with all the weapons of propriety against the terrible thing
a really comfortable pension at constantinople so they call it out of decency but in their hearts they want a pension with magic windows opening on the foam of perilous seas in fairyland forlorn
no ordinary view will content the miss alans
they want the pension keats  im awfully sorry to interrupt mr beebe said freddy but have you any matches  i have said cecil and it did not escape mr beebes notice that he spoke to the boy more kindly
you have never met these miss alans have you mr vyse  never  then you dont see the wonder of this greek visit
i havent been to greece myself and dont mean to go and i cant imagine any of my friends going
it is altogether too big for our little lot
dont you think so
italy is just about as much as we can manage
italy is heroic but greece is godlike or devilishi am not sure which and in either case absolutely out of our suburban focus
all right freddyi am not being clever upon my word i am noti took the idea from another fellow and give me those matches when youve done with them he lit a cigarette and went on talking to the two young men
i was saying if our poor little cockney lives must have a background let it be italian
big enough in all conscience
the ceiling of the sistine chapel for me
there the contrast is just as much as i can realize
but not the parthenon not the frieze of phidias at any price and here comes the victoria  youre quite right said cecil
greece is not for our little lot and he got in
freddy followed nodding to the clergyman whom he trusted not to be pulling ones leg really
and before they had gone a dozen yards he jumped out and came running back for vyses matchbox which had not been returned
as he took it he said im so glad you only talked about books
cecils hard hit
lucy wont marry him
if youd gone on about her as you did about them he might have broken down  but when  late last night
i must go  perhaps they wont want me down there  nogo on
goodbye  thank goodness exclaimed mr beebe to himself and struck the saddle of his bicycle approvingly it was the one foolish thing she ever did
oh what a glorious riddance and after a little thought he negotiated the slope into windy corner light of heart
the house was again as it ought to becut off forever from cecils pretentious world
he would find miss minnie down in the garden
in the drawingroom lucy was tinkling at a mozart sonata
he hesitated a moment but went down the garden as requested
there he found a mournful company
it was a blustering day and the wind had taken and broken the dahlias
mrs honeychurch who looked cross was tying them up while miss bartlett unsuitably dressed impeded her with offers of assistance
at a little distance stood minnie and the gardenchild a minute importation each holding either end of a long piece of bass
oh how do you do mr beebe
gracious what a mess everything is
look at my scarlet pompoms and the wind blowing your skirts about and the ground so hard that not a prop will stick in and then the carriage having to go out when i had counted on having powell whogive every one their duedoes tie up dahlias properly  evidently mrs honeychurch was shattered
how do you do said miss bartlett with a meaning glance as though conveying that more than dahlias had been broken off by the autumn gales
here lennie the bass cried mrs honeychurch
the gardenchild who did not know what bass was stood rooted to the path with horror
minnie slipped to her uncle and whispered that everyone was very disagreeable today and that it was not her fault if dahliastrings would tear longways instead of across
come for a walk with me he told her
you have worried them as much as they can stand
mrs honeychurch i only called in aimlessly
i shall take her up to tea at the beehive tavern if i may  oh must you
yes donot the scissors thank you charlotte when both my hands are full alreadyim perfectly certain that the orange cactus will go before i can get to it  mr beebe who was an adept at relieving situations invited miss bartlett to accompany them to this mild festivity
yes charlotte i dont want youdo go theres nothing to stop about for either in the house or out of it  miss bartlett said that her duty lay in the dahlia bed but when she had exasperated everyone except minnie by a refusal she turned round and exasperated minnie by an acceptance
as they walked up the garden the orange cactus fell and mr beebes last vision was of the gardenchild clasping it like a lover his dark head buried in a wealth of blossom
it is terrible this havoc among the flowers he remarked
it is always terrible when the promise of months is destroyed in a moment enunciated miss bartlett
perhaps we ought to send miss honeychurch down to her mother
or will she come with us  i think we had better leave lucy to herself and to her own pursuits  theyre angry with miss honeychurch because she was late for breakfast whispered minnie and floyd has gone and mr vyse has gone and freddy wont play with me
in fact uncle arthur the house is not at all what it was yesterday  dont be a prig said her uncle arthur
go and put on your boots  he stepped into the drawingroom where lucy was still attentively pursuing the sonatas of mozart
she stopped when he entered
how do you do
miss bartlett and minnie are coming with me to tea at the beehive
would you come too  i dont think i will thank you  no i didnt suppose you would care to much  lucy turned to the piano and struck a few chords
how delicate those sonatas are said mr beebe though at the bottom of his heart he thought them silly little things
lucy passed into schumann
miss honeychurch  yes  i met them on the hill
your brother told me  oh he did she sounded annoyed
mr beebe felt hurt for he had thought that she would like him to be told
i neednt say that it will go no further  mother charlotte cecil freddy you said lucy playing a note for each person who knew and then playing a sixth note
if youll let me say so i am very glad and i am certain that you have done the right thing  so i hoped other people would think but they dont seem to  i could see that miss bartlett thought it unwise  so does mother
mother minds dreadfully  i am very sorry for that said mr beebe with feeling
mrs honeychurch who hated all changes did mind but not nearly as much as her daughter pretended and only for the minute
it was really a ruse of lucys to justify her despondencya ruse of which she was not herself conscious for she was marching in the armies of darkness
and freddy minds  still freddy never hit it off with vyse much did he
i gathered that he disliked the engagement and felt it might separate him from you  boys are so odd  minnie could be heard arguing with miss bartlett through the floor
tea at the beehive apparently involved a complete change of apparel
mr beebe saw that lucyvery properlydid not wish to discuss her action so after a sincere expression of sympathy he said i have had an absurd letter from miss alan
that was really what brought me over
i thought it might amuse you all  how delightful said lucy in a dull voice
for the sake of something to do he began to read her the letter
after a few words her eyes grew alert and soon she interrupted him with going abroad
when do they start  next week i gather  did freddy say whether he was driving straight back  no he didnt  because i do hope he wont go gossiping  so she did want to talk about her broken engagement
always complaisant he put the letter away
but she at once exclaimed in a high voice oh do tell me more about the miss alans
how perfectly splendid of them to go abroad  i want them to start from venice and go in a cargo steamer down the illyrian coast  she laughed heartily
oh delightful
i wish theyd take me  has italy filled you with the fever of travel
perhaps george emerson is right
he says that italy is only an euphuism for fate  oh not italy but constantinople
i have always longed to go to constantinople
constantinople is practically asia isnt it  mr beebe reminded her that constantinople was still unlikely and that the miss alans only aimed at athens with delphi perhaps if the roads are safe but this made no difference to her enthusiasm
she had always longed to go to greece even more it seemed
he saw to his surprise that she was apparently serious
i didnt realize that you and the miss alans were still such friends after cissie villa  oh thats nothing i assure you cissie villas nothing to me i would give anything to go with them  would your mother spare you again so soon
you have scarcely been home three months  she must spare me cried lucy in growing excitement
i simply must go away
i have to she ran her fingers hysterically through her hair
dont you see that i have to go away
i didnt realize at the timeand of course i want to see constantinople so particularly  you mean that since you have broken off your engagement you feel  yes yes
i knew youd understand  mr beebe did not quite understand
why could not miss honeychurch repose in the bosom of her family
cecil had evidently taken up the dignified line and was not going to annoy her
then it struck him that her family itself might be annoying
he hinted this to her and she accepted the hint eagerly
yes of course to go to constantinople until they are used to the idea and everything has calmed down  i am afraid it has been a bothersome business he said gently
no not at all
cecil was very kind indeed onlyi had better tell you the whole truth since you have heard a littleit was that he is so masterful
i found that he wouldnt let me go my own way
he would improve me in places where i cant be improved
cecil wont let a woman decide for herselfin fact he darent
what nonsense i do talk
but that is the kind of thing  it is what i gathered from my own observation of mr vyse it is what i gather from all that i have known of you
i do sympathize and agree most profoundly
i agree so much that you must let me make one little criticism is it worth while rushing off to greece  but i must go somewhere she cried
i have been worrying all the morning and here comes the very thing she struck her knees with clenched fists and repeated i must
and the time i shall have with mother and all the money she spent on me last spring
you all think much too highly of me
i wish you werent so kind at this moment miss bartlett entered and her nervousness increased
i must get away ever so far
i must know my own mind and where i want to go  come along tea tea tea said mr beebe and bustled his guests out of the frontdoor
he hustled them so quickly that he forgot his hat
when he returned for it he heard to his relief and surprise the tinkling of a mozart sonata
she is playing again he said to miss bartlett
lucy can always play was the acid reply
one is very thankful that she has such a resource
she is evidently much worried as of course she ought to be
i know all about it
the marriage was so near that it must have been a hard struggle before she could wind herself up to speak  miss bartlett gave a kind of wriggle and he prepared for a discussion
he had never fathomed miss bartlett
as he had put it to himself at florence she might yet reveal depths of strangeness if not of meaning but she was so unsympathetic that she must be reliable
he assumed that much and he had no hesitation in discussing lucy with her
minnie was fortunately collecting ferns
she opened the discussion with we had much better let the matter drop  i wonder  it is of the highest importance that there should be no gossip in summer street
it would be death to gossip about mr vyses dismissal at the present moment  mr beebe raised his eyebrows
death is a strong wordsurely too strong
there was no question of tragedy
he said of course miss honeychurch will make the fact public in her own way and when she chooses
freddy only told me because he knew she would not mind  i know said miss bartlett civilly
yet freddy ought not to have told even you
one cannot be too careful  quite so  i do implore absolute secrecy
a chance word to a chattering friend and  exactly he was used to these nervous old maids and to the exaggerated importance that they attach to words
a rector lives in a web of petty secrets and confidences and warnings and the wiser he is the less he will regard them
he will change the subject as did mr beebe saying cheerfully have you heard from any bertolini people lately
i believe you keep up with miss lavish
it is odd how we of that pension who seemed such a fortuitous collection have been working into one anothers lives
two three four six of usno eight i had forgotten the emersonshave kept more or less in touch
we must really give the signora a testimonial  and miss bartlett not favouring the scheme they walked up the hill in a silence which was only broken by the rector naming some fern
on the summit they paused
the sky had grown wilder since he stood there last hour giving to the land a tragic greatness that is rare in surrey
grey clouds were charging across tissues of white which stretched and shredded and tore slowly until through their final layers there gleamed a hint of the disappearing blue
summer was retreating
the wind roared the trees groaned yet the noise seemed insufficient for those vast operations in heaven
the weather was breaking up breaking broken and it is a sense of the fit rather than of the supernatural that equips such crises with the salvos of angelic artillery
mr beebes eyes rested on windy corner where lucy sat practising mozart
no smile came to his lips and changing the subject again he said we shant have rain but we shall have darkness so let us hurry on
the darkness last night was appalling  they reached the beehive tavern at about five oclock
that amiable hostelry possesses a verandah in which the young and the unwise do dearly love to sit while guests of more mature years seek a pleasant sanded room and have tea at a table comfortably
mr beebe saw that miss bartlett would be cold if she sat out and that minnie would be dull if she sat in so he proposed a division of forces
they would hand the child her food through the window
thus he was incidentally enabled to discuss the fortunes of lucy
i have been thinking miss bartlett he said and unless you very much object i would like to reopen that discussion she bowed
nothing about the past
i know little and care less about that i am absolutely certain that it is to your cousins credit
she has acted loftily and rightly and it is like her gentle modesty to say that we think too highly of her
but the future
seriously what do you think of this greek plan he pulled out the letter again
i dont know whether you overheard but she wants to join the miss alans in their mad career
its alli cant explainits wrong  miss bartlett read the letter in silence laid it down seemed to hesitate and then read it again
i cant see the point of it myself  to his astonishment she replied there i cannot agree with you
in it i spy lucys salvation  really
now why  she wanted to leave windy corner  i knowbut it seems so odd so unlike her soi was going to sayselfish  it is natural surelyafter such painful scenesthat she should desire a change  here apparently was one of those points that the male intellect misses
mr beebe exclaimed so she says herself and since another lady agrees with her i must own that i am partially convinced
perhaps she must have a change
i have no sisters orand i dont understand these things
but why need she go as far as greece  you may well ask that replied miss bartlett who was evidently interested and had almost dropped her evasive manner
why greece
what is it minnie dearjam
why not tunbridge wells
oh mr beebe
i had a long and most unsatisfactory interview with dear lucy this morning
i cannot help her
i will say no more
perhaps i have already said too much
i am not to talk
i wanted her to spend six months with me at tunbridge wells and she refused  mr beebe poked at a crumb with his knife
but my feelings are of no importance
i know too well that i get on lucys nerves
our tour was a failure
she wanted to leave florence and when we got to rome she did not want to be in rome and all the time i felt that i was spending her mothers money  let us keep to the future though interrupted mr beebe
i want your advice  very well said charlotte with a choky abruptness that was new to him though familiar to lucy
i for one will help her to go to greece
will you  mr beebe considered
it is absolutely necessary she continued lowering her veil and whispering through it with a passion an intensity that surprised him
i knowi know the darkness was coming on and he felt that this odd woman really did know
she must not stop here a moment and we must keep quiet till she goes
i trust that the servants know nothing
afterwardsbut i may have said too much already
only lucy and i are helpless against mrs honeychurch alone
if you help we may succeed
otherwise  otherwise  otherwise she repeated as if the word held finality
yes i will help her said the clergyman setting his jaw firm
come let us go back now and settle the whole thing up  miss bartlett burst into florid gratitude
the tavern signa beehive trimmed evenly with beescreaked in the wind outside as she thanked him
mr beebe did not quite understand the situation but then he did not desire to understand it nor to jump to the conclusion of another man that would have attracted a grosser mind
he only felt that miss bartlett knew of some vague influence from which the girl desired to be delivered and which might well be clothed in the fleshly form
its very vagueness spurred him into knighterrantry
his belief in celibacy so reticent so carefully concealed beneath his tolerance and culture now came to the surface and expanded like some delicate flower
they that marry do well but they that refrain do better so ran his belief and he never heard that an engagement was broken off but with a slight feeling of pleasure
in the case of lucy the feeling was intensified through dislike of cecil and he was willing to go furtherto place her out of danger until she could confirm her resolution of virginity
the feeling was very subtle and quite undogmatic and he never imparted it to any other of the characters in this entanglement
yet it existed and it alone explains his action subsequently and his influence on the action of others
the compact that he made with miss bartlett in the tavern was to help not only lucy but religion also
they hurried home through a world of black and grey
he conversed on indifferent topics the emersons need of a housekeeper servants italian servants novels about italy novels with a purpose could literature influence life
windy corner glimmered
in the garden mrs honeychurch now helped by freddy still wrestled with the lives of her flowers
it gets too dark she said hopelessly
this comes of putting off
we might have known the weather would break up soon and now lucy wants to go to greece
i dont know what the worlds coming to  mrs
honeychurch he said go to greece she must
come up to the house and lets talk it over
do you in the first place mind her breaking with vyse  mr
beebe im thankfulsimply thankful  so am i said freddy
good
now come up to the house  they conferred in the diningroom for half an hour
lucy would never have carried the greek scheme alone
it was expensive and dramaticboth qualities that her mother loathed
nor would charlotte have succeeded
the honours of the day rested with mr beebe
by his tact and common sense and by his influence as a clergymanfor a clergyman who was not a fool influenced mrs honeychurch greatlyhe bent her to their purpose i dont see why greece is necessary she said but as you do i suppose it is all right
it must be something i cant understand
lucy
lets tell her
lucy  she is playing the piano mr beebe said
he opened the door and heard the words of a song       look not thou on beautys charming  i didnt know that miss honeychurch sang too    sit thou still when kings are arming    taste not when the winecup glistens  its a song that cecil gave her
how odd girls are  whats that called lucy stopping short
all right dear said mrs honeychurch kindly
she went into the drawingroom and mr beebe heard her kiss lucy and say i am sorry i was so cross about greece but it came on the top of the dahlias  rather a hard voice said thank you mother that doesnt matter a bit  and you are right toogreece will be all right you can go if the miss alans will have you  oh splendid
oh thank you  mr beebe followed
lucy still sat at the piano with her hands over the keys
she was glad but he had expected greater gladness
her mother bent over her
freddy to whom she had been singing reclined on the floor with his head against her and an unlit pipe between his lips
oddly enough the group was beautiful
mr beebe who loved the art of the past was reminded of a favourite theme the santa conversazione in which people who care for one another are painted chatting together about noble thingsa theme neither sensual nor sensational and therefore ignored by the art of today
why should lucy want either to marry or to travel when she had such friends at home
taste not when the winecup glistens    speak not when the people listens  she continued
heres mr beebe  mr
beebe knows my rude ways  its a beautiful song and a wise one said he
go on  it isnt very good she said listlessly
i forget whyharmony or something  i suspected it was unscholarly
its so beautiful  the tunes right enough said freddy but the words are rotten
why throw up the sponge  how stupidly you talk said his sister
the santa conversazione was broken up
after all there was no reason that lucy should talk about greece or thank him for persuading her mother so he said goodbye
freddy lit his bicycle lamp for him in the porch and with his usual felicity of phrase said this has been a day and a half      stop thine ear against the singer  wait a minute she is finishing     from the red gold keep thy finger     vacant heart and hand and eye     easy live and quiet die  i love weather like this said freddy
mr beebe passed into it
the two main facts were clear
she had behaved splendidly and he had helped her
he could not expect to master the details of so big a change in a girls life
if here and there he was dissatisfied or puzzled he must acquiesce she was choosing the better part
vacant heart and hand and eye  perhaps the song stated the better part rather too strongly
he half fancied that the soaring accompanimentwhich he did not lose in the shout of the galereally agreed with freddy and was gently criticizing the words that it adorned    vacant heart and hand and eye    easy live and quiet die  however for the fourth time windy corner lay poised below himnow as a beacon in the roaring tides of darkness
chapter xix lying to mr emerson  the miss alans were found in their beloved temperance hotel near bloomsburya clean airless establishment much patronized by provincial england
they always perched there before crossing the great seas and for a week or two would fidget gently over clothes guidebooks mackintosh squares digestive bread and other continental necessaries
that there are shops abroad even in athens never occurred to them for they regarded travel as a species of warfare only to be undertaken by those who have been fully armed at the haymarket stores
miss honeychurch they trusted would take care to equip herself duly
quinine could now be obtained in tabloids paper soap was a great help towards freshening up ones face in the train
lucy promised a little depressed
but of course you know all about these things and you have mr vyse to help you
a gentleman is such a standby  mrs honeychurch who had come up to town with her daughter began to drum nervously upon her cardcase
we think it so good of mr vyse to spare you miss catharine continued
it is not every young man who would be so unselfish
but perhaps he will come out and join you later on  or does his work keep him in london said miss teresa the more acute and less kindly of the two sisters
however we shall see him when he sees you off
i do so long to see him  no one will see lucy off interposed mrs honeychurch
she doesnt like it  no i hate seeingsoff said lucy
really
how funny
i should have thought that in this case  oh mrs honeychurch you arent going
it is such a pleasure to have met you  they escaped and lucy said with relief thats all right
we just got through that time  but her mother was annoyed
i should be told dear that i am unsympathetic
but i cannot see why you didnt tell your friends about cecil and be done with it
there all the time we had to sit fencing and almost telling lies and be seen through too i dare say which is most unpleasant  lucy had plenty to say in reply
she described the miss alans character they were such gossips and if one told them the news would be everywhere in no time
but why shouldnt it be everywhere in no time  because i settled with cecil not to announce it until i left england
i shall tell them then
its much pleasanter
how wet it is
lets turn in here  here was the british museum
mrs honeychurch refused
if they must take shelter let it be in a shop
lucy felt contemptuous for she was on the tack of caring for greek sculpture and had already borrowed a mythical dictionary from mr beebe to get up the names of the goddesses and gods
oh well let it be shop then
lets go to mudies
ill buy a guidebook  you know lucy you and charlotte and mr beebe all tell me im so stupid so i suppose i am but i shall never understand this holeandcorner work
youve got rid of cecilwell and good and im thankful hes gone though i did feel angry for the minute
but why not announce it
why this hushing up and tiptoeing  its only for a few days  but why at all  lucy was silent
she was drifting away from her mother
it was quite easy to say because george emerson has been bothering me and if he hears ive given up cecil may begin againquite easy and it had the incidental advantage of being true
but she could not say it
she disliked confidences for they might lead to selfknowledge and to that king of terrorslight
ever since that last evening at florence she had deemed it unwise to reveal her soul
mrs honeychurch too was silent
she was thinking my daughter wont answer me she would rather be with those inquisitive old maids than with freddy and me
any rag tag and bobtail apparently does if she can leave her home and as in her case thoughts never remained unspoken long she burst out with youre tired of windy corner  this was perfectly true
lucy had hoped to return to windy corner when she escaped from cecil but she discovered that her home existed no longer
it might exist for freddy who still lived and thought straight but not for one who had deliberately warped the brain
she did not acknowledge that her brain was warped for the brain itself must assist in that acknowledgment and she was disordering the very instruments of life
she only felt i do not love george i broke off my engagement because i did not love george i must go to greece because i do not love george it is more important that i should look up gods in the dictionary than that i should help my mother everyone else is behaving very badly she only felt irritable and petulant and anxious to do what she was not expected to do and in this spirit she proceeded with the conversation
oh mother what rubbish you talk
of course im not tired of windy corner  then why not say so at once instead of considering half an hour  she laughed faintly half a minute would be nearer  perhaps you would like to stay away from your home altogether  hush mother
people will hear you for they had entered mudies
she bought baedeker and then continued of course i want to live at home but as we are talking about it i may as well say that i shall want to be away in the future more than i have been
you see i come into my money next year  tears came into her mothers eyes
driven by nameless bewilderment by what is in older people termed eccentricity lucy determined to make this point clear
ive seen the world so littlei felt so out of things in italy
i have seen so little of life one ought to come up to london morenot a cheap ticket like today but to stop
i might even share a flat for a little with some other girl  and mess with typewriters and latchkeys exploded mrs honeychurch
and agitate and scream and be carried off kicking by the police
and call it a missionwhen no one wants you
and call it dutywhen it means that you cant stand your own home
and call it workwhen thousands of men are starving with the competition as it is
and then to prepare yourself find two doddering old ladies and go abroad with them  i want more independence said lucy lamely she knew that she wanted something and independence is a useful cry we can always say that we have not got it
she tried to remember her emotions in florence those had been sincere and passionate and had suggested beauty rather than short skirts and latchkeys
but independence was certainly her cue
very well
take your independence and be gone
rush up and down and round the world and come back as thin as a lath with the bad food
despise the house that your father built and the garden that he planted and our dear viewand then share a flat with another girl  lucy screwed up her mouth and said perhaps i spoke hastily  oh goodness her mother flashed
how you do remind me of charlotte bartlett  charlotte flashed lucy in her turn pierced at last by a vivid pain
more every moment  i dont know what you mean mother charlotte and i are not the very least alike  well i see the likeness
the same eternal worrying the same taking back of words
you and charlotte trying to divide two apples among three people last night might be sisters  what rubbish
and if you dislike charlotte so its rather a pity you asked her to stop
i warned you about her i begged you implored you not to but of course it was not listened to  there you go  i beg your pardon  charlotte again my dear thats all her very words  lucy clenched her teeth
my point is that you oughtnt to have asked charlotte to stop
i wish you would keep to the point and the conversation died off into a wrangle
she and her mother shopped in silence spoke little in the train little again in the carriage which met them at dorking station
it had poured all day and as they ascended through the deep surrey lanes showers of water fell from the overhanging beechtrees and rattled on the hood
lucy complained that the hood was stuffy
leaning forward she looked out into the steaming dusk and watched the carriagelamp pass like a searchlight over mud and leaves and reveal nothing beautiful
the crush when charlotte gets in will be abominable she remarked
for they were to pick up miss bartlett at summer street where she had been dropped as the carriage went down to pay a call on mr beebes old mother
we shall have to sit three a side because the trees drop and yet it isnt raining
oh for a little air then she listened to the horses hoofshe has not toldhe has not told that melody was blurred by the soft road
cant we have the hood down she demanded and her mother with sudden tenderness said very well old lady stop the horse and the horse was stopped and lucy and powell wrestled with the hood and squirted water down mrs honeychurchs neck
but now that the hood was down she did see something that she would have missedthere were no lights in the windows of cissie villa and round the garden gate she fancied she saw a padlock
is that house to let again powell she called
yes miss he replied
have they gone  it is too far out of town for the young gentleman and his fathers rheumatism has come on so he cant stop on alone so they are trying to let furnished was the answer
they have gone then  yes miss they have gone  lucy sank back
the carriage stopped at the rectory
she got out to call for miss bartlett
so the emersons had gone and all this bother about greece had been unnecessary
waste
that word seemed to sum up the whole of life
wasted plans wasted money wasted love and she had wounded her mother
was it possible that she had muddled things away
quite possible
other people had
when the maid opened the door she was unable to speak and stared stupidly into the hall
miss bartlett at once came forward and after a long preamble asked a great favour might she go to church
mr beebe and his mother had already gone but she had refused to start until she obtained her hostesss full sanction for it would mean keeping the horse waiting a good ten minutes more
certainly said the hostess wearily
i forgot it was friday
lets all go
powell can go round to the stables  lucy dearest  no church for me thank you  a sigh and they departed
the church was invisible but up in the darkness to the left there was a hint of colour
this was a stained window through which some feeble light was shining and when the door opened lucy heard mr beebes voice running through the litany to a minute congregation
even their church built upon the slope of the hill so artfully with its beautiful raised transept and its spire of silvery shingleeven their church had lost its charm and the thing one never talked aboutreligionwas fading like all the other things
she followed the maid into the rectory
would she object to sitting in mr beebes study
there was only that one fire
she would not object
some one was there already for lucy heard the words a lady to wait sir  old mr emerson was sitting by the fire with his foot upon a goutstool
oh miss honeychurch that you should come he quavered and lucy saw an alteration in him since last sunday
not a word would come to her lips
george she had faced and could have faced again but she had forgotten how to treat his father
miss honeychurch dear we are so sorry
george is so sorry
he thought he had a right to try
i cannot blame my boy and yet i wish he had told me first
he ought not to have tried
i knew nothing about it at all  if only she could remember how to behave
he held up his hand
but you must not scold him  lucy turned her back and began to look at mr beebes books
i taught him he quavered to trust in love
i said when love comes that is reality i said passion does not blind
no
passion is sanity and the woman you love she is the only person you will ever really understand he sighed true everlastingly true though my day is over and though there is the result
poor boy
he is so sorry
he said he knew it was madness when you brought your cousin in that whatever you felt you did not mean
yethis voice gathered strength he spoke out to make certainmiss honeychurch do you remember italy  lucy selected a booka volume of old testament commentaries
holding it up to her eyes she said i have no wish to discuss italy or any subject connected with your son  but you do remember it  he has misbehaved himself from the first  i only was told that he loved you last sunday
i never could judge behaviour
iisuppose he has  feeling a little steadier she put the book back and turned round to him
his face was drooping and swollen but his eyes though they were sunken deep gleamed with a childs courage
why he has behaved abominably she said
i am glad he is sorry
do you know what he did  not abominably was the gentle correction
he only tried when he should not have tried
you have all you want miss honeychurch you are going to marry the man you love
do not go out of georges life saying he is abominable  no of course said lucy ashamed at the reference to cecil
abominable is much too strong
i am sorry i used it about your son
i think i will go to church after all
my mother and my cousin have gone
i shall not be so very late  especially as he has gone under he said quietly
what was that  gone under naturally he beat his palms together in silence his head fell on his chest
i dont understand  as his mother did  but mr emersonmr emersonwhat are you talking about  when i wouldnt have george baptized said he
lucy was frightened
and she agreed that baptism was nothing but he caught that fever when he was twelve and she turned round
she thought it a judgement he shuddered
oh horrible when we had given up that sort of thing and broken away from her parents
oh horribleworst of allworse than death when you have made a little clearing in the wilderness planted your little garden let in your sunlight and then the weeds creep in again
a judgement
and our boy had typhoid because no clergyman had dropped water on him in church
is it possible miss honeychurch
shall we slip back into the darkness for ever  i dont know gasped lucy
i dont understand this sort of thing
i was not meant to understand it  but mr
eagerhe came when i was out and acted according to his principles
i dont blame him or any one but by the time george was well she was ill
he made her think about sin and she went under thinking about it  it was thus that mr emerson had murdered his wife in the sight of god
oh how terrible said lucy forgetting her own affairs at last
he was not baptized said the old man
i did hold firm and he looked with unwavering eyes at the rows of books as ifat what costhe had won a victory over them
my boy shall go back to the earth untouched  she asked whether young mr emerson was ill  ohlast sunday he started into the present
george last sundayno not ill just gone under
he is never ill
but he is his mothers son
her eyes were his and she had that forehead that i think so beautiful and he will not think it worth while to live
it was always touch and go
he will live but he will not think it worth while to live
he will never think anything worth while
you remember that church at florence  lucy did remember and how she had suggested that george should collect postage stamps
after you left florencehorrible
then we took the house here and he goes bathing with your brother and became better
you saw him bathing  i am so sorry but it is no good discussing this affair
i am deeply sorry about it  then there came something about a novel
i didnt follow it at all i had to hear so much and he minded telling me he finds me too old
ah well one must have failures
george comes down tomorrow and takes me up to his london rooms
he cant bear to be about here and i must be where he is  mr
emerson cried the girl dont leave at least not on my account
i am going to greece
dont leave your comfortable house  it was the first time her voice had been kind and he smiled
how good everyone is
and look at mr beebe housing mecame over this morning and heard i was going
here i am so comfortable with a fire  yes but you wont go back to london
its absurd  i must be with george i must make him care to live and down here he cant
he says the thought of seeing you and of hearing about youi am not justifying him i am only saying what has happened  oh mr emersonshe took hold of his handyou mustnt
ive been bother enough to the world by now
i cant have you moving out of your house when you like it and perhaps losing money through itall on my account
you must stop
i am just going to greece  all the way to greece  her manner altered
to greece  so you must stop
you wont talk about this business i know
i can trust you both  certainly you can
we either have you in our lives or leave you to the life that you have chosen  i shouldnt want  i suppose mr vyse is very angry with george
no it was wrong of george to try
we have pushed our beliefs too far
i fancy that we deserve sorrow  she looked at the books againblack brown and that acrid theological blue
they surrounded the visitors on every side they were piled on the tables they pressed against the very ceiling
to lucy who could not see that mr emerson was profoundly religious and differed from mr beebe chiefly by his acknowledgment of passionit seemed dreadful that the old man should crawl into such a sanctum when he was unhappy and be dependent on the bounty of a clergyman
more certain than ever that she was tired he offered her his chair
no please sit still
i think i will sit in the carriage  miss honeychurch you do sound tired  not a bit said lucy with trembling lips
but you are and theres a look of george about you
and what were you saying about going abroad  she was silent
greeceand she saw that he was thinking the word overgreece but you were to be married this year i thought  not till january it wasnt said lucy clasping her hands
would she tell an actual lie when it came to the point
i suppose that mr vyse is going with you
i hopeit isnt because george spoke that you are both going  no  i hope that you will enjoy greece with mr vyse  thank you  at that moment mr beebe came back from church
his cassock was covered with rain
thats all right he said kindly
i counted on you two keeping each other company
its pouring again
the entire congregation which consists of your cousin your mother and my mother stands waiting in the church till the carriage fetches it
did powell go round  i think so ill see  noof course ill see
how are the miss alans  very well thank you  did you tell mr emerson about greece  ii did  dont you think it very plucky of her mr emerson to undertake the two miss alans
now miss honeychurch go backkeep warm
i think three is such a courageous number to go travelling and he hurried off to the stables
he is not going she said hoarsely
i made a slip
mr vyse does stop behind in england  somehow it was impossible to cheat this old man
to george to cecil she would have lied again but he seemed so near the end of things so dignified in his approach to the gulf of which he gave one account and the books that surrounded him another so mild to the rough paths that he had traversed that the true chivalrynot the wornout chivalry of sex but the true chivalry that all the young may show to all the oldawoke in her and at whatever risk she told him that cecil was not her companion to greece
and she spoke so seriously that the risk became a certainty and he lifting his eyes said you are leaving him
you are leaving the man you love  ii had to  why miss honeychurch why  terror came over her and she lied again
she made the long convincing speech that she had made to mr beebe and intended to make to the world when she announced that her engagement was no more
he heard her in silence and then said my dear i am worried about you
it seems to medreamily she was not alarmedthat you are in a muddle  she shook her head
take an old mans word theres nothing worse than a muddle in all the world
it is easy to face death and fate and the things that sound so dreadful
it is on my muddles that i look back with horroron the things that i might have avoided
we can help one another but little
i used to think i could teach young people the whole of life but i know better now and all my teaching of george has come down to this beware of muddle
do you remember in that church when you pretended to be annoyed with me and werent
do you remember before when you refused the room with the view
those were muddleslittle but ominousand i am fearing that you are in one now she was silent
dont trust me miss honeychurch
though life is very glorious it is difficult  she was still silent
life wrote a friend of mine is a public performance on the violin in which you must learn the instrument as you go along i think he puts it well
man has to pick up the use of his functions as he goes alongespecially the function of love then he burst out excitedly thats it thats what i mean
you love george  and after his long preamble the three words burst against lucy like waves from the open sea
but you do he went on not waiting for contradiction
you love the boy body and soul plainly directly as he loves you and no other word expresses it
you wont marry the other man for his sake  how dare you gasped lucy with the roaring of waters in her ears
oh how like a mani mean to suppose that a woman is always thinking about a man  but you are  she summoned physical disgust
youre shocked but i mean to shock you
its the only hope at times
i can reach you no other way
you must marry or your life will be wasted
you have gone too far to retreat
i have no time for the tenderness and the comradeship and the poetry and the things that really matter and for which you marry
i know that with george you will find them and that you love him
then be his wife
he is already part of you
though you fly to greece and never see him again or forget his very name george will work in your thoughts till you die
it isnt possible to love and to part
you will wish that it was
you can transmute love ignore it muddle it but you can never pull it out of you
i know by experience that the poets are right love is eternal  lucy began to cry with anger and though her anger passed away soon her tears remained
i only wish poets would say this too love is of the body not the body but of the body
ah
the misery that would be saved if we confessed that
ah
for a little directness to liberate the soul
your soul dear lucy
i hate the word now because of all the cant with which superstition has wrapped it round
but we have souls
i cannot say how they came nor whither they go but we have them and i see you ruining yours
i cannot bear it
it is again the darkness creeping in it is hell then he checked himself
what nonsense i have talkedhow abstract and remote
and i have made you cry
dear girl forgive my prosiness marry my boy
when i think what life is and how seldom love is answered by lovemarry him it is one of the moments for which the world was made  she could not understand him the words were indeed remote
yet as he spoke the darkness was withdrawn veil after veil and she saw to the bottom of her soul
then lucy  youve frightened me she moaned
cecilmr beebethe tickets boughteverything she fell sobbing into the chair
im caught in the tangle
i must suffer and grow old away from him
i cannot break the whole of life for his sake
they trusted me  a carriage drew up at the frontdoor
give george my loveonce only
tell him muddle then she arranged her veil while the tears poured over her cheeks inside
lucy  nothey are in the halloh please not mr emersonthey trust me  but why should they when you have deceived them  mr beebe opened the door saying heres my mother  youre not worthy of their trust  whats that said mr beebe sharply
i was saying why should you trust her when she deceived you  one minute mother he came in and shut the door
i dont follow you mr emerson
to whom do you refer
trust whom  i mean she has pretended to you that she did not love george
they have loved one another all along  mr beebe looked at the sobbing girl
he was very quiet and his white face with its ruddy whiskers seemed suddenly inhuman
a long black column he stood and awaited her reply
i shall never marry him quavered lucy
a look of contempt came over him and he said why not  mr
beebei have misled youi have misled myself  oh rubbish miss honeychurch  it is not rubbish said the old man hotly
its the part of people that you dont understand  mr beebe laid his hand on the old mans shoulder pleasantly
lucy
lucy called voices from the carriage
mr
beebe could you help me  he looked amazed at the request and said in a low stern voice i am more grieved than i can possibly express
it is lamentable lamentableincredible  whats wrong with the boy fired up the other again
nothing mr emerson except that he no longer interests me
marry george miss honeychurch
he will do admirably  he walked out and left them
they heard him guiding his mother upstairs
lucy the voices called
she turned to mr emerson in despair
but his face revived her
it was the face of a saint who understood
now it is all dark
now beauty and passion seem never to have existed
i know
but remember the mountains over florence and the view
ah dear if i were george and gave you one kiss it would make you brave
you have to go cold into a battle that needs warmth out into the muddle that you have made yourself and your mother and all your friends will despise you oh my darling and rightly if it is ever right to despise
george still dark all the tussle and the misery without a word from him
am i justified into his own eyes tears came
yes for we fight for more than love or pleasure there is truth
truth counts truth does count  you kiss me said the girl
you kiss me
i will try  he gave her a sense of deities reconciled a feeling that in gaining the man she loved she would gain something for the whole world
throughout the squalor of her homeward driveshe spoke at oncehis salutation remained
he had robbed the body of its taint the worlds taunts of their sting he had shown her the holiness of direct desire
she never exactly understood she would say in after years how he managed to strengthen her
it was as if he had made her see the whole of everything at once    chapter xx the end of the middle ages  the miss alans did go to greece but they went by themselves
they alone of this little company will double malea and plough the waters of the saronic gulf
they alone will visit athens and delphi and either shrine of intellectual songthat upon the acropolis encircled by blue seas that under parnassus where the eagles build and the bronze charioteer drives undismayed towards infinity
trembling anxious cumbered with much digestive bread they did proceed to constantinople they did go round the world
the rest of us must be contented with a fair but a less arduous goal
italiam petimus we return to the pension bertolini
george said it was his old room
no it isnt said lucy because it is the room i had and i had your fathers room
i forget why charlotte made me for some reason  he knelt on the tiled floor and laid his face in her lap
george you baby get up  why shouldnt i be a baby murmured george
unable to answer this question she put down his sock which she was trying to mend and gazed out through the window
it was evening and again the spring
oh bother charlotte she said thoughtfully
what can such people be made of  same stuff as parsons are made of  nonsense  quite right
it is nonsense  now you get up off the cold floor or youll be starting rheumatism next and you stop laughing and being so silly  why shouldnt i laugh he asked pinning her with his elbows and advancing his face to hers
whats there to cry at
kiss me here he indicated the spot where a kiss would be welcome
he was a boy after all
when it came to the point it was she who remembered the past she into whose soul the iron had entered she who knew whose room this had been last year
it endeared him to her strangely that he should be sometimes wrong
any letters he asked
just a line from freddy  now kiss me here then here  then threatened again with rheumatism he strolled to the window opened it as the english will and leant out
there was the parapet there the river there to the left the beginnings of the hills
the cabdriver who at once saluted him with the hiss of a serpent might be that very phaethon who had set this happiness in motion twelve months ago
a passion of gratitudeall feelings grow to passions in the southcame over the husband and he blessed the people and the things who had taken so much trouble about a young fool
he had helped himself it is true but how stupidly
all the fighting that mattered had been done by othersby italy by his father by his wife
lucy you come and look at the cypresses and the church whatever its name is still shows  san miniato
ill just finish your sock  signorino domani faremo uno giro called the cabman with engaging certainty
george told him that he was mistaken they had no money to throw away on driving
and the people who had not meant to helpthe miss lavishes the cecils the miss bartletts
ever prone to magnify fate george counted up the forces that had swept him into this contentment
anything good in freddys letter  not yet  his own content was absolute but hers held bitterness the honeychurches had not forgiven them they were disgusted at her past hypocrisy she had alienated windy corner perhaps for ever
what does he say  silly boy
he thinks hes being dignified
he knew we should go off in the springhe has known it for six monthsthat if mother wouldnt give her consent we should take the thing into our own hands
they had fair warning and now he calls it an elopement
ridiculous boy  signorino domani faremo uno giro  but it will all come right in the end
he has to build us both up from the beginning again
i wish though that cecil had not turned so cynical about women
he has for the second time quite altered
why will men have theories about women
i havent any about men
i wish too that mr beebe  you may well wish that  he will never forgive usi mean he will never be interested in us again
i wish that he did not influence them so much at windy corner
i wish he hadntbut if we act the truth the people who really love us are sure to come back to us in the long run  perhaps then he said more gently well i acted the truththe only thing i did doand you came back to me
so possibly you know he turned back into the room
nonsense with that sock he carried her to the window so that she too saw all the view
they sank upon their knees invisible from the road they hoped and began to whisper one anothers names
ah
it was worth while it was the great joy that they had expected and countless little joys of which they had never dreamt
they were silent
signorino domani faremo  oh bother that man  but lucy remembered the vendor of photographs and said no dont be rude to him then with a catching of her breath she murmured mr
eager and charlotte dreadful frozen charlotte
how cruel she would be to a man like that  look at the lights going over the bridge  but this room reminds me of charlotte
how horrible to grow old in charlottes way
to think that evening at the rectory that she shouldnt have heard your father was in the house
for she would have stopped me going in and he was the only person alive who could have made me see sense
you couldnt have made me
when i am very happyshe kissed himi remember on how little it all hangs
if charlotte had only known she would have stopped me going in and i should have gone to silly greece and become different for ever  but she did know said george she did see my father surely
he said so  oh no she didnt see him
she was upstairs with old mrs beebe dont you remember and then went straight to the church
she said so  george was obstinate again
my father said he saw her and i prefer his word
he was dozing by the study fire and he opened his eyes and there was miss bartlett
a few minutes before you came in
she was turning to go as he woke up
he didnt speak to her  then they spoke of other thingsthe desultory talk of those who have been fighting to reach one another and whose reward is to rest quietly in each others arms
it was long ere they returned to miss bartlett but when they did her behaviour seemed more interesting
george who disliked any darkness said its clear that she knew
then why did she risk the meeting
she knew he was there and yet she went to church  they tried to piece the thing together
as they talked an incredible solution came into lucys mind
she rejected it and said how like charlotte to undo her work by a feeble muddle at the last moment but something in the dying evening in the roar of the river in their very embrace warned them that her words fell short of life and george whispered or did she mean it  mean what  signorino domani faremo uno giro  lucy bent forward and said with gentleness lascia prego lascia
siamo sposati  scusi tanto signora he replied in tones as gentle and whipped up his horse
buona serae grazie  niente  the cabman drove away singing
mean what george  he whispered is it this
is this possible
ill put a marvel to you
that your cousin has always hoped
that from the very first moment we met she hoped far down in her mind that we should be like thisof course very far down
that she fought us on the surface and yet she hoped
i cant explain her any other way
can you
look how she kept me alive in you all the summer how she gave you no peace how month after month she became more eccentric and unreliable
the sight of us haunted heror she couldnt have described us as she did to her friend
there are detailsit burnt
i read the book afterwards
she is not frozen lucy she is not withered up all through
she tore us apart twice but in the rectory that evening she was given one more chance to make us happy
we can never make friends with her or thank her
but i do believe that far down in her heart far below all speech and behaviour she is glad  it is impossible murmured lucy and then remembering the experiences of her own heart she said noit is just possible  youth enwrapped them the song of phaethon announced passion requited love attained
but they were conscious of a love more mysterious than this
the song died away they heard the river bearing down the snows of winter into the mediterranean
chapter   one may as well begin with helen's letters to her sister
howards end                                                      tuesday
dearest meg  it isn't going to be what we expected
it is old and little and altogether delightfulred brick
we can scarcely pack in as it is and the dear knows what will happen when paul younger son arrives tomorrow
from hall you go right or left into diningroom or drawingroom
hall itself is practically a room
you open another door in it and there are the stairs going up in a sort of tunnel to the firstfloor
three bedrooms in a row there and three attics in a row above
that isn't all the house really but it's all that one noticesnine windows as you look up from the front garden
then there's a very big wychelmto the left as you look upleaning a little over the house and standing on the boundary between the garden and meadow
i quite love that tree already
also ordinary elms oaksno nastier than ordinary oakspeartrees appletrees and a vine
no silver birches though
however i must get on to my host and hostess
i only wanted to show that it isn't the least what we expected
why did we settle that their house would be all gables and wiggles and their garden all gambogecoloured paths
i believe simply because we associate them with expensive hotelsmrs wilcox trailing in beautiful dresses down long corridors mr wilcox bullying porters etc
we females are that unjust
i shall be back saturday will let you know train later
they are as angry as i am that you did not come too really tibby is too tiresome he starts a new mortal disease every month
how could he have got hay fever in london
and even if he could it seems hard that you should give up a visit to hear a schoolboy sneeze
tell him that charles wilcox the son who is here has hay fever too but he's brave and gets quite cross when we inquire after it
men like the wilcoxes would do tibby a power of good
but you won't agree and i'd better change the subject
this long letter is because i'm writing before breakfast
oh the beautiful vine leaves
the house is covered with a vine
i looked out earlier and mrs wilcox was already in the garden
she evidently loves it
no wonder she sometimes looks tired
she was watching the large red poppies come out
then she walked off the lawn to the meadow whose corner to the right i can just see
trail trail went her long dress over the sopping grass and she came back with her hands full of the hay that was cut yesterdayi suppose for rabbits or something as she kept on smelling it
the air here is delicious
later on i heard the noise of croquet balls and looked out again and it was charles wilcox practising they are keen on all games
presently he started sneezing and had to stop
then i hear more clicketing and it is mr wilcox practising and then 'atissue atissue' he has to stop too
then evie comes out and does some calisthenic exercises on a machine that is tacked on to a greengagetreethey put everything to useand then she says 'atissue' and in she goes
and finally mrs wilcox reappears trail trail still smelling hay and looking at the flowers
i inflict all this on you because once you said that life is sometimes life and sometimes only a drama and one must learn to distinguish t'other from which and up to now i have always put that down as 'meg's clever nonsense'
but this morning it really does seem not life but a play and it did amuse me enormously to watch the w's
now mrs wilcox has come in
i am going to wear omission
last night mrs wilcox wore an omission and evie omission
so it isn't exactly a goasyouplease place and if you shut your eyes it still seems the wiggly hotel that we expected
not if you open them
the dogroses are too sweet
there is a great hedge of them over the lawnmagnificently tall so that they fall down in garlands and nice and thin at the bottom so that you can see ducks through it and a cow
these belong to the farm which is the only house near us
there goes the breakfast gong
much love
modified love to tibby
love to aunt juley how good of her to come and keep you company but what a bore
burn this
will write again thursday
helen                                                    howards end                                                       friday
dearest meg  i am having a glorious time
i like them all
mrs wilcox if quieter than in germany is sweeter than ever and i never saw anything like her steady unselfishness and the best of it is that the others do not take advantage of her
they are the very happiest jolliest family that you can imagine
i do really feel that we are making friends
the fun of it is that they think me a noodle and say soat least mr wilcox doesand when that happens and one doesn't mind it's a pretty sure test isn't it
he says the most horrid things about women's suffrage so nicely and when i said i believed in equality he just folded his arms and gave me such a setting down as i've never had
meg shall we ever learn to talk less
i never felt so ashamed of myself in my life
i couldn't point to a time when men had been equal nor even to a time when the wish to be equal had made them happier in other ways
i couldn't say a word
i had just picked up the notion that equality is good from some bookprobably from poetry or you
anyhow it's been knocked into pieces and like all people who are really strong mr wilcox did it without hurting me
on the other hand i laugh at them for catching hay fever
we live like fightingcocks and charles takes us out every day in the motora tomb with trees in it a hermit's house a wonderful road that was made by the kings of merciatennisa cricket matchbridgeand at night we squeeze up in this lovely house
the whole clan's here nowit's like a rabbit warren
evie is a dear
they want me to stop over sundayi suppose it won't matter if i do
marvellous weather and the view's marvellousviews westward to the high ground
thank you for your letter
burn this
your affectionate                                                      helen                                                   howards end                                                      sunday
dearest dearest megi do not know what you will say paul and i are in lovethe younger son who only came here wednesday
chapter   margaret glanced at her sister's note and pushed it over the breakfasttable to her aunt
there was a moment's hush and then the floodgates opened
i can tell you nothing aunt juley
i know no more than you do
we metwe only met the father and mother abroad last spring
i know so little that i didn't even know their son's name
it's all so she waved her hand and laughed a little
in that case it is far too sudden
who knows aunt juley who knows
but margaret dear i mean we mustn't be unpractical now that we've come to facts
it is too sudden surely
who knows
but margaret dear  i'll go for her other letters said margaret
no i won't i'll finish my breakfast
in fact i haven't them
we met the wilcoxes on an awful expedition that we made from heidelberg to speyer
helen and i had got it into our heads that there was a grand old cathedral at speyerthe archbishop of speyer was one of the seven electorsyou know'speyer maintz and koln'
those three sees once commanded the rhine valley and got it the name of priest street
i still feel quite uneasy about this business margaret
the train crossed by a bridge of boats and at first sight it looked quite fine
but oh in five minutes we had seen the whole thing
the cathedral had been ruined absolutely ruined by restoration not an inch left of the original structure
we wasted a whole day and came across the wilcoxes as we were eating our sandwiches in the public gardens
they too poor things had been taken inthey were actually stopping at speyerand they rather liked helen insisting that they must fly with us to heidelberg
as a matter of fact they did come on next day
we all took some drives together
they knew us well enough to ask helen to come and see themat least i was asked too but tibby's illness prevented me so last monday she went alone
that's all
you know as much as i do now
it's a young man out the unknown
she was to have come back saturday but put off till monday perhaps on account ofi don't know
she broke off and listened to the sounds of a london morning
their house was in wickham place and fairly quiet for a lofty promontory of buildings separated it from the main thoroughfare
one had the sense of a backwater or rather of an estuary whose waters flowed in from the invisible sea and ebbed into a profound silence while the waves without were still beating
though the promontory consisted of flatsexpensive with cavernous entrance halls full of concierges and palmsit fulfilled its purpose and gained for the older houses opposite a certain measure of peace
these too would be swept away in time and another promontory would rise upon their site as humanity piled itself higher and higher on the precious soil of london
mrs munt had her own method of interpreting her nieces
she decided that margaret was a little hysterical and was trying to gain time by a torrent of talk
feeling very diplomatic she lamented the fate of speyer and declared that never never should she be so misguided as to visit it and added of her own accord that the principles of restoration were ill understood in germany
the germans she said are too thorough and this is all very well sometimes but at other times it does not do
exactly said margaret germans are too thorough
and her eyes began to shine
of course i regard you schlegels as english said mrs munt hastilyenglish to the backbone
margaret leaned forward and stroked her hand
and that reminds mehelen's letter  oh yes aunt juley i am thinking all right about helen's letter
i knowi must go down and see her
i am thinking about her all right
i am meaning to go down  but go with some plan said mrs munt admitting into her kindly voice a note of exasperation
margaret if i may interfere don't be taken by surprise
what do you think of the wilcoxes
are they our sort
are they likely people
could they appreciate helen who is to my mind a very special sort of person
do they care about literature and art
that is most important when you come to think of it
literature and art
most important
how old would the son be
she says 'younger son'
would he be in a position to marry
is he likely to make helen happy
did you gather  i gathered nothing
they began to talk at once
then in that case  in that case i can make no plans don't you see
on the contrary  i hate plans
i hate lines of action
helen isn't a baby
then in that case my dear why go down
margaret was silent
if her aunt could not see why she must go down she was not going to tell her
she was not going to say i love my dear sister i must be near her at this crisis of her life
the affections are more reticent than the passions and their expression more subtle
if she herself should ever fall in love with a man she like helen would proclaim it from the housetops but as she only loved a sister she used the voiceless language of sympathy
i consider you odd girls continued mrs munt and very wonderful girls and in many ways far older than your years
butyou won't be offended
frankly i feel you are not up to this business
it requires an older person
dear i have nothing to call me back to swanage
she spread out her plump arms
i am all at your disposal
let me go down to this house whose name i forget instead of you
aunt juleyshe jumped up and kissed heri must must go to howards end myself
you don't exactly understand though i can never thank you properly for offering
i do understand retorted mrs munt with immense confidence
i go down in no spirit of interference but to make inquiries
inquiries are necessary
now i am going to be rude
you would say the wrong thing to a certainty you would
in your anxiety for helen's happiness you would offend the whole of these wilcoxes by asking one of your impetuous questionsnot that one minds offending them
i shall ask no questions
i have it in helen's writing that she and a man are in love
there is no question to ask as long as she keeps to that
all the rest isn't worth a straw
a long engagement if you like but inquiries questions plans lines of actionno aunt juley no
away she hurried not beautiful not supremely brilliant but filled with something that took the place of both qualitiessomething best described as a profound vivacity a continual and sincere response to all that she encountered in her path through life
if helen had written the same to me about a shopassistant or a penniless clerk  dear margaret do come into the library and shut the door
your good maids are dusting the banisters
or if she had wanted to marry the man who calls for carter paterson i should have said the same
then with one of those turns that convinced her aunt that she was not mad really and convinced observers of another type that she was not a barren theorist she added though in the case of carter paterson i should want it to be a very long engagement indeed i must say
i should think so said mrs munt and indeed i can scarcely follow you
now just imagine if you said anything of that sort to the wilcoxes
i understand it but most good people would think you mad
imagine how disconcerting for helen
what is wanted is a person who will go slowly slowly in this business and see how things are and where they are likely to lead to
margaret was down on this
but you implied just now that the engagement must be broken off
i think probably it must but slowly
can you break an engagement off slowly
her eyes lit up
what's an engagement made of do you suppose
i think it's made of some hard stuff that may snap but can't break
it is different to the other ties of life
they stretch or bend
they admit of degree
they're different
exactly so
but won't you let me just run down to howards house and save you all the discomfort
i will really not interfere but i do so thoroughly understand the kind of thing you schlegels want that one quiet look round will be enough for me
margaret again thanked her again kissed her and then ran upstairs to see her brother
he was not so well
the hay fever had worried him a good deal all night
his head ached his eyes were wet his mucous membrane he informed her was in a most unsatisfactory condition
the only thing that made life worth living was the thought of walter savage landor from whose imaginary conversations she had promised to read at frequent intervals during the day
it was rather difficult
something must be done about helen
she must be assured that it is not a criminal offence to love at first sight
a telegram to this effect would be cold and cryptic a personal visit seemed each moment more impossible
now the doctor arrived and said that tibby was quite bad
might it really be best to accept aunt juley's kind offer and to send her down to howards end with a note
certainly margaret was impulsive
she did swing rapidly from one decision to another
running downstairs into the library she criedyes i have changed my mind i do wish that you would go
there was a train from king's cross at eleven
at halfpast ten tibby with rare selfeffacement fell asleep and margaret was able to drive her aunt to the station
you will remember aunt juley not to be drawn into discussing the engagement
give my letter to helen and say whatever you feel yourself but do keep clear of the relatives
we have scarcely got their names straight yet and besides that sort of thing is so uncivilized and wrong
so uncivilized
queried mrs munt fearing that she was losing the point of some brilliant remark
oh i used an affected word
i only meant would you please only talk the thing over with helen
only with helen
because but it was no moment to expound the personal nature of love
even margaret shrank from it and contented herself with stroking her good aunt's hand and with meditating half sensibly and half poetically on the journey that was about to begin from king's cross
like many others who have lived long in a great capital she had strong feelings about the various railway termini
they are our gates to the glorious and the unknown
through them we pass out into adventure and sunshine to them alas
we return
in paddington all cornwall is latent and the remoter west down the inclines of liverpool street lie fenlands and the illimitable broads scotland is through the pylons of euston wessex behind the poised chaos of waterloo
italians realize this as is natural those of them who are so unfortunate as to serve as waiters in berlin call the anhalt bahnhof the stazione d'italia because by it they must return to their homes
and he is a chilly londoner who does not endow his stations with some personality and extend to them however shyly the emotions of fear and love
to margareti hope that it will not set the reader against herthe station of king's cross had always suggested infinity
its very situationwithdrawn a little behind the facile splendours of st pancrasimplied a comment on the materialism of life
those two great arches colourless indifferent shouldering between them an unlovely clock were fit portals for some eternal adventure whose issue might be prosperous but would certainly not be expressed in the ordinary language of prosperity
if you think this ridiculous remember that it is not margaret who is telling you about it and let me hasten to add that they were in plenty of time for the train that mrs munt though she took a secondclass ticket was put by the guard into a first only two seconds on the train one smoking and the other babiesone cannot be expected to travel with babies and that margaret on her return to wickham place was confronted with the following telegram  all over
wish i had never written
tell no one
helen  but aunt juley was gonegone irrevocably and no power on earth could stop her
chapter   most complacently did mrs munt rehearse her mission
her nieces were independent young women and it was not often that she was able to help them
emily's daughters had never been quite like other girls
they had been left motherless when tibby was born when helen was five and margaret herself but thirteen
it was before the passing of the deceased wife's sister bill so mrs munt could without impropriety offer to go and keep house at wickham place
but her brotherinlaw who was peculiar and a german had referred the question to margaret who with the crudity of youth had answered no they could manage much better alone
five years later mr schlegel had died too and mrs munt had repeated her offer
margaret crude no longer had been grateful and extremely nice but the substance of her answer had been the same
i must not interfere a third time thought mrs munt
however of course she did
she learnt to her horror that margaret now of age was taking her money out of the old safe investments and putting it into foreign things which always smash
silence would have been criminal
her own fortune was invested in home rails and most ardently did she beg her niece to imitate her
then we should be together dear
margaret out of politeness invested a few hundreds in the nottingham and derby railway and though the foreign things did admirably and the nottingham and derby declined with the steady dignity of which only home rails are capable mrs munt never ceased to rejoice and to say i did manage that at all events
when the smash comes poor margaret will have a nestegg to fall back upon
this year helen came of age and exactly the same thing happened in helen's case she also would shift her money out of consols but she too almost without being pressed consecrated a fraction of it to the nottingham and derby railway
so far so good but in social matters their aunt had accomplished nothing
sooner or later the girls would enter on the process known as throwing themselves away and if they had delayed hitherto it was only that they might throw themselves more vehemently in the future
they saw too many people at wickham placeunshaven musicians an actress even german cousins one knows what foreigners are acquaintances picked up at continental hotels one knows what they are too
it was interesting and down at swanage no one appreciated culture more than mrs munt but it was dangerous and disaster was bound to come
how right she was and how lucky to be on the spot when the disaster came
the train sped northward under innumerable tunnels
it was only an hour's journey but mrs munt had to raise and lower the window again and again
she passed through the south welwyn tunnel saw light for a moment and entered the north welwyn tunnel of tragic fame
she traversed the immense viaduct whose arches span untroubled meadows and the dreamy flow of tewin water
she skirted the parks of politicians
at times the great north road accompanied her more suggestive of infinity than any railway awakening after a nap of a hundred years to such life as is conferred by the stench of motorcars and to such culture as is implied by the advertisements of antibilious pills
to history to tragedy to the past to the future mrs munt remained equally indifferent hers but to concentrate on the end of her journey and to rescue poor helen from this dreadful mess
the station for howards end was at hilton one of the large villages that are strung so frequently along the north road and that owe their size to the traffic of coaching and precoaching days
being near london it had not shared in the rural decay and its long high street had budded out right and left into residential estates
for about a mile a series of tiled and slated houses passed before mrs munt's inattentive eyes a series broken at one point by six danish tumuli that stood shoulder to shoulder along the highroad tombs of soldiers
beyond these tumuli habitations thickened and the train came to a standstill in a tangle that was almost a town
the station like the scenery like helen's letters struck an indeterminate note
into which country will it lead england or suburbia
it was new it had island platforms and a subway and the superficial comfort exacted by business men
but it held hints of local life personal intercourse as even mrs munt was to discover
i want a house she confided to the ticket boy
its name is howards lodge
do you know where it is
mr
wilcox
the boy called
a young man in front of them turned round
she's wanting howards end
there was nothing for it but to go forward though mrs munt was too much agitated even to stare at the stranger
but remembering that there were two brothers she had the sense to say to him excuse me asking but are you the younger mr wilcox or the elder
the younger
can i do anything for you
oh wellshe controlled herself with difficulty
really
are you
i  she moved away from the ticket boy and lowered her voice
i am miss schlegels aunt
i ought to introduce myself oughtn't i
my name is mrs
munt
she was conscious that he raised his cap and said quite coolly oh rather miss schlegel is stopping with us
did you want to see her
possibly  i'll call you a cab
no wait a mo he thought
our motor's here
i'll run you up in it
that is very kind  not at all if you'll just wait till they bring out a parcel from the office
this way
my niece is not with you by any chance
no i came over with my father
he has gone on north in your train
you'll see miss schlegel at lunch
you're coming up to lunch i hope
i should like to come up said mrs munt not committing herself to nourishment until she had studied helen's lover a little more
he seemed a gentleman but had so rattled her round that her powers of observation were numbed
she glanced at him stealthily
to a feminine eye there was nothing amiss in the sharp depressions at the corners of his mouth nor in the rather boxlike construction of his forehead
he was dark cleanshaven and seemed accustomed to command
in front or behind
which do you prefer
it may be windy in front
in front if i may then we can talk
but excuse me one momenti can't think what they're doing with that parcel
he strode into the bookingoffice and called with a new voice hi
hi you there
are you going to keep me waiting all day
parcel for wilcox howards end
just look sharp
emerging he said in quieter tones this station's abominably organized if i had my way the whole lot of 'em should get the sack
may i help you in
this is very good of you said mrs munt as she settled herself into a luxurious cavern of red leather and suffered her person to be padded with rugs and shawls
she was more civil than she had intended but really this young man was very kind
moreover she was a little afraid of him his selfpossession was extraordinary
very good indeed she repeated adding it is just what i should have wished
very good of you to say so he replied with a slight look of surprise which like most slight looks escaped mrs munt's attention
i was just tooling my father over to catch the down train
you see we heard from helen this morning
young wilcox was pouring in petrol starting his engine and performing other actions with which this story has no concern
the great car began to rock and the form of mrs munt trying to explain things sprang agreeably up and down among the red cushions
the mater will be very glad to see you he mumbled
hi
i say
parcel for howards end
bring it out
hi
a bearded porter emerged with the parcel in one hand and an entry book in the other
with the gathering whir of the motor these ejaculations mingled sign must i
why theshould i sign after all this bother
not even got a pencil on you
remember next time i report you to the stationmaster
my time's of value though yours mayn't be
herehere being a tip
extremely sorry mrs
munt
not at all mr
wilcox
and do you object to going through the village
it is rather a longer spin but i have one or two commissions
i should love going through the village
naturally i am very anxious to talk things over with you
as she said this she felt ashamed for she was disobeying margaret's instructions
only disobeying them in the letter surely
margaret had only warned her against discussing the incident with outsiders
surely it was not uncivilized or wrong to discuss it with the young man himself since chance had thrown them together
a reticent fellow he made no reply
mounting by her side he put on gloves and spectacles and off they drove the bearded porterlife is a mysterious businesslooking after them with admiration
the wind was in their faces down the station road blowing the dust into mrs munt's eyes
but as soon as they turned into the great north road she opened fire
you can well imagine she said that the news was a great shock to us
what news
mr wilcox she said frankly
margaret has told me everythingeverything
i have seen helen's letter
he could not look her in the face as his eyes were fixed on his work he was travelling as quickly as he dared down the high street
but he inclined his head in her direction and said i beg your pardon i didn't catch
about helen
helen of course
helen is a very exceptional personi am sure you will let me say this feeling towards her as you doindeed all the schlegels are exceptional
i come in no spirit of interference but it was a great shock
they drew up opposite a draper's
without replying he turned round in his seat and contemplated the cloud of dust that they had raised in their passage through the village
it was settling again but not all into the road from which he had taken it
some of it had percolated through the open windows some had whitened the roses and gooseberries of the wayside gardens while a certain proportion had entered the lungs of the villagers
i wonder when they'll learn wisdom and tar the roads was his comment
then a man ran out of the draper's with a roll of oilcloth and off they went again
margaret could not come herself on account of poor tibby so i am here to represent her and to have a good talk
i'm sorry to be so dense said the young man again drawing up outside a shop
but i still haven't quite understood
helen mr wilcoxmy niece and you
he pushed up his goggles and gazed at her absolutely bewildered
horror smote her to the heart for even she began to suspect that they were at crosspurposes and that she had commenced her mission by some hideous blunder
miss schlegel and myself
he asked compressing his lips
i trust there has been no misunderstanding quavered mrs munt
her letter certainly read that way
what way
that you and she she paused then drooped her eyelids
i think i catch your meaning he said stickily
what an extraordinary mistake
then you didn't the least she stammered getting bloodred in the face and wishing she had never been born
scarcely as i am already engaged to another lady
there was a moment's silence and then he caught his breath and exploded with oh good god
don't tell me it's some silliness of paul's
but you are paul
i'm not
then why did you say so at the station
i said nothing of the sort
i beg your pardon you did
i beg your pardon i did not
my name is charles
younger may mean son as opposed to father or second brother as opposed to first
there is much to be said for either view and later on they said it
but they had other questions before them now
do you mean to tell me that paul  but she did not like his voice
he sounded as if he was talking to a porter and certain that he had deceived her at the station she too grew angry
do you mean to tell me that paul and your niece  mrs muntsuch is human naturedetermined that she would champion the lovers
she was not going to be bullied by a severe young man
yes they care for one another very much indeed she said
i dare say they will tell you about it byandby
we heard this morning
and charles clenched his fist and cried the idiot the idiot the little fool
mrs munt tried to divest herself of her rugs
if that is your attitude mr wilcox i prefer to walk
i beg you will do no such thing
i'll take you up this moment to the house
let me tell you the thing's impossible and must be stopped
mrs munt did not often lose her temper and when she did it was only to protect those whom she loved
on this occasion she blazed out
i quite agree sir
the thing is impossible and i will come up and stop it
my niece is a very exceptional person and i am not inclined to sit still while she throws herself away on those who will not appreciate her
charles worked his jaws
considering she has only known your brother since wednesday and only met your father and mother at a stray hotel  could you possibly lower your voice
the shopman will overhear
esprit de classeif one may coin the phrasewas strong in mrs munt
she sat quivering while a member of the lower orders deposited a metal funnel a saucepan and a garden squirt beside the roll of oilcloth
right behind
yes sir
and the lower orders vanished in a cloud of dust
i warn you paul hasn't a penny it's useless
no need to warn us mr wilcox i assure you
the warning is all the other way
my niece has been very foolish and i shall give her a good scolding and take her back to london with me
he has to make his way out in nigeria
he couldn't think of marrying for years and when he does it must be a woman who can stand the climate and is in other wayswhy hasn't he told us
of course he's ashamed
he knows he's been a fool
and so he hasa damned fool
she grew furious
whereas miss schlegel has lost no time in publishing the news
if i were a man mr wilcox for that last remark i'd box your ears
you're not fit to clean my niece's boots to sit in the same room with her and you dareyou actually darei decline to argue with such a person
all i know is she's spread the thing and he hasn't and my father's away and i  and all that i know is  might i finish my sentence please
no
charles clenched his teeth and sent the motor swerving all over the lane
she screamed
so they played the game of capping families a round of which is always played when love would unite two members of our race
but they played it with unusual vigour stating in so many words that schlegels were better than wilcoxes wilcoxes better than schlegels
they flung decency aside
the man was young the woman deeply stirred in both a vein of coarseness was latent
their quarrel was no more surprising than are most quarrelsinevitable at the time incredible afterwards
but it was more than usually futile
a few minutes and they were enlightened
the motor drew up at howards end and helen looking very pale ran out to meet her aunt
aunt juley i have just had a telegram from margaret ii meant to stop your coming
it isn'tit's over
the climax was too much for mrs munt
she burst into tears
aunt juley dear don't
don't let them know i've been so silly
it wasn't anything
do bear up for my sake
paul cried charles wilcox pulling his gloves off
don't let them know
they are never to know
oh my darling helen  paul
paul
a very young man came out of the house
paul is there any truth in this
i didn'ti don't  yes or no man plain question plain answer
did or didn't miss schlegel  charles dear said a voice from the garden
charles dear charles one doesn't ask plain questions
there aren't such things
they were all silent
it was mrs wilcox
she approached just as helen's letter had described her trailing noiselessly over the lawn and there was actually a wisp of hay in her hands
she seemed to belong not to the young people and their motor but to the house and to the tree that overshadowed it
one knew that she worshipped the past and that the instinctive wisdom the past can alone bestow had descended upon herthat wisdom to which we give the clumsy name of aristocracy
high born she might not be
but assuredly she cared about her ancestors and let them help her
when she saw charles angry paul frightened and mrs munt in tears she heard her ancestors say separate those human beings who will hurt each other most
the rest can wait
so she did not ask questions
still less did she pretend that nothing had happened as a competent society hostess would have done
she said miss schlegel would you take your aunt up to your room or to my room whichever you think best
paul do find evie and tell her lunch for six but i'm not sure whether we shall all be downstairs for it
and when they had obeyed her she turned to her elder son who still stood in the throbbing stinking car and smiled at him with tenderness and without a word turned away from him towards her flowers
mother he called are you aware that paul has been playing the fool again
it's all right dear
they have broken off the engagement
engagement
they do not love any longer if you prefer it put that way said mrs wilcox stooping down to smell a rose
chapter   helen and her aunt returned to wickham place in a state of collapse and for a little time margaret had three invalids on her hands
mrs munt soon recovered
she possessed to a remarkable degree the power of distorting the past and before many days were over she had forgotten the part played by her own imprudence in the catastrophe
even at the crisis she had cried thank goodness poor margaret is saved this
which during the journey to london evolved into it had to be gone through by someone which in its turn ripened into the permanent form of the one time i really did help emily's girls was over the wilcox business
but helen was a more serious patient
new ideas had burst upon her like a thunder clap and by them and by her reverberations she had been stunned
the truth was that she had fallen in love not with an individual but with a family
before paul arrived she had as it were been tuned up into his key
the energy of the wilcoxes had fascinated her had created new images of beauty in her responsive mind
to be all day with them in the open air to sleep at night under their roof had seemed the supreme joy of life and had led to that abandonment of personality that is a possible prelude to love
she had liked giving in to mr wilcox or evie or charles she had liked being told that her notions of life were sheltered or academic that equality was nonsense votes for women nonsense socialism nonsense art and literature except when conducive to strengthening the character nonsense
one by one the schlegel fetiches had been overthrown and though professing to defend them she had rejoiced
when mr wilcox said that one sound man of business did more good to the world than a dozen of your social reformers she had swallowed the curious assertion without a gasp and had leant back luxuriously among the cushions of his motorcar
when charles said why be so polite to servants
they don't understand it she had not given the schlegel retort of if they don't understand it i do
no she had vowed to be less polite to servants in the future
i am swathed in cant she thought and it is good for me to be stripped of it
and all that she thought or did or breathed was a quiet preparation for paul
paul was inevitable
charles was taken up with another girl mr wilcox was so old evie so young mrs wilcox so different
round the absent brother she began to throw the halo of romance to irradiate him with all the splendour of those happy days to feel that in him she should draw nearest to the robust ideal
he and she were about the same age evie said
most people thought paul handsomer than his brother
he was certainly a better shot though not so good at golf
and when paul appeared flushed with the triumph of getting through an examination and ready to flirt with any pretty girl helen met him halfway or more than halfway and turned towards him on the sunday evening
he had been talking of his approaching exile in nigeria and he should have continued to talk of it and allowed their guest to recover
but the heave of her bosom flattered him
passion was possible and he became passionate
deep down in him something whispered this girl would let you kiss her you might not have such a chance again
that was how it happened or rather how helen described it to her sister using words even more unsympathetic than my own
but the poetry of that kiss the wonder of it the magic that there was in life for hours after itwho can describe that
it is so easy for an englishman to sneer at these chance collisions of human beings
to the insular cynic and the insular moralist they offer an equal opportunity
it is so easy to talk of passing emotion and how to forget how vivid the emotion was ere it passed
our impulse to sneer to forget is at root a good one
we recognize that emotion is not enough and that men and women are personalities capable of sustained relations not mere opportunities for an electrical discharge
yet we rate the impulse too highly
we do not admit that by collisions of this trivial sort the doors of heaven may be shaken open
to helen at all events her life was to bring nothing more intense than the embrace of this boy who played no part in it
he had drawn her out of the house where there was danger of surprise and light he had led her by a path he knew until they stood under the column of the vast wychelm
a man in the darkness he had whispered i love you when she was desiring love
in time his slender personality faded the scene that he had evoked endured
in all the variable years that followed she never saw the like of it again
i understand said margaretat least i understand as much as ever is understood of these things
tell me now what happened on the monday morning
it was over at once
how helen
i was still happy while i dressed but as i came downstairs i got nervous and when i went into the diningroom i knew it was no good
there was eviei can't explainmanaging the teaurn and mr wilcox reading the times
was paul there
yes and charles was talking to him about stocks and shares and he looked frightened
by slight indications the sisters could convey much to each other
margaret saw horror latent in the scene and helen's next remark did not surprise her
somehow when that kind of man looks frightened it is too awful
it is all right for us to be frightened or for men of another sortfather for instance but for men like that
when i saw all the others so placid and paul mad with terror in case i said the wrong thing i felt for a moment that the whole wilcox family was a fraud just a wall of newspapers and motorcars and golfclubs and that if it fell i should find nothing behind it but panic and emptiness 
i don't think that
the wilcoxes struck me as being genuine people particularly the wife
no i don't really think that
but paul was so broadshouldered all kinds of extraordinary things made it worse and i knew that it would never donever
i said to him after breakfast when the others were practising strokes 'we rather lost our heads' and he looked better at once though frightfully ashamed
he began a speech about having no money to marry on but it hurt him to make it and istopped him
then he said 'i must beg your pardon over this miss schlegel i can't think what came over me last night'
and i said 'nor what over me never mind'
and then we partedat least until i remembered that i had written straight off to tell you the night before and that frightened him again
i asked him to send a telegram for me for he knew you would be coming or something and he tried to get hold of the motor but charles and mr wilcox wanted it to go to the station and charles offered to send the telegram for me and then i had to say that the telegram was of no consequence for paul said charles might read it and though i wrote it out several times he always said people would suspect something
he took it himself at last pretending that he must walk down to get cartridges and what with one thing and the other it was not handed in at the post office until too late
it was the most terrible morning
paul disliked me more and more and evie talked cricket averages till i nearly screamed
i cannot think how i stood her all the other days
at last charles and his father started for the station and then came your telegram warning me that aunt juley was coming by that train and pauloh rather horriblesaid that i had muddled it
but mrs wilcox knew
knew what
everything though we neither of us told her a word and had known all along i think
oh she must have overheard you
i suppose so but it seemed wonderful
when charles and aunt juley drove up calling each other names mrs wilcox stepped in from the garden and made everything less terrible
ugh
but it has been a disgusting business
to think that she sighed
to think that because you and a young man meet for a moment there must be all these telegrams and anger supplied margaret
helen nodded
i've often thought about it helen
it's one of the most interesting things in the world
the truth is that there is a great outer life that you and i have never toucheda life in which telegrams and anger count
personal relations that we think supreme are not supreme there
there love means marriage settlements death death duties
so far i'm clear
but here my difficulty
this outer life though obviously horrid often seems the real onethere's grit in it
it does breed character
do personal relations lead to sloppiness in the end
oh meg that's what i felt only not so clearly when the wilcoxes were so competent and seemed to have their hands on all the ropes 
don't you feel it now
i remember paul at breakfast said helen quietly
i shall never forget him
he had nothing to fall back upon
i know that personal relations are the real life for ever and ever
amen
so the wilcox episode fell into the background leaving behind it memories of sweetness and horror that mingled and the sisters pursued the life that helen had commended
they talked to each other and to other people they filled the tall thin house at wickham place with those whom they liked or could befriend
they even attended public meetings
in their own fashion they cared deeply about politics though not as politicians would have us care they desired that public life should mirror whatever is good in the life within
temperance tolerance and sexual equality were intelligible cries to them whereas they did not follow our forward policy in thibet with the keen attention that it merits and would at times dismiss the whole british empire with a puzzled if reverent sigh
not out of them are the shows of history erected the world would be a grey bloodless place were it entirely composed of miss schlegels
but the world being what it is perhaps they shine out in it like stars
a word on their origin
they were not english to the backbone as their aunt had piously asserted
but on the other band they were not germans of the dreadful sort
their father had belonged to a type that was more prominent in germany fifty years ago than now
he was not the aggressive german so dear to the english journalist nor the domestic german so dear to the english wit
if one classed him at all it would be as the countryman of hegel and kant as the idealist inclined to be dreamy whose imperialism was the imperialism of the air
not that his life had been inactive
he had fought like blazes against denmark austria france
but he had fought without visualizing the results of victory
a hint of the truth broke on him after sedan when he saw the dyed moustaches of napoleon going grey another when he entered paris and saw the smashed windows of the tuileries
peace cameit was all very immense one had turned into an empirebut he knew that some quality had vanished for which not all alsacelorraine could compensate him
germany a commercial power germany a naval power germany with colonies here and a forward policy there and legitimate aspirations in the other place might appeal to others and be fitly served by them for his own part he abstained from the fruits of victory and naturalized himself in england
the more earnest members of his family never forgave him and knew that his children though scarcely english of the dreadful sort would never be german to the backbone
he had obtained work in one of our provincial universities and there married poor emily or die englanderin as the case may be and as she had money they proceeded to london and came to know a good many people
but his gaze was always fixed beyond the sea
it was his hope that the clouds of materialism obscuring the fatherland would part in time and the mild intellectual light reemerge
do you imply that we germans are stupid uncle ernst
exclaimed a haughty and magnificent nephew
uncle ernst replied to my mind
you use the intellect but you no longer care about it
that i call stupidity
as the haughty nephew did not follow he continued you only care about the' things that you can use and therefore arrange them in the following order money supremely useful intellect rather useful imagination of no use at all
nofor the other had protestedyour pangermanism is no more imaginative than is our imperialism over here
it is the vice of a vulgar mind to be thrilled by bigness to think that a thousand square miles are a thousand times more wonderful than one square mile and that a million square miles are almost the same as heaven
that is not imagination
no it kills it
when their poets over here try to celebrate bigness they are dead at once and naturally
your poets too are dying your philosophers your musicians to whom europe has listened for two hundred years
gone
gone with the little courts that nurtured themgone with esterhaz and weimar
what
what's that
your universities
oh yes you have learned men who collect more facts than do the learned men of england
they collect facts and facts and empires of facts
but which of them will rekindle the light within
to all this margaret listened sitting on the haughty nephew's knee
it was a unique education for the little girls
the haughty nephew would be at wickham place one day bringing with him an even haughtier wife both convinced that germany was appointed by god to govern the world
aunt juley would come the next day convinced that great britain had been appointed to the same post by the same authority
were both these loudvoiced parties right
on one occasion they had met and margaret with clasped hands had implored them to argue the subject out in her presence
whereat they blushed and began to talk about the weather
papa she criedshe was a most offensive childwhy will they not discuss this most clear question
her father surveying the parties grimly replied that he did not know
putting her head on one side margaret then remarked to me one of two things is very clear either god does not know his own mind about england and germany or else these do not know the mind of god
a hateful little girl but at thirteen she had grasped a dilemma that most people travel through life without perceiving
her brain darted up and down it grew pliant and strong
her conclusion was that any human being lies nearer to the unseen than any organization and from this she never varied
helen advanced along the same lines though with a more irresponsible tread
in character she resembled her sister but she was pretty and so apt to have a more amusing time
people gathered round her more readily especially when they were new acquaintances and she did enjoy a little homage very much
when their father died and they ruled alone at wickham place she often absorbed the whole of the company while margaretboth were tremendous talkersfell flat
neither sister bothered about this
helen never apologized afterwards margaret did not feel the slightest rancour
but looks have their influence upon character
the sisters were alike as little girls but at the time of the wilcox episode their methods were beginning to diverge the younger was rather apt to entice people and in enticing them to be herself enticed the elder went straight ahead and accepted an occasional failure as part of the game
little need be premised about tibby
he was now an intelligent man of sixteen but dyspeptic and difficile
chapter   it will be generally admitted that beethoven's fifth symphony is the most sublime noise that has ever penetrated into the ear of man
all sorts and conditions are satisfied by it
whether you are like mrs munt and tap surreptitiously when the tunes comeof course not so as to disturb the others or like helen who can see heroes and shipwrecks in the music's flood or like margaret who can only see the music or like tibby who is profoundly versed in counterpoint and holds the full score open on his knee or like their cousin fraulein mosebach who remembers all the time that beethoven is echt deutsch or like fraulein mosebach's young man who can remember nothing but fraulein mosebach in any case the passion of your life becomes more vivid and you are bound to admit that such a noise is cheap at two shillings
it is cheap even if you hear it in the queen's hall dreariest musicroom in london though not as dreary as the free trade hall manchester and even if you sit on the extreme left of that hall so that the brass bumps at you before the rest of the orchestra arrives it is still cheap
who is margaret talking to
said mrs munt at the conclusion of the first movement
she was again in london on a visit to wickham place
helen looked down the long line of their party and said that she did not know
would it be some young man or other whom she takes an interest in
i expect so helen replied
music enwrapped her and she could not enter into the distinction that divides young men whom one takes an interest in from young men whom one knows
you girls are so wonderful in always havingoh dear
one mustn't talk
for the andante had begunvery beautiful but bearing a family likeness to all the other beautiful andantes that beethoven had written and to helen's mind rather disconnecting the heroes and shipwrecks of the first movement from the heroes and goblins of the third
she heard the tune through once and then her attention wandered and she gazed at the audience or the organ or the architecture
much did she censure the attenuated cupids who encircle the ceiling of the queen's hall inclining each to each with vapid gesture and clad in sallow pantaloons on which the october sunlight struck
how awful to marry a man like those cupids
thought helen
here beethoven started decorating his tune so she heard him through once more and then she smiled at her cousin frieda
but frieda listening to classical music could not respond
herr liesecke too looked as if wild horses could not make him inattentive there were lines across his forehead his lips were parted his pincenez at right angles to his nose and he had laid a thick white hand on either knee
and next to her was aunt juley so british and wanting to tap
how interesting that row of people was
what diverse influences had gone to the making
here beethoven after humming and hawing with great sweetness said heigho and the andante came to an end
applause and a round of wunderschoning and prachtvolleying from the german contingent
margaret started talking to her new young man helen said to her aunt now comes the wonderful movement first of all the goblins and then a trio of elephants dancing and tibby implored the company generally to look out for the transitional passage on the drum
on the what dear
on the drum aunt juley
no look out for the part where you think you have done with the goblins and they come back breathed helen as the music started with a goblin walking quietly over the universe from end to end
others followed him
they were not aggressive creatures it was that that made them so terrible to helen
they merely observed in passing that there was no such thing as splendour or heroism in the world
after the interlude of elephants dancing they returned and made the observation for the second time
helen could not contradict them for once at all events she had felt the same and had seen the reliable walls of youth collapse
panic and emptiness
panic and emptiness
the goblins were right
her brother raised his finger it was the transitional passage on the drum
for as if things were going too far beethoven took hold of the goblins and made them do what he wanted
he appeared in person
he gave them a little push and they began to walk in major key instead of in a minor and thenhe blew with his mouth and they were scattered
gusts of splendour gods and demigods contending with vast swords colour and fragrance broadcast on the field of battle magnificent victory magnificent death
oh it all burst before the girl and she even stretched out her gloved hands as if it was tangible
any fate was titanic any contest desirable conqueror and conquered would alike be applauded by the angels of the utmost stars
and the goblinsthey had not really been there at all
they were only the phantoms of cowardice and unbelief
one healthy human impulse would dispel them
men like the wilcoxes or president roosevelt would say yes
beethoven knew better
the goblins really had been there
they might returnand they did
it was as if the splendour of life might boil overand waste to steam and froth
in its dissolution one heard the terrible ominous note and a goblin with increased malignity walked quietly over the universe from end to end
panic and emptiness
panic and emptiness
even the flaming ramparts of the world might fall
beethoven chose to make all right in the end
he built the ramparts up
he blew with his mouth for the second time and again the goblins were scattered
he brought back the gusts of splendour the heroism the youth the magnificence of life and of death and amid vast roarings of a superhuman joy he led his fifth symphony to its conclusion
but the goblins were there
they could return
he had said so bravely and that is why one can trust beethoven when he says other things
helen pushed her way out during the applause
she desired to be alone
the music summed up to her all that had happened or could happen in her career
she read it as a tangible statement which could never be superseded
the notes meant this and that to her and they could have no other meaning and life could have no other meaning
she pushed right out of the building and walked slowly down the outside staircase breathing the autumnal air and then she strolled home
margaret called mrs munt is helen all right
oh yes
she is always going away in the middle of a programme said tibby
the music has evidently moved her deeply said fraulein mosebach
excuse me said margaret's young man who had for some time been preparing a sentence but that lady has quite inadvertently taken my umbrella
oh good gracious me
i am so sorry
tibby run after helen
i shall miss the four serious songs if i do
tibby love you must go
it isn't of any consequence said the young man in truth a little uneasy about his umbrella
but of course it is
tibby
tibby
tibby rose to his feet and wilfully caught his person on the backs of the chairs
by the time he had tipped up the seat and had found his hat and had deposited his full score in safety it was too late to go after helen
the four serious songs had begun and one could not move during their performance
my sister is so careless whispered margaret
not at all replied the young man but his voice was dead and cold
if you would give me your address  oh not at all not at all and he wrapped his greatcoat over his knees
then the four serious songs rang shallow in margaret's ears
brahms for all his grumbling and grizzling had never guessed what it felt like to be suspected of stealing an umbrella
for this fool of a young man thought that she and helen and tibby had been playing the confidence trick on him and that if he gave his address they would break into his rooms some midnight or other and steal his walkingstick too
most ladies would have laughed but margaret really minded for it gave her a glimpse into squalor
to trust people is a luxury in which only the wealthy can indulge the poor cannot afford it
as soon as brahms had grunted himself out she gave him her card and said that is where we live if you preferred you could call for the umbrella after the concert but i didn't like to trouble you when it has all been our fault
his face brightened a little when he saw that wickham place was w it was sad to see him corroded with suspicion and yet not daring to be impolite in case these welldressed people were honest after all
she took it as a good sign that he said to her it's a fine programme this afternoon is it not
for this was the remark with which he had originally opened before the umbrella intervened
the beethoven's fine said margaret who was not a female of the encouraging type
i don't like the brahms though nor the mendelssohn that came firstand ugh
i don't like this elgar that's coming
what what
called herr liesecke overhearing
the pomp and circumstance will not be fine
oh margaret you tiresome girl
cried her aunt
here have i been persuading herr liesecke to stop for pomp and circumstance and you are undoing all my work
i am so anxious for him to hear what we are doing in music
oh you mustn't run down our english composers margaret
for my part i have heard the composition at stettin said fraulein mosebach
on two occasions
it is dramatic a little
frieda you despise english music
you know you do
and english art
and english literature except shakespeare and he's a german
very well frieda you may go
the lovers laughed and glanced at each other
moved by a common impulse they rose to their feet and fled from pomp and circumstance
we have this call to play in finsbury circus it is true said herr liesecke as he edged past her and reached the gangway just as the music started
margaret loudly whispered by aunt juley
margaret margaret
fraulein mosebach has left her beautiful little bag behind her on the seat
sure enough there was frieda's reticule containing her address book her pocket dictionary her map of london and her money
oh what a botherwhat a family we are
frfrieda
hush
said all those who thought the music fine
but it's the number they want in finsbury circus  might icouldn't i said the suspicious young man and got very red
oh i would be so grateful
he took the bagmoney clinking inside itand slipped up the gangway with it
he was just in time to catch them at the swingdoor and he received a pretty smile from the german girl and a fine bow from her cavalier
he returned to his seat upsides with the world
the trust that they had reposed in him was trivial but he felt that it cancelled his mistrust for them and that probably he would not be had over his umbrella
this young man had been had in the pastbadly perhaps overwhelminglyand now most of his energies went in defending himself against the unknown
but this afternoonperhaps on account of musiche perceived that one must slack off occasionally or what is the good of being alive
wickham place w though a risk was as safe as most things and he would risk it
so when the concert was over and margaret said we live quite near i am going there now
could you walk around with me and we'll find your umbrella
he said thank you peaceably and followed her out of the queen's hall
she wished that he was not so anxious to hand a lady downstairs or to carry a lady's programme for herhis class was near enough her own for its manners to vex her
but she found him interesting on the wholeevery one interested the schlegels on the whole at that timeand while her lips talked culture her heart was planning to invite him to tea
how tired one gets after music
she began
do you find the atmosphere of queen's hall oppressive
yes horribly
but surely the atmosphere of covent garden is even more oppressive
do you go there much
when my work permits i attend the gallery for the royal opera
helen would have exclaimed so do i i love the gallery and thus have endeared herself to the young man
helen could do these things
but margaret had an almost morbid horror of drawing people out of making things go
she had been to the gallery at covent garden but she did not attend it preferring the more expensive seats still less did she love it
so she made no reply
this year i have been three timesto faust tosca and was it tannhouser or tannhoyser
better not risk the word
margaret disliked tosca and faust
and so for one reason and another they walked on in silence chaperoned by the voice of mrs munt who was getting into difficulties with her nephew
i do in a way remember the passage tibby but when every instrument is so beautiful it is difficult to pick out one thing rather than another
i am sure that you and helen take me to the very nicest concerts
not a dull note from beginning to end
i only wish that our german friends would have stayed till it finished
but surely you haven't forgotten the drum steadily beating on the low c aunt juley
came tibby's voice
no one could
it's unmistakable
a specially loud part
hazarded mrs munt
of course i do not go in for being musical she added the shot failing
i only care for musica very different thing
but still i will say this for myselfi do know when i like a thing and when i don't
some people are the same about pictures
they can go into a picture gallerymiss conder canand say straight off what they feel all round the wall
i never could do that
but music is so different to pictures to my mind
when it comes to music i am as safe as houses and i assure you tibby i am by no means pleased by everything
there was a thingsomething about a faun in frenchwhich helen went into ecstasies over but i thought it most tinkling and superficial and said so and i held to my opinion too
do you agree
asked margaret
do you think music is so different to pictures
ii should have thought so kind of he said
so should i
now my sister declares they're just the same
we have great arguments over it
she says i'm dense i say she's sloppy
getting under way she cried now doesn't it seem absurd to you
what is the good of the arts if they are interchangeable
what is the good of the ear if it tells you the same as the eye
helen's one aim is to translate tunes into the language of painting and pictures into the language of music
it's very ingenious and she says several pretty things in the process but what's gained i'd like to know
oh it's all rubbish radically false
if monet's really debussy and debussy's really monet neither gentleman is worth his saltthat's my opinion
evidently these sisters quarrelled
now this very symphony that we've just been havingshe won't let it alone
she labels it with meanings from start to finish turns it into literature
i wonder if the day will ever return when music will be treated as music
yet i don't know
there's my brotherbehind us
he treats music as music and oh my goodness
he makes me angrier than anyone simply furious
with him i daren't even argue
an unhappy family if talented
but of course the real villain is wagner
he has done more than any man in the nineteenth century towards the muddling of arts
i do feel that music is in a very serious state just now though extraordinarily interesting
every now and then in history there do come these terrible geniuses like wagner who stir up all the wells of thought at once
for a moment it's splendid
such a splash as never was
but afterwardssuch a lot of mud and the wellsas it were they communicate with each other too easily now and not one of them will run quite clear
that's what wagner's done
her speeches fluttered away from the young man like birds
if only he could talk like this he would have caught the world
oh to acquire culture
oh to pronounce foreign names correctly
oh to be well informed discoursing at ease on every subject that a lady started
but it would take one years
with an hour at lunch and a few shattered hours in the evening how was it possible to catch up with leisured women who had been reading steadily from childhood
his brain might be full of names he might have even heard of monet and debussy the trouble was that he could not string them together into a sentence he could not make them tell he could not quite forget about his stolen umbrella
yes the umbrella was the real trouble
behind monet and debussy the umbrella persisted with the steady beat of a drum
i suppose my umbrella will be all right he was thinking
i don't really mind about it
i will think about music instead
i suppose my umbrella will be all right
earlier in the afternoon he had worried about seats
ought he to have paid as much as two shillings
earlier still he had wondered shall i try to do without a programme
there had always been something to worry him ever since he could remember always something that distracted him in the pursuit of beauty
for he did pursue beauty and therefore margaret's speeches did flutter away from him like birds
margaret talked ahead occasionally saying don't you think so
don't you feel the same
and once she stopped and said oh do interrupt me
which terrified him
she did not attract him though she filled him with awe
her figure was meagre her face seemed all teeth and eyes her references to her sister and brother were uncharitable
for all her cleverness and culture she was probably one of those soulless atheistical women who have been so shown up by miss corelli
it was surprising and alarming that she should suddenly say i do hope that you'll come in and have some tea
i do hope that you'll come in and have some tea
we should be so glad
i have dragged you so far out of your way
they had arrived at wickham place
the sun had set and the backwater in deep shadow was filling with a gentle haze
to the right of the fantastic skyline of the flats towered black against the hues of evening to the left the older houses raised a squarecut irregular parapet against the grey
margaret fumbled for her latchkey
of course she had forgotten it
so grasping her umbrella by its ferrule she leant over the area and tapped at the diningroom window
helen
let us in
all right said a voice
you've been taking this gentleman's umbrella
taken a what
said helen opening the door
oh what's that
do come in
how do you do
helen you must not be so ramshackly
you took this gentleman's umbrella away from queen's hall and he has had the trouble of coming for it
oh i am so sorry
cried helen all her hair flying
she had pulled off her hat as soon as she returned and had flung herself into the big diningroom chair
i do nothing but steal umbrellas
i am so very sorry
do come in and choose one
is yours a hooky or a nobbly
mine's a nobblyat least i think it is
the light was turned on and they began to search the hall helen who had abruptly parted with the fifth symphony commenting with shrill little cries
don't you talk meg
you stole an old gentleman's silk tophat
yes she did aunt juley
it is a positive fact
she thought it was a muff
oh heavens
i've knocked the in and out card down
where's frieda
tibby why don't you everno i can't remember what i was going to say
that wasn't it but do tell the maids to hurry tea up
what about this umbrella
she opened it
no it's all gone along the seams
it's an appalling umbrella
it must be mine
but it was not
he took it from her murmured a few words of thanks and then fled with the lilting step of the clerk
but if you will stop cried margaret
now helen how stupid you've been
whatever have i done
don't you see that you've frightened him away
i meant him to stop to tea
you oughtn't to talk about stealing or holes in an umbrella
i saw his nice eyes getting so miserable
no it's not a bit of good now
for helen had darted out into the street shouting oh do stop
i dare say it is all for the best opined mrs munt
we know nothing about the young man margaret and your drawingroom is full of very tempting little things
but helen cried aunt juley how can you
you make me more and more ashamed
i'd rather he had been a thief and taken all the apostle spoons than that iwell i must shut the frontdoor i suppose
one more failure for helen
yes i think the apostle spoons could have gone as rent said margaret
seeing that her aunt did not understand she added you remember 'rent'
it was one of father's wordsrent to the ideal to his own faith in human nature
you remember how he would trust strangers and if they fooled him he would say 'it's better to be fooled than to be suspicious'that the confidence trick is the work of man but the wantofconfidencetrick is the work of the devil
i remember something of the sort now said mrs munt rather tartly for she longed to add it was lucky that your father married a wife with money
but this was unkind and she contented herself with why he might have stolen the little ricketts picture as well
better that he had said helen stoutly
no i agree with aunt juley said margaret
i'd rather mistrust people than lose my little ricketts
there are limits
their brother finding the incident commonplace had stolen upstairs to see whether there were scones for tea
he warmed the teapotalmost too deftlyrejected the orange pekoe that the parlourmaid had provided poured in five spoonfuls of a superior blend filled up with really boiling water and now called to the ladies to be quick or they would lose the aroma
all right auntie tibby called helen while margaret thoughtful again said in a way i wish we had a real boy in the housethe kind of boy who cares for men
it would make entertaining so much easier
so do i said her sister
tibby only cares for cultured females singing brahms
and when they joined him she said rather sharply why didn't you make that young man welcome tibby
you must do the host a little you know
you ought to have taken his hat and coaxed him into stopping instead of letting him be swamped by screaming women
tibby sighed and drew a long strand of hair over his forehead
oh it's no good looking superior
i mean what i say
leave tibby alone
said margaret who could not bear her brother to be scolded
here's the house a regular hencoop
grumbled helen
oh my dear
protested mrs munt
how can you say such dreadful things
the number of men you get here has always astonished me
if there is any danger it's the other way round
yes but it's the wrong sort of men helen means
no i don't corrected helen
we get the right sort of man but the wrong side of him and i say that's tibby's fault
there ought to be a something about the houseani don't know what
a touch of the w's perhaps
helen put out her tongue
who are the w's
asked tibby
the w's are things i and meg and aunt juley know about and you don't so there
i suppose that ours is a female house said margaret and one must just accept it
no aunt juley i don't mean that this house is full of women
i am trying to say something much more clever
i mean that it was irrevocably feminine even in father's time
now i'm sure you understand
well i'll give you another example
it'll shock you but i don't care
suppose queen victoria gave a dinnerparty and that the guests had been leighton millais swinburne rossetti meredith fitzgerald etc
do you suppose that the atmosphere of that dinner would have been artistic
heavens no
the very chairs on which they sat would have seen to that
so with our houseit must be feminine and all we can do is to see that it isn't effeminate
just as another house that i can mention but i won't sounded irrevocably masculine and all its inmates can do is to see that it isn't brutal
that house being the w's house i presume said tibby
you're not going to be told about the w's my child helen cried so don't you think it
and on the other hand i don't the least mind if you find out so don't you think you've done anything clever in either case
give me a cigarette
you do what you can for the house said margaret
the drawingroom reeks of smoke
if you smoked too the house might suddenly turn masculine
atmosphere is probably a question of touch and go
even at queen victoria's dinnerpartyif something had been just a little differentperhaps if she'd worn a clinging liberty teagown instead of a magenta satin  with an indian shawl over her shoulders  fastened at the bosom with a cairngormpin  bursts of disloyal laughteryou must remember that they are half germangreeted these suggestions and margaret said pensively how inconceivable it would be if the royal family cared about art
and the conversation drifted away and away and helen's cigarette turned to a spot in the darkness and the great flats opposite were sown with lighted windows which vanished and were relit again and vanished incessantly
beyond them the thoroughfare roared gentlya tide that could never be quiet while in the east invisible behind the smokes of wapping the moon was rising
that reminds me margaret
we might have taken that young man into the diningroom at all events
only the majolica plateand that is so firmly set in the wall
i am really distressed that he had no tea
for that little incident had impressed the three women more than might be supposed
it remained as a goblin football as a hint that all is not for the best in the best of all possible worlds and that beneath these superstructures of wealth and art there wanders an illfed boy who has recovered his umbrella indeed but who has left no address behind him and no name
chapter   we are not concerned with the very poor
they are unthinkable and only to be approached by the statistician or the poet
this story deals with gentlefolk or with those who are obliged to pretend that they are gentlefolk
the boy leonard bast stood at the extreme verge of gentility
he was not in the abyss but he could see it and at times people whom he knew had dropped in and counted no more
he knew that he was poor and would admit it he would have died sooner than confess any inferiority to the rich
this may be splendid of him
but he was inferior to most rich people there is not the least doubt of it
he was not as courteous as the average rich man nor as intelligent nor as healthy nor as lovable
his mind and his body had been alike underfed because he was poor and because he was modern they were always craving better food
had he lived some centuries ago in the brightly coloured civilizations of the past he would have had a definite status his rank and his income would have corresponded
but in his day the angel of democracy had arisen enshadowing the classes with leathern wings and proclaiming all men are equalall men that is to say who possess umbrellas and so he was obliged to assert gentility lest he slipped into the abyss where nothing counts and the statements of democracy are inaudible
as he walked away from wickham place his first care was to prove that he was as good as the miss schlegels
obscurely wounded in his pride he tried to wound them in return
they were probably not ladies
would real ladies have asked him to tea
they were certainly illnatured and cold
at each step his feeling of superiority increased
would a real lady have talked about stealing an umbrella
perhaps they were thieves after all and if he had gone into the house they could have clapped a chloroformed handkerchief over his face
he walked on complacently as far as the houses of parliament
there an empty stomach asserted itself and told him he was a fool
evening mr
bast
evening mr
dealtry
nice evening
evening
mr dealtry a fellow clerk passed on and leonard stood wondering whether he would take the tram as far as a penny would take him or whether he would walk
he decided to walkit is no good giving in and he had spent money enough at queen's halland he walked over westminster bridge in front of st thomas's hospital and through the immense tunnel that passes under the southwestern main line at vauxhall
in the tunnel he paused and listened to the roar of the trains
a sharp pain darted through his head and he was conscious of the exact form of his eye sockets
he pushed on for another mile and did not slacken speed until he stood at the entrance of a road called camelia road which was at present his home
here he stopped again and glanced suspiciously to right and left like a rabbit that is going to bolt into its hole
a block of flats constructed with extreme cheapness towered on either hand
farther down the road two more blocks were being built and beyond these an old house was being demolished to accommodate another pair
it was the kind of scene that may be observed all over london whatever the localitybricks and mortar rising and falling with the restlessness of the water in a fountain as the city receives more and more men upon her soil
camelia road would soon stand out like a fortress and command for a little an extensive view
only for a little
plans were out for the erection of flats in magnolia road also
and again a few years and all the flats in either road might be pulled down and new buildings of a vastness at present unimaginable might arise where they had fallen
evening mr
bast
evening mr
cunningham
very serious thing this decline of the birthrate in manchester
i beg your pardon
very serious thing this decline of the birthrate in manchester repeated mr cunningham tapping the sunday paper in which the calamity in question had just been announced to him
ah yes said leonard who was not going to let on that he had not bought a sunday paper
if this kind of thing goes on the population of england will be stationary in 
you don't say so
i call it a very serious thing eh
goodevening mr
cunningham
goodevening mr
bast
then leonard entered block b of the flats and turned not upstairs but down into what is known to house agents as a semibasement and to other men as a cellar
he opened the door and cried hullo
with the pseudogeniality of the cockney
there was no reply
hullo
he repeated
the sittingroom was empty though the electric light had been left burning
a look of relief came over his face and he flung himself into the armchair
the sittingroom contained besides the armchair two other chairs a piano a threelegged table and a cosy corner
of the walls one was occupied by the window the other by a draped mantelshelf bristling with cupids
opposite the window was the door and beside the door a bookcase while over the piano there extended one of the masterpieces of maud goodman
it was an amorous and not unpleasant little hole when the curtains were drawn and the lights turned on and the gasstove unlit
but it struck that shallow makeshift note that is so often heard in the modem dwellingplace
it had been too easily gained and could be relinquished too easily
as leonard was kicking off his boots he jarred the threelegged table and a photograph frame honourably poised upon it slid sideways fell off into the fireplace and smashed
he swore in a colourless sort of way and picked the photograph up
it represented a young lady called jacky and had been taken at the time when young ladies called jacky were often photographed with their mouths open
teeth of dazzling whiteness extended along either of jacky's jaws and positively weighted her head sideways so large were they and so numerous
take my word for it that smile was simply stunning and it is only you and i who will be fastidious and complain that true joy begins in the eyes and that the eyes of jacky did not accord with her smile but were anxious and hungry
leonard tried to pull out the fragments of glass and cut his fingers and swore again
a drop of blood fell on the frame another followed spilling over on to the exposed photograph
he swore more vigorously and dashed to the kitchen where he bathed his hands
the kitchen was the same size as the sitting room through it was a bedroom
this completed his home
he was renting the flat furnished of all the objects that encumbered it none were his own except the photograph frame the cupids and the books
damn damn damnation
he murmured together with such other words as he had learnt from older men
then he raised his hand to his forehead and said oh damn it all which meant something different
he pulled himself together
he drank a little tea black and silent that still survived upon an upper shelf
he swallowed some dusty crumbs of cake
then he went back to the sittingroom settled himself anew and began to read a volume of ruskin
seven miles to the north of venice  how perfectly the famous chapter opens
how supreme its command of admonition and of poetry
the rich man is speaking to us from his gondola
seven miles to the north of venice the banks of sand which nearer the city rise little above lowwater mark attain by degrees a higher level and knit themselves at last into fields of salt morass raised here and there into shapeless mounds and intercepted by narrow creeks of sea
leonard was trying to form his style on ruskin he understood him to be the greatest master of english prose
he read forward steadily occasionally making a few notes
let us consider a little each of these characters in succession and first for of the shafts enough has been said already what is very peculiar to this churchits luminousness
was there anything to be learnt from this fine sentence
could he adapt it to the needs of daily life
could he introduce it with modifications when he next wrote a letter to his brother the layreader
for example  let us consider a little each of these characters in succession and first for of the absence of ventilation enough has been said already what is very peculiar to this flatits obscurity 
something told him that the modifications would not do and that something had he known it was the spirit of english prose
my flat is dark as well as stuffy
those were the words for him
and the voice in the gondola rolled on piping melodiously of effort and selfsacrifice full of high purpose full of beauty full even of sympathy and the love of men yet somehow eluding all that was actual and insistent in leonard's life
for it was the voice of one who had never been dirty or hungry and had not guessed successfully what dirt and hunger are
leonard listened to it with reverence
he felt that he was being done good to and that if he kept on with ruskin and the queen's hall concerts and some pictures by watts he would one day push his head out of the grey waters and see the universe
he believed in sudden conversion a belief which may be right but which is peculiarly attractive to a halfbaked mind
it is the bias of much popular religion in the domain of business it dominates the stock exchange and becomes that bit of luck by which all successes and failures are explained
if only i had a bit of luck the whole thing would come straight   
he's got a most magnificent place down at streatham and a  hp  fiat but then mind you he's had luck   
i'm sorry the wife's so late but she never has any luck over catching trains
leonard was superior to these people he did believe in effort and in a steady preparation for the change that he desired
but of a heritage that may expand gradually he had no conception he hoped to come to culture suddenly much as the revivalist hopes to come to jesus
those miss schlegels had come to it they had done the trick their hands were upon the ropes once and for all
and meanwhile his flat was dark as well as stuffy
presently there was a noise on the staircase
he shut up margaret's card in the pages of ruskin and opened the door
a woman entered of whom it is simplest to say that she was not respectable
her appearance was awesome
she seemed all strings and bellpullsribbons chains bead necklaces that clinked and caughtand a boa of azure feathers hung round her neck with the ends uneven
her throat was bare wound with a double row of pearls her arms were bare to the elbows and might again be detected at the shoulder through cheap lace
her hat which was flowery resembled those punnets covered with flannel which we sowed with mustard and cress in our childhood and which germinated here yes and there no
she wore it on the back of her head
as for her hair or rather hairs they are too complicated to describe but one system went down her back lying in a thick pad there while another created for a lighter destiny rippled around her forehead
the facethe face does not signify
it was the face of the photograph but older and the teeth were not so numerous as the photographer had suggested and certainly not so white
yes jacky was past her prime whatever that prime may have been
she was descending quicker than most women into the colourless years and the look in her eyes confessed it
what ho
said leonard greeting that apparition with much spirit and helping it off with its boa
jacky in husky tones replied what ho
been out
he asked
the question sounds superfluous but it cannot have been really for the lady answered no adding oh i am so tired
you tired
eh
i'm tired said he hanging the boa up
oh len i am so tired
i've been to that classical concert i told you about said leonard
what's that
i came back as soon as it was over
any one been round to our place
asked jacky
not that i've seen
i met mr cunningham outside and we passed a few remarks
what not mr
cunnginham
yes
oh you mean mr
cunningham
yes
mr
cunningham
i've been out to tea at a lady friend's
her secret being at last given to the world and the name of the ladyfriend being even adumbrated jacky made no further experiments in the difficult and tiring art of conversation
she never had been a great talker
even in her photographic days she had relied upon her smile and her figure to attract and now that she was           on the shelf           on the shelf     boys boys i'm on the shelf  she was not likely to find her tongue
occasional bursts of song of which the above is an example still issued from her lips but the spoken word was rare
she sat down on leonard's knee and began to fondle him
she was now a massive woman of thirtythree and her weight hurt him but he could not very well say anything
then she said is that a book you're reading
and he said that's a book and drew it from her unreluctant grasp
margaret's card fell out of it
it fell face downwards and he murmured bookmarker
len  what is it
he asked a little wearily for she only had one topic of conversation when she sat upon his knee
you do love me
jacky you know that i do
how can you ask such questions
but you do love me len don't you
of course i do
a pause
the other remark was still due
len  well
what is it
len you will make it all right
i can't have you ask me that again said the boy flaring up into a sudden passion
i've promised to marry you when i'm of age and that's enough
my word's my word
i've promised to marry you as soon as ever i'm twentyone and i can't keep on being worried
i've worries enough
it isn't likely i'd throw you over let alone my word when i've spent all this money
besides i'm an englishman and i never go back on my word
jacky do be reasonable
of course i'll marry you
only do stop badgering me
when's your birthday len
i've told you again and again the eleventh of november next
now get off my knee a bit someone must get supper i suppose
jacky went through to the bedroom and began to see to her hat
this meant blowing at it with short sharp puffs
leonard tidied up the sittingroom and began to prepare their evening meal
he put a penny into the slot of the gasmeter and soon the flat was reeking with metallic fumes
somehow he could not recover his temper and all the time he was cooking he continued to complain bitterly
it really is too bad when a fellow isn't trusted
it makes one feel so wild when i've pretended to the people here that you're my wifeall right you shall be my wifeand i've bought you the ring to wear and i've taken this flat furnished and it's far more than i can afford and yet you aren't content and i've also not told the truth when i've written home
he lowered his voice
he'd stop it
in a tone of horror that was a little luxurious he repeated my brother'd stop it
i'm going against the whole world jacky
that's what i am jacky
i don't take any heed of what anyone says
i just go straight forward i do
that's always been my way
i'm not one of your weak knockkneed chaps
if a woman's in trouble i don't leave her in the lurch
that's not my street
no thank you
i'll tell you another thing too
i care a good deal about improving myself by means of literature and art and so getting a wider outlook
for instance when you came in i was reading ruskin's stones of venice
i don't say this to boast but just to show you the kind of man i am
i can tell you i enjoyed that classical concert this afternoon
to all his moods jacky remained equally indifferent
when supper was readyand not beforeshe emerged from the bedroom saying but you do love me don't you
they began with a soup square which leonard had just dissolved in some hot water
it was followed by the tonguea freckled cylinder of meat with a little jelly at the top and a great deal of yellow fat at the bottomending with another square dissolved in water jelly pineapple which leonard had prepared earlier in the day
jacky ate contentedly enough occasionally looking at her man with those anxious eyes to which nothing else in her appearance corresponded and which yet seemed to mirror her soul
and leonard managed to convince his stomach that it was having a nourishing meal
after supper they smoked cigarettes and exchanged a few statements
she observed that her likeness had been broken
he found occasion to remark for the second time that he had come straight back home after the concert at queen's hall
presently she sat upon his knee
the inhabitants of camelia road tramped to and fro outside the window just on a level with their heads and the family in the flat on the groundfloor began to sing hark my soul it is the lord
that tune fairly gives me the hump said leonard
jacky followed this and said that for her part she thought it a lovely tune
no i'll play you something lovely
get up dear for a minute
he went to the piano and jingled out a little grieg
he played badly and vulgarly but the performance was not without its effect for jacky said she thought she'd be going to bed
as she receded a new set of interests possessed the boy and he began to think of what had been said about music by that odd miss schlegelthe one that twisted her face about so when she spoke
then the thoughts grew sad and envious
there was the girl named helen who had pinched his umbrella and the german girl who had smiled at him pleasantly and herr someone and aunt someone and the brotherall all with their hands on the ropes
they had all passed up that narrow rich staircase at wickham place to some ample room whither he could never follow them not if he read for ten hours a day
oh it was not good this continual aspiration
some are born cultured the rest had better go in for whatever comes easy
to see life steadily and to see it whole was not for the likes of him
from the darkness beyond the kitchen a voice called len
you in bed
he asked his forehead twitching
m'm
all right
presently she called him again
i must clean my boots ready for the morning he answered
presently she called him again
i rather want to get this chapter done
what
he closed his ears against her
what's that
all right jacky nothing i'm reading a book
what
what
he answered catching her degraded deafness
presently she called him again
ruskin had visited torcello by this time and was ordering his gondoliers to take him to murano
it occurred to him as he glided over the whispering lagoons that the power of nature could not be shortened by the folly nor her beauty altogether saddened by the misery of such as leonard
chapter   oh margaret cried her aunt next morning such a most unfortunate thing has happened
i could not get you alone
the most unfortunate thing was not very serious
one of the flats in the ornate block opposite had been taken furnished by the wilcox family coming up no doubt in the hope of getting into london society
that mrs munt should be the first to discover the misfortune was not remarkable for she was so interested in the flats that she watched their every mutation with unwearying care
in theory she despised themthey took away that oldworld lookthey cut off the sunflats house a flashy type of person
but if the truth had been known she found her visits to wickham place twice as amusing since wickham mansions had arisen and would in a couple of days learn more about them than her nieces in a couple of months or her nephew in a couple of years
she would stroll across and make friends with the porters and inquire what the rents were exclaiming for example what
a hundred and twenty for a basement
you'll never get it
and they would answer one can but try madam
the passenger lifts the provision lifts the arrangement for coals a great temptation for a dishonest porter were all familiar matters to her and perhaps a relief from the politicoeconomicalaesthetic atmosphere that reigned at the schlegels'
margaret received the information calmly and did not agree that it would throw a cloud over poor helen's life
oh but helen isn't a girl with no interests she explained
she has plenty of other things and other people to think about
she made a false start with the wilcoxes and she'll be as willing as we are to have nothing more to do with them
for a clever girl dear how very oddly you do talk
helen'll have to have something more to do with them now that they're all opposite
she may meet that paul in the street
she cannot very well not bow
of course she must bow
but look here let's do the flowers
i was going to say the will to be interested in him has died and what else matters
i look on that disastrous episode over which you were so kind as the killing of a nerve in helen
it's dead and she'll never be troubled with it again
the only things that matter are the things that interest one
bowing even calling and leaving cards even a dinnerpartywe can do all those things to the wilcoxes if they find it agreeable but the other thing the one important thingnever again
don't you see
mrs munt did not see and indeed margaret was making a most questionable statementthat any emotion any interest once vividly aroused can wholly die
i also have the honour to inform you that the wilcoxes are bored with us
i didn't tell you at the timeit might have made you angry and you had enough to worry youbut i wrote a letter to mrs w and apologized for the trouble that helen had given them
she didn't answer it
how very rude
i wonder
or was it sensible
no margaret most rude
in either case one can class it as reassuring
mrs munt sighed
she was going back to swanage on the morrow just as her nieces were wanting her most
other regrets crowded upon her for instance how magnificently she would have cut charles if she had met him face to face
she had already seen him giving an order to the porterand very common he looked in a tall hat
but unfortunately his back was turned to her and though she had cut his back she could not regard this as a telling snub
but you will be careful won't you
she exhorted
oh certainly
fiendishly careful
and helen must be careful too  careful over what
cried helen at that moment coming into the room with her cousin
nothing said margaret seized with a momentary awkwardness
careful over what aunt juley
mrs munt assumed a cryptic air
it is only that a certain family whom we know by name but do not mention as you said yourself last night after the concert have taken the flat opposite from the mathesonswhere the plants are in the balcony
helen began some laughing reply and then disconcerted them all by blushing
mrs munt was so disconcerted that she exclaimed what helen you don't mind them coming do you
and deepened the blush to crimson
of course i don't mind said helen a little crossly
it is that you and meg are both so absurdly grave about it when there's nothing to be grave about at all
i'm not grave protested margaret a little cross in her turn
well you look grave doesn't she frieda
i don't feel grave that's all i can say you're going quite on the wrong tack
no she does not feel grave echoed mrs munt
i can bear witness to that
she disagrees  hark
interrupted fraulein mosebach
i hear bruno entering the hall
for herr liesecke was due at wickham place to call for the two younger girls
he was not entering the hallin fact he did not enter it for quite five minutes
but frieda detected a delicate situation and said that she and helen had much better wait for bruno down below and leave margaret and mrs munt to finish arranging the flowers
helen acquiesced
but as if to prove that the situation was not delicate really she stopped in the doorway and said  did you say the mathesons' flat aunt juley
how wonderful you are
i never knew that the woman who laced too tightly's name was matheson
come helen said her cousin
go helen said her aunt and continued to margaret almost in the same breath helen cannot deceive me she does mind
oh hush
breathed margaret
frieda'll hear you and she can be so tiresome
she minds persisted mrs munt moving thoughtfully about the room and pulling the dead chrysanthemums out of the vases
i knew she'd mindand i'm sure a girl ought to
such an experience
such awful coarsegrained people
i know more about them than you do which you forget and if charles had taken you that motor drivewell you'd have reached the house a perfect wreck
oh margaret you don't know what you are in for
they're all bottled up against the drawingroom window
there's mrs wilcoxi've seen her
there's paul
there's evie who is a minx
there's charlesi saw him to start with
and who would an elderly man with a moustache and a coppercoloured face be
mr wilcox possibly
i knew it
and there's mr
wilcox
it's a shame to call his face copper colour complained margaret
he has a remarkably good complexion for a man of his age
mrs munt triumphant elsewhere could afford to concede mr wilcox his complexion
she passed on from it to the plan of campaign that her nieces should pursue in the future
margaret tried to stop her
helen did not take the news quite as i expected but the wilcox nerve is dead in her really so there's no need for plans
it's as well to be prepared
noit's as well not to be prepared
because'  her thought drew being from the obscure borderland
she could not explain in so many words but she felt that those who prepare for all the emergencies of life beforehand may equip themselves at the expense of joy
it is necessary to prepare for an examination or a dinnerparty or a possible fall in the price of stock those who attempt human relations must adopt another method or fail
because i'd sooner risk it was her lame conclusion
but imagine the evenings exclaimed her aunt pointing to the mansions with the spout of the wateringcan
turn the electric light on her or there and it's almost the same room
one evening they may forget to draw their blinds down and you'll see them and the next you yours and they'll see you
impossible to sit out on the balconies
impossible to water the plants or even speak
imagine going out of the frontdoor and they come out opposite at the same moment
and yet you tell me that plans are unnecessary and you'd rather risk it
i hope to risk things all my life
oh margaret most dangerous
but after all she continued with a smile there's never any great risk as long as you have money
oh shame
what a shocking speech
money pads the edges of things said miss schlegel
god help those who have none
but this is something quite new
said mrs munt who collected new ideas as a squirrel collects nuts and was especially attracted by those that are portable
new for me sensible people have acknowledged it for years
you and i and the wilcoxes stand upon money as upon islands
it is so firm beneath our feet that we forget its very existence
it's only when we see someone near us tottering that we realize all that an independent income means
last night when we were talking up here round the fire i began to think that the very soul of the world is economic and that the lowest abyss is not the absence of love but the absence of coin
i call that rather cynical
so do i
but helen and i we ought to remember when we are tempted to criticize others that we are standing on these islands and that most of the others are down below the surface of the sea
the poor cannot always reach those whom they want to love and they can hardly ever escape from those whom they love no longer
we rich can
imagine the tragedy last june if helen and paul wilcox had been poor people and couldn't invoke railways and motorcars to part them
that's more like socialism said mrs munt suspiciously
call it what you like
i call it going through life with one's hand spread open on the table
i'm tired of these rich people who pretend to be poor and think it shows a nice mind to ignore the piles of money that keep their feet above the waves
i stand each year upon six hundred pounds and helen upon the same and tibby will stand upon eight and as fast as our pounds crumble away into the sea they are renewedfrom the sea yes from the sea
and all our thoughts are the thoughts of sixhundredpounders and all our speeches and because we don't want to steal umbrellas ourselves we forget that below the sea people do want to steal them and do steal them sometimes and that what's a joke up here is down there reality  there they gothere goes fraulein mosebach
really for a german she does dress charmingly
oh
what is it
helen was looking up at the wilcoxes' flat
why shouldn't she
i beg your pardon i interrupted you
what was it you were saying about reality
i had worked round to myself as usual answered margaret in tones that were suddenly preoccupied
do tell me this at all events
are you for the rich or for the poor
too difficult
ask me another
am i for poverty or for riches
for riches
hurrah for riches
for riches
echoed mrs munt having as it were at last secured her nut
yes
for riches
money for ever
so am i and so i am afraid are most of my acquaintances at swanage but i am surprised that you agree with us
thank you so much aunt juley
while i have talked theories you have done the flowers
not at all dear
i wish you would let me help you in more important things
well would you be very kind
would you come round with me to the registry office
there's a housemaid who won't say yes but doesn't say no
on their way thither they too looked up at the wilcoxes' flat
evie was in the balcony staring most rudely according to mrs munt
oh yes it was a nuisance there was no doubt of it
helen was proof against a passing encounter butmargaret began to lose confidence
might it reawake the dying nerve if the family were living close against her eyes
and frieda mosebach was stopping with them for another fortnight and frieda was sharp abominably sharp and quite capable of remarking you love one of the young gentlemen opposite yes
the remark would be untrue but of the kind which if stated often enough may become true just as the remark england and germany are bound to fight renders war a little more likely each time that it is made and is therefore made the more readily by the gutter press of either nation
have the private emotions also their gutter press
margaret thought so and feared that good aunt juley and frieda were typical specimens of it
they might by continual chatter lead helen into a repetition of the desires of june
into a repetitionthey could not do more they could not lead her into lasting love
they wereshe saw it clearlyjournalism her father with all his defects and wrongheadedness had been literature and had he lived he would have persuaded his daughter rightly
the registry office was holding its morning reception
a string of carriages filled the street
miss schlegel waited her turn and finally had to be content with an insidious temporary being rejected by genuine housemaids on the ground of her numerous stairs
her failure depressed her and though she forgot the failure the depression remained
on her way home she again glanced up at the wilcoxes' flat and took the rather matronly step of speaking about the matter to helen
helen you must tell me whether this thing worries you
if what
said helen who was washing her hands for lunch
the w's coming
no of course not
really
really
then she admitted that she was a little worried on mrs wilcox's account she implied that mrs wilcox might reach backward into deep feelings and be pained by things that never touched the other members of that clan
i shan't mind if paul points at our house and says 'there lives the girl who tried to catch me'
but she might
if even that worries you we could arrange something
there's no reason we should be near people who displease us or whom we displease thanks to our money
we might even go away for a little
well i am going away
frieda's just asked me to stettin and i shan't be back till after the new year
will that do
or must i fly the country altogether
really meg what has come over you to make such a fuss
oh i'm getting an old maid i suppose
i thought i minded nothing but really ii should be bored if you fell in love with the same man twice andshe cleared her throatyou did go red you know when aunt juley attacked you this morning
i shouldn't have referred to it otherwise
but helen's laugh rang true as she raised a soapy hand to heaven and swore that never nowhere and nohow would she again fall in love with any of the wilcox family down to its remotest collaterals
chapter   the friendship between margaret and mrs wilcox which was to develop soquickly and with such strange results may perhaps have had its beginnings at speyer in the spring
perhaps the elder lady as she gazed at the vulgar ruddy cathedral and listened to the talk of helen and her husband may have detected in the other and less charming of the sisters a deeper sympathy a sounder judgment
she was capable of detecting such things
perhaps it was she who had desired the miss schlegels to be invited to howards end and margaret whose presence she had particularly desired
all this is speculation mrs wilcox has left few clear indications behind her
it is certain that she came to call at wickham place a fortnight later the very day that helen was going with her cousin to stettin
helen
cried fraulein mosebach in awestruck tones she was now in her cousin's confidencehis mother has forgiven you
and then remembering that in england the newcomer ought not to call before she is called upon she changed her tone from awe to disapproval and opined that mrs wilcox was keine dame
bother the whole family
snapped margaret
helen stop giggling and pirouetting and go and finish your packing
why can't the woman leave us alone
i don't know what i shall do with meg helen retorted collapsing upon the stairs
she's got wilcox and box upon the brain
meg meg i don't love the young gentleman i don't love the young gentleman meg meg
can a body speak plainer
most certainly her love has died asserted fraulein mosebach
most certainly it has frieda but that will not prevent me from being bored with the wilcoxes if i return the call
then helen simulated tears and fraulein mosebach who thought her extremely amusing did the same
oh boo hoo
boo hoo hoo
meg's going to return the call and i can't
'cos why
'cos i'm going to germaneye
if you are going to germany go and pack if you aren't go and call on the wilcoxes instead of me
but meg meg i don't love the young gentleman i don't love the young lud who's that coming down the stairs
i vow 'tis my brother
 crimini
a maleeven such a male as tibbywas enough to stop the foolery
the barrier of sex though decreasing among the civilized is still high and higher on the side of women
helen could tell her sister all and her cousin much about paul she told her brother nothing
it was not prudishness for she now spoke of the wilcox ideal with laughter and even with a growing brutality
nor was it precaution for tibby seldom repeated any news that did not concern himself
it was rather the feeling that she betrayed a secret into the camp of men and that however trivial it was on this side of the barrier it would become important on that
so she stopped or rather began to fool on other subjects until her longsuffering relatives drove her upstairs
fraulein mosebach followed her but lingered to say heavily over the banisters to margaret it is all rightshe does not love the young manhe has not been worthy of her
yes i know thanks very much
i thought i did right to tell you
ever so many thanks
what's that
asked tibby
no one told him and he proceeded into the diningroom to eat elvas plums
that evening margaret took decisive action
the house was very quiet and the fogwe are in november nowpressed against the windows like an excluded ghost
frieda and helen and all their luggage had gone
tibby who was not feeling well lay stretched on a sofa by the fire
margaret sat by him thinking
her mind darted from impulse to impulse and finally marshalled them all in review
the practical person who knows what he wants at once and generally knows nothing else will excuse her of indecision
but this was the way her mind worked
and when she did act no one could accuse her of indecision then
she hit out as lustily as if she had not considered the matter at all
the letter that she wrote mrs wilcox glowed with the native hue of resolution
the pale cast of thought was with her a breath rather than a tarnish a breath that leaves the colours all the more vivid when it has been wiped away
dear mrs wilcox  i have to write something discourteous
it would be better if we did not meet
both my sister and my aunt have given displeasure to your family and in my sister's case the grounds for displeasure might recur
as far as i know she no longer occupies her thoughts with your son
but it would not be fair either to her or to you if they met and it is therefore right that our acquaintance which began so pleasantly should end
i fear that you will not agree with this indeed i know that you will not since you have been good enough to call on us
it is only an instinct on my part and no doubt the instinct is wrong
my sister would undoubtedly say that it is wrong
i write without her knowledge and i hope that you will not associate her with my discourtesy
believe me                                             yours truly                                           m j schlegel   margaret sent this letter round by post
next morning she received the following reply by hand   dear miss schlegel  you should not have written me such a letter
i called to tell you that paul has gone abroad
ruth wilcox   margaret's cheeks burnt
she could not finish her breakfast
she was on fire with shame
helen had told her that the youth was leaving england but other things had seemed more important and she had forgotten
all her absurd anxieties fell to the ground and in their place arose the certainty that she had been rude to mrs wilcox
rudeness affected margaret like a bitter taste in the mouth
it poisoned life
at times it is necessary but woe to those who employ it without due need
she flung on a hat and shawl just like a poor woman and plunged into the fog which still continued
her lips were compressed the letter remained in her hand and in this state she crossed the street entered the marble vestibule of the flats eluded the concierges and ran up the stairs till she reached the secondfloor
she sent in her name and to her surprise was shown straight into mrs wilcox's bedroom
oh mrs wilcox i have made the baddest blunder
i am more more ashamed and sorry than i can say
mrs wilcox bowed gravely
she was offended and did not pretend to the contrary
she was sitting up in bed writing letters on an invalid table that spanned her knees
a breakfast tray was on another table beside her
the light of the fire the light from the window and the light of a candlelamp which threw a quivering halo round her hands combined to create a strange atmosphere of dissolution
i knew he was going to india in november but i forgot
he sailed on the th for nigeria in africa
i knewi know
i have been too absurd all through
i am very much ashamed
mrs wilcox did not answer
i am more sorry than i can say and i hope that you will forgive me
it doesn't matter miss schlegel
it is good of you to have come round so promptly
it does matter cried margaret
i have been rude to you and my sister is not even at home so there was not even that excuse
indeed
she has just gone to germany
she gone as well murmured the other
yes certainly it is quite safesafe absolutely now
you've been worrying too
exclaimed margaret getting more and more excited and taking a chair without invitation
how perfectly extraordinary
i can see that you have
you felt as i do helen mustn't meet him again
i did think it best
now why
that's a most difficult question said mrs wilcox smiling and a little losing her expression of annoyance
i think you put it best in your letterit was an instinct which may be wrong
it wasn't that your son still  oh no he oftenmy paul is very young you see
then what was it
she repeated an instinct which may be wrong
in other words they belong to types that can fall in love but couldn't live together
that's dreadfully probable
i'm afraid that in nine cases out of ten nature pulls one way and human nature another
these are indeed 'other words' said mrs
wilcox
i had nothing so coherent in my head
i was merely alarmed when i knew that my boy cared for your sister
ah i have always been wanting to ask you
how did you know
helen was so surprised when our aunt drove up and you stepped forward and arranged things
did paul tell you
there is nothing to be gained by discussing that said mrs wilcox after a moment's pause
mrs wilcox were you very angry with us last june
i wrote you a letter and you didn't answer it
i was certainly against taking mrs matheson's flat
i knew it was opposite your house
but it's all right now
i think so
you only think
you aren't sure
i do love these little muddles tidied up
oh yes i'm sure said mrs wilcox moving with uneasiness beneath the clothes
i always sound uncertain over things
it is my way of speaking
that's all right and i'm sure too
here the maid came in to remove the breakfasttray
they were interrupted and when they resumed conversation it was on more normal lines
i must say goodbye nowyou will be getting up
noplease stop a little longeri am taking a day in bed
now and then i do
i thought of you as one of the early risers
at howards endyes there is nothing to get up for in london
nothing to get up for
cried the scandalized margaret
when there are all the autumn exhibitions and ysaye playing in the afternoon
not to mention people
the truth is i am a little tired
first came the wedding and then paul went off and instead of resting yesterday i paid a round of calls
a wedding
yes charles my elder son is married
indeed
we took the flat chiefly on that account and also that paul could get his african outfit
the flat belongs to a cousin of my husband's and she most kindly offered it to us
so before the day came we were able to make the acquaintance of dolly's people which we had not yet done
margaret asked who dolly's people were
fussell
the father is in the indian armyretired the brother is in the army
the mother is dead
so perhaps these were the chinless sunburnt men whom helen had espied one afternoon through the window
margaret felt mildly interested in the fortunes of the wilcox family
she had acquired the habit on helen's account and it still clung to her
she asked for more information about miss dolly fussell that was and was given it in even unemotional tones
mrs wilcox's voice though sweet and compelling had little range of expression
it suggested that pictures concerts and people are all of small and equal value
only once had it quickenedwhen speaking of howards end
charles and albert fussell have known one another some time
they belong to the same club and are both devoted to golf
dolly plays golf too though i believe not so well and they first met in a mixed foursome
we all like her and are very much pleased
they were married on the th a few days before paul sailed
charles was very anxious to have his brother as best man so he made a great point of having it on the th
the fussells would have preferred it after christmas but they were very nice about it
there is dolly's photographin that double frame
are you quite certain that i'm not interrupting mrs
wilcox
yes quite
then i will stay
i'm enjoying this
dolly's photograph was now examined
it was signed for dear mims which mrs wilcox interpreted as the name she and charles had settled that she should call me
dolly looked silly and had one of those triangular faces that so often prove attractive to a robust man
she was very pretty
from her margaret passed to charles whose features prevailed opposite
she speculated on the forces that had drawn the two together till god parted them
she found time to hope that they would be happy
they have gone to naples for their honeymoon
lucky people
i can hardly imagine charles in italy
doesn't he care for travelling
he likes travel but he does see through foreigners so
what he enjoys most is a motor tour in england and i think that would have carried the day if the weather had not been so abominable
his father gave him a car of his own for a wedding present which for the present is being stored at howards end
i suppose you have a garage there
yes
my husband built a little one only last month to the west of the house not far from the wychelm in what used to be the paddock for the pony
the last words had an indescribable ring about them
where's the pony gone
asked margaret after a pause
the pony
oh dead ever so long ago
the wychelm i remember
helen spoke of it as a very splendid tree
it is the finest wychelm in hertfordshire
did your sister tell you about the teeth
no
oh it might interest you
there are pigs' teeth stuck into the trunk about four feet from the ground
the country people put them in long ago and they think that if they chew a piece of the bark it will cure the toothache
the teeth are almost grown over now and no one comes to the tree
i should
i love folklore and all festering superstitions
do you think that the tree really did cure toothache if one believed in it
of course it did
it would cure anythingonce
certainly i remember casesyou see i lived at howards end long long before mr wilcox knew it
i was born there
the conversation again shifted
at the time it seemed little more than aimless chatter
she was interested when her hostess explained that howards end was her own property
she was bored when too minute an account was given of the fussell family of the anxieties of charles concerning naples of the movements of mr wilcox and evie who were motoring in yorkshire
margaret could not bear being bored
she grew inattentive played with the photograph frame dropped it smashed dolly's glass apologized was pardoned cut her finger thereon was pitied and finally said she must be goingthere was all the housekeeping to do and she had to interview tibby's ridingmaster
then the curious note was struck again
goodbye miss schlegel goodbye
thank you for coming
you have cheered me up
i'm so glad
ii wonder whether you ever think about yourself
i think of nothing else said margaret blushing but letting her hand remain in that of the invalid
i wonder
i wondered at heidelberg
i'm sure
i almost think  yes
asked margaret for there was a long pausea pause that was somehow akin to the flicker of the fire the quiver of the readinglamp upon their hands the white blur from the window a pause of shifting and eternal shadows
i almost think you forget you're a girl
margaret was startled and a little annoyed
i'm twentynine she remarked
that not so wildly girlish
mrs wilcox smiled
what makes you say that
do you mean that i have been gauche and rude
a shake of the head
i only meant that i am fiftyone and that to me both of youread it all in some book or other i cannot put things clearly
oh i've got itinexperience
i'm no better than helen you mean and yet i presume to advise her
yes
you have got it
inexperience is the word
inexperience repeated margaret in serious yet buoyant tones
of course i have everything to learnabsolutely everythingjust as much as helen
life's very difficult and full of surprises
at all events i've got as far as that
to be humble and kind to go straight ahead to love people rather than pity them to remember the submergedwell one can't do all these things at once worse luck because they're so contradictory
it's then that proportion comes into live by proportion
don't begin with proportion
only prigs do that
let proportion come in as a last resource when the better things have failed and a deadlockgracious me i've started preaching
indeed you put the difficulties of life splendidly said mrs wilcox withdrawing her hand into the deeper shadows
it is just what i should have liked to say about them myself
chapter   mrs wilcox cannot be accused of giving margaret much information about life
and margaret on the other hand has made a fair show of modesty and has pretended to an inexperience that she certainly did not feel
she had kept house for over ten years she had entertained almost with distinction she had brought up a charming sister and was bringing up a brother
surely if experience is attainable she had attained it
yet the little luncheonparty that she gave in mrs wilcox's honour was not a success
the new friend did not blend with the one or two delightful people who had been asked to meet her and the atmosphere was one of polite bewilderment
her tastes were simple her knowledge of culture slight and she was not interested in the new english art club nor in the dividingline between journalism and literature which was started as a conversational hare
the delightful people darted after it with cries of joy margaret leading them and not till the meal was half over did they realize that the principal guest had taken no part in the chase
there was no common topic
mrs wilcox whose life had been spent in the service of husband and sons had little to say to strangers who had never shared it and whose age was half her own
clever talk alarmed her and withered her delicate imaginings it was the social counterpart of a motorcar all jerks and she was a wisp of hay a flower
twice she deplored the weather twice criticized the train service on the great northern railway
they vigorously assented and rushed on and when she inquired whether there was any news of helen her hostess was too much occupied in placing rothenstein to answer
the question was repeated i hope that your sister is safe in germany by now
margaret checked herself and said yes thank you i heard on tuesday
but the demon of vociferation was in her and the next moment she was off again
only on tuesday for they live right away at stettin
did you ever know any one living at stettin
never said mrs wilcox gravely while her neighbour a young man low down in the education office began to discuss what people who lived at stettin ought to look like
was there such a thing as stettininity
margaret swept on
people at stettin drop things into boats out of overhanging warehouses
at least our cousins do but aren't particularly rich
the town isn't interesting except for a clock that rolls its eyes and the view of the oder which truly is something special
oh mrs wilcox you would love the oder
the river or rather riversthere seem to be dozens of themare intense blue and the plain they run through an intensest green
indeed
that sounds like a most beautiful view miss schlegel
so i say but helen who will muddle things says no it's like music
the course of the oder is to be like music
it's obliged to remind her of a symphonic poem
the part by the landingstage is in b minor if i remember rightly but lower down things get extremely mixed
there is a slodgy theme in several keys at once meaning mudbanks and another for the navigable canal and the exit into the baltic is in c sharp major pianissimo
what do the overhanging warehouses make of that
asked the man laughing
they make a great deal of it replied margaret unexpectedly rushing off on a new track
i think it's affectation to compare the oder to music and so do you but the overhanging warehouses of stettin take beauty seriously which we don't and the average englishman doesn't and despises all who do
now don't say 'germans have no taste' or i shall scream
they haven't
butbutsuch a tremendous but
they take poetry seriously
they do take poetry seriously
is anything gained by that
yes yes
the german is always on the lookout for beauty
he may miss it through stupidity or misinterpret it but he is always asking beauty to enter his life and i believe that in the end it will come
at heidelberg i met a fat veterinary surgeon whose voice broke with sobs as he repeated some mawkish poetry
so easy for me to laughi who never repeat poetry good or bad and cannot remember one fragment of verse to thrill myself with
my blood boilswell i'm half german so put it down to patriotismwhen i listen to the tasteful contempt of the average islander for things teutonic whether they're bocklin or my veterinary surgeon
'oh bocklin' they say 'he strains after beauty he peoples nature with gods too consciously'
of course bocklin strains because he wants somethingbeauty and all the other intangible gifts that are floating about the world
so his landscapes don't come off and leader's do
i am not sure that i agree
do you
said he turning to mrs wilcox
she replied i think miss schlegel puts everything splendidly and a chill fell on the conversation
oh mrs wilcox say something nicer than that
it's such a snub to be told you put things splendidly 
i do not mean it as a snub
your last speech interested me so much
generally people do not seem quite to like germany
i have long wanted to hear what is said on the other side
the other side
then you do disagree
oh good
give us your side
i have no side
but my husbandher voice softened the chill increasedhas very little faith in the continent and our children have all taken after him
on what grounds
do they feel that the continent is in bad form
mrs wilcox had no idea she paid little attention to grounds
she was not intellectual nor even alert and it was odd that all the same she should give the idea of greatness
margaret zigzagging with her friends over thought and art was conscious of a personality that transcended their own and dwarfed their activities
there was no bitterness in mrs wilcox there was not even criticism she was lovable and no ungracious or uncharitable word had passed her lips
yet she and daily life were out of focus one or the other must show blurred
and at lunch she seemed more out of focus than usual and nearer the line that divides life from a life that may be of greater importance
you will admit though that the continentit seems silly to speak of 'the continent' but really it is all more like itself than any part of it is like england
england is unique
do have another jelly first
i was going to say that the continent for good or for evil is interested in ideas
its literature and art have what one might call the kink of the unseen about them and this persists even through decadence and affectation
there is more liberty of action in england but for liberty of thought go to bureaucratic prussia
people will there discuss with humility vital questions that we here think ourselves too good to touch with tongs
i do not want to go to prussian said mrs wilcoxnot even to see that interesting view that you were describing
and for discussing with humility i am too old
we never discuss anything at howards end
then you ought to
said margaret
discussion keeps a house alive
it cannot stand by bricks and mortar alone
it cannot stand without them said mrs wilcox unexpectedly catching on to the thought and rousing for the first and last time a faint hope in the breasts of the delightful people
it cannot stand without them and i sometimes thinkbut i cannot expect your generation to agree for even my daughter disagrees with me here
never mind us or her
do say
i sometimes think that it is wiser to leave action and discussion to men
there was a little silence
one admits that the arguments against the suffrage are extraordinarily strong said a girl opposite leaning forward and crumbling her bread
are they
i never follow any arguments
i am only too thankful not to have a vote myself
we didn't mean the vote though did we
supplied margaret
aren't we differing on something much wider mrs wilcox
whether women are to remain what they have been since the dawn of history or whether since men have moved forward so far they too may move forward a little now
i say they may
i would even admit a biological change
i don't know i don't know
i must be getting back to my overhanging warehouse said the man
they've turned disgracefully strict
mrs wilcox also rose
oh but come upstairs for a little
miss quested plays
do you like macdowell
do you mind him only having two noises
if you must really go i'll see you out
won't you even have coffee
they left the diningroom closing the door behind them and as mrs wilcox buttoned up her jacket she said what an interesting life you all lead in london
no we don't said margaret with a sudden revulsion
we lead the lives of gibbering monkeys
mrs wilcoxreallywe have something quiet and stable at the bottom
we really have
all my friends have
don't pretend you enjoyed lunch for you loathed it but forgive me by coming again alone or by asking me to you
i am used to young people said mrs wilcox and with each word she spoke the outlines of known things grew dim
i hear a great deal of chatter at home for we like you entertain a great deal
with us it is more sport and politics buti enjoyed my lunch very much miss schlegel dear and am not pretending and only wish i could have joined in more
for one thing i'm not particularly well just today
for another you younger people move so quickly that it dazes me
charles is the same dolly the same
but we are all in the same boat old and young
i never forget that
they were silent for a moment
then with a newborn emotion they shook hands
the conversation ceased suddenly when margaret reentered the diningroom her friends had been talking over her new friend and had dismissed her as uninteresting
chapter   several days passed
was mrs wilcox one of the unsatisfactory peoplethere are many of themwho dangle intimacy and then withdraw it
they evoke our interests and affections and keep the life of the spirit dawdling round them
then they withdraw
when physical passion is involved there is a definite name for such behaviourflirtingand if carried far enough it is punishable by law
but no lawnot public opinion evenpunishes those who coquette with friendship though the dull ache that they inflict the sense of misdirected effort and exhaustion may be as intolerable
was she one of these
margaret feared so at first for with a londoner's impatience she wanted everything to be settled up immediately
she mistrusted the periods of quiet that are essential to true growth
desiring to book mrs wilcox as a friend she pressed on the ceremony pencil as it were in hand pressing the more because the rest of the family were away and the opportunity seemed favourable
but the elder woman would not be hurried
she refused to fit in with the wickham place set or to reopen discussion of helen and paul whom margaret would have utilized as a shortcut
she took her time or perhaps let time take her and when the crisis did come all was ready
the crisis opened with a message would miss schlegel come shopping
christmas was nearing and mrs wilcox felt behindhand with the presents
she had taken some more days in bed and must make up for lost time
margaret accepted and at eleven o'clock one cheerless morning they started out in a brougham
first of all began margaret we must make a list and tick off the people's names
my aunt always does and this fog may thicken up any moment
have you any ideas
i thought we would go to harrod's or the haymarket stores said mrs wilcox rather hopelessly
everything is sure to be there
i am not a good shopper
the din is so confusing and your aunt is quite rightone ought to make a list
take my notebook then and write your own name at the top of the page
oh hooray
said margaret writing it
how very kind of you to start with me
but she did not want to receive anything expensive
their acquaintance was singular rather than intimate and she divined that the wilcox clan would resent any expenditure on outsiders the more compact families do
she did not want to be thought a second helen who would snatch presents since she could not snatch young men nor to be exposed like a second aunt juley to the insults of charles
a certain austerity of demeanour was best and she added i don't really want a yuletide gift though
in fact i'd rather not
why
because i've odd ideas about christmas
because i have all that money can buy
i want more people but no more things
i should like to give you something worth your acquaintance miss schlegel in memory of your kindness to me during my lonely fortnight
it has so happened that i have been left alone and you have stopped me from brooding
i am too apt to brood
if that is so said margaret if i have happened to be of use to you which i didn't know you cannot pay me back with anything tangible
 i suppose not but one would like to
perhaps i shall think of something as we go about
her name remained at the head of the list but nothing was written opposite it
they drove from shop to shop
the air was white and when they alighted it tasted like cold pennies
at times they passed through a clot of grey
mrs wilcox's vitality was low that morning and it was margaret who decided on a horse for this little girl a golliwog for that for the rector's wife a copper warmingtray
we always give the servants money
yes do you yes much easier replied margaret but felt the grotesque impact of the unseen upon the seen and saw issuing from a forgotten manger at bethlehem this torrent of coins and toys
vulgarity reigned
publichouses besides their usual exhortation against temperance reform invited men to join our christmas goose clubone bottle of gin etc or two according to subscription
a poster of a woman in tights heralded the christmas pantomime and little red devils who had come in again that year were prevalent upon the christmascards
margaret was no morbid idealist
she did not wish this spate of business and selfadvertisement checked
it was only the occasion of it that struck her with amazement annually
how many of these vacillating shoppers and tired shopassistants realized that it was a divine event that drew them together
she realized it though standing outside in the matter
she was not a christian in the accepted sense she did not believe that god had ever worked among us as a young artisan
these people or most of them believed it and if pressed would affirm it in words
but the visible signs of their belief were regent street or drury lane a little mud displaced a little money spent a little food cooked eaten and forgotten
inadequate
but in public who shall express the unseen adequately
it is private life that holds out the mirror to infinity personal intercourse and that alone that ever hints at a personality beyond our daily vision
no i do like christmas on the whole she announced
in its clumsy way it does approach peace and goodwill
but oh it is clumsier every year
is it
i am only used to country christmases
we are usually in london and play the game with vigourcarols at the abbey clumsy midday meal clumsy dinner for the maids followed by christmastree and dancing of poor children with songs from helen
the drawingroom does very well for that
we put the tree in the powdercloset and draw a curtain when the candles are lighted and with the lookingglass behind it looks quite pretty
i wish we might have a powdercloset in our next house
of course the tree has to be very small and the presents don't hang on it
no the presents reside in a sort of rocky landscape made of crumpled brown paper
you spoke of your 'next house' miss schlegel
then are you leaving wickham place
yes in two or three years when the lease expires
we must
have you been there long
all our lives
you will be very sorry to leave it
i suppose so
we scarcely realize it yet
my father she broke off for they had reached the stationery department of the haymarket stores and mrs wilcox wanted to order some private greeting cards
if possible something distinctive she sighed
at the counter she found a friend bent on the same errand and conversed with her insipidly wasting much time
my husband and our daughter are motoring
bertha too
oh fancy what a coincidence
margaret though not practical could shine in such company as this
while they talked she went through a volume of specimen cards and submitted one for mrs wilcox's inspection
mrs wilcox was delightedso original words so sweet she would order a hundred like that and could never be sufficiently grateful
then just as the assistant was booking the order she said do you know i'll wait
on second thoughts i'll wait
there's plenty of time still isn't there and i shall be able to get evie's opinion
they returned to the carriage by devious paths when they were in she said but couldn't you get it renewed
i beg your pardon
asked margaret
the lease i mean
oh the lease
have you been thinking of that all the time
how very kind of you
surely something could be done
no values have risen too enormously
they mean to pull down wickham place and build flats like yours
but how horrible
landlords are horrible
then she said vehemently it is monstrous miss schlegel it isn't right
i had no idea that this was hanging over you
i do pity you from the bottom of my heart
to be parted from your house your father's houseit oughtn't to be allowed
it is worse than dying
i would rather die thanoh poor girls
can what they call civilization be right if people mayn't die in the room where they were born
my dear i am so sorry  margaret did not know what to say
mrs wilcox had been overtired by the shopping and was inclined to hysteria
howards end was nearly pulled down once
it would have killed me
howards end must be a very different house to ours
we are fond of ours but there is nothing distinctive about it
as you saw it is an ordinary london house
we shall easily find another
so you think
again my lack of experience i suppose
said margaret easing away from the subject
i can't say anything when you take up that line mrs wilcox
i wish i could see myself as you see meforeshortened into a backfisch
quite the ingenue
very charmingwonderfully well read for my age but incapable  mrs wilcox would not be deterred
come down with me to howards end now she said more vehemently than ever
i want you to see it
you have never seen it
i want to hear what you say about it for you do put things so wonderfully
margaret glanced at the pitiless air and then at the tired face of her companion
later on i should love it she continued but it's hardly the weather for such an expedition and we ought to start when we're fresh
isn't the house shut up too
she received no answer
mrs wilcox appeared to be annoyed
might i come some other day
mrs wilcox bent forward and tapped the glass
back to wickham place please
was her order to the coachman
margaret had been snubbed
a thousand thanks miss schlegel for all your help
not at all
it is such a comfort to get the presents off my mindthe christmascards especially
i do admire your choice
it was her turn to receive no answer
in her turn margaret became annoyed
my husband and evie will be back the day after tomorrow
that is why i dragged you out shopping today
i stayed in town chiefly to shop but got through nothing and now he writes that they must cut their tour short the weather is so bad and the policetraps have been so badnearly as bad as in surrey
ours is such a careful chauffeur and my husband feels it particularly hard that they should be treated like roadhogs
why
well naturally hehe isn't a roadhog
he was exceeding the speedlimit i conclude
he must expect to suffer with the lower animals
mrs wilcox was silenced
in growing discomfort they drove homewards
the city seemed satanic the narrower streets oppressing like the galleries of a mine
no harm was done by the fog to trade for it lay high and the lighted windows of the shops were thronged with customers
it was rather a darkening of the spirit which fell back upon itself to find a more grievous darkness within
margaret nearly spoke a dozen times but something throttled her
she felt petty and awkward and her meditations on christmas grew more cynical
peace
it may bring other gifts but is there a single londoner to whom christmas is peaceful
the craving for excitement and for elaboration has ruined that blessing
goodwill
had she seen any example of it in the hordes of purchasers
or in herself
she had failed to respond to this invitation merely because it was a little queer and imaginativeshe whose birthright it was to nourish imagination
better to have accepted to have tired themselves a little by the journey than coldly to reply might i come some other day
her cynicism left her
there would be no other day
this shadowy woman would never ask her again
they parted at the mansions
mrs wilcox went in after due civilities and margaret watched the tall lonely figure sweep up the hall to the lift
as the glass doors closed on it she had the sense of an imprisonment
the beautiful head disappeared first still buried in the muff the long trailing skirt followed
a woman of undefinable rarity was going up heavenward like a specimen in a bottle
and into what a heavena vault as of hell sooty black from which soots descended
at lunch her brother seeing her inclined for silence insisted on talking
tibby was not illnatured but from babyhood something drove him to do the unwelcome and the unexpected
now he gave her a long account of the dayschool that he sometimes patronized
the account was interesting and she had often pressed him for it before but she could not attend now for her mind was focussed on the invisible
she discerned that mrs wilcox though a loving wife and mother had only one passion in lifeher houseand that the moment was solemn when she invited a friend to share this passion with her
to answer another day was to answer as a fool
another day will do for brick and mortar but not for the holy of holies into which howards end had been transfigured
her own curiosity was slight
she had heard more than enough about it in the summer
the nine windows the vine and the wychelm had no pleasant connections for her and she would have preferred to spend the afternoon at a concert
but imagination triumphed
while her brother held forth she determined to go at whatever cost and to compel mrs wilcox to go too
when lunch was over she stepped over to the flats
mrs wilcox had just gone away for the night
margaret said that it was of no consequence hurried downstairs and took a hansom to king's cross
she was convinced that the escapade was important though it would have puzzled her to say why
there was a question of imprisonment and escape and though she did not know the time of the train she strained her eyes for the st pancras' clock
then the clock of king's cross swung into sight a second moon in that infernal sky and her cab drew up at the station
there was a train for hilton in five minutes
she took a ticket asking in her agitation for a single
as she did so a grave and happy voice saluted her and thanked her
i will come if i still may said margaret laughing nervously
you are coming to sleep dear too
it is in the morning that my house is most beautiful
you are coming to stop
i cannot show you my meadow properly except at sunrise
these fogsshe pointed at the station roofnever spread far
i dare say they are sitting in the sun in hertfordshire and you will never repent joining them
i shall never repent joining you
it is the same
they began the walk up the long platform
far at its end stood the train breasting the darkness without
they never reached it
before imagination could triumph there were cries of mother
mother
and a heavybrowed girl darted out of the cloakroom and seized mrs wilcox by the arm
evie
she gasped
evie my pet  the girl called father
i say
look who's here
evie dearest girl why aren't you in yorkshire
nomotor smashchanged plansfather's coming
why ruth
cried mr wilcox joining them
what in the name of all that's wonderful are you doing here ruth
mrs wilcox had recovered herself
oh henry dear
here's a lovely surprisebut let me introducebut i think you know miss schlegel
oh yes he replied not greatly interested
but how's yourself ruth
fit as a fiddle she answered gaily
so are we and so was our car which ran a as far as ripon but there a wretched horse and cart which a fool of a driver  miss schlegel our little outing must be for another day
i was saying that this fool of a driver as the policeman himself admits  another day mrs wilcox
of course
but as we've insured against third party risks it won't so much matter  cart and car being practically at right angles  the voices of the happy family rose high
margaret was left alone
no one wanted her
mrs wilcox walked out of king's cross between her husband and her daughter listening to both of them
chapter   the funeral was over
the carriages rolled away through the soft mud and only the poor remained
they approached to the newlydug shaft and looked their last at the coffin now almost hidden beneath the spadefuls of clay
it was their moment
most of them were women from the dead woman's district to whom black garments had been served out by mr wilcox's orders
pure curiosity had brought others
they thrilled with the excitement of a death and of a rapid death and stood in groups or moved between the graves like drops of ink
the son of one of them a woodcutter was perched high above their heads pollarding one of the churchyard elms
from where he sat he could see the village of hilton strung upon the north road with its accreting suburbs the sunset beyond scarlet and orange winking at him beneath brows of grey the church the plantations and behind him an unspoilt country of fields and farms
but he too was rolling the event luxuriously in his mouth
he tried to tell his mother down below all that he had felt when he saw the coffin approaching how he could not leave his work and yet did not like to go on with it how he had almost slipped out of the tree he was so upset the rooks had cawed and no wonderit was as if rooks knew too
his mother claimed the prophetic power herselfshe had seen a strange look about mrs wilcox for some time
london had done the mischief said others
she had been a kind lady her grandmother had been kind tooa plainer person but very kind
ah the old sort was dying out
mr wilcox he was a kind gentleman
they advanced to the topic again and again dully but with exaltation
the funeral of a rich person was to them what the funeral of alcestis or ophelia is to the educated
it was art though remote from life it enhanced life's values and they witnessed it avidly
the gravediggers who had kept up an undercurrent of disapprovalthey disliked charles it was not a moment to speak of such things but they did not like charles wilcoxthe gravediggers finished their work and piled up the wreaths and crosses above it
the sun set over hilton the grey brows of the evening flushed a little and were cleft with one scarlet frown
chattering sadly to each other the mourners passed through the lychgate and traversed the chestnut avenues that led down to the village
the young woodcutter stayed a little longer poised above the silence and swaying rhythmically
at last the bough fell beneath his saw
with a grunt he descended his thoughts dwelling no longer on death but on love for he was mating
he stopped as he passed the new grave a sheaf of tawny chrysanthemums had caught his eye
they didn't ought to have coloured flowers at buryings he reflected
trudging on a few steps he stopped again looked furtively at the dusk turned back wrenched a chrysanthemum from the sheaf and hid it in his pocket
after him came silence absolute
the cottage that abutted on the churchyard was empty and no other house stood near
hour after hour the scene of the interment remained without an eye to witness it
clouds drifted over it from the west or the church may have been a ship highprowed steering with all its company towards infinity
towards morning the air grew colder the sky clearer the surface of the earth hard and sparkling above the prostrate dead
the woodcutter returning after a night of joy reflected they lilies they chrysants it's a pity i didn't take them all
up at howards end they were attempting breakfast
charles and evie sat in the diningroom with mrs charles
their father who could not bear to see a face breakfasted upstairs
he suffered acutely
pain came over him in spasms as if it was physical and even while he was about to eat his eyes would fill with tears and he would lay down the morsel untasted
he remembered his wife's even goodness during thirty years
not anything in detailnot courtship or early rapturesbut just the unvarying virtue that seemed to him a woman's noblest quality
so many women are capricious breaking into odd flaws of passion or frivolity
not so his wife
year after year summer and winter as bride and mother she had been the same he had always trusted her
her tenderness
her innocence
the wonderful innocence that was hers by the gift of god
ruth knew no more of worldly wickedness and wisdom than did the flowers in her garden or the grass in her field
her idea of businesshenry why do people who have enough money try to get more money
her idea of politicsi am sure that if the mothers of various nations could meet there would be no more wars
her idea of religionah this had been a cloud but a cloud that passed
she came of quaker stock and he and his family formerly dissenters were now members of the church of england
the rector's sermons had at first repelled her and she had expressed a desire for a more inward light adding not so much for myself as for baby charles
inward light must have been granted for he heard no complaints in later years
they brought up their three children without dispute
they had never disputed
she lay under the earth now
she had gone and as if to make her going the more bitter had gone with a touch of mystery that was all unlike her
why didn't you tell me you knew of it
he had moaned and her faint voice had answered i didn't want to henryi might have been wrongand every one hates illnesses
he had been told of the horror by a strange doctor whom she had consulted during his absence from town
was this altogether just
without fully explaining she had died
it was a fault on her part andtears rushed into his eyeswhat a little fault
it was the only time she had deceived him in those thirty years
he rose to his feet and looked out of the window for evie had come in with the letters and he could meet no one's eye
ah yesshe had been a good womanshe had been steady
he chose the word deliberately
to him steadiness included all praise
he himself gazing at the wintry garden is in appearance a steady man
his face was not as square as his son's and indeed the chin though firm enough in outline retreated a little and the lips ambiguous were curtained by a moustache
but there was no external hint of weakness
the eyes if capable of kindness and goodfellowship if ruddy for the moment with tears were the eyes of one who could not be driven
the forehead too was like charles's
high and straight brown and polished merging abruptly into temples and skull it has the effect of a bastion that protected his head from the world
at times it had the effect of a blank wall
he had dwelt behind it intact and happy for fifty years
the post's come father said evie awkwardly
thanks
put it down
has the breakfast been all right
yes thanks
the girl glanced at him and at it with constraint
she did not know what to do
charles says do you want the times
no i'll read it later
ring if you want anything father won't you
i've all i want
having sorted the letters from the circulars she went back to the diningroom
father's eaten nothing she announced sitting down with wrinkled brows behind the teaurn  charles did not answer but after a moment he ran quickly upstairs opened the door and said look here father you must eat you know and having paused for a reply that did not come stole down again
he's going to read his letters first i think he said evasively i dare say he will go on with his breakfast afterwards
then he took up the times and for some time there was no sound except the clink of cup against saucer and of knife on plate
poor mrs charles sat between her silent companions terrified at the course of events and a little bored
she was a rubbishy little creature and she knew it
a telegram had dragged her from naples to the deathbed of a woman whom she had scarcely known
a word from her husband had plunged her into mourning
she desired to mourn inwardly as well but she wished that mrs wilcox since fated to die could have died before the marriage for then less would have been expected of her
crumbling her toast and too nervous to ask for the butter she remained almost motionless thankful only for this that her fatherinlaw was having his breakfast upstairs
at last charles spoke
they had no business to be pollarding those elms yesterday he said to his sister
no indeed
i must make a note of that he continued
i am surprised that the rector allowed it
perhaps it may not be the rector's affair
whose else could it be
the lord of the manor
impossible
butter dolly
thank you evie dear
charles  yes dear
i didn't know one could pollard elms
i thought one only pollarded willows
oh no one can pollard elms
then why oughtn't the elms in the churchyard to be pollarded
charles frowned a little and turned again to his sister
another point
i must speak to chalkeley
yes rather you must complain to chalkeley
it's no good him saying he is not responsible for those men
he is responsible
yes rather
brother and sister were not callous
they spoke thus partly because they desired to keep chalkeley up to the marka healthy desire in its waypartly because they avoided the personal note in life
all wilcoxes did
it did not seem to them of supreme importance
or it may be as helen supposed they realized its importance but were afraid of it
panic and emptiness could one glance behind
they were not callous and they left the breakfasttable with aching hearts
their mother never had come in to breakfast
it was in the other rooms and especially in the garden that they felt her loss most
as charles went out to the garage he was reminded at every step of the woman who had loved him and whom he could never replace
what battles he had fought against her gentle conservatism
how she had disliked improvements yet how loyally she had accepted them when made
he and his fatherwhat trouble they had had to get this very garage
with what difficulty had they persuaded her to yield them to the paddock for itthe paddock that she loved more dearly than the garden itself
the vineshe had got her way about the vine
it still encumbered the south wall with its unproductive branches
and so with evie as she stood talking to the cook
though she could take up her mother's work inside the house just as the man could take it up without she felt that something unique had fallen out of her life
their grief though less poignant than their father's grew from deeper roots for a wife may be replaced a mother never
charles would go back to the office
there was little to do at howards end
the contents of his mother's will had been long known to them
there were no legacies no annuities none of the posthumous bustle with which some of the dead prolong their activities
trusting her husband she had left him everything without reserve
she was quite a poor womanthe house had been all her dowry and the house would come to charles in time
her watercolours mr wilcox intended to reserve for paul while evie would take the jewellery and lace
how easily she slipped out of life
charles thought the habit laudable though he did not intend to adopt it himself whereas margaret would have seen in it an almost culpable indifference to earthly fame
cynicismnot the superficial cynicism that snarls and sneers but the cynicism that can go with courtesy and tendernessthat was the note of mrs wilcox's will
she wanted not to vex people
that accomplished the earth might freeze over her for ever
no there was nothing for charles to wait for
he could not go on with his honeymoon so he would go up to london and workhe felt too miserable hanging about
he and dolly would have the furnished flat while his father rested quietly in the country with evie
he could also keep an eye on his own little house which was being painted and decorated for him in one of the surrey suburbs and in which he hoped to install himself soon after christmas
yes he would go up after lunch in his new motor and the town servants who had come down for the funeral would go up by train
he found his father's chauffeur in the garage said morning without looking at the man's face and bending over the car continued hullo
my new car's been driven
has it sir
yes said charles getting rather red and whoever's driven it hasn't cleaned it properly for there's mud on the axle
take it off
the man went for the cloths without a word
he was a chauffeur as ugly as sinnot that this did him disservice with charles who thought charm in a man rather rot and had soon got rid of the little italian beast with whom they had started
charles his bride was tripping after him over the hoarfrost a dainty black column her little face and elaborate mourning hat forming the capital thereof
one minute i'm busy
well crane who's been driving it do you suppose
don't know i'm sure sir
no one's driven it since i've been back but of course there's the fortnight i've been away with the other car in yorkshire
the mud came off easily
charles your father's down
something's happened
he wants you in the house at once
oh charles
wait dear wait a minute
who had the key to the garage while you were away crane
the gardener sir
do you mean to tell me that old penny can drive a motor
no sir no one's had the motor out sir
then how do you account for the mud on the axle
i can't of course say for the time i've been in yorkshire
no more mud now sir
charles was vexed
the man was treating him as a fool and if his heart had not been so heavy he would have reported him to his father
but it was not a morning for complaints
ordering the motor to be round after lunch he joined his wife who had all the while been pouring out some incoherent story about a letter and a miss schlegel
now dolly i can attend to you
miss schlegel
what does she want
when people wrote a letter charles always asked what they wanted
want was to him the only cause of action
and the question in this case was correct for his wife replied she wants howards end
howards end
now crane just don't forget to put on the stepney wheel
no sir
now mind you don't forget for icome little woman
when they were out of the chauffeur's sight he put his arm around her waist and pressed her against him
all his affection and half his attentionit was what he granted her throughout their happy married life
but you haven't listened charles  what's wrong
i keep on telling youhowards end
miss schlegels got it
got what
asked charles unclasping her
what the dickens are you talking about
now charles you promised not to say those naughty  look here i'm in no mood for foolery
it's no morning for it either
i tell youi keep on telling youmiss schlegelshe's got ityour mother's left it to herand you've all got to move out
howards end
howards end
she screamed mimicking him and as she did so evie came dashing out of the shrubbery
dolly go back at once
my father's much annoyed with you
charlesshe hit herself wildlycome in at once to father
he's had a letter that's too awful
charles began to run but checked himself and stepped heavily across the gravel path
there the house wasthe nine windows the unprolific vine
he exclaimed schlegels again
and as if to complete chaos dolly said oh no the matron of the nursing home has written instead of her
come in all three of you
cried his father no longer inert
dolly why have you disobeyed me
oh mr wilcox  i told you not to go out to the garage
i've heard you all shouting in the garden
i won't have it
come in
he stood in the porch transformed letters in his hand
into the diningroom every one of you
we can't discuss private matters in the middle of all the servants
here charles here read these
see what you make
charles took two letters and read them as he followed the procession
the first was a covering note from the matron
mrs wilcox had desired her when the funeral should be over to forward the enclosed
the enclosedit was from his mother herself
she had written to my husband i should like miss schlegel margaret to have howards end
i suppose we're going to have a talk about this
he remarked ominously calm
certainly
i was coming out to you when dolly  well let's sit down
come evie don't waste time sit down
in silence they drew up to the breakfasttable
the events of yesterdayindeed of this morningsuddenly receded into a past so remote that they seemed scarcely to have lived in it
heavy breathings were heard
they were calming themselves
charles to steady them further read the enclosure out loud a note in my mother's handwriting in an envelope addressed to my father sealed
inside 'i should like miss schlegel margaret to have howards end'
no date no signature
forwarded through the matron of that nursing home
now the question is  dolly interrupted him
but i say that note isn't legal
houses ought to be done by a lawyer charles surely
her husband worked his jaw severely
little lumps appeared in front of either eara symptom that she had not yet learnt to respect and she asked whether she might see the note
charles looked at his father for permission who said abstractedly give it her
she seized it and at once exclaimed why it's only in pencil
i said so
pencil never counts
we know that it is not legally binding dolly said mr wilcox speaking from out of his fortress
we are aware of that
legally i should be justified in tearing it up and throwing it into the fire
of course my dear we consider you as one of the family but it will be better if you do not interfere with what you do not understand
charles vexed both with his father and his wife then repeated the question is he had cleared a space of the breakfasttable from plates and knives so that he could draw patterns on the tablecloth
the question is whether miss schlegel during the fortnight we were all away whether she unduly he stopped
i don't think that said his father whose nature was nobler than his son's  don't think what
that she would havethat it is a case of undue influence
no to my mind the question is thethe invalid's condition at the time she wrote
my dear father consult an expert if you like but i don't admit it is my mother's writing
why you just said it was
cried dolly
never mind if i did he blazed out and hold your tongue
the poor little wife coloured at this and drawing her handkerchief from her pocket shed a few tears
no one noticed her
evie was scowling like an angry boy
the two men were gradually assuming the manner of the committeeroom
they were both at their best when serving on committees
they did not make the mistake of handling human affairs in the bulk but disposed of them item by item sharply
calligraphy was the item before them now and on it they turned their welltrained brains
charles after a little demur accepted the writing as genuine and they passed on to the next point
it is the bestperhaps the onlyway of dodging emotion
they were the average human article and had they considered the note as a whole it would have driven them miserable or mad
considered item by item the emotional content was minimized and all went forward smoothly
the clock ticked the coals blazed higher and contended with the white radiance that poured in through the windows
unnoticed the sun occupied his sky and the shadows of the tree stems extraordinarily solid fell like trenches of purple across the frosted lawn
it was a glorious winter morning
evie's fox terrier who had passed for white was only a dirty grey dog now so intense was the purity that surrounded him
he was discredited but the blackbirds that he was chasing glowed with arabian darkness for all the conventional colouring of life had been altered
inside the clock struck ten with a rich and confident note
other clocks confirmed it and the discussion moved towards its close
to follow it is unnecessary
it is rather a moment when the commentator should step forward
ought the wilcoxes to have offered their home to margaret
i think not
the appeal was too flimsy
it was not legal it had been written in illness and under the spell of a sudden friendship it was contrary to the dead woman's intentions in the past contrary to her very nature so far as that nature was understood by them
to them howards end was a house they could not know that to her it had been a spirit for which she sought a spiritual heir
andpushing one step farther in these mistsmay they not have decided even better than they supposed
is it credible that the possessions of the spirit can be bequeathed at all
has the soul offspring
a wychelm tree a vine a wisp of hay with dew on itcan passion for such things be transmitted where there is no bond of blood
no the wilcoxes are not to be blamed
the problem is too terrific and they could not even perceive a problem
no it is natural and fitting that after due debate they should tear the note up and throw it on to their diningroom fire
the practical moralist may acquit them absolutely
he who strives to look deeper may acquit themalmost
for one hard fact remains
they did neglect a personal appeal
the woman who had died did say to them do this and they answered we will not
the incident made a most painful impression on them
grief mounted into the brain and worked there disquietingly
yesterday they had lamented she was a dear mother a true wife in our absence she neglected her health and died
today they thought she was not as true as dear as we supposed
the desire for a more inward light had found expression at last the unseen had impacted on the seen and all that they could say was treachery
mrs wilcox had been treacherous to the family to the laws of property to her own written word
how did she expect howards end to be conveyed to miss schlegel
was her husband to whom it legally belonged to make it over to her as a free gift
was the said miss schlegel to have a life interest in it or to own it absolutely
was there to be no compensation for the garage and other improvements that they had made under the assumption that all would be theirs some day
treacherous
treacherous and absurd
when we think the dead both treacherous and absurd we have gone far towards reconciling ourselves to their departure
that note scribbled in pencil sent through the matron was unbusinesslike as well as cruel and decreased at once the value of the woman who had written it
ah well
said mr wilcox rising from the table
i shouldn't have thought it possible
mother couldn't have meant it said evie still frowning
no my girl of course not
mother believed so in ancestors tooit isn't like her to leave anything to an outsider who'd never appreciate 
the whole thing is unlike her he announced
if miss schlegel had been poor if she had wanted a house i could understand it a little
but she has a house of her own
why should she want another
she wouldn't have any use of howards end
that time may prove murmured charles
how
asked his sister
presumably she knowsmother will have told her
she got twice or three times into the nursing home
presumably she is awaiting developments
what a horrid woman
and dolly who had recovered cried why she may be coming down to turn us out now
charles put her right
i wish she would he said ominously
i could then deal with her
so could i echoed his father who was feeling rather in the cold
charles had been kind in undertaking the funeral arrangements and in telling him to eat his breakfast but the boy as he grew up was a little dictatorial and assumed the post of chairman too readily
i could deal with her if she comes but she won't come
you're all a bit hard on miss schlegel
that paul business was pretty scandalous though
i want no more of the paul business charles as i said at the time and besides it is quite apart from this business
margaret schlegel has been officious and tiresome during this terrible week and we have all suffered under her but upon my soul she's honest
she's not in collusion with the matron
i'm absolutely certain of it
nor was she with the doctor
i'm equally certain of that
she did not hide anything from us for up to that very afternoon she was as ignorant as we are
she like ourselves was a dupe he stopped for a moment
you see charles in her terrible pain your poor mother put us all in false positions
paul would not have left england you would not have gone to italy nor evie and i into yorkshire if only we had known
well miss schlegel's position has been equally false
take all in all she has not come out of it badly
evie said but those chrysanthemums  or coming down to the funeral at all echoed dolly
why shouldn't she come down
she had the right to and she stood far back among the hilton women
the flowerscertainly we should not have sent such flowers but they may have seemed the right thing to her evie and for all you know they may be the custom in germany 
oh i forget she isn't really english cried evie
that would explain a lot
she's a cosmopolitan said charles looking at his watch
i admit i'm rather down on cosmopolitans
my fault doubtless
i cannot stand them and a german cosmopolitan is the limit
i think that's about all isn't it
i want to run down and see chalkeley
a bicycle will do
and by the way i wish you'd speak to crane some time
i'm certain he's had my new car out
has he done it any harm
no
in that case i shall let it pass
it's not worth while having a row
charles and his father sometimes disagreed
but they always parted with an increased regard for one another and each desired no doughtier comrade when it was necessary to voyage for a little past the emotions
so the sailors of ulysses voyaged past the sirens having first stopped one another's ears with wool
chapter   charles need not have been anxious
miss schlegel had never heard of his mother's strange request
she was to hear of it in after years when she had built up her life differently and it was to fit into position as the headstone of the corner
her mind was bent on other questions now and by her also it would have been rejected as the fantasy of an invalid
she was parting from these wilcoxes for the second time
paul and his mother ripple and great wave had flowed into her life and ebbed out of it for ever
the ripple had left no traces behind the wave had strewn at her feet fragments torn from the unknown
a curious seeker she stood for a while at the verge of the sea that tells so little but tells a little and watched the outgoing of this last tremendous tide
her friend had vanished in agony but not she believed in degradation
her withdrawal had hinted at other things besides disease and pain
some leave our life with tears others with an insane frigidity mrs wilcox had taken the middle course which only rarer natures can pursue
she had kept proportion
she had told a little of her grim secret to her friends but not too much she had shut up her heartalmost but not entirely
it is thus if there is any rule that we ought to dieneither as victim nor as fanatic but as the seafarer who can greet with an equal eye the deep that he is entering and the shore that he must leave
the last wordwhatever it would behad certainly not been said in hilton churchyard
she had not died there
a funeral is not death any more than baptism is birth or marriage union
all three are the clumsy devices coming now too late now too early by which society would register the quick motions of man
in margaret's eyes mrs wilcox had escaped registration
she had gone out of life vividly her own way and no dust was so truly dust as the contents of that heavy coffin lowered with ceremonial until it rested on the dust of the earth no flowers so utterly wasted as the chrysanthemums that the frost must have withered before morning
margaret had once said she loved superstition
it was not true
few women had tried more earnestly to pierce the accretions in which body and soul are enwrapped
the death of mrs wilcox had helped her in her work
she saw a little more clearly than hitherto what a human being is and to what he may aspire
truer relationships gleamed
perhaps the last word would be hopehope even on this side of the grave
meanwhile she could take an interest in the survivors
in spite of her christmas duties in spite of her brother the wilcoxes continued to play a considerable part in her thoughts
she had seen so much of them in the final week
they were not her sort they were often suspicious and stupid and deficient where she excelled but collision with them stimulated her and she felt an interest that verged into liking even for charles
she desired to protect them and often felt that they could protect her excelling where she was deficient
once past the rocks of emotion they knew so well what to do whom to send for their hands were on all the ropes they had grit as well as grittiness and she valued grit enormously
they led a life that she could not attain tothe outer life of telegrams and anger which had detonated when helen and paul had touched in june and had detonated again the other week
to margaret this life was to remain a real force
she could not despise it as helen and tibby affected to do
it fostered such virtues as neatness decision and obedience virtues of the second rank no doubt but they have formed our civilization
they form character too margaret could not doubt it they keep the soul from becoming sloppy
how dare schlegels despise wilcoxes when it takes all sorts to make a world
don't brood too much she wrote to helen on the superiority of the unseen to the seen
it's true but to brood on it is mediaeval
our business is not to contrast the two but to reconcile them
helen replied that she had no intention of brooding on such a dull subject
what did her sister take her for
the weather was magnificent
she and the mosebachs had gone tobogganing on the only hill that pomerania boasted
it was fun but overcrowded for the rest of pomerania had gone there too
helen loved the country and her letter glowed with physical exercise and poetry
she spoke of the scenery quiet yet august of the snowclad fields with their scampering herds of deer of the river and its quaint entrance into the baltic sea of the oderberge only three hundred feet high from which one slid all too quickly back into the pomeranian plains and yet these oderberge were real mountains with pineforests streams and views complete
it isn't size that counts so much as the way things are arranged
in another paragraph she referred to mrs wilcox sympathetically but the news had not bitten into her
she had not realized the accessories of death which are in a sense more memorable than death itself
the atmosphere of precautions and recriminations and in the midst a human body growing more vivid because it was in pain the end of that body in hilton churchyard the survival of something that suggested hope vivid in its turn against life's workaday cheerfulnessall these were lost to helen who only felt that a pleasant lady could now be pleasant no longer
she returned to wickham place full of her own affairsshe had had another proposaland margaret after a moment's hesitation was content that this should be so
the proposal had not been a serious matter
it was the work of fraulein mosebach who had conceived the large and patriotic notion of winning back her cousins to the fatherland by matrimony
england had played paul wilcox and lost germany played herr forstmeister someonehelen could not remember his name
herr forstmeister lived in a wood and standing on the summit of the oderberge he had pointed out his house to helen or rather had pointed out the wedge of pines in which it lay
she had exclaimed oh how lovely
that's the place for me
and in the evening frieda appeared in her bedroom
i have a message dear helen etc and so she had but had been very nice when helen laughed quite understooda forest too solitary and dampquite agreed but herr forstmeister believed he had assurance to the contrary
germany had lost but with goodhumour holding the manhood of the world she felt bound to win
and there will even be someone for tibby concluded helen
there now tibby think of that frieda is saving up a little girl for you in pigtails and white worsted stockings but the feet of the stockings are pink as if the little girl had trodden in strawberries
i've talked too much
my head aches
now you talk
tibby consented to talk
he too was full of his own affairs for he had just been up to try for a scholarship at oxford
the men were down and the candidates had been housed in various colleges and had dined in hall
tibby was sensitive to beauty the experience was new and he gave a description of his visit that was almost glowing
the august and mellow university soaked with the richness of the western counties that it has served for a thousand years appealed at once to the boy's taste it was the kind of thing he could understand and he understood it all the better because it was empty
oxford isoxford not a mere receptacle for youth like cambridge
perhaps it wants its inmates to love it rather than to love one another such at all events was to be its effect on tibby
his sisters sent him there that he might make friends for they knew that his education had been cranky and had severed him from other boys and men
he made no friends
his oxford remained oxford empty and he took into life with him not the memory of a radiance but the memory of a colour scheme
it pleased margaret to hear her brother and sister talking
they did not get on overwell as a rule
for a few moments she listened to them feeling elderly and benign
then something occurred to her and she interrupted  helen i told you about poor mrs wilcox that sad business
yes
i have had a correspondence with her son
he was winding up the estate and wrote to ask me whether his mother had wanted me to have anything
i thought it good of him considering i knew her so little
i said that she had once spoken of giving me a christmas present but we both forgot about it afterwards
i hope charles took the hint
yesthat is to say her husband wrote later on and thanked me for being a little kind to her and actually gave me her silver vinaigrette
don't you think that is extraordinarily generous
it has made me like him very much
he hopes that this will not be the end of our acquaintance but that you and i will go and stop with evie some time in the future
i like mr wilcox
he is taking up his workrubberit is a big business
i gather he is launching out rather
charles is in it too
charles is marrieda pretty little creature but she doesn't seem wise
they took on the flat but now they have gone off to a house of their own
helen after a decent pause continued her account of stettin
how quickly a situation changes
in june she had been in a crisis even in november she could blush and be unnatural now it was january and the whole affair lay forgotten
looking back on the past six months margaret realized the chaotic nature of our daily life and its difference from the orderly sequence that has been fabricated by historians
actual life is full of false clues and signposts that lead nowhere
with infinite effort we nerve ourselves for a crisis that never comes
the most successful career must show a waste of strength that might have removed mountains and the most unsuccessful is not that of the man who is taken unprepared but of him who has prepared and is never taken
on a tragedy of that kind our national morality is duly silent
it assumes that preparation against danger is in itself a good and that men like nations are the better for staggering through life fully armed
the tragedy of preparedness has scarcely been handled save by the greeks
life is indeed dangerous but not in the way morality would have us believe
it is indeed unmanageable but the essence of it is not a battle
it is unmanageable because it is a romance and its essence is romantic beauty
margaret hoped that for the future she would be less cautious not more cautious than she had been in the past
chapter   over two years passed and the schlegel household continued to lead its life of cultured but not ignoble ease still swimming gracefully on the grey tides of london
concerts and plays swept past them money had been spent and renewed reputations won and lost and the city herself emblematic of their lives rose and fell in a continual flux while her shallows washed more widely against the hills of surrey and over the fields of hertfordshire
this famous building had arisen that was doomed
today whitehall had been transformed it would be the turn of regent street tomorrow
and month by month the roads smelt more strongly of petrol and were more difficult to cross and human beings heard each other speak with greater difficulty breathed less of the air and saw less of the sky
nature withdrew the leaves were falling by midsummer the sun shone through dirt with an admired obscurity
to speak against london is no longer fashionable
the earth as an artistic cult has had its day and the literature of the near future will probably ignore the country and seek inspiration from the town
one can understand the reaction
of pan and the elemental forces the public has heard a little too muchthey seem victorian while london is georgianand those who care for the earth with sincerity may wait long ere the pendulum swings back to her again
certainly london fascinates
one visualizes it as a tract of quivering grey intelligent without purpose and excitable without love as a spirit that has altered before it can be chronicled as a heart that certainly beats but with no pulsation of humanity
it lies beyond everything nature with all her cruelty comes nearer to us than do these crowds of men
a friend explains himself the earth is explicablefrom her we came and we must return to her
but who can explain westminster bridge road or liverpool street in the morningthe city inhalingor the same thoroughfares in the eveningthe city exhaling her exhausted air
we reach in desperation beyond the fog beyond the very stars the voids of the universe are ransacked to justify the monster and stamped with a human face
london is religion's opportunitynot the decorous religion of theologians but anthropomorphic crude
yes the continuous flow would be tolerable if a man of our own sortnot anyone pompous or tearfulwere caring for us up in the sky
the londoner seldom understands his city until it sweeps him too away from his moorings and margaret's eyes were not opened until the lease of wickham place expired
she had always known that it must expire but the knowledge only became vivid about nine months before the event
then the house was suddenly ringed with pathos
it had seen so much happiness
why had it to be swept away
in the streets of the city she noted for the first time the architecture of hurry and heard the language of hurry on the mouths of its inhabitantsclipped words formless sentences potted expressions of approval or disgust
month by month things were stepping livelier but to what goal
the population still rose but what was the quality of the men born
the particular millionaire who owned the freehold of wickham place and desired to erect babylonian flats upon itwhat right had he to stir so large a portion of the quivering jelly
he was not a foolshe had heard him expose socialismbut true insight began just where his intelligence ended and one gathered that this was the case with most millionaires
what right had such menbut margaret checked herself
that way lies madness
thank goodness she too had some money and could purchase a new home
tibby now in his second year at oxford was down for the easter vacation and margaret took the opportunity of having a serious talk with him
did he at all know where he wanted to live
tibby didn't know that he did know
did he at all know what he wanted to do
he was equally uncertain but when pressed remarked that he should prefer to be quite free of any profession
margaret was not shocked but went on sewing for a few minutes before she replied  i was thinking of mr vyse
he never strikes me as particularly happy
yees said tibby and then held his mouth open in a curious quiver as if he too had thoughts of mr vyse had seen round through over and beyond mr vyse had weighed mr vyse grouped him and finally dismissed him as having no possible bearing on the subject under discussion
that bleat of tibby's infuriated helen
but helen was now down in the diningroom preparing a speech about political economy
at times her voice could be heard declaiming through the floor
but mr vyse is rather a wretched weedy man don't you think
then there's guy
that was a pitiful business
besidesshifting to the general every one is the better for some regular work
groans
i shall stick to it she continued smiling
i am not saying it to educate you it is what i really think
i believe that in the last century men have developed the desire for work and they must not starve it
it's a new desire
it goes with a great deal that's bad but in itself it's good and i hope that for women too 'not to work' will soon become as shocking as 'not to be married' was a hundred years ago
i have no experience of this profound desire to which you allude enunciated tibby
then we'll leave the subject till you do
i'm not going to rattle you round
take your time
only do think over the lives of the men you like most and see how they've arranged them
i like guy and mr vyse most said tibby faintly and leant so far back in his chair that he extended in a horizontal line from knees to throat
and don't think i'm not serious because i don't use the traditional argumentsmaking money a sphere awaiting you and so onall of which are for various reasons cant
she sewed on
i'm only your sister
i haven't any authority over you and i don't want to have any
just to put before you what i think the truth
you seeshe shook off the pincenez to which she had recently takenin a few years we shall be the same age practically and i shall want you to help me
men are so much nicer than women
labouring under such a delusion why do you not marry
i sometimes jolly well think i would if i got the chance
has nobody arst you
only ninnies
do people ask helen
plentifully
tell me about them
no
tell me about your ninnies then
they were men who had nothing better to do said his sister feeling that she was entitled to score this point
so take warning you must work or else you must pretend to work which is what i do
work work work if you'd save your soul and your body
it is honestly a necessity dear boy
look at the wilcoxes look at mr pembroke
with all their defects of temper and understanding such men give me more pleasure than many who are better equipped and i think it is because they have worked regularly and honestly
spare me the wilcoxes he moaned
i shall not
they are the right sort
oh goodness me meg
he protested suddenly sitting up alert and angry
tibby for all his defects had a genuine personality
well they're as near the right sort as you can imagine
no nooh no
i was thinking of the younger son whom i once classed as a ninny but who came back so ill from nigeria
he's gone out there again evie wilcox tells meout to his duty
duty always elicited a groan
he doesn't want the money it is work he wants though it is beastly workdull country dishonest natives an eternal fidget over fresh water and food
a nation who can produce men of that sort may well be proud
no wonder england has become an empire
empire
i can't bother over results said margaret a little sadly
they are too difficult for me
i can only look at the men
an empire bores me so far but i can appreciate the heroism that builds it up
london bores me but what thousands of splendid people are labouring to make london  what it is he sneered
what it is worse luck
i want activity without civilization
how paradoxical
yet i expect that is what we shall find in heaven
and i said tibby want civilization without activity which i expect is what we shall find in the other place
you needn't go as far as the other place tibbikins if you want that
you can find it at oxford
stupid  if i'm stupid get me back to the househunting
i'll even live in oxford if you likenorth oxford
i'll live anywhere except bournemouth torquay and cheltenham
oh yes or ilfracombe and swanage and tunbridge wells and surbiton and bedford
there on no account
london then
i agree but helen rather wants to get away from london
however there's no reason we shouldn't have a house in the country and also a flat in town provided we all stick together and contribute
though of courseoh how one does maunder on and to think to think of the people who are really poor
how do they live
not to move about the world would kill me
as she spoke the door was flung open and helen burst in in a state of extreme excitement
oh my dears what do you think
you'll never guess
a woman's been here asking me for her husband
her what
helen was fond of supplying her own surprise
yes for her husband and it really is so
not anything to do with bracknell
cried margaret who had lately taken on an unemployed of that name to clean the knives and boots
i offered bracknell and he was rejected
so was tibby
cheer up tibby
it's no one we know
i said 'hunt my good woman have a good look round hunt under the tables poke up the chimney shake out the antimacassars
husband
husband'
oh and she so magnificently dressed and tinkling like a chandelier
now helen what did happen really
what i say
i was as it were orating my speech
annie opens the door like a fool and shows a female straight in on me with my mouth open
then we beganvery civilly
'i want my husband what i have reason to believe is here'
nohow unjust one is
she said 'whom' not 'what'
she got it perfectly
so i said 'name please'
and she said 'lan miss' and there we were
lan
lan or len
we were not nice about our vowels
lanoline
but what an extraordinary  i said 'my good mrs lanoline we have some grave misunderstanding here
beautiful as i am my modesty is even more remarkable than my beauty and never never has mr lanoline rested his eyes on mine'
i hope you were pleased said tibby
of course helen squeaked
a perfectly delightful experience
oh mrs lanoline's a dearshe asked for a husband as if he was an umbrella
she mislaid him saturday afternoonand for a long time suffered no inconvenience
but all night and all this morning her apprehensions grew
breakfast didn't seem the sameno no more did lunch and so she strolled up to  wickham place as being the most likely place for the missing article
but how on earth  don't begin how on earthing
'i know what i know' she kept repeating not uncivilly but with extreme gloom
in vain i asked her what she did know
some knew what others knew and others didn't and if they didn't then others again had better be careful
oh dear she was incompetent
she had a face like a silkworm and the diningroom reeks of orrisroot
we chatted pleasantly a little about husbands and i wondered where hers was too and advised her to go to the police
she thanked me
we agreed that mr lanoline's a notty notty man and hasn't no business to go on the lardyda
but i think she suspected me up to the last
bags i writing to aunt juley about this
now meg rememberbags i
bag it by all means murmured margaret putting down her work
i'm not sure that this is so funny helen
it means some horrible volcano smoking somewhere doesn't it
i don't think soshe doesn't really mind
the admirable creature isn't capable of tragedy
her husband may be though said margaret moving to the window
oh no not likely
no one capable of tragedy could have married mrs
lanoline
was she pretty
her figure may have been good once
the flats their only outlook hung like an ornate curtain between margaret and the welter of london
her thoughts turned sadly to househunting
wickham place had been so safe
she feared fantastically that her own little flock might be moving into turmoil and squalor into nearer contact with such episodes as these
tibby and i have again been wondering where we'll live next september she said at last
tibby had better first wonder what he'll do retorted helen and that topic was resumed but with acrimony
then tea came and after tea helen went on preparing her speech and margaret prepared one too for they were going out to a discussion society on the morrow
but her thoughts were poisoned
mrs lanoline had risen out of the abyss like a faint smell a goblin football telling of a life where love and hatred had both decayed
chapter   the mystery like so many mysteries was explained
next day just as they were dressed to go out to dinner a mr bast called
he was a clerk in the employment of the porphyrion fire insurance company
thus much from his card
he had come about the lady yesterday
thus much from annie who had shown him into the diningroom
cheers children
cried helen
it's mrs
lanoline
tibby was interested
the three hurried downstairs to find not the gay dog they expected but a young man colourless toneless who had already the mournful eyes above a drooping moustache that are so common in london and that haunt some streets of the city like accusing presences
one guessed him as the third generation grandson to the shepherd or ploughboy whom civilization had sucked into the town as one of the thousands who have lost the life of the body and failed to reach the life of the spirit
hints of robustness survived in him more than a hint of primitive good looks and margaret noting the spine that might have been straight and the chest that might have broadened wondered whether it paid to give up the glory of the animal for a tail coat and a couple of ideas
culture had worked in her own case but during the last few weeks she had doubted whether it humanized the majority so wide and so widening is the gulf that stretches between the natural and the philosophic man so many the good chaps who are wrecked in trying to cross it
she knew this type very wellthe vague aspirations the mental dishonesty the familiarity with the outsides of books
she knew the very tones in which he would address her
she was only unprepared for an example of her own visitingcard
you wouldn't remember giving me this miss schlegel
said he uneasily familiar
no i can't say i do
well that was how it happened you see
where did we meet mr bast
for the minute i don't remember
it was a concert at the queen's hall
i think you will recollect he added pretentiously when i tell you that it included a performance of the fifth symphony of beethoven
we hear the fifth practically every time it's done so i'm not suredo you remember helen
was it the time the sandy cat walked round the balustrade
he thought not
then i don't remember
that's the only beethoven i ever remember specially
and you if i may say so took away my umbrella inadvertently of course
likely enough helen laughed for i steal umbrellas even oftener than i hear beethoven
did you get it back
yes thank you miss schlegel
the mistake arose out of my card did it
interposed margaret
yes the mistake aroseit was a mistake
the lady who called here yesterday thought that you were calling too and that she could find you
she continued pushing him forward for though he had promised an explanation he seemed unable to give one
that's so calling tooa mistake
then why
began helen but margaret laid a hand on her arm
i said to my wife he continued more rapidlyi said to mrs bast 'i have to pay a call on some friends' and mrs bast said to me 'do go'
while i was gone however she wanted me on important business and thought i had come here owing to the card and so came after me and i beg to tender my apologies and hers as well for any inconvenience we may have inadvertently caused you
no inconvenience said helen but i still don't understand
an air of evasion characterized mr bast
he explained again but was obviously lying and helen didn't see why he should get off
she had the cruelty of youth
neglecting her sister's pressure she said i still don't understand
when did you say you paid this call
call
what call
said he staring as if her question had been a foolish one a favourite device of those in midstream
this afternoon call
in the afternoon of course
he replied and looked at tibby to see how the repartee went
but tibby himself a repartee was unsympathetic and said saturday afternoon or sunday afternoon
ssaturday
really
said helen and you were still calling on sunday when your wife came here
a long visit
i don't call that fair said mr bast going scarlet and handsome
there was fight in his eyes
i know what you mean and it isn't so
oh don't let us mind said margaret distressed again by odours from the abyss
it was something else he asserted his elaborate manner breaking down
i was somewhere else to what you think so there
it was good of you to come and explain she said
the rest is naturally no concern of ours
yes but i wanti wantedhave you ever read the ordeal of richard feverel
margaret nodded
it's a beautiful book
i wanted to get back to the earth don't you see like richard does in the end
or have you ever read stevenson's prince otto
helen and tibby groaned gently
that's another beautiful book
you get back to the earth in that
i wanted he mouthed affectedly
then through the mists of his culture came a hard fact hard as a pebble
i walked all the saturday night said leonard
i walked
a thrill of approval ran through the sisters
but culture closed in again
he asked whether they had ever read e v lucas's open road
said helen no doubt it's another beautiful book but i'd rather hear about your road
oh i walked
how far
i don't know nor for how long
it got too dark to see my watch
were you walking alone may i ask
yes he said straightening himself but we'd been talking it over at the office
there's been a lot of talk at the office lately about these things
the fellows there said one steers by the pole star and i looked it up in the celestial atlas but once out of doors everything gets so mixed  don't talk to me about the pole star interrupted helen who was becoming interested
i know its little ways
it goes round and round and you go round after it
well i lost it entirely
first of all the street lamps then the trees and towards morning it got cloudy
tibby who preferred his comedy undiluted slipped from the room
he knew that this fellow would never attain to poetry and did not want to hear him trying
margaret and helen remained
their brother influenced them more than they knew in his absence they were stirred to enthusiasm more easily
where did you start from
cried margaret
do tell us more
i took the underground to wimbledon
as i came out of the office i said to myself 'i must have a walk once in a way
if i don't take this walk now i shall never take it'
i had a bit of dinner at wimbledon and then  but not good country there is it
it was gaslamps for hours
still i had all the night and being out was the great thing
i did get into woods too presently
yes go on said helen
you've no idea how difficult uneven ground is when it's dark
did you actually go off the roads
oh yes
i always meant to go off the roads but the worst of it is that it's more difficult to find one's way
mr bast you're a born adventurer laughed margaret
no professional athlete would have attempted what you've done
it's a wonder your walk didn't end in a broken neck
whatever did your wife say
professional athletes never move without lanterns and compasses said helen
besides they can't walk
it tires them
go on
i felt like r l s you probably remember how in virginibus  yes but the wood
this 'ere wood
how did you get out of it
i managed one wood and found a road the other side which went a good bit uphill
i rather fancy it was those north downs for the road went off into grass and i got into another wood
that was awful with gorse bushes
i did wish i'd never come but suddenly it got lightjust while i seemed going under one tree
then i found a road down to a station and took the first train i could back to london
but was the dawn wonderful
asked helen
with unforgettable sincerity he replied no
the word flew again like a pebble from the sling
down toppled all that had seemed ignoble or literary in his talk down toppled tiresome r l s and the love of the earth and his silk tophat
in the presence of these women leonard had arrived and he spoke with a flow an exultation that he had seldom known
the dawn was only grey it was nothing to mention  just a grey evening turned upside down
i know
and i was too tired to lift up my head to look at it and so cold too
i'm glad i did it and yet at the time it bored me more than i can say
and besidesyou can believe me or not as you choosei was very hungry
that dinner at wimbledoni meant it to last me all night like other dinners
i never thought that walking would make such a difference
why when you're walking you want as it were a breakfast and luncheon and tea during the night as well and i'd nothing but a packet of woodbines
lord i did feel bad
looking back it wasn't what you may call enjoyment
it was more a case of sticking to it
i did stick
ii was determined
oh hang it all
what's the goodi mean the good of living in a room for ever
there one goes on day after day same old game same up and down to town until you forget there is any other game
you ought to see once in a way what's going on outside if it's only nothing particular after all
i should just think you ought said helen sitting on the edge of the table
the sound of a lady's voice recalled him from sincerity and he said curious it should all come about from reading something of richard jefferies
excuse me mr bast but you're wrong there
it didn't
it came from something far greater
but she could not stop him
borrow was imminent after jefferiesborrow thoreau and sorrow
r l s brought up the rear and the outburst ended in a swamp of books
no disrespect to these great names
the fault is ours not theirs
they mean us to use them for signposts and are not to blame if in our weakness we mistake the signpost for the destination
and leonard had reached the destination
he had visited the county of surrey when darkness covered its amenities and its cosy villas had reentered ancient night
every twelve hours this miracle happens but he had troubled to go and see for himself
within his cramped little mind dwelt something that was greater than jefferies' booksthe spirit that led jefferies to write them and his dawn though revealing nothing but monotones was part of the eternal sunrise that shows george borrow stonehenge
then you don't think i was foolish
he asked becoming again the naive and sweettempered boy for whom nature had intended him
heavens no
replied margaret
heaven help us if we do
replied helen
i'm very glad you say that
now my wife would never understandnot if i explained for days
no it wasn't foolish
cried helen her eyes aflame
you've pushed back the boundaries i think it splendid of you
you've not been content to dream as we have  though we have walked too  i must show you a picture upstairs  here the doorbell rang
the hansom had come to take them to their evening party
oh bother not to say dashi had forgotten we were dining out but do do come round again and have a talk
yes you mustdo echoed margaret
leonard with extreme sentiment replied no i shall not
it's better like this
why better
asked margaret
no it is better not to risk a second interview
i shall always look back on this talk with you as one of the finest things in my life
really
i mean this
we can never repeat
it has done me real good and there we had better leave it
that's rather a sad view of life surely
things so often get spoiled
i know flashed helen but people don't
he could not understand this
he continued in a vein which mingled true imagination and false
what he said wasn't wrong but it wasn't right and a false note jarred
one little twist they felt and the instrument might be in tune
one little strain and it might be silent for ever
he thanked the ladies very much but he would not call again
there was a moment's awkwardness and then helen said go then perhaps you know best but never forget you're better than jefferies
and he went
their hansom caught him up at the corner passed with a waving of hands and vanished with its accomplished load into the evening
london was beginning to illuminate herself against the night
electric lights sizzled and jagged in the main thoroughfares gaslamps in the side streets glimmered a canary gold or green
the sky was a crimson battlefield of spring but london was not afraid
her smoke mitigated the splendour and the clouds down oxford street were a delicately painted ceiling which adorned while it did not distract
she has never known the clearcut armies of the purer air
leonard hurried through her tinted wonders very much part of the picture
his was a grey life and to brighten it he had ruled off a few corners for romance
the miss schlegelsor to speak more accurately his interview with themwere to fill such a corner nor was it by any means the first time that he had talked intimately to strangers
the habit was analogous to a debauch an outlet though the worst of outlets for instincts that would not be denied
terrifying him it would beat down his suspicions and prudence until he was confiding secrets to people whom he had scarcely seen
it brought him many fears and some pleasant memories
perhaps the keenest happiness he had ever known was during a railway journey to cambridge where a decentmannered undergraduate had spoken to him
they had got into conversation and gradually leonard flung reticence aside told some of his domestic troubles and hinted at the rest
the undergraduate supposing they could start a friendship asked him to coffee after hall which he accepted but afterwards grew shy and took care not to stir from the commercial hotel where he lodged
he did not want romance to collide with the porphyrion still less with jacky and people with fuller happier lives are slow to understand this
to the schlegels as to the undergraduate he was an interesting creature of whom they wanted to see more
but they to him were denizens of romance who must keep to the corner he had assigned them pictures that must not walk out of their frames
his behaviour over margaret's visitingcard had been typical
his had scarcely been a tragic marriage
where there is no money and no inclination to violence tragedy cannot be generated
he could not leave his wife and he did not want to hit her
petulance and squalor were enough
here that card had come in
leonard though furtive was untidy and left it lying about
jacky found it and then began what's that card eh
yes don't you wish you knew what that card was
len who's miss schlegel
etc
months passed and the card now as a joke now as a grievance was handed about getting dirtier and dirtier
it followed them when they moved from cornelia road to tulse hill
it was submitted to third parties
a few inches of pasteboard it became the battlefield on which the souls of leonard and his wife contended
why did he not say a lady took my umbrella another gave me this that i might call for my umbrella
because jacky would have disbelieved him
partly but chiefly because he was sentimental
no affection gathered round the card but it symbolized the life of culture that jacky should never spoil
at night he would say to himself well at all events she doesn't know about that card
yah
done her there
poor jacky
she was not a bad sort and had a great deal to bear
she drew her own conclusionshe was only capable of drawing one conclusionand in the fulness of time she acted upon it
all the friday leonard had refused to speak to her and had spent the evening observing the stars
on the saturday he went up as usual to town but he came not back saturday night nor sunday morning nor sunday afternoon
the inconvenience grew intolerable and though she was now of a retiring habit and shy of women she went up to wickham place
leonard returned in her absence
the card the fatal card was gone from the pages of ruskin and he guessed what had happened
well
he had exclaimed greeting her with peals of laughter
i know where you've been but you don't know where i've been 
jacky sighed said len i do think you might explain and resumed domesticity
explanations were difficult at this stage and leonard was too sillyor it is tempting to write too sound a chap to attempt them
his reticence was not entirely the shoddy article that a business life promotes the reticence that pretends that nothing is something and hides behind the daily telegraph
the adventurer also is reticent and it is an adventure for a clerk to walk for a few hours in darkness
you may laugh at him you who have slept nights on the veldt with your rifle beside you and all the atmosphere of adventure past
and you also may laugh who think adventures silly
but do not be surprised if leonard is shy whenever he meets you and if the schlegels rather than jacky hear about the dawn
that the schlegels had not thought him foolish became a permanent joy
he was at his best when he thought of them
it buoyed him as he journeyed home beneath fading heavens
somehow the barriers of wealth had fallen and there had beenhe could not phrase ita general assertion of the wonder of the world
my conviction says the mystic gains infinitely the moment another soul will believe in it and they had agreed that there was something beyond life's daily grey
he took off his tophat and smoothed it thoughtfully
he had hitherto supposed the unknown to be books literature clever conversation culture
one raised oneself by study and got upsides with the world
but in that quick interchange a new light dawned
was that something walking in the dark among the surburban hills
he discovered that he was going bareheaded down regent street
london came back with a rush
few were about at this hour but all whom he passed looked at him with a hostility that was the more impressive because it was unconscious
he put his hat on
it was too big his head disappeared like a pudding into a basin the ears bending outwards at the touch of the curly brim
he wore it a little backwards and its effect was greatly to elongate the face and to bring out the distance between the eyes and the moustache
thus equipped he escaped criticism
no one felt uneasy as he titupped along the pavements the heart of a man ticking fast in his chest
chapter   the sisters went out to dinner full of their adventure and when they were both full of the same subject there were few dinnerparties that could stand up against them
this particular one which was all ladies had more kick in it than most but succumbed after a struggle
helen at one part of the table margaret at the other would talk of mr bast and of no one else and somewhere about the entree their monologues collided fell ruining and became common property
nor was this all
the dinnerparty was really an informal discussion club there was a paper after it read amid coffeecups and laughter in the drawingroom but dealing more or less thoughtfully with some topic of general interest
after the paper came a debate and in this debate mr bast also figured appearing now as a bright spot in civilization now as a dark spot according to the temperament of the speaker
the subject of the paper had been how ought i to dispose of my money
the reader professing to be a millionaire on the point of death inclined to bequeath her fortune for the foundation of local art galleries but open to conviction from other sources
the various parts had been assigned beforehand and some of the speeches were amusing
the hostess assumed the ungrateful role of the millionaire's eldest son and implored her expiring parent not to dislocate society by allowing such vast sums to pass out of the family
money was the fruit of selfdenial and the second generation had a right to profit by the selfdenial of the first
what right had mr bast to profit
the national gallery was good enough for the likes of him
after property had had its saya saying that is necessarily ungraciousthe various philanthropists stepped forward
something must be done for mr bast his conditions must be improved without impairing his independence he must have a free library or free tenniscourts his rent must be paid in such a way that he did not know it was being paid it must be made worth his while to join the territorials he must be forcibly parted from his uninspiring wife the money going to her as compensation he must be assigned a twin star some member of the leisured classes who would watch over him ceaselessly groans from helen he must be given food but no clothes clothes but no food a thirdreturn ticket to venice without either food or clothes when he arrived there
in short he might be given anything and everything so long as it was not the money itself
and here margaret interrupted
order order miss schlegel
said the reader of the paper
you are here i understand to advise me in the interests of the society for the preservation of places of historic interest or natural beauty
i cannot have you speaking out of your role
it makes my poor head go round and i think you forget that i am very ill  your head won't go round if only you'll listen to my argument said margaret
why not give him the money itself
you're supposed to have about thirty thousand a year
have i
i thought i had a million
wasn't a million your capital
dear me
we ought to have settled that
still it doesn't matter
whatever you've got i order you to give as many poor men as you can three hundred a year each 
but that would be pauperizing them said an earnest girl who liked the schlegels but thought them a little unspiritual at times
not if you gave them so much
a big windfall would not pauperize a man
it is these little driblets distributed among too many that do the harm
money's educational
it's far more educational than the things it buys
there was a protest
in a sense added margaret but the protest continued
well isn't the most civilized thing going the man who has learnt to wear his income properly
exactly what your mr basts won't do
give them a chance
give them money
don't dole them out poetrybooks and railwaytickets like babies
give them the wherewithal to buy these things
when your socialism comes it may be different and we may think in terms of commodities instead of cash
till it comes give people cash for it is the warp of civilization whatever the woof may be
the imagination ought to play upon money and realize it vividly for it's thethe second most important thing in the world
it is so sluffed over and hushed up there is so little clear thinkingoh political economy of course but so few of us think clearly about our own private incomes and admit that independent thoughts are in nine cases out of ten the result of independent means
money give mr bast money and don't bother about his ideals
he'll pick up those for himself
she leant back while the more earnest members of the club began to misconstrue her
the female mind though cruelly practical in daily life cannot bear to hear ideals belittled in conversation and miss schlegel was asked however she could say such dreadful things and what it would profit mr bast if he gained the whole world and lost his own soul
she answered nothing but he would not gain his soul until he had gained a little of the world
then they said no they did not believe it and she admitted that an overworked clerk may save his soul in the superterrestrial sense where the effort will be taken for the deed but she denied that he will ever explore the spiritual resources of this world will ever know the rarer joys of the body or attain to clear and passionate intercourse with his fellows
others had attacked the fabric of societyproperty interest etc
 she only fixed her eyes on a few human beings to see how under present conditions they could be made happier
doing good to humanity was useless the manycoloured efforts thereto spreading over the vast area like films and resulting in an universal grey
to do good to one or as in this case to a few was the utmost she dare hope for
between the idealists and the political economists margaret had a bad time
disagreeing elsewhere they agreed in disowning her and in keeping the administration of the millionaire's money in their own hands
the earnest girl brought forward a scheme of personal supervision and mutual help the effect of which was to alter poor people until they became exactly like people who were not so poor
the hostess pertinently remarked that she as eldest son might surely rank among the millionaire's legatees
margaret weakly admitted the claim and another claim was at once set up by helen who declared that she had been the millionaire's housemaid for over forty years overfed and underpaid was nothing to be done for her so corpulent and poor
the millionaire then read out her last will and testament in which she left the whole of her fortune to the chancellor of the exchequer
then she died
the serious parts of the discussion had been of higher merit than the playfulin a men's debate is the reverse more general
but the meeting broke up hilariously enough and a dozen happy ladies dispersed to their homes
helen and margaret walked the earnest girl as far as battersea bridge station arguing copiously all the way
when she had gone they were conscious of an alleviation and of the great beauty of the evening
they turned back towards oakley street
the lamps and the planetrees following the line of the embankment struck a note of dignity that is rare in english cities
the seats almost deserted were here and there occupied by gentlefolk in evening dress who had strolled out from the houses behind to enjoy fresh air and the whisper of the rising tide
there is something continental about chelsea embankment
it is an open space used rightly a blessing more frequent in germany than here
as margaret and helen sat down the city behind them seemed to be a vast theatre an operahouse in which some endless trilogy was performing and they themselves a pair of satisfied subscribers who did not mind losing a little of the second act
cold
no
tired
doesn't matter
the earnest girl's train rumbled away over the bridge
i say helen  well
are we really going to follow up mr
bast
i don't know
i think we won't
as you like
it's no good i think unless you really mean to know people
the discussion brought that home to me
we got on well enough with him in a spirit of excitement but think of rational intercourse
we mustn't play at friendship
no it's no good
there's mrs lanoline too helen yawned
so dull
just so and possibly worse than dull
i should like to know how he got hold of your card
but he saidsomething about a concert and an umbrella  then did the card see the wife  helen come to bed
no just a little longer it is so beautiful
tell me oh yes did you say money is the warp of the world
yes
then what's the woof
very much what one chooses said margaret
it's something that isn't moneyone can't say more
walking at night
probably
for tibby oxford
it seems so
for you
now that we have to leave wickham place i begin to think it's that
for mrs wilcox it was certainly howards end
one's own name will carry immense distances
mr wilcox who was sitting with friends many seats away heard his rose to his feet and strolled along towards the speakers
it is sad to suppose that places may ever be more important than people continued margaret
why meg
they're so much nicer generally
i'd rather think of that forester's house in pomerania than of the fat herr forstmeister who lived in it
i believe we shall come to care about people less and less helen
the more people one knows the easier it becomes to replace them
it's one of the curses of london
i quite expect to end my life caring most for a place
here mr wilcox reached them
it was several weeks since they had met
how do you do
he cried
i thought i recognized your voices
whatever are you both doing down here
his tones were protective
he implied that one ought not to sit out on chelsea embankment without a male escort
helen resented this but margaret accepted it as part of the good man's equipment
what an age it is since i've seen you mr wilcox
i met evie in the tube though lately
i hope you have good news of your son
paul
said mr wilcox extinguishing his cigarette and sitting down between them
oh paul's all right
we had a line from madeira
he'll be at work again by now
ugh said helen shuddering from complex causes
i beg your pardon
isn't the climate of nigeria too horrible
someone's got to go he said simply
england will never keep her trade overseas unless she is prepared to make sacrifices
unless we get firm in west africa geruntold complications may follow
now tell me all your news
oh we've had a splendid evening cried helen who always woke up at the advent of a visitor
we belong to a kind of club that reads papers margaret and iall women but there is a discussion after
this evening it was on how one ought to leave one's moneywhether to one's family or to the poor and if so howoh most interesting
the man of business smiled
since his wife's death he had almost doubled his income
he was an important figure at last a reassuring name on company prospectuses and life had treated him very well
the world seemed in his grasp as he listened to the river thames which still flowed inland from the sea
so wonderful to the girls it held no mysteries for him
he had helped to shorten its long tidal trough by taking shares in the lock at teddington and if he and other capitalists thought good some day it could be shortened again
with a good dinner inside him and an amiable but academic woman on either flank he felt that his hands were on all the ropes of life and that what he did not know could not be worth knowing
sounds a most original entertainment
he exclaimed and laughed in his pleasant way
i wish evie would go to that sort of thing
but she hasn't the time
she's taken to breed aberdeen terriersjolly little dogs
i expect we'd better be doing the same really
we pretend we're improving ourselves you see said helen a little sharply for the wilcox glamour is not of the kind that returns and she had bitter memories of the days when a speech such as he had just made would have impressed her favourably
we suppose it is a good thing to waste an evening once a fortnight over a debate but as my sister says it may be better to breed dogs
not at all
i don't agree with your sister
there's nothing like a debate to teach one quickness
i often wish i had gone in for them when i was a youngster
it would have helped me no end
quickness
yes
quickness in argument
time after time i've missed scoring a point because the other man has had the gift of the gab and i haven't
oh i believe in these discussions
the patronizing tone thought margaret came well enough from a man who was old enough to be their father
she had always maintained that mr wilcox had a charm
in times of sorrow or emotion his inadequacy had pained her but it was pleasant to listen to him now and to watch his thick brown moustache and high forehead confronting the stars
but helen was nettled
the aim of their debates she implied was truth
oh yes it doesn't much matter what subject you take said he
margaret laughed and said but this is going to be far better than the debate itself
helen recovered herself and laughed too
no i won't go on she declared
i'll just put our special case to mr
wilcox
about mr bast
yes do
he'll be more lenient to a special case
but mr wilcox do first light another cigarette
it's this
we've just come across a young fellow who's evidently very poor and who seems interest  what's his profession
clerk
what in
do you remember margaret
porphyrion fire insurance company
oh yes the nice people who gave aunt juley a new hearthrug
he seems interesting in some ways very and one wishes one could help him
he is married to a wife whom he doesn't seem to care for much
he likes books and what one may roughly call adventure and if he had a chancebut he is so poor
he lives a life where all the money is apt to go on nonsense and clothes
one is so afraid that circumstances will be too strong for him and that he will sink
well he got mixed up in our debate
he wasn't the subject of it but it seemed to bear on his point
suppose a millionaire died and desired to leave money to help such a man
how should he be helped
should he be given three hundred pounds a year direct which was margaret's plan
most of them thought this would pauperize him
should he and those like him be given free libraries
i said 'no'
he doesn't want more books to read but to read books rightly
my suggestion was he should be given something every year towards a summer holiday but then there is his wife and they said she would have to go too
nothing seemed quite right
now what do you think
imagine that you were a millionaire and wanted to help the poor
what would you do
mr wilcox whose fortune was not so very far below the standard indicated laughed exuberantly
my dear miss schlegel i will not rush in where your sex has been unable to tread
i will not add another plan to the numerous excellent ones that have been already suggested
my only contribution is this let your young friend clear out of the porphyrion fire insurance company with all possible speed
why
said margaret
he lowered his voice
this is between friends
it'll be in the receiver's hands before christmas
it'll smash he added thinking that she had not understood
dear me helen listen to that
and he'll have to get another place
will have
let him leave the ship before it sinks
let him get one now
rather than wait to make sure
decidedly
why's that
again the olympian laugh and the lowered voice
naturally the man who's in a situation when he applies stands a better chance is in a stronger position than the man who isn't
it looks as if he's worth something
i know by myselfthis is letting you into the state secretsit affects an employer greatly
human nature i'm afraid
i hadn't thought of that murmured margaret while helen said our human nature appears to be the other way round
we employ people because they're unemployed
the boot man for instance
and how does he clean the boots
not well confessed margaret
there you are
then do you really advise us to tell this youth  i advise nothing he interrupted glancing up and down the embankment in case his indiscretion had been overheard
i oughtn't to have spokenbut i happen to know being more or less behind the scenes
the porphyrion's a bad bad concernnow don't say i said so
it's outside the tariff ring
certainly i won't say
in fact i don't know what that means
i thought an insurance company never smashed was helen's contribution
don't the others always run in and save them
you're thinking of reinsurance said mr wilcox mildly
it is exactly there that the porphyrion is weak
it has tried to undercut has been badly hit by a long series of small fires and it hasn't been able to reinsure
i'm afraid that public companies don't save one another for love
'human nature' i suppose quoted helen and he laughed and agreed that it was
when margaret said that she supposed that clerks like every one else found it extremely difficult to get situations in these days he replied yes extremely and rose to rejoin his friends
he knew by his own officeseldom a vacant post and hundreds of applicants for it at present no vacant post
and how's howards end looking
said margaret wishing to change the subject before they parted
mr wilcox was a little apt to think one wanted to get something out of him
it's let
really
and you wandering homeless in longhaired chelsea
how strange are the ways of fate
no it's let unfurnished
we've moved
why i thought of you both as anchored there for ever
evie never told me
i dare say when you met evie the thing wasn't settled
we only moved a week ago
paul has rather a feeling for the old place and we held on for him to have his holiday there but really it is impossibly small
endless drawbacks
i forget whether you've been up to it
as far as the house never
well howards end is one of those converted farms
they don't really do spend what you will on them
we messed away with a garage all among the wychelm roots and last year we enclosed a bit of the meadow and attempted a mockery
evie got rather keen on alpine plants
but it didn't dono it didn't do
you remember or your sister will remember the farm with those abominable guineafowls and the hedge that the old woman never would cut properly so that it all went thin at the bottom
and inside the house the beamsand the staircase through a doorpicturesque enough but not a place to live in
he glanced over the parapet cheerfully
full tide
and the position wasn't right either
the neighbourhood's getting suburban
either be in london or out of it i say so we've taken a house in ducie street close to sloane street and a place right down in shropshireoniton grange
ever heard of oniton
do come and see usright away from everywhere up towards wales 
what a change
said margaret
but the change was in her own voice which had become most sad
i can't imagine howards end or hilton without you
hilton isn't without us he replied
charles is there still
still
said margaret who had not kept up with the charles'
but i thought he was still at epsom
they were furnishing that christmasone christmas
how everything alters
i used to admire mrs charles from our windows very often
wasn't it epsom
yes but they moved eighteen months ago
charles the good chaphis voice droppedthought i should be lonely
i didn't want him to move but he would and took a house at the other end of hilton down by the six hills
he had a motor too
there they all are a very jolly partyhe and she and the two grandchildren
i manage other people's affairs so much better than they manage them themselves said margaret as they shook hands
when you moved out of howards end i should have moved mr charles wilcox into it
i should have kept so remarkable a place in the family
so it is he replied
i haven't sold it and don't mean to
no but none of you are there
oh we've got a splendid tenanthamar bryce an invalid
if charles ever wanted itbut he won't
dolly is so dependent on modern conveniences
no we have all decided against howards end
we like it in a way but now we feel that it is neither one thing nor the other
one must have one thing or the other
and some people are lucky enough to have both
you're doing yourself proud mr wilcox
my congratulations
and mine said helen
do remind evie to come and see ustwo wickham place
we shan't be there very long either
you too on the move
next september margaret sighed
every one moving
goodbye
the tide had begun to ebb
margaret leant over the parapet and watched it sadly
mr wilcox had forgotten his wife helen her lover she herself was probably forgetting
every one moving
is it worth while attempting the past when there is this continual flux even in the hearts of men
helen roused her by saying what a prosperous vulgarian mr wilcox has grown
i have very little use for him in these days
however he did tell us about the porphyrion
let us write to mr bast as soon as ever we get home and tell him to clear out of it at once
do yes that's worth doing
let us
let's ask him to tea
chapter   leonard accepted the invitation to tea next saturday
but he was right the visit proved a conspicuous failure
sugar
said margaret
cake
said helen
the big cake or the little deadlies
i'm afraid you thought my letter rather odd but we'll explainwe aren't odd reallynot affected really
we're overexpressive that's all 
as a lady's lapdog leonard did not excel
he was not an italian still less a frenchman in whose blood there runs the very spirit of persiflage and of gracious repartee
his wit was the cockney's it opened no doors into imagination and helen was drawn up short by the more a lady has to say the better administered waggishly
oh yes she said
ladies brighten  yes i know
the darlings are regular sunbeams
let me give you a plate
how do you like your work
interposed margaret
he too was drawn up short
he would not have these women prying into his work
they were romance and so was the room to which he had at last penetrated with the queer sketches of people bathing upon its walls and so were the very teacups with their delicate borders of wild strawberries
but he would not let romance interfere with his life
there is the devil to pay then
oh well enough he answered
your company is the porphyrion isn't it
yes that's sobecoming rather offended
it's funny how things get round
why funny
asked helen who did not follow the workings of his mind
it was written as large as life on your card and considering we wrote to you there and that you replied on the stamped paper  would you call the porphyrion one of the big insurance companies
pursued margaret
it depends what you call big
i mean by big a solid wellestablished concern that offers a reasonably good career to its employes
i couldn't saysome would tell you one thing and others another said the employe uneasily
for my own parthe shook his headi only believe half i hear
not that even it's safer
those clever ones come to the worse grief i've often noticed
ah you can't be too careful
he drank and wiped his moustache which was going to be one of those moustaches that always droop into teacupsmore bother than they're worth surely and not fashionable either
i quite agree and that's why i was curious to know is it a solid wellestablished concern
leonard had no idea
he understood his own corner of the machine but nothing beyond it
he desired to confess neither knowledge nor ignorance and under these circumstances another motion of the head seemed safest
to him as to the british public the porphyrion was the porphyrion of the advertisementa giant in the classical style but draped sufficiently who held in one hand a burning torch and pointed with the other to st paul's and windsor castle
a large sum of money was inscribed below and you drew your own conclusions
this giant caused leonard to do arithmetic and write letters to explain the regulations to new clients and reexplain them to old ones
a giant was of an impulsive moralityone knew that much
he would pay for mrs munt's hearthrug with ostentatious haste a large claim he would repudiate quietly and fight court by court
but his true fighting weight his antecedents his amours with other members of the commercial pantheonall these were as uncertain to ordinary mortals as were the escapades of zeus
while the gods are powerful we learn little about them
it is only in the days of their decadence that a strong light beats into heaven
we were told the porphyrion's no go blurted helen
we wanted to tell you that's why we wrote
a friend of ours did think that it is unsufficiently reinsured said margaret
now leonard had his clue
he must praise the porphyrion
you can tell your friend he said that he's quite wrong
oh good
the young man coloured a little
in his circle to be wrong was fatal
the miss schlegels did not mind being wrong
they were genuinely glad that they had been misinformed
to them nothing was fatal but evil
wrong so to speak he added
how 'so to speak'
i mean i wouldn't say he's right altogether
but this was a blunder
then he is right partly said the elder woman quick as lightning
leonard replied that every one was right partly if it came to that
mr bast i don't understand business and i dare say my questions are stupid but can you tell me what makes a concern 'right' or 'wrong'
leonard sat back with a sigh
our friend who is also a business man was so positive
he said before christmas  and advised you to clear out of it concluded helen
but i don't see why he should know better than you do
leonard rubbed his hands
he was tempted to say that he knew nothing about the thing at all
but a commercial training was too strong for him
nor could he say it was a bad thing for this would be giving it away nor yet that it was good for this would be giving it away equally
he attempted to suggest that it was something between the two with vast possibilities in either direction but broke down under the gaze of four sincere eyes
as yet he scarcely distinguished between the two sisters
one was more beautiful and more lively but the miss schlegels still remained a composite indian god whose waving arms and contradictory speeches were the product of a single mind
one can but see he remarked adding as ibsen says 'things happen'
he was itching to talk about books and make the most of his romantic hour
minute after minute slipped away while the ladies with imperfect skill discussed the subject of reinsurance or praised their anonymous friend
leonard grew annoyedperhaps rightly
he made vague remarks about not being one of those who minded their affairs being talked over by others but they did not take the hint
men might have shown more tact
women however tactful elsewhere are heavyhanded here
they cannot see why we should shroud our incomes and our prospects in a veil
how much exactly have you and how much do you expect to have next june
and these were women with a theory who held that reticence about money matters is absurd and that life would be truer if each would state the exact size of the golden island upon which he stands the exact stretch of warp over which he throws the woof that is not money
how can we do justice to the pattern otherwise
and the precious minutes slipped away and jacky and squalor came nearer
at last he could bear it no longer and broke in reciting the names of books feverishly
there was a moment of piercing joy when margaret said so you like carlyle and then the door opened and mr wilcox miss wilcox entered preceded by two prancing puppies
oh the dears
oh evie how too impossibly sweet
screamed helen falling on her hands and knees
we brought the little fellows round said mr wilcox
i bred 'em myself
oh really
mr bast come and play with puppies
i've got to be going now said leonard sourly
but play with puppies a little first
this is ahab that's jezebel said evie who was one of those who name animals after the less successful characters of old testament history
i've got to be going
helen was too much occupied with puppies to notice him
mr wilcox mr bamust you be really
goodbye
come again said helen from the floor
then leonard's gorge arose
why should he come again
what was the good of it
he said roundly no i shan't i knew it would be a failure
most people would have let him go
a little mistake
we tried knowing another classimpossible
but the schlegels had never played with life
they had attempted friendship and they would take the consequences
helen retorted i call that a very rude remark
what do you want to turn on me like that for
and suddenly the drawingroom reechoed to a vulgar row
you ask me why i turn on you
yes
what do you want to have me here for
to help you you silly boy
cried helen
and don't shout
i don't want your patronage
i don't want your tea
i was quite happy
what do you want to unsettle me for
he turned to mr wilcox
i put it to this gentleman
i ask you sir am to have my brain picked
mr wilcox turned to margaret with the air of humorous strength that he could so well command
are we intruding miss schlegel
can we be of any use or shall we go
but margaret ignored him
i'm connected with a leading insurance company sir
i receive what i take to be an invitation from theseladies he drawled the word
i come and it's to have my brain picked
i ask you is it fair
highly unfair said mr wilcox drawing a gasp from evie who knew that her father was becoming dangerous
there you hear that
most unfair the gentleman says
there
not content withpointing at margaretyou can't deny it
his voice rose he was falling into the rhythm of a scene with jacky
but as soon as i'm useful it's a very different thing
'oh yes send for him
crossquestion him
pick his brains'
oh yes
now take me on the whole i'm a quiet fellow i'm lawabiding i don't wish any unpleasantness but ii  you said margaretyouyou  laughter from evie as at a repartee
you are the man who tried to walk by the pole star
more laughter
you saw the sunrise
laughter
you tried to get away from the fogs that are stifling us allaway past books and houses to the truth
you were looking for a real home 
i fail to see the connection said leonard hot with stupid anger
so do i
there was a pause
you were that last sundayyou are this today
mr bast
i and my sister have talked you over
we wanted to help you we also supposed you might help us
we did not have you here out of charitywhich bores usbut because we hoped there would be a connection between last sunday and other days
what is the good of your stars and trees your sunrise and the wind if they do not enter into our daily lives
they have never entered into mine but into yours we thoughthaven't we all to struggle against life's daily greyness against pettiness against mechanical cheerfulness against suspicion
i struggle by remembering my friends others i have known by remembering some placesome beloved place or treewe thought you one of these
of course if there's been any misunderstanding mumbled leonard all i can do is to go
but i beg to state he paused
ahab and jezebel danced at his boots and made him look ridiculous
you were picking my brain for official informationi can prove itihe blew his nose and left them
can i help you now
said mr wilcox turning to margaret
may i have one quiet word with him in the hall
helen go after himdo anythinganythingto make the noodle understand
helen hesitated
but really said their visitor
ought she to
at once she went
he resumed
i would have chimed in but i felt that you could polish him off for yourselvesi didn't interfere
you were splendid miss schlegelabsolutely splendid
you can take my word for it but there are very few women who could have managed him
oh yes said margaret distractedly
bowling him over with those long sentences was what fetched me cried evie
yes indeed chuckled her father all that part about 'mechanical cheerfulness'oh fine
i'm very sorry said margaret collecting herself
he's a nice creature really
i cannot think what set him off
it has been most unpleasant for you
oh i didn't mind
then he changed his mood
he asked if he might speak as an old friend and permission given said oughtn't you really to be more careful
margaret laughed though her thoughts still strayed after helen
do you realize that it's all your fault
she said
you're responsible
i
this is the young man whom we were to warn against the porphyrion
we warn him andlook
mr wilcox was annoyed
i hardly consider that a fair deduction he said
obviously unfair said margaret
i was only thinking how tangled things are
it's our fault mostlyneither yours nor his
not his
no
miss schlegel you are too kind
yes indeed nodded evie a little contemptuously
you behave much too well to people and then they impose on you
i know the world and that type of man and as soon as i entered the room i saw you had not been treating him properly
you must keep that type at a distance
otherwise they forget themselves
sad but true
they aren't our sort and one must face the fact
yees
do admit that we should never have had the outburst if he was a gentleman
i admit it willingly said margaret who was pacing up and down the room
a gentleman would have kept his suspicions to himself
mr wilcox watched her with a vague uneasiness
what did he suspect you of
of wanting to make money out of him
intolerable brute
but how were you to benefit
exactly
how indeed
just horrible corroding suspicion
one touch of thought or of goodwill would have brushed it away
just the senseless fear that does make men intolerable brutes
i come back to my original point
you ought to be more careful miss schlegel
your servants ought to have orders not to let such people in
she turned to him frankly
let me explain exactly why we like this man and want to see him again
that's your clever way of thinking
i shall never believe you like him
i do
firstly because he cares for physical adventure just as you do
yes you go motoring and shooting he would like to go camping out
secondly he cares for something special in adventure
it is quickest to call that special something poetry  oh he's one of that writer sort
nooh no
i mean he may be but it would be loathsome stiff
his brain is filled with the husks of books culturehorrible we want him to wash out his brain and go to the real thing
we want to show him how he may get upsides with life
as i said either friends or the country someshe hesitatedeither some very dear person or some very dear place seems necessary to relieve life's daily grey and to show that it is grey
if possible one should have both
some of her words ran past mr wilcox
he let them run past
others he caught and criticized with admirable lucidity
your mistake is this and it is a very common mistake
this young bounder has a life of his own
what right have you to conclude it is an unsuccessful life or as you call it 'grey'
because  one minute
you know nothing about him
he probably has his own joys and interestswife children snug little home
that's where we practical fellowshe smiledare more tolerant than you intellectuals
we live and let live and assume that things are jogging on fairly well elsewhere and that the ordinary plain man may be trusted to look after his own affairs
i quite granti look at the faces of the clerks in my own office and observe them to be dull but i don't know what's going on beneath
so by the way with london
i have heard you rail against london miss schlegel and it seems a funny thing to say but i was very angry with you
what do you know about london
you only see civilization from the outside
i don't say in your case but in too many cases that attitude leads to morbidity discontent and socialism
she admitted the strength of his position though it undermined imagination
as he spoke some outposts of poetry and perhaps of sympathy fell ruining and she retreated to what she called her second lineto the special facts of the case
his wife is an old bore she said simply
he never came home last saturday night because he wanted to be alone and she thought he was with us
with you
yes
evie tittered
he hasn't got the cosy home that you assumed
he needs outside interests
naughty young man
cried the girl
naughty
said margaret who hated naughtiness more than sin
when you're married miss wilcox won't you want outside interests
he has apparently got them put in mr wilcox slyly
yes indeed father
he was tramping in surrey if you mean that said margaret pacing away rather crossly
oh i dare say
miss wilcox he was
mmmm
from mr wilcox who thought the episode amusing if risque
with most ladies he would not have discussed it but he was trading on margaret's reputation as an emanicipated woman
he said so and about such a thing he wouldn't lie
they both began to laugh
that's where i differ from you
men lie about their positions and prospects but not about a thing of that sort
he shook his head
miss schlegel excuse me but i know the type
i said beforehe isn't a type
he cares about adventures rightly
he's certain that our smug existence isn't all
he's vulgar and hysterical and bookish but i don't think that sums him up
there's manhood in him as well
yes that's what i'm trying to say
he's a real man
as she spoke their eyes met and it was as if mr wilcox's defences fell
she saw back to the real man in him
unwittingly she had touched his emotions
a woman and two menthey had formed the magic triangle of sex and the male was thrilled to jealousy in case the female was attracted by another male
love say the ascetics reveals our shameful kinship with the beasts
be it so one can bear that jealousy is the real shame
it is jealousy not love that connects us with the farmyard intolerably and calls up visions of two angry cocks and a complacent hen
margaret crushed complacency down because she was civilized
mr wilcox uncivilized continued to feel anger long after he had rebuilt his defences and was again presenting a bastion to the world
miss schlegel you're a pair of dear creatures but you really must be careful in this uncharitable world
what does your brother say
i forget
surely he has some opinion
he laughs if i remember correctly
he's very clever isn't he
said evie who had met and detested tibby at oxford
yes pretty wellbut i wonder what helen's doing
she is very young to undertake this sort of thing said mr wilcox
margaret went out into the landing
she heard no sound and mr bast's topper was missing from the hall
helen
she called
yes
replied a voice from the library
you in there
yeshe's gone some time
margaret went to her
why you're all alone she said
yesit's all right megpoor poor creature  come back to the wilcoxes and tell me latermr w much concerned and slightly titillated
oh i've no patience with him
i hate him
poor dear mr bast
he wanted to talk literature and we would talk business
such a muddle of a man and yet so worth pulling through
i like him extraordinarily 
well done said margaret kissing her but come into the drawingroom now and don't talk about him to the wilcoxes
make light of the whole thing
helen came and behaved with a cheerfulness that reassured their visitorthis hen at all events was fancyfree
he's gone with my blessing she cried and now for puppies
as they drove away mr wilcox said to his daughter  i am really concerned at the way those girls go on
they are as clever as you make 'em but unpracticalgod bless me
one of these days they'll go too far
girls like that oughtn't to live alone in london
until they marry they ought to have someone to look after them
we must look in more oftenwe're better than no one
you like them don't you evie
evie replied helen's right enough but i can't stand the toothy one
and i shouldn't have called either of them girls
evie had grown up handsome
darkeyed with the glow of youth under sunburn built firmly and firmlipped she was the best the wilcoxes could do in the way of feminine beauty
for the present puppies and her father were the only things she loved but the net of matrimony was being prepared for her and a few days later she was attracted to a mr percy cahill an uncle of mrs charles and he was attracted to her
chapter   the age of property holds bitter moments even for a proprietor
when a move is imminent furniture becomes ridiculous and margaret now lay awake at nights wondering where where on earth they and all their belongings would be deposited in september next
chairs tables pictures books that had rumbled down to them through the generations must rumble forward again like a slide of rubbish to which she longed to give the final push and send toppling into the sea
but there were all their father's booksthey never read them but they were their father's and must be kept
there was the marbletopped chiffoniertheir mother had set store by it they could not remember why
round every knob and cushion in the house sentiment gathered a sentiment that was at times personal but more often a faint piety to the dead a prolongation of rites that might have ended at the grave
it was absurd if you came to think of it helen and tibby came to think of it margaret was too busy with the houseagents
the feudal ownership of land did bring dignity whereas the modern ownership of movables is reducing us again to a nomadic horde
we are reverting to the civilization of luggage and historians of the future will note how the middle classes accreted possessions without taking root in the earth and may find in this the secret of their imaginative poverty
the schlegels were certainly the poorer for the loss of wickham place
it had helped to balance their lives and almost to counsel them
nor is their groundlandlord spiritually the richer
he has built flats on its site his motorcars grow swifter his exposures of socialism more trenchant
but he has spilt the precious distillation of the years and no chemistry of his can give it back to society again
margaret grew depressed she was anxious to settle on a house before they left town to pay their annual visit to mrs munt
she enjoyed this visit and wanted to have her mind at ease for it
swanage though dull was stable and this year she longed more than usual for its fresh air and for the magnificent downs that guard it on the north
but london thwarted her in its atmosphere she could not concentrate
london only stimulates it cannot sustain and margaret hurrying over its surface for a house without knowing what sort of a house she wanted was paying for many a thrilling sensation in the past
she could not even break loose from culture and her time was wasted by concerts which it would be a sin to miss and invitations which it would never do to refuse
at last she grew desperate she resolved that she would go nowhere and be at home to no one until she found a house and broke the resolution in half an hour
once she had humorously lamented that she had never been to simpson's restaurant in the strand
now a note arrived from miss wilcox asking her to lunch there
mr cahill was coming and the three would have such a jolly chat and perhaps end up at the hippodrome
margaret had no strong regard for evie and no desire to meet her fiance and she was surprised that helen who had been far funnier about simpson's had not been asked instead
but the invitation touched her by its intimate tone
she must know evie wilcox better than she supposed and declaring that she simply must she accepted
but when she saw evie at the entrance of the restaurant staring fiercely at nothing after the fashion of athletic women her heart failed her anew
miss wilcox had changed perceptibly since her engagement
her voice was gruffer her manner more downright and she was inclined to patronize the more foolish virgin
margaret was silly enough to be pained at this
depressed at her isolation she saw not only houses and furniture but the vessel of life itself slipping past her with people like evie and mr cahill on board
there are moments when virtue and wisdom fail us and one of them came to her at simpson's in the strand
as she trod the staircase narrow but carpeted thickly as she entered the eatingroom where saddles of mutton were being trundled up to expectant clergymen she had a strong if erroneous conviction of her own futility and wished she had never come out of her backwater where nothing happened except art and literature and where no one ever got married or succeeded in remaining engaged
then came a little surprise
father might be of the partyyes father was
with a smile of pleasure she moved forward to greet him and her feeling of loneliness vanished
i thought i'd get round if i could said he
evie told me of her little plan so i just slipped in and secured a table
always secure a table first
evie don't pretend you want to sit by your old father because you don't
miss schlegel come in my side out of pity
my goodness but you look tired
been worrying round after your young clerks
no after houses said margaret edging past him into the box
i'm hungry not tired i want to eat heaps
that's good
what'll you have
fish pie said she with a glance at the menu
fish pie
fancy coming for fish pie to simpson's
it's not a bit the thing to go for here 
go for something for me then said margaret pulling off her gloves
her spirits were rising and his reference to leonard bast had warmed her curiously
saddle of mutton said he after profound reflection and cider to drink
that's the type of thing
i like this place for a joke once in a way
it is so thoroughly old english
don't you agree
yes said margaret who didn't
the order was given the joint rolled up and the carver under mr wilcox's direction cut the meat where it was succulent and piled their plates high
mr cahill insisted on sirloin but admitted that he had made a mistake later on
he and evie soon fell into a conversation of the no i didn't yes you did typeconversation which though fascinating to those who are engaged in it neither desires nor deserves the attention of others
it's a golden rule to tip the carver
tip everywhere's my motto
perhaps it does make life more human
then the fellows know one again
especially in the east if you tip they remember you from year's end to year's end
have you been in the east
oh greece and the levant
i used to go out for sport and business to cyprus some military society of a sort there
a few piastres properly distributed help to keep one's memory green
but you of course think this shockingly cynical
how's your discussion society getting on
any new utopias lately
no i'm househunting mr wilcox as i've already told you once
do you know of any houses
afraid i don't
well what's the point of being practical if you can't find two distressed females a house
we merely want a small house with large rooms and plenty of them
evie i like that
miss schlegel expects me to turn house agent for her
what's that father
i want a new home in september and someone must find it
i can't
percy do you know of anything
i can't say i do said mr cahill
how like you
you're never any good
never any good
just listen to her
never any good
oh come
well you aren't
miss schlegel is he
the torrent of their love having splashed these drops at margaret swept away on its habitual course
she sympathized with it now for a little comfort had restored her geniality
speech and silence pleased her equally and while mr wilcox made some preliminary inquiries about cheese her eyes surveyed the restaurant and admired its wellcalculated tributes to the solidity of our past
though no more old english than the works of kipling it had selected its reminiscences so adroitly that her criticism was lulled and the guests whom it was nourishing for imperial purposes bore the outer semblance of parson adams or tom jones
scraps of their talk jarred oddly on the ear
right you are
i'll cable out to uganda this evening came from the table behind
their emperor wants war well let him have it was the opinion of a clergyman
she smiled at such incongruities
next time she said to mr wilcox you shall come to lunch with me at mr eustace miles's
with pleasure
no you'd hate it she said pushing her glass towards him for some more cider
it's all proteids and bodybuildings and people come up to you and beg your pardon but you have such a beautiful aura
a what
never heard of an aura
oh happy happy man
i scrub at mine for hours
nor of an astral plane
he had heard of astral planes and censured them
just so
luckily it was helen's aura not mine and she had to chaperone it and do the politenesses
i just sat with my handkerchief in my mouth till the man went
funny experiences seem to come to you two girls
no one's ever asked me about mywhat d'ye call it
perhaps i've not got one
you're bound to have one but it may be such a terrible colour that no one dares mention it
tell me though miss schlegel do you really believe in the supernatural and all that
too difficult a question
why's that
gruyere or stilton
gruyere please
better have stilton
stilton
because though i don't believe in auras and think theosophy's only a halfwayhouse  yet there may be something in it all the same he concluded with a frown
not even that
it may be halfway in the wrong direction
i can't explain
i don't believe in all these fads and yet i don't like saying that i don't believe in them
he seemed unsatisfied and said so you wouldn't give me your word that you don't hold with astral bodies and all the rest of it
i could said margaret surprised that the point was of any importance to him
indeed i will
when i talked about scrubbing my aura i was only trying to be funny
but why do you want this settled
i don't know
now mr wilcox you do know
yes i am no you're not burst from the lovers opposite
margaret was silent for a moment and then changed the subject
how's your house
much the same as when you honoured it last week
i don't mean ducie street
howards end of course
why 'of course'
can't you turn out your tenant and let it to us
we're nearly demented
let me think
i wish i could help you
but i thought you wanted to be in town
one bit of advice fix your district then fix your price and then don't budge
that's how i got both ducie street and oniton
i said to myself 'i mean to be exactly here' and i was and oniton's a place in a thousand
but i do budge
gentlemen seem to mesmerize housescow them with an eye and up they come trembling
ladies can't
it's the houses that are mesmerizing me
i've no control over the saucy things
houses are alive
no
i'm out of my depth he said and added didn't you talk rather like that to your office boy
did i
i mean i did more or less
i talk the same way to every oneor try to
yes i know
and how much do you suppose that he understood of it
that's his lookout
i don't believe in suiting my conversation to my company
one can doubtless hit upon some medium of exchange that seems to do well enough but it's no more like the real thing than money is like food
there's no nourishment in it
you pass it to the lower classes and they pass it back to you and this you call 'social intercourse' or 'mutual endeavour' when it's mutual priggishness if it's anything
our friends at chelsea don't see this
they say one ought to be at all costs intelligible and sacrifice  lower classes interrupted mr wilcox as it were thrusting his hand into her speech
well you do admit that there are rich and poor
that's something
margaret could not reply
was he incredibly stupid or did he understand her better than she understood herself
you do admit that if wealth was divided up equally in a few years there would be rich and poor again just the same
the hardworking man would come to the top the wastrel sink to the bottom
every one admits that
your socialists don't
my socialists do
yours mayn't but i strongly suspect yours of being not socialists but ninepins which you have constructed for your own amusement
i can't imagine any living creature who would bowl over quite so easily
he would have resented this had she not been a woman
but women may say anythingit was one of his holiest beliefsand he only retorted with a gay smile i don't care
you've made two damaging admissions and i'm heartily with you in both
in time they finished lunch and margaret who had excused herself from the hippodrome took her leave
evie had scarcely addressed her and she suspected that the entertainment had been planned by the father
he and she were advancing out of their respective families towards a more intimate acquaintance
it had begun long ago
she had been his wife's friend and as such he had given her that silver vinaigrette as a memento
it was pretty of him to have given that vinaigrette and he had always preferred her to helenunlike most men
but the advance had been astonishing lately
they had done more in a week than in two years and were really beginning to know each other
she did not forget his promise to sample eustace miles and asked him as soon as she could secure tibby as his chaperon
he came and partook of bodybuilding dishes with humility
next morning the schlegels left for swanage
they had not succeeded in finding a new home
chapter   as they were seated at aunt juley's breakfasttable at the bays parrying her excessive hospitality and enjoying the view of the bay a letter came for margaret and threw her into perturbation
it was from mr wilcox
it announced an important change in his plans
owing to evie's marriage he had decided to give up his house in ducie street and was willing to let it on a yearly tenancy
it was a businesslike letter and stated frankly what he would do for them and what he would not do
also the rent
if they approved margaret was to come up at oncethe words were underlined as is necessary when dealing with womenand to go over the house with him
if they disapproved a wire would oblige as he should put it into the hands of an agent
the letter perturbed because she was not sure what it meant
if he liked her if he had manoeuvred to get her to simpson's might this be a manoeuvre to get her to london and result in an offer of marriage
she put it to herself as indelicately as possible in the hope that her brain would cry rubbish you're a selfconscious fool
but her brain only tingled a little and was silent and for a time she sat gazing at the mincing waves and wondering whether the news would seem strange to the others
as soon as she began speaking the sound of her own voice reassured her
there could be nothing in it
the replies also were typical and in the buff of conversation her fears vanished
you needn't go though began her hostess
i needn't but hadn't i better
it's really getting rather serious
we let chance after chance slip and the end of it is we shall be bundled out bag and baggage into the street
we don't know what we want that's the mischief with us  no we have no real ties said helen helping herself to toast
shan't i go up to town today take the house if it's the least possible and then come down by the afternoon train tomorrow and start enjoying myself
i shall be no fun to myself or to others until this business is off my mind
but you won't do anything rash margaret
there's nothing rash to do
who are the wilcoxes
said tibby a question that sounds silly but was really extremely subtle as his aunt found to her cost when she tried to answer it
i don't manage the wilcoxes i don't see where they come in
no more do i agreed helen
it's funny that we just don't lose sight of them
out of all our hotel acquaintances mr wilcox is the only one who has stuck
it is now over three years and we have drifted away from far more interesting people in that time
interesting people don't get one houses
meg if you start in your honestenglish vein i shall throw the treacle at you
it's a better vein than the cosmopolitan said margaret getting up
now children which is it to be
you know the ducie street house
shall i say yes or shall i say no
tibby lovewhich
i'm specially anxious to pin you both
it all depends what meaning you attach to the word 'possi'  it depends on nothing of the sort
say 'yes'
say 'no'
then margaret spoke rather seriously
i think she said that our race is degenerating
we cannot settle even this little thing what will it be like when we have to settle a big one
it will be as easy as eating returned helen
i was thinking of father
how could he settle to leave germany as he did when he had fought for it as a young man and all his feelings and friends were prussian
how could he break loose with patriotism and begin aiming at something else
it would have killed me
when he was nearly forty he could change countries and idealsand we at our age can't change houses
it's humiliating
your father may have been able to change countries said mrs munt with asperity and that may or may not be a good thing
but he could change houses no better than you can in fact much worse
never shall i forget what poor emily suffered in the move from manchester
i knew it cried helen
i told you so
it is the little things one bungles at
the big real ones are nothing when they come
bungle my dear
you are too little to recollectin fact you weren't there
but the furniture was actually in the vans and on the move before the lease for wickham place was signed and emily took train with babywho was margaret thenand the smaller luggage for london without so much as knowing where her new home would be
getting away from that house may be hard but it is nothing to the misery that we all went through getting you into it
helen with her mouth full cried and that's the man who beat the austrians and the danes and the french and who beat the germans that were inside himself
and we're like him
speak for yourself said tibby
remember that i am cosmopolitan please
helen may be right
of course she's right said helen
helen might be right but she did not go up to london
margaret did that
an interrupted holiday is the worst of the minor worries and one may be pardoned for feeling morbid when a business letter snatches one away from the sea and friends
she could not believe that her father had ever felt the same
her eyes had been troubling her lately so that she could not read in the train and it bored her to look at the landscape which she had seen but yesterday
at southampton she waved to frieda frieda was on her way down to join them at swanage and mrs munt had calculated that their trains would cross
but frieda was looking the other way and margaret travelled on to town feeling solitary and oldmaidish
how like an old maid to fancy that mr wilcox was courting her
she had once visited a spinsterpoor silly and unattractivewhose mania it was that every man who approached her fell in love
how margaret's heart had bled for the deluded thing
how she had lectured reasoned and in despair acquiesced
i may have been deceived by the curate my dear but the young fellow who brings the midday post really is fond of me and has as a matter fact it had always seemed to her the most hideous corner of old age yet she might be driven into it herself by the mere pressure of virginity
mr wilcox met her at waterloo himself
she felt certain that he was not the same as usual for one thing he took offence at everything she said
this is awfully kind of you she began but i'm afraid it's not going to do
the house has not been built that suits the schlegel family
what
have you come up determined not to deal
not exactly
not exactly
in that case let's be starting
she lingered to admire the motor which was new and a fairer creature than the vermilion giant that had borne aunt juley to her doom three years before
presumably it's very beautiful she said
how do you like it crane
come let's be starting repeated her host
how on earth did you know that my chauffeur was called crane
why i know crane i've been for a drive with evie once
i know that you've got a parlourmaid called milton
i know all sorts of things
evie
he echoed in injured tones
you won't see her
she's gone out with cahill
it's no fun i can tell you being left so much alone
i've got my work all dayindeed a great deal too much of itbut when i come home in the evening i tell you i can't stand the house
in my absurd way i'm lonely too margaret replied
it's heartbreaking to leave one's old home
i scarcely remember anything before wickham place and helen and tibby were born there
helen says  you too feel lonely
horribly
hullo parliament's back
mr wilcox glanced at parliament contemptuously
the more important ropes of life lay elsewhere
yes they are talking again
said he
but you were going to say  only some rubbish about furniture
helen says it alone endures while men and houses perish and that in the end the world will be a desert of chairs and sofasjust imagine it
rolling through infinity with no one to sit upon them
your sister always likes her little joke
she says 'yes' my brother says 'no' to ducie street
it's no fun helping us mr wilcox i assure you
you are not as unpractical as you pretend
i shall never believe it
margaret laughed
but she wasquite as unpractical
she could not concentrate on details
parliament the thames the irresponsive chauffeur would flash into the field of househunting and all demand some comment or response
it is impossible to see modern life steadily and see it whole and she had chosen to see it whole
mr wilcox saw steadily
he never bothered over the mysterious or the private
the thames might run inland from the sea the chauffeur might conceal all passion and philosophy beneath his unhealthy skin
they knew their own business and he knew his
yet she liked being with him
he was not a rebuke but a stimulus and banished morbidity
some twenty years her senior he preserved a gift that she supposed herself to have already lostnot youth's creative power but its selfconfidence and optimism
he was so sure that it was a very pleasant world
his complexion was robust his hair had receded but not thinned the thick moustache and the eyes that helen had compared to brandyballs had an agreeable menace in them whether they were turned towards the slums or towards the stars
some dayin the millenniumthere may be no need for his type
at present homage is due to it from those who think themselves superior and who possibly are
at all events you responded to my telegram promptly he remarked
oh even i know a good thing when i see it
i'm glad you don't despise the goods of this world
heavens no
only idiots and prigs do that
i am glad very glad he repeated suddenly softening and turning to her as if the remark had pleased him
there is so much cant talked in wouldbe intellectual circles
i am glad you don't share it
selfdenial is all very well as a means of strengthening the character
but i can't stand those people who run down comforts
they have usually some axe to grind
can you
comforts are of two kinds said margaret who was keeping herself in handthose we can share with others like fire weather or music and those we can'tfood for instance
it depends
i mean reasonable comforts of course
i shouldn't like to think that you he bent nearer the sentence died unfinished
margaret's head turned very stupid and the inside of it seemed to revolve like the beacon in a lighthouse
he did not kiss her for the hour was halfpast twelve and the car was passing by the stables of buckingham palace
but the atmosphere was so charged with emotion that people only seemed to exist on her account and she was surprised that crane did not realize this and turn round
idiot though she might be surely mr wilcox was morehow should one put it
more psychological than usual
always a good judge of character for business purposes he seemed this afternoon to enlarge his field and to note qualities outside neatness obedience and decision
i want to go over the whole house she announced when they arrived
as soon as i get back to swanage which will be tomorrow afternoon i'll talk it over once more with helen and tibby and wire you 'yes' or 'no'
right
the diningroom
and they began their survey
the diningroom was big but overfurnished
chelsea would have moaned aloud
mr wilcox had eschewed those decorative schemes that wince and relent and refrain and achieve beauty by sacrificing comfort and pluck
after so much selfcolour and selfdenial margaret viewed with relief the sumptuous dado the frieze the gilded wallpaper amid whose foliage parrots sang
it would never do with her own furniture but those heavy chairs that immense sideboard loaded with presentation plate stood up against its pressure like men
the room suggested men and margaret keen to derive the modern capitalist from the warriors and hunters of the past saw it as an ancient guesthall where the lord sat at meat among his thanes
even the biblethe dutch bible that charles had brought back from the boer warfell into position
such a room admitted loot
now the entrancehall
the entrancehall was paved
here we fellows smoke
we fellows smoked in chairs of maroon leather
it was as if a motorcar had spawned
oh jolly
said margaret sinking into one of them
you do like it
he said fixing his eyes on her upturned face and surely betraying an almost intimate note
it's all rubbish not making oneself comfortable
isn't it
yees
semirubbish
are those cruikshanks
gillrays
shall we go on upstairs
does all this furniture come from howards end
the howards end furniture has all gone to oniton
doeshowever i'm concerned with the house not the furniture
how big is this smokingroom
thirty by fifteen
no wait a minute
fifteen and a half
ah well
mr wilcox aren't you ever amused at the solemnity with which we middle classes approach the subject of houses
they proceeded to the drawingroom
chelsea managed better here
it was sallow and ineffective
one could visualize the ladies withdrawing to it while their lords discussed life's realities below to the accompaniment of cigars
had mrs wilcox's drawingroom looked thus at howards end
just as this thought entered margaret's brain mr wilcox did ask her to be his wife and the knowledge that she had been right so overcame her that she nearly fainted
but the proposal was not to rank among the world's great love scenes
miss schlegelhis voice was firmi have had you up on false pretences
i want to speak about a much more serious matter than a house
margaret almost answered i know  could you be induced to share myis it probable  oh mr
wilcox
she interrupted holding the piano and averting her eyes
i see i see
i will write to you afterwards if i may
he began to stammer
miss schlegelmargaretyou don't understand
oh yes
indeed yes
said margaret
i am asking you to be my wife
so deep already was her sympathy that when he said i am asking you to be my wife she made herself give a little start
she must show surprise if he expected it
an immense joy came over her
it was indescribable
it had nothing to do with humanity and most resembled the allpervading happiness of fine weather
fine weather is due to the sun but margaret could think of no central radiance here
she stood in his drawingroom happy and longing to give happiness
on leaving him she realized that the central radiance had been love
you aren't offended miss schlegel
how could i be offended
there was a moment's pause
he was anxious to get rid of her and she knew it
she had too much intuition to look at him as he struggled for possessions that money cannot buy
he desired comradeship and affection but he feared them and she who had taught herself only to desire and could have clothed the struggle with beauty held back and hesitated with him
goodbye she continued
you will have a letter from mei am going back to swanage tomorrow
thank you
goodbye and it's you i thank
i may order the motor round mayn't i
that would be most kind
i wish i had written instead
ought i to have written
not at all
there's just one question  she shook her head
he looked a little bewildered and they parted
they parted without shaking hands she had kept the interview for his sake in tints of the quietest grey
yet she thrilled with happiness ere she reached her own house
others had loved her in the past if one may apply to their brief desires so grave a word but those others had been ninniesyoung men who had nothing to do old men who could find nobody better
and she had often loved too but only so far as the facts of sex demanded mere yearnings for the masculine to be dismissed for what they were worth with a smile
never before had her personality been touched
she was not young or very rich and it amazed her that a man of any standing should take her seriously
as she sat trying to do accounts in her empty house amidst beautiful pictures and noble books waves of emotion broke as if a tide of passion was flowing through the night air
she shook her head tried to concentrate her attention and failed
in vain did she repeat but i've been through this sort of thing before
she had never been through it the big machinery as opposed to the little had been set in motion and the idea that mr wilcox loved obsessed her before she came to love him in return
she would come to no decision yet
oh sir this is so suddenthat prudish phrase exactly expressed her when her time came
premonitions are not preparation
she must examine more closely her own nature and his she must talk it over judicially with helen
it had been a strange lovescenethe central radiance unacknowledged from first to last
she in his place would have said ich liebe dich but perhaps it was not his habit to open the heart
he might have done it if she had pressed himas a matter of duty perhaps england expects every man to open his heart once but the effort would have jarred him and never if she could avoid it should he lose those defences that he had chosen to raise against the world
he must never be bothered with emotional talk or with a display of sympathy
he was an elderly man now and it would be futile and impudent to correct him
mrs wilcox strayed in and out ever a welcome ghost surveying the scene thought margaret without one hint of bitterness
chapter   if one wanted to show a foreigner england perhaps the wisest course would be to take him to the final section of the purbeck hills and stand him on their summit a few miles to the east of corfe
then system after system of our island would roll together under his feet
beneath him is the valley of the frome and all the wild lands that come tossing down from dorchester black and gold to mirror their gorse in the expanses of poole
the valley of the stour is beyond unaccountable stream dirty at blandford pure at wimbornethe stour sliding out of fat fields to marry the avon beneath the tower of christchurch
the valley of the avoninvisible but far to the north the trained eye may see clearbury ring that guards it and the imagination may leap beyond that on to salisbury plain itself and beyond the plain to all the glorious downs of central england
nor is suburbia absent
bournemouth's ignoble coast cowers to the right heralding the pinetrees that mean for all their beauty red houses and the stock exchange and extend to the gates of london itself
so tremendous is the city's trail
but the cliffs of freshwater it shall never touch and the island will guard the island's purity till the end of time
seen from the west the wight is beautiful beyond all laws of beauty
it is as if a fragment of england floated forward to greet the foreignerchalk of our chalk turf of our turf epitome of what will follow
and behind the fragment lies southampton hostess to the nations and portsmouth a latent fire and all around it with double and treble collision of tides swirls the sea
how many villages appear in this view
how many castles
how many churches vanished or triumphant
how many ships railways and roads
what incredible variety of men working beneath that lucent sky to what final end
the reason fails like a wave on the swanage beach the imagination swells spreads and deepens until it becomes geographic and encircles england
so frieda mosebach now frau architect liesecke and mother to her husband's baby was brought up to these heights to be impressed and after a prolonged gaze she said that the hills were more swelling here than in pomerania which was true but did not seem to mrs munt apposite
poole harbour was dry which led her to praise the absence of muddy foreshore at friedrich wilhelms bad rugen where beechtrees hang over the tideless baltic and cows may contemplate the brine
rather unhealthy mrs munt thought this would be water being safer when it moved about
and your english lakesvindermere grasmereare they then unhealthy
no frau liesecke but that is because they are fresh water and different
salt water ought to have tides and go up and down a great deal or else it smells
look for instance at an aquarium
an aquarium
oh meesis munt you mean to tell me that fresh aquariums stink less than salt
why when victor my brotherinlaw collected many tadpoles  you are not to say 'stink' interrupted helen at least you may say it but you must pretend you are being funny while you say it
then 'smell'
and the mud of your pool down theredoes it not smell or may i say 'stink ha ha'
there always has been mud in poole harbour said mrs munt with a slight frown
the rivers bring it down and a most valuable oysterfishery depends upon it
yes that is so conceded frieda and another international incident was closed
'bournemouth is' resumed their hostess quoting a local rhyme to which she was much attached 'bournemouth is poole was and swanage is to be the most important town of all and biggest of the three'
now frau liesecke i have shown you bournemouth and i have shown you poole so let us walk backward a little and look down again at swanage
aunt juley wouldn't that be meg's train
a tiny puff of smoke had been circling the harbour and now was bearing southwards towards them over the black and the gold
oh dearest margaret i do hope she won't be overtired
oh i do wonderi do wonder whether she's taken the house
i hope she hasn't been hasty
so do ioh so do i
will it be as beautiful as wickham place
frieda asked
i should think it would
trust mr wilcox for doing himself proud
all those ducie street houses are beautiful in their modern way and i can't think why he doesn't keep on with it
but it's really for evie that he went there and now that evie's going to be married  ah
you've never seen miss wilcox frieda
how absurdly matrimonial you are
but sister to that paul
yes
and to that charles said mrs munt with feeling
oh helen helen what a time that was
helen laughed
meg and i haven't got such tender hearts
if there's a chance of a cheap house we go for it
now look frau liesecke at my niece's train
you see it is coming towards uscoming coming and when it gets to corfe it will actually go through the downs on which we are standing so that if we walk over as i suggested and look down on swanage we shall see it coming on the other side
shall we
frieda assented and in a few minutes they had crossed the ridge and exchanged the greater view for the lesser
rather a dull valley lay below backed by the slope of the coastward downs
they were looking across the isle of purbeck and on to swanage soon to be the most important town of all and ugliest of the three
margaret's train reappeared as promised and was greeted with approval by her aunt
it came to a standstill in the middle distance and there it had been planned that tibby should meet her and drive her and a teabasket up to join them
you see continued helen to her cousin the wilcoxes collect houses as your victor collects tadpoles
they have one ducie street two howards end where my great rumpus was three a country seat in shropshire four charles has a house in hilton and five another near epsom and six evie will have a house when she marries and probably a piedaterre in the countrywhich makes seven
oh yes and paul a hut in africa makes eight
i wish we could get howards end
that was something like a dear little house
didn't you think so aunt juley
 i had too much to do dear to look at it said mrs munt with a gracious dignity
i had everything to settle and explain and charles wilcox to keep in his place besides
it isn't likely i should remember much
i just remember having lunch in your bedroom
yes so do i
but oh dear dear how dead it all seems
and in the autumn there began this antipauline movementyou and frieda and meg and mrs wilcox all obsessed with the idea that i might yet marry paul
you yet may said frieda despondently
helen shook her head
the great wilcox peril will never return
if i'm certain of anything it's of that
one is certain of nothing but the truth of one's own emotions
the remark fell damply on the conversation
but helen slipped her arm round her cousin somehow liking her the better for making it
it was not an original remark nor had frieda appropriated it passionately for she had a patriotic rather than a philosophic mind
yet it betrayed that interest in the universal which the average teuton possesses and the average englishman does not
it was however illogically the good the beautiful the true as opposed to the respectable the pretty the adequate
it was a landscape of bocklin's beside a landscape of leader's strident and illconsidered but quivering into supernatural life
it sharpened idealism stirred the soul
it may have been a bad preparation for what followed
look
cried aunt juley hurrying away from generalities over the narrow summit of the down
stand where i stand and you will see the ponycart coming
i see the ponycart coming
they stood and saw the ponycart coming
margaret and tibby were presently seen coming in it
leaving the outskirts of swanage it drove for a little through the budding lanes and then began the ascent
have you got the house
they shouted long before she could possibly hear
helen ran down to meet her
the highroad passed over a saddle and a track went thence at right angles along the ridge of the down
have you got the house
margaret shook her head
oh what a nuisance
so we're as we were
not exactly
she got out looking tired
some mystery said tibby
we are to be enlightened presently
margaret came close up to her and whispered that she had had a proposal of marriage from mr wilcox
helen was amused
she opened the gate on to the downs so that her brother might lead the pony through
it's just like a widower she remarked
they've cheek enough for anything and invariably select one of their first wife's friends
margaret's face flashed despair
that type she broke off with a cry
meg not anything wrong with you
wait one minute said margaret whispering always
but you've never conceivablyyou've never she pulled herself together
tibby hurry up through i can't hold this gate indefinitely
aunt juley
i say aunt juley make the tea will you and frieda we've got to talk houses and i'll come on afterwards
and then turning her face to her sister's she burst into tears
margaret was stupefied
she heard herself saying oh really  she felt herself touched with a hand that trembled
don't sobbed helen don't don't meg don't
she seemed incapable of saying any other word
margaret trembling herself led her forward up the road till they strayed through another gate on to the down
don't don't do such a thing
i tell you not todon't
i knowdon't
what do you know
panic and emptiness sobbed helen
don't
then margaret thought helen is a little selfish
i have never behaved like this when there has seemed a chance of her marrying
she said but we would still see each other very often and  it's not a thing like that sobbed helen
and she broke right away and wandered distractedly upwards stretching her hands towards the view and crying
what's happened to you
called margaret following through the wind that gathers at sundown on the northern slopes of hills
but it's stupid
and suddenly stupidity seized her and the immense landscape was blurred
but helen turned back  
meg  i don't know what's happened to either of us said margaret wiping her eyes
we must both have gone mad
then helen wiped hers and they even laughed a little
look here sit down
all right i'll sit down if you'll sit down
there
one kiss
now whatever whatever is the matter
i do mean what i said
don't it wouldn't do
oh helen stop saying 'don't'
it's ignorant
it's as if your head wasn't out of the slime
'don't' is probably what mrs bast says all the day to mr
bast
helen was silent
well
tell me about it first and meanwhile perhaps i'll have got my head out of the slime
that's better
well where shall i begin
when i arrived at waterloono i'll go back before that because i'm anxious you should know everything from the first
the 'first' was about ten days ago
it was the day mr bast came to tea and lost his temper
i was defending him and mr wilcox became jealous about me however slightly
i thought it was the involuntary thing which men can't help any more than we can
you knowat least i know in my own casewhen a man has said to me 'soandso's a pretty girl' i am seized with a momentary sourness against soandso and long to tweak her ear
it's a tiresome feeling but not an important one and one easily manages it
but it wasn't only this in mr wilcox's case i gather now
then you love him
margaret considered
it is wonderful knowing that a real man cares for you she said
the mere fact of that grows more tremendous
remember i've known and liked him steadily for nearly three years
but loved him
margaret peered into her past
it is pleasant to analyze feelings while they are still only feelings and unembodied in the social fabric
with her arm round helen and her eyes shifting over the view as if this county or that could reveal the secret of her own heart she meditated honestly and said no
but you will
yes said margaret of that i'm pretty sure
indeed i began the moment he spoke to me
and have settled to marry him
i had but am wanting a long talk about it now
what is it against him helen
you must try and say
helen in her turn looked outwards
it is ever since paul she said finally
but what has mr wilcox to do with paul
but he was there they were all there that morning when i came down to breakfast and saw that paul was frightenedthe man who loved me frightened and all his paraphernalia fallen so that i knew it was impossible because personal relations are the important thing for ever and ever and not this outer life of telegrams and anger
she poured the sentence forth in one breath but her sister understood it because it touched on thoughts that were familiar between them
that's foolish
in the first place i disagree about the outer life
well we've often argued that
the real point is that there is the widest gulf between my lovemaking and yours
yourswas romance mine will be prose
i'm not running it downa very good kind of prose but well considered well thought out
for instance i know all mr wilcox's faults
he's afraid of emotion
he cares too much about success too little about the past
his sympathy lacks poetry and so isn't sympathy really
i'd even sayshe looked at the shining lagoonsthat spiritually he's not as honest as i am
doesn't that satisfy you
no it doesn't said helen
it makes me feel worse and worse
you must be mad
margaret made a movement of irritation
i don't intend him or any man or any woman to be all my lifegood heavens no
there are heaps of things in me that he doesn't and shall never understand
thus she spoke before the wedding ceremony and the physical union before the astonishing glass shade had fallen that interposes between married couples and the world
she was to keep her independence more than do most women as yet
marriage was to alter her fortunes rather than her character and she was not far wrong in boasting that she understood her future husband
yet he did alter her charactera little
there was an unforeseen surprise a cessation of the winds and odours of life a social pressure that would have her think conjugally
so with him she continued
there are heaps of things in himmore especially things that he doesthat will always be hidden from me
he has all those public qualities which you so despise and enable all this she waved her hand at the landscape which confirmed anything
if wilcoxes hadn't worked and died in england for thousands of years you and i couldn't sit here without having our throats cut
there would be no trains no ships to carry us literary people about in no fields even
just savagery
noperhaps not even that
without their spirit life might never have moved out of protoplasm
more and more do i refuse to draw my income and sneer at those who guarantee it
there are times when it seems to me  and to me and to all women
so one kissed paul
that's brutal said margaret
mine is an absolutely different case
i've thought things out
it makes no difference thinking things out
they come to the same
 rubbish
there was a long silence during which the tide returned into poole harbour
one would lose something murmured helen apparently to herself
the water crept over the mudflats towards the gorse and the blackened heather
branksea island lost its immense foreshores and became a sombre episode of trees
frome was forced inward towards dorchester stour against wimborne avon towards salisbury and over the immense displacement the sun presided leading it to triumph ere he sank to rest
england was alive throbbing through all her estuaries crying for joy through the mouths of all her gulls and the north wind with contrary motion blew stronger against her rising seas
what did it mean
for what end are her fair complexities her changes of soil her sinuous coast
does she belong to those who have moulded her and made her feared by other lands or to those who have added nothing to her power but have somehow seen her seen the whole island at once lying as a jewel in a silver sea sailing as a ship of souls with all the brave world's fleet accompanying her towards eternity
chapter   margaret had often wondered at the disturbance that takes place in the world's waters when love who seems so tiny a pebble slips in
whom does love concern beyond the beloved and the lover
yet his impact deluges a hundred shores
no doubt the disturbance is really the spirit of the generations welcoming the new generation and chafing against the ultimate fate who holds all the seas in the palm of her hand
but love cannot understand this
he cannot comprehend another's infinity he is conscious only of his ownflying sunbeam falling rose pebble that asks for one quiet plunge below the fretting interplay of space and time
he knows that he will survive at the end of things and be gathered by fate as a jewel from the slime and be handed with admiration round the assembly of the gods
men did produce this they will say and saying they will give men immortality
but meanwhilewhat agitations meanwhile
the foundations of property and propriety are laid bare twin rocks family pride flounders to the surface puffing and blowing and refusing to be comforted theology vaguely ascetic gets up a nasty ground swell
then the lawyers are arousedcold broodand creep out of their holes
they do what they can they tidy up property and propriety reassure theology and family pride
halfguineas are poured on the troubled waters the lawyers creep back and if all has gone well love joins one man and woman together in matrimony
margaret had expected the disturbance and was not irritated by it
for a sensitive woman she had steady nerves and could bear with the incongruous and the grotesque and besides there was nothing excessive about her loveaffair
goodhumour was the dominant note of her relations with mr wilcox or as i must now call him henry
henry did not encourage romance and she was no girl to fidget for it
an acquaintance had become a lover might become a husband but would retain all that she had noted in the acquaintance and love must confirm an old relation rather than reveal a new one
in this spirit she promised to marry him
he was in swanage on the morrow bearing the engagementring
they greeted one another with a hearty cordiality that impressed aunt juley
henry dined at the bays but he had engaged a bedroom in the principal hotel he was one of those men who knew the principal hotel by instinct
after dinner he asked margaret if she wouldn't care for a turn on the parade
she accepted and could not repress a little tremor it would be her first real love scene
but as she put on her hat she burst out laughing
love was so unlike the article served up in books the joy though genuine was different the mystery an unexpected mystery
for one thing mr wilcox still seemed a stranger
for a time they talked about the ring then she said  do you remember the embankment at chelsea
it can't be ten days ago
yes he said laughing
and you and your sister were head and ears deep in some quixotic scheme
ah well
i little thought then certainly
did you
i don't know about that i shouldn't like to say
why was it earlier
she cried
did you think of me this way earlier
how extraordinarily interesting henry
tell me
but henry had no intention of telling
perhaps he could not have told for his mental states became obscure as soon as he had passed through them
he misliked the very word interesting connoting it with wasted energy and even with morbidity
hard facts were enough for him
i didn't think of it she pursued
no when you spoke to me in the drawingroom that was practically the first
it was all so different from what it's supposed to be
on the stage or in books a proposal ishow shall i put it
a fullblown affair a kind of bouquet it loses its literal meaning
but in life a proposal really is a proposal  by the way  a suggestion a seed she concluded and the thought flew away into darkness
i was thinking if you didn't mind that we ought to spend this evening in a business talk there will be so much to settle
i think so too
tell me in the first place how did you get on with tibby
with your brother
yes during cigarettes
oh very well
i am so glad she answered a little surprised
what did you talk about
me presumably
about greece too
greece was a very good card henry
tibby's only a boy still and one has to pick and choose subjects a little
well done
i was telling him i have shares in a currantfarm near calamata
what a delightful thing to have shares in
can't we go there for our honeymoon
what to do
to eat the currants
and isn't there marvellous scenery
moderately but it's not the kind of place one could possibly go to with a lady
why not
no hotels
some ladies do without hotels
are you aware that helen and i have walked alone over the apennines with our luggage on our backs
i wasn't aware and if i can manage it you will never do such a thing again
she said more gravely you haven't found time for a talk with helen yet i suppose
no
do before you go
i am so anxious you two should be friends
your sister and i have always hit it off he said negligently
but we're drifting away from our business
let me begin at the beginning
you know that evie is going to marry percy cahill
dolly's uncle
exactly
the girl's madly in love with him
a very good sort of fellow but he demandsand rightlya suitable provision with her
and in the second place you will naturally understand there is charles
before leaving town i wrote charles a very careful letter
you see he has an increasing family and increasing expenses and the i and w a is nothing particular just now though capable of development
poor fellow
murmured margaret looking out to sea and not understanding
charles being the elder son some day charles will have howards end but i am anxious in my own happiness not to be unjust to others
of course not she began and then gave a little cry
you mean money
how stupid i am
of course not
oddly enough he winced a little at the word
yes
money since you put it so frankly
i am determined to be just to alljust to you just to them
i am determined that my children shall have no case against me
be generous to them she said sharply
bother justice
i am determinedand have already written to charles to that effect  but how much have you got
what
how much have you a year
i've six hundred
my income
yes
we must begin with how much you have before we can settle how much you can give charles
justice and even generosity depend on that
i must say you're a downright young woman he observed patting her arm and laughing a little
what a question to spring on a fellow
don't you know your income
or don't you want to tell it me
i  that's all rightnow she patted himdon't tell me
i don't want to know
i can do the sum just as well by proportion
divide your income into ten parts
how many parts would you give to evie how many to charles how many to paul
the fact is my dear i hadn't any intention of bothering you with details
i only wanted to let you know thatwell that something must be done for the others and you've understood me perfectly so let's pass on to the next point
yes we've settled that said margaret undisturbed by his strategic blunderings
go ahead give away all you can bearing in mind i've a clear six hundred
what a mercy it is to have all this money about one
we've none too much i assure you you're marrying a poor man
helen wouldn't agree with me here she continued
helen daren't slang the rich being rich herself but she would like to
there's an odd notion that i haven't yet got hold of running about at the back of her brain that poverty is somehow 'real'
she dislikes all organization and probably confuses wealth with the technique of wealth
sovereigns in a stocking wouldn't bother her cheques do
helen is too relentless
one can't deal in her highhanded manner with the world
there's this other point and then i must go back to my hotel and write some letters
what's to be done now about the house in ducie street
keep it onat least it depends
when do you want to marry me
she raised her voice as too often and some youths who were also taking the evening air overheard her
getting a bit hot eh
said one
mr wilcox turned on them and said sharply i say
there was silence
take care i don't report you to the police
they moved away quietly enough but were only biding their time and the rest of the conversation was punctuated by peals of ungovernable laughter
lowering his voice and infusing a hint of reproof into it he said evie will probably be married in september
we could scarcely think of anything before then
the earlier the nicer henry
females are not supposed to say such things but the earlier the nicer
how about september for us too
he asked rather dryly
right
shall we go into ducie street ourselves in september
or shall we try to bounce helen and tibby into it
that's rather an idea
they are so unbusinesslike we could make them do anything by judicious management
look hereyes
we'll do that
and we ourselves could live at howards end or shropshire
he blew out his cheeks
heavens
how you women do fly round
my head's in a whirl
point by point margaret
howards end's impossible
i let it to hamar bryce on a three years' agreement last march
don't you remember
oniton
well that is much much too far away to rely on entirely
you will be able to be down there entertaining a certain amount but we must have a house within easy reach of town
only ducie street has huge drawbacks
there's a mews behind
margaret could not help laughing
it was the first she had heard of the mews behind ducie street
when she was a possible tenant it had suppressed itself not consciously but automatically
the breezy wilcox manner though genuine lacked the clearness of vision that is imperative for truth
when henry lived in ducie street he remembered the mews when he tried to let he forgot it and if anyone had remarked that the mews must be either there or not he would have felt annoyed and afterwards have found some opportunity of stigmatizing the speaker as academic
so does my grocer stigmatize me when i complain of the quality of his sultanas and he answers in one breath that they are the best sultanas and how can i expect the best sultanas at that price
it is a flaw inherent in the business mind and margaret may do well to be tender to it considering all that the business mind has done for england
yes in summer especially the mews is a serious nuisance
the smoking room too is an abominable little den
the house opposite has been taken by operatic people
ducie street's going down it's my private opinion
how sad
it's only a few years since they built those pretty houses
shows things are moving
good for trade
i hate this continual flux of london
it is an epitome of us at our worsteternal formlessness all the qualities good bad and indifferent streaming awaystreaming streaming for ever
that's why i dread it so
i mistrust rivers even in scenery
now the sea  high tide yes
hoy toidfrom the promenading youths
and these are the men to whom we give the vote observed mr wilcox omitting to add that they were also the men to whom he gave work as clerkswork that scarcely encouraged them to grow into other men
however they have their own lives and interests
let's get on
he turned as he spoke and prepared to see her back to the bays
the business was over
his hotel was in the opposite direction and if he accompanied her his letters would be late for the post
she implored him not to come but he was obdurate
a nice beginning if your aunt saw you slip in alone
but i always do go about alone
considering i've walked over the apennines it's common sense
you will make me so angry
i don't the least take it as a compliment
he laughed and lit a cigar
it isn't meant as a compliment my dear
i just won't have you going about in the dark
such people about too
it's dangerous 
can't i look after myself
i do wish  come along margaret no wheedling
a younger woman might have resented his masterly ways but margaret had too firm a grip of life to make a fuss
she was in her own way as masterly
if he was a fortress she was a mountain peak whom all might tread but whom the snows made nightly virginal
disdaining the heroic outfit excitable in her methods garrulous episodical shrill she misled her lover much as she had misled her aunt
he mistook her fertility for weakness
he supposed her as clever as they make 'em but no more not realizing that she was penetrating to the depths of his soul and approving of what she found there
and if insight were sufficient if the inner life were the whole of life their happiness has been assured
they walked ahead briskly
the parade and the road after it were well lighted but it was darker in aunt juley's garden
as they were going up by the sidepaths through some rhododendrons mr wilcox who was in front said margaret rather huskily turned dropped his cigar and took her in his arms
she was startled and nearly screamed but recovered herself at once and kissed with genuine love the lips that were pressed against her own
it was their first kiss and when it was over he saw her safely to the door and rang the bell for her but disappeared into the night before the maid answered it
on looking back the incident displeased her
it was so isolated
nothing in their previous conversation had heralded it and worse still no tenderness had ensued
if a man cannot lead up to passion he can at all events lead down from it and she had hoped after her complaisance for some interchange of gentle words
but he had hurried away as if ashamed and for an instant she was reminded of helen and paul
chapter   charles had just been scolding his dolly
she deserved the scolding and had bent before it but her head though bloody was unsubdued and her chirrupings began to mingle with his retreating thunder
you've woken the baby
i knew you would
rumtifoo racketytackety tompkin
i'm not responsible for what uncle percy does nor for anybody else or anything so there
who asked him while i was away
who asked my sister down to meet him
who sent them out in the motor day after day
charles that reminds me of some poem
does it indeed
we shall all be dancing to a very different music presently
miss schlegel has fairly got us on toast
i could simply scratch that woman's eyes out and to say it's my fault is most unfair
it's your fault and five months ago you admitted it
i didn't
you did
tootle tootle playing on the pootle
exclaimed dolly suddenly devoting herself to the child
it's all very well to turn the conversation but father would never have dreamt of marrying as long as evie was there to make him comfortable
but you must needs start matchmaking
besides cahill's too old
of course if you're going to be rude to uncle percy  miss schlegel always meant to get hold of howards end and thanks to you she's got it
i call the way you twist things round and make them hang together most unfair
you couldn't have been nastier if you'd caught me flirting
could he diddums
we're in a bad hole and must make the best of it
i shall answer the pater's letter civilly
he's evidently anxious to do the decent thing
but i do not intend to forget these schlegels in a hurry
as long as they're on their best behaviourdolly are you listening
we'll behave too
but if i find them giving themselves airs or monopolizing my father or at all illtreating him or worrying him with their artistic beastliness i intend to put my foot down yes firmly
taking my mother's place
heaven knows what poor old paul will say when the news reaches him
the interlude closes
it has taken place in charles's garden at hilton
he and dolly are sitting in deckchairs and their motor is regarding them placidly from its garage across the lawn
a shortfrocked edition of charles also regards them placidly a perambulator edition is squeaking a third edition is expected shortly
nature is turning out wilcoxes in this peaceful abode so that they may inherit the earth
chapter   margaret greeted her lord with peculiar tenderness on the morrow
mature as he was she might yet be able to help him to the building of the rainbow bridge that should connect the prose in us with the passion
without it we are meaningless fragments half monks half beasts unconnected arches that have never joined into a man
with it love is born and alights on the highest curve glowing against the grey sober against the fire
happy the man who sees from either aspect the glory of these outspread wings
the roads of his soul lie clear and he and his friends shall find easygoing
it was hardgoing in the roads of mr wilcox's soul
from boyhood he had neglected them
i am not a fellow who bothers about my own inside
outwardly he was cheerful reliable and brave but within all had reverted to chaos ruled so far as it was ruled at all by an incomplete asceticism
whether as boy husband or widower he had always the sneaking belief that bodily passion is bad a belief that is desirable only when held passionately
religion had confirmed him
the words that were read aloud on sunday to him and to other respectable men were the words that had once kindled the souls of st catharine and st francis into a whitehot hatred of the carnal
he couldnot be as the saints and love the infinite with a seraphic ardour but he could be a little ashamed of loving a wife
amabat amare timebat
and it was here that margaret hoped to help him
it did not seem so difficult
she need trouble him with no gift of her own
she would only point out the salvation that was latent in his own soul and in the soul of every man
only connect
that was the whole of her sermon
only connect the prose and the passion and both will be exalted and human love will be seen at its height
live in fragments no longer
only connect and the beast and the monk robbed of the isolation that is life to either will die
nor was the message difficult to give
it need not take the form of a good talking
by quiet indications the bridge would be built and span their lives with beauty
but she failed
for there was one quality in henry for which she was never prepared however much she reminded herself of it his obtuseness
he simply did not notice things and there was no more to be said
he never noticed that helen and frieda were hostile or that tibby was not interested in currant plantations he never noticed the lights and shades that exist in the grayest conversation the fingerposts the milestones the collisions the illimitable views
onceon another occasionshe scolded him about it
he was puzzled but replied with a laugh my motto is concentrate
i've no intention of frittering away my strength on that sort of thing
it isn't frittering away the strength she protested
it's enlarging the space in which you may be strong
he answered you're a clever little woman but my motto's concentrate
and this morning he concentrated with a vengeance
they met in the rhododendrons of yesterday
in the daylight the bushes were inconsiderable and the path was bright in the morning sun
she was with helen who had been ominously quiet since the affair was settled
here we all are
she cried and took him by one hand retaining her sister's in the other
here we are
goodmorning helen
helen replied goodmorning mr
wilcox
henry she has had such a nice letter from the queer cross boydo you remember him
he had a sad moustache but the back of his head was young
i have had a letter too
not a nice onei want to talk it over with you for leonard bast was nothing to him now that she had given him her word the triangle of sex was broken for ever
thanks to your hint he's clearing out of the porphyrion
not a bad business that porphyrion he said absently as he took his own letter out of his pocket
not a bad she exclaimed dropping his hand
surely on chelsea embankment  here's our hostess
goodmorning mrs munt
fine rhododendrons
good morning frau liesecke we manage to grow flowers in england don't we
not a bad business
no
my letter's about howards end
bryce has been ordered abroad and wants to sublet it
i am far from sure that i shall give him permission
there was no clause in the agreement
in my opinion subletting is a mistake
if he can find me another tenant whom i consider suitable i may cancel the agreement
morning schlegel
don't you think that's better than subletting
helen had dropped her hand now and he had steered her past the whole party to the seaward side of the house
beneath them was the bourgeois little bay which must have yearned all through the centuries for just such a wateringplace as swanage to be built on its margin
the waves were colourless and the bournemouth steamer gave a further touch of insipidity drawn up against the pier and hooting wildly for excursionists
when there is a sublet i find that damage  do excuse me but about the porphyrion
i don't feel easymight i just bother you henry
her manner was so serious that he stopped and asked her a little sharply what she wanted
you said on chelsea embankment surely that it was a bad concern so we advised this clerk to clear out
he writes this morning that he's taken our advice and now you say it's not a bad concern 
a clerk who clears out of any concern good or bad without securing a berth somewhere else first is a fool and i've no pity for him
he has not done that
he's going into a bank in camden town he says
the salary's much lower but he hopes to managea branch of dempster's bank
is that all right
dempster
my goodness me yes
more right than the porphyrion
yes yes yes safe as housessafer
very many thanks
i'm sorryif you sublet
if he sublets i shan't have the same control
in theory there should be no more damage done at howards end in practice there will be
things may be done for which no money can compensate
for instance i shouldn't want that fine wychelm spoilt
it hangsmargaret we must go and see the old place some time
it's pretty in its way
we'll motor down and have lunch with charles
i should enjoy that said margaret bravely
what about next wednesday
wednesday
no i couldn't well do that
aunt juley expects us to stop here another week at least
but you can give that up now
erno said margaret after a moment's thought
oh that'll be all right
i'll speak to her
this visit is a high solemnity
my aunt counts on it year after year
she turns the house upside down for us she invites our special friendsshe scarcely knows frieda and we can't leave her on her hands
i missed one day and she would be so hurt if i didn't stay the full ten
but i'll say a word to her
don't you bother
henry i won't go
don't bully me
you want to see the house though
very muchi've heard so much about it one way or the other
aren't there pigs' teeth in the wychelm
pigs' teeth
and you chew the bark for toothache
what a rum notion
of course not
perhaps i have confused it with some other tree
there are still a great number of sacred trees in england it seems
but he left her to intercept mrs munt whose voice could be heard in the distance to be intercepted himself by helen
oh mr wilcox about the porphyrion she began and went scarlet all over her face
it's all right called margaret catching them up
dempster's bank's better
but i think you told us the porphyrion was bad and would smash before christmas
did i
it was still outside the tariff ring and had to take rotten policies
lately it came insafe as houses now
in other words mr bast need never have left it
no the fellow needn't
and needn't have started life elsewhere at a greatly reduced salary
he only says 'reduced' corrected margaret seeing trouble ahead
with a man so poor every reduction must be great
i consider it a deplorable misfortune
mr wilcox intent on his business with mrs munt was going steadily on but the last remark made him say what
what's that
do you mean that i'm responsible
you're ridiculous helen
you seem to think he looked at his watch
let me explain the point to you
it is like this
you seem to assume when a business concern is conducting a delicate negotiation it ought to keep the public informed stage by stage
the porphyrion according to you was bound to say 'i am trying all i can to get into the tariff ring
i am not sure that i shall succeed but it is the only thing that will save me from insolvency and i am trying'
my dear helen  is that your point
a man who had little money has lessthat's mine
i am grieved for your clerk
but it is all in the day's work
it's part of the battle of life
a man who had little money she repeated has less owing to us
under these circumstances i do not consider 'the battle of life' a happy expression
oh come come
he protested pleasantly
you're not to blame
no one's to blame
is no one to blame for anything
i wouldn't say that but you're taking it far too seriously
who is this fellow
we have told you about the fellow twice already said helen
you have even met the fellow
he is very poor and his wife is an extravagant imbecile
he is capable of better things
wewe the upper classesthought we would help him from the height of our superior knowledgeand here's the result
he raised his finger
now a word of advice
i require no more advice
a word of advice
don't take up that sentimental attitude over the poor
see that she doesn't margaret
the poor are poor and one's sorry for them but there it is
as civilization moves forward the shoe is bound to pinch in places and it's absurd to pretend that anyone is responsible personally
neither you nor i nor my informant nor the man who informed him nor the directors of the porphyrion are to blame for this clerk's loss of salary
it's just the shoe pinchingno one can help it and it might easily have been worse
helen quivered with indignation
by all means subscribe to charitiessubscribe to them largelybut don't get carried away by absurd schemes of social reform
i see a good deal behind the scenes and you can take it from me that there is no social questionexcept for a few journalists who try to get a living out of the phrase
there are just rich and poor as there always have been and always will be
point me out a time when men have been equal  i didn't say  point me out a time when desire for equality has made them happier
no no
you can't
there always have been rich and poor
i'm no fatalist
heaven forbid
but our civilization is moulded by great impersonal forces his voice grew complacent it always did when he eliminated the personal and there always will be rich and poor
you can't deny it and now it was a respectful voiceand you can't deny that in spite of all the tendency of civilization has on the whole been upward
owing to god i suppose flashed helen
he stared at her
you grab the dollars
god does the rest
it was no good instructing the girl if she was going to talk about god in that neurotic modern way
fraternal to the last he left her for the quieter company of mrs munt
he thought she rather reminds me of dolly
helen looked out at the sea
don't even discuss political economy with henry advised her sister
it'll only end in a cry
but he must be one of those men who have reconciled science with religion said helen slowly
i don't like those men
they are scientific themselves and talk of the survival of the fittest and cut down the salaries of their clerks and stunt the independence of all who may menace their comfort but yet they believe that somehow goodand it is always that sloppy 'somehow'will be the outcome and that in some mystical way the mr basts of the future will benefit because the mr basts of today are in pain
he is such a man in theory
but oh helen in theory
but oh meg what a theory
why should you put things so bitterly dearie
because i'm an old maid said helen biting her lip
i can't think why i go on like this myself
she shook off her sister's hand and went into the house
margaret distressed at the day's beginning followed the bournemouth steamer with her eyes
she saw that helen's nerves were exasperated by the unlucky bast business beyond the bounds of politeness
there might at any minute be a real explosion which even henry would notice
henry must be removed
margaret
her aunt called
magsy
it isn't true surely what mr wilcox says that you want to go away early next week
not 'want' was margaret's prompt reply but there is so much to be settled and i do want to see the charles'
but going away without taking the weymouth trip or even the lulworth
said mrs munt coming nearer
without going once more up nine barrows down
i'm afraid so
mr wilcox rejoined her with good
i did the breaking of the ice
a wave of tenderness came over her
she put a hand on either shoulder and looked deeply into the black bright eyes
what was behind their competent stare
she knew but was not disquieted
chapter   margaret had no intention of letting things slide and the evening before she left swanage she gave her sister a thorough scolding
she censured her not for disapproving of the engagement but for throwing over her disapproval a veil of mystery
helen was equally frank
yes she said with the air of one looking inwards there is a mystery
i can't help it
it's not my fault
it's the way life has been made
helen in those days was overinterested in the subconscious self
she exaggerated the punch and judy aspect of life and spoke of mankind as puppets whom an invisible showman twitches into love and war
margaret pointed out that if she dwelt on this she too would eliminate the personal
helen was silent for a minute and then burst into a queer speech which cleared the air
go on and marry him
i think you're splendid and if anyone can pull it off you will
margaret denied that there was anything to pull off but she continued yes there is and i wasn't up to it with paul
i can only do what's easy
i can only entice and be enticed
i can't and won't attempt difficult relations
if i marry it will either be a man who's strong enough to boss me or whom i'm strong enough to boss
so i shan't ever marry for there aren't such men
and heaven help any one whom i do marry for i shall certainly run away from him before you can say 'jack robinson'
there
because i'm uneducated
but you you're different you're a heroine
oh helen
am i
will it be as dreadful for poor henry as all that
you mean to keep proportion and that's heroic it's greek and i don't see why it shouldn't succeed with you
go on and fight with him and help him
don't ask me for help or even for sympathy
henceforward i'm going my own way
i mean to be thorough because thoroughness is easy
i mean to dislike your husband and to tell him so
i mean to make no concessions to tibby
if tibby wants to live with me he must lump me
i mean to love you more than ever
yes i do
you and i have built up something real because it is purely spiritual
there's no veil of mystery over us
unreality and mystery begin as soon as one touches the body
the popular view is as usual exactly the wrong one
our bothers are over tangible thingsmoney husbands househunting
but heaven will work of itself
margaret was grateful for this expression of affection and answered perhaps
all vistas close in the unseenno one doubts itbut helen closed them rather too quickly for her taste
at every turn of speech one was confronted with reality and the absolute
perhaps margaret grew too old for metaphysics perhaps henry was weaning her from them but she felt that there was something a little unbalanced in the mind that so readily shreds the visible
the business man who assumes that this life is everything and the mystic who asserts that it is nothing fail on this side and on that to hit the truth
yes i see dear it's about halfway between aunt juley had hazarded in earlier years
no truth being alive was not halfway between anything
it was only to be found by continuous excursions into either realm and though proportion is the final secret to espouse it at the outset is to insure sterility
helen agreeing here disagreeing there would have talked till midnight but margaret with her packing to do focussed the conversation on henry
she might abuse henry behind his back but please would she always be civil to him in company
i definitely dislike him but i'll do what i can promised helen
do what you can with my friends in return
this conversation made margaret easier
their inner life was so safe that they could bargain over externals in a way that would have been incredible to aunt juley and impossible for tibby or charles
there are moments when the inner life actually pays when years of selfscrutiny conducted for no ulterior motive are suddenly of practical use
such moments are still rare in the west that they come at all promises a fairer future
margaret though unable to understand her sister was assured against estrangement and returned to london with a more peaceful mind
the following morning at eleven o'clock she presented herself at the offices of the imperial and west african rubber company
she was glad to go there for henry had implied his business rather than described it and the formlessness and vagueness that one associates with africa had hitherto brooded over the main sources of his wealth
not that a visit to the office cleared things up
there was just the ordinary surface scum of ledgers and polished counters and brass bars that began and stopped for no possible reason of electriclight globes blossoming in triplets of little rabbit hutches faced with glass or wire of little rabbits
and even when she penetrated to the inner depths she found only the ordinary table and turkey carpet and though the map over the fireplace did depict a helping of west africa it was a very ordinary map
another map hung opposite on which the whole continent appeared looking like a whale marked out for blubber and by its side was a door shut but henry's voice came through it dictating a strong letter
she might have been at the porphyrion or dempster's bank or her own winemerchant's
everything seems just alike in these days
but perhaps she was seeing the imperial side of the company rather than its west african and imperialism always had been one of her difficulties
one minute
called mr wilcox on receiving her name
he touched a bell the effect of which was to produce charles
charles had written his father an adequate lettermore adequate than evie's through which a girlish indignation throbbed
and he greeted his future stepmother with propriety
i hope that my wifehow do you do
will give you a decent lunch was his opening
i left instructions but we live in a roughandready way
she expects you back to tea too after you have had a look at howards end
i wonder what you'll think of the place
i wouldn't touch it with tongs myself
do sit down
it's a measly little place
i shall enjoy seeing it said margaret feeling for the first time shy
you'll see it at its worst for bryce decamped abroad last monday without even arranging for a charwoman to clear up after him
i never saw such a disgraceful mess
it's unbelievable
he wasn't in the house a month
i've more than a little bone to pick with bryce called henry from the inner chamber
why did he go so suddenly
invalid type couldn't sleep
poor fellow
poor fiddlesticks
said mr wilcox joining them
he had the impudence to put up noticeboards without as much as saying with your leave or by your leave
charles flung them down
yes i flung them down said charles modestly
i've sent a telegram after him and a pretty sharp one too
he and he in person is responsible for the upkeep of that house for the next three years
the keys are at the farm we wouldn't have the keys
quite right
dolly would have taken them but i was in fortunately
what's mr bryce like
asked margaret
but nobody cared
mr bryce was the tenant who had no right to sublet to have defined him further was a waste of time
on his misdeeds they descanted profusely until the girl who had been typing the strong letter came out with it
mr wilcox added his signature
now we'll be off said he
a motordrive a form of felicity detested by margaret awaited her
charles saw them in civil to the last and in a moment the offices of the imperial and west african rubber company faded away
but it was not an impressive drive
perhaps the weather was to blame being grey and banked high with weary clouds
perhaps hertfordshire is scarcely intended for motorists
did not a gentleman once motor so quickly through westmoreland that he missed it
and if westmoreland can be missed it will fare ill with a county whose delicate structure particularly needs the attentive eye
hertfordshire is england at its quietest with little emphasis of river and hill it is england meditative
if drayton were with us again to write a new edition of his incomparable poem he would sing the nymphs of hertfordshire as indeterminate of feature with hair obfuscated by the london smoke
their eyes would be sad and averted from their fate towards the northern flats their leader not isis or sabrina but the slowly flowing lea
no glory of raiment would be theirs no urgency of dance but they would be real nymphs
the chauffeur could not travel as quickly as he had hoped for the great north road was full of easter traffic
but he went quite quick enough for margaret a poorspirited creature who had chickens and children on the brain
they're all right said mr wilcox
they'll learnlike the swallows and the telegraphwires
yes but while they're learning  the motor's come to stay he answered
one must get about
there's a pretty churchoh you aren't sharp enough
well look out if the road worries youright outward at the scenery 
she looked at the scenery
it heaved and merged like porridge
presently it congealed
they had arrived
charles's house on the left on the right the swelling forms of the six hills
their appearance in such a neighbourhood surprised her
they interrupted the stream of residences that was thickening up towards hilton
beyond them she saw meadows and a wood and beneath them she settled that soldiers of the best kind lay buried
she hated war and liked soldiersit was one of her amiable inconsistencies
but here was dolly dressed up to the nines standing at the door to greet them and here were the first drops of the rain
they ran in gaily and after a long wait in the drawingroom sat down to the roughandready lunch every dish in which concealed or exuded cream
mr bryce was the chief topic of conversation
dolly described his visit with the key while her fatherinlaw gave satisfaction by chaffing her and contradicting all she said
it was evidently the custom to laugh at dolly
he chaffed margaret too and margaret roused from a grave meditation was pleased and chaffed him back
dolly seemed surprised and eyed her curiously
after lunch the two children came down
margaret disliked babies but hit it off better with the twoyearold and sent dolly into fits of laughter by talking sense to him
kiss them now and come away said mr wilcox
she came but refused to kiss them it was such hard luck on the little things she said and though dolly proffered chorlyworly and porglywoggles in turn she was obdurate
by this time it was raining steadily
the car came round with the hood up and again she lost all sense of space
in a few minutes they stopped and crane opened the door of the car
what's happened
asked margaret
what do you suppose
said henry
a little porch was close up against her face
are we there already
we are
well i never
in years ago it seemed so far away
smiling but somehow disillusioned she jumped out and her impetus carried her to the frontdoor
she was about to open it when henry said that's no good it's locked
who's got the key
as he had himself forgotten to call for the key at the farm no one replied
he also wanted to know who had left the front gate open since a cow had strayed in from the road and was spoiling the croquet lawn
then he said rather crossly margaret you wait in the dry
i'll go down for the key
it isn't a hundred yards
mayn't i come too
no i shall be back before i'm gone
then the car turned away and it was as if a curtain had risen
for the second time that day she saw the appearance of the earth
there were the greengagetrees that helen had once described there the tennis lawn there the hedge that would be glorious with dogroses in june but the vision now was of black and palest green
down by the dellhole more vivid colours were awakening and lent lilies stood sentinel on its margin or advanced in battalions over the grass
tulips were a tray of jewels
she could not see the wychelm tree but a branch of the celebrated vine studded with velvet knobs had covered the porch
she was struck by the fertility of the soil she had seldom been in a garden where the flowers looked so well and even the weeds she was idly plucking out of the porch were intensely green
why had poor mr bryce fled from all this beauty
for she had already decided that the place was beautiful
naughty cow
go away
cried margaret to the cow but without indignation
harder came the rain pouring out of a windless sky and spattering up from the noticeboards of the houseagents which lay in a row on the lawn where charles had hurled them
she must have interviewed charles in another worldwhere one did have interviews
how helen would revel in such a notion
charles dead all people dead nothing alive but houses and gardens
the obvious dead the intangible alive andno connection at all between them
margaret smiled
would that her own fancies were as clearcut
would that she could deal as highhandedly with the world
smiling and sighing she laid her hand upon the door
it opened
the house was not locked up at all
she hesitated
ought she to wait for henry
he felt strongly about property and might prefer to show her over himself
on the other hand he had told her to keep in the dry and the porch was beginning to drip
so she went in and the drought from inside slammed the door behind
desolation greeted her
dirty fingerprints were on the hallwindows flue and rubbish on its unwashed boards
the civilization of luggage had been here for a month and then decamped
diningroom and drawing roomright and leftwere guessed only by their wallpapers
they were just rooms where one could shelter from the rain
across the ceiling of each ran a great beam
the diningroom and hall revealed theirs openly but the drawingroom's was matchboardedbecause the facts of life must be concealed from ladies
drawingroom diningroom and hallhow petty the names sounded
here were simply three rooms where children could play and friends shelter from the rain
yes and they were beautiful
then she opened one of the doors oppositethere were twoand exchanged wallpapers for whitewash
it was the servants' part though she scarcely realized that just rooms again where friends might shelter
the garden at the back was full of flowering cherries and plums
farther on were hints of the meadow and a black cliff of pines
yes the meadow was beautiful
penned in by the desolate weather she recaptured the sense of space which the motor had tried to rob from her
she remembered again that ten square miles are not ten times as wonderful as one square mile that a thousand square miles are not practically the same as heaven
the phantom of bigness which london encourages was laid for ever when she paced from the hall at howards end to its kitchen and heard the rains run this way and that where the watershed of the roof divided them
now helen came to her mind scrutinizing half wessex from the ridge of the purbeck downs and saying you will have to lose something
she was not so sure
for instance she would double her kingdom by opening the door that concealed the stairs
now she thought of the map of africa of empires of her father of the two supreme nations streams of whose life warmed her blood but mingling had cooled her brain
she paced back into the hall and as she did so the house reverberated
is that you henry
she called
there was no answer but the house reverberated again
henry have you got in
but it was the heart of the house beating faintly at first then loudly martially
it dominated the rain
it is the starved imagination not the wellnourished that is afraid
margaret flung open the door to the stairs
a noise as of drums seemed to deafen her
a woman an old woman was descending with figure erect with face impassive with lips that parted and said dryly  oh
well i took you for ruth wilcox
margaret stammered imrs
wilcoxi
in fancy of coursein fancy
you had her way of walking
goodday
and the old woman passed out into the rain
chapter   it gave her quite a turn said mr wilcox when retailing the incident to dolly at teatime
none of you girls have any nerves really
of course a word from me put it all right but silly old miss averyshe frightened you didn't she margaret
there you stood clutching a bunch of weeds
she might have said something instead of coming down the stairs with that alarming bonnet on
i passed her as i came in
enough to make the car shy
i believe miss avery goes in for being a character some old maids do
he lit a cigarette
it is their last resource
heaven knows what she was doing in the place but that's bryce's business not mine
i wasn't as foolish as you suggest said margaret
she only startled me for the house had been silent so long
did you take her for a spook
asked dolly for whom spooks and going to church summarized the unseen
not exactly
she really did frighten you said henry who was far from discouraging timidity in females
poor margaret
and very naturally
uneducated classes are so stupid
is miss avery uneducated classes
margaret asked and found herself looking at the decoration scheme of dolly's drawingroom
she's just one of the crew at the farm
people like that always assume things
she assumed you'd know who she was
she left all the howards end keys in the front lobby and assumed that you'd seen them as you came in that you'd lock up the house when you'd done and would bring them on down to her
and there was her niece hunting for them down at the farm
lack of education makes people very casual
hilton was full of women like miss avery once
i shouldn't have disliked it perhaps
or miss avery giving me a wedding present said dolly
which was illogical but interesting
through dolly margaret was destined to learn a good deal
but charles said i must try not to mind because she had known his grandmother
as usual you've got the story wrong my good dorothea
i mean greatgrandmotherthe one who left mrs wilcox the house
weren't both of them and miss avery friends when howards end too was a farm
her fatherinlaw blew out a shaft of smoke
his attitude to his dead wife was curious
he would allude to her and hear her discussed but never mentioned her by name
nor was he interested in the dim bucolic past
dolly wasfor the following reason
then hadn't mrs wilcox a brotheror was it an uncle
anyhow he popped the question and miss avery she said 'no'
just imagine if she'd said 'yes' she would have been charles's aunt
oh i saythat's rather good
'charlie's aunt'
i must chaff him about that this evening
and the man went out and was killed
yes i'm certain i've got it right now
tom howardhe was the last of them
i believe so said mr wilcox negligently
i say
howards endhoward's ended
cried dolly
i'm rather on the spot this evening eh
i wish you'd ask whether crane's ended
oh mr wilcox how can you
because if he has had enough tea we ought to godolly's a good little woman he continued but a little of her goes a long way
i couldn't live near her if you paid me
margaret smiled
though presenting a firm front to outsiders no wilcox could live near or near the possessions of any other wilcox
they had the colonial spirit and were always making for some spot where the white man might carry his burden unobserved
of course howards end was impossible so long as the younger couple were established in hilton
his objections to the house were plain as daylight now
crane had had enough tea and was sent to the garage where their car had been trickling muddy water over charles's
the downpour had surely penetrated the six hills by now bringing news of our restless civilization
curious mounds said henry but in with you now another time
he had to be up in london by sevenif possible by sixthirty
once more she lost the sense of space once more trees houses people animals hills merged and heaved into one dirtiness and she was at wickham place
her evening was pleasant
the sense of flux which had haunted her all the year disappeared for a time
she forgot the luggage and the motorcars and the hurrying men who know so much and connect so little
she recaptured the sense of space which is the basis of all earthly beauty and starting from howards end she attempted to realize england
she failedvisions do not come when we try though they may come through trying
but an unexpected love of the island awoke in her connecting on this side with the joys of the flesh on that with the inconceivable
helen and her father had known this love poor leonard bast was groping after it but it had been hidden from margaret till this afternoon
it had certainly come through the house and old miss avery
through them the notion of through persisted her mind trembled towards a conclusion which only the unwise have put into words
then veering back into warmth it dwelt on ruddy bricks flowering plumtrees and all the tangible joys of spring
henry after allaying her agitation had taken her over his property and had explained to her the use and dimensions of the various rooms
he had sketched the history of the little estate
it is so unlucky ran the monologue that money wasn't put into it about fifty years ago
then it had fourfivetimes the landthirty acres at least
one could have made something out of it thena small park or at all events shrubberies and rebuilt the house farther away from the road
what's the good of taking it in hand now
nothing but the meadow left and even that was heavily mortgaged when i first had to do with thingsyes and the house too
oh it was no joke
she saw two women as he spoke one old the other young watching their inheritance melt away
she saw them greet him as a deliverer
mismanagement did itbesides the days for small farms are over
it doesn't payexcept with intensive cultivation
small holdings back to the landah
philanthropic bunkum
take it as a rule that nothing pays on a small scale
most of the land you see they were standing at an upper window the only one which faced west belongs to the people at the parkthey made their pile over coppergood chaps
avery's farm sishe'swhat they call the common where you see that ruined oakone after the other fell in and so did this as near as is no matter
but henry had saved it without fine feelings or deep insight but he had saved it and she loved him for the deed
when i had more control i did what i could sold off the two and a half animals and the mangy pony and the superannuated tools pulled down the outhouses drained thinned out i don't know how many guelderroses and eldertrees and inside the house i turned the old kitchen into a hall and made a kitchen behind where the dairy was
garage and so on came later
but one could still tell it's been an old farm
and yet it isn't the place that would fetch one of your artistic crew
no it wasn't and if he did not quite understand it the artistic crew would still less it was english and the wychelm that she saw from the window was an english tree
no report had prepared her for its peculiar glory
it was neither warrior nor lover nor god in none of these roles do the english excel
it was a comrade bending over the house strength and adventure in its roots but in its utmost fingers tenderness and the girth that a dozen men could not have spanned became in the end evanescent till pale bud clusters seemed to float in the air
it was a comrade
house and tree transcended any similes of sex
margaret thought of them now and was to think of them through many a windy night and london day but to compare either to man to woman always dwarfed the vision
yet they kept within limits of the human
their message was not of eternity but of hope on this side of the grave
as she stood in the one gazing at the other truer relationship had gleamed
another touch and the account of her day is finished
they entered the garden for a minute and to mr wilcox's surprise she was right
teeth pigs' teeth could be seen in the bark of the wychelm treejust the white tips of them showing
extraordinary
he cried
who told you
i heard of it one winter in london was her answer for she too avoided mentioning mrs wilcox by name
chapter   evie heard of her father's engagement when she was in for a tennis tournament and her play went simply to pot
that she should marry and leave him had seemed natural enough that he left alone should do the same was deceitful and now charles and dolly said that it was all her fault
but i never dreamt of such a thing she grumbled
dad took me to call now and then and made me ask her to simpson's
well i'm altogether off dad
it was also an insult to their mother's memory there they were agreed and evie had the idea of returning mrs wilcox's lace and jewellery as a protest
against what it would protest she was not clear but being only eighteen the idea of renunciation appealed to her the more as she did not care for jewellery or lace
dolly then suggested that she and uncle percy should pretend to break off their engagement and then perhaps mr wilcox would quarrel with miss schlegel and break off his or paul might be cabled for
but at this point charles told them not to talk nonsense
so evie settled to marry as soon as possible it was no good hanging about with these schlegels eyeing her
the date of her wedding was consequently put forward from september to august and in the intoxication of presents she recovered much of her goodhumour
margaret found that she was expected to figure at this function and to figure largely it would be such an opportunity said henry for her to get to know his set
sir james bidder would be there and all the cahills and the fussells and his sisterinlaw mrs warrington wilcox had fortunately got back from her tour round the world
henry she loved but his set promised to be another matter
he had not the knack of surrounding himself with nice peopleindeed for a man of ability and virtue his choice had been singularly unfortunate he had no guiding principle beyond a certain preference for mediocrity he was content to settle one of the greatest things in life haphazard and so while his investments went right his friends generally went wrong
she would be told oh soandso's a good sorta thundering good sort and find on meeting him that he was a brute or a bore
if henry had shown real affection she would have understood for affection explains everything
but he seemed without sentiment
the thundering good sort might at any moment become a fellow for whom i never did have much use and have less now and be shaken off cheerily into oblivion
margaret had done the same as a schoolgirl
now she never forgot anyone for whom she had once cared she connected though the connection might be bitter and she hoped that some day henry would do the same
evie was not to be married from ducie street
she had a fancy for something rural and besides no one would be in london then so she left her boxes for a few weeks at oniton grange and her banns were duly published in the parish church and for a couple of days the little town dreaming between the ruddy hills was roused by the clang of our civilization and drew up by the roadside to let the motors pass
oniton had been a discovery of mr wilcox'sa discovery of which he was not altogether proud
it was up towards the welsh border and so difficult of access that he had concluded it must be something special
a ruined castle stood in the grounds
but having got there what was one to do
the shooting was bad the fishing indifferent and womenfolk reported the scenery as nothing much
the place turned out to be in the wrong part of shropshire damn it and though he never damned his own property aloud he was only waiting to get it off his hands and then to let fly
evie's marriage was its last appearance in public
as soon as a tenant was found it became a house for which he never had had much use and had less now and like howards end faded into limbo
but on margaret oniton was destined to make a lasting impression
she regarded it as her future home and was anxious to start straight with the clergy etc and if possible to see something of the local life
it was a markettownas tiny a one as england possessesand had for ages served that lonely valley and guarded our marches against the kelt
in spite of the occasion in spite of the numbing hilarity that greeted her as soon as she got into the reserved saloon at paddington her senses were awake and watching and though oniton was to prove one of her innumerable false starts she never forgot it nor the things that happened there
the london party only numbered eightthe fussells father and son two angloindian ladies named mrs plynlimmon and lady edser mrs warrington wilcox and her daughter and lastly the little girl very smart and quiet who figures at so many weddings and who kept a watchful eye on margaret the brideelect dolly was absenta domestic event detained her at hilton paul had cabled a humorous message charles was to meet them with a trio of motors at shrewsbury
helen had refused her invitation tibby had never answered his
the management was excellent as was to be expected with anything that henry undertook one was conscious of his sensible and generous brain in the background
they were his guests as soon as they reached the train a special label for their luggage a courier a special lunch they had only to look pleasant and where possible pretty
margaret thought with dismay of her own nuptialspresumably under the management of tibby
mr theobald schlegel and miss helen schlegel request the pleasure of mrs plynlimmon's company on the occasion of the marriage of their sister margaret
the formula was incredible but it must soon be printed and sent and though wickham place need not compete with oniton it must feed its guests properly and provide them with sufficient chairs
her wedding would either be ramshackly or bourgeoisshe hoped the latter
such an affair as the present staged with a deftness that was almost beautiful lay beyond her powers and those of her friends
the low rich purr of a great western express is not the worst background for conversation and the journey passed pleasantly enough
nothing could have exceeded the kindness of the two men
they raised windows for some ladies and lowered them for others they rang the bell for the servant they identified the colleges as the train slipped past oxford they caught books or bagpurses in the act of tumbling on to the floor
yet there was nothing finicky about their politeness it had the public school touch and though sedulous was virile
more battles than waterloo have been won on our playingfields and margaret bowed to a charm of which she did not wholly approve and said nothing when the oxford colleges were identified wrongly
male and female created he them the journey to shrewsbury confirmed this questionable statement and the long glass saloon that moved so easily and felt so comfortable became a forcinghouse for the idea of sex
at shrewsbury came fresh air
margaret was all for sightseeing and while the others were finishing their tea at the raven she annexed a motor and hurried over the astonishing city
her chauffeur was not the faithful crane but an italian who dearly loved making her late
charles watch in hand though with a level brow was standing in front of the hotel when they returned
it was perfectly all right he told her she was by no means the last
and then he dived into the coffeeroom and she heard him say for god's sake hurry the women up we shall never be off and albert fussell reply not i i've done my share and colonel fussell opine that the ladies were getting themselves up to kill
presently myra mrs warrington's daughter appeared and as she was his cousin charles blew her up a little she had been changing her smart traveling hat for a smart motor hat
then mrs warrington herself leading the quiet child the two angloindian ladies were always last
maids courier heavy luggage had already gone on by a branchline to a station nearer oniton but there were five hatboxes and four dressingbags to be packed and five dustcloaks to be put on and to be put off at the last moment because charles declared them not necessary
the men presided over everything with unfailing goodhumour
by halfpast five the party was ready and went out of shrewsbury by the welsh bridge
shropshire had not the reticence of hertfordshire
though robbed of half its magic by swift movement it still conveyed the sense of hills
they were nearing the buttresses that force the severn eastern and make it an english stream and the sun sinking over the sentinels of wales was straight in their eyes
having picked up another guest they turned southward avoiding the greater mountains but conscious of an occasional summit rounded and mild whose colouring differed in quality from that of the lower earth and whose contours altered more slowly
quiet mysteries were in progress behind those tossing horizons the west as ever was retreating with some secret which may not be worth the discovery but which no practical man will ever discover
they spoke of tariff reform
mrs warrington was just back from the colonies
like many other critics of empire her mouth had been stopped with food and she could only exclaim at the hospitality with which she had been received and warn the mother country against trifling with young titans
they threaten to cut the painter she cried and where shall we be then
miss schlegel you'll undertake to keep henry sound about tariff reform
it is our last hope
margaret playfully confessed herself on the other side and they began to quote from their respective handbooks while the motor carried them deep into the hills
curious these were rather than impressive for their outlines lacked beauty and the pink fieldson their summits suggested the handkerchiefs of a giant spread out to dry
an occasional outcrop of rock an occasional wood an occasional forest treeless and brown all hinted at wildness to follow but the main colour was an agricultural green
the air grew cooler they had surmounted the last gradient and oniton lay below them with its church its radiating houses its castle its rivergirt peninsula
close to the castle was a grey mansion unintellectual but kindly stretching with its grounds across the peninsula's neckthe sort of mansion that was built all over england in the beginning of the last century while architecture was still an expression of the national character
that was the grange remarked albert over his shoulder and then he jammed the brake on and the motor slowed down and stopped
i'm sorry said he turning round
do you mind getting outby the door on the right
steady on
what's happened
asked mrs warrington
then the car behind them drew up and the voice of charles was heard saying get out the women at once
there was a concourse of males and margaret and her companions were hustled out and received into the second car
what had happened
as it started off again the door of a cottage opened and a girl screamed wildly at them
what is it
the ladies cried
charles drove them a hundred yards without speaking
then he said it's all right
your car just touched a dog
but stop
cried margaret horrified
it didn't hurt him
didn't really hurt him
asked myra
no
do please stop
said margaret leaning forward
she was standing up in the car the other occupants holding her knees to steady her
i want to go back please
charles took no notice
we've left mr fussell behind said another and angelo and crane
yes but no woman
i expect a little ofmrs warrington scratched her palm will be more to the point than one of us
the insurance company sees to that remarked charles and albert will do the talking
i want to go back though i say
repeated margaret getting angry
charles took no notice
the motor loaded with refugees continued to travel very slowly down the hill
the men are there chorused the others
men will see to it
the men can't see to it
oh this is ridiculous
charles i ask you to stop
stopping's no good drawled charles
isn't it
said margaret and jumped straight out of the car
she fell on her knees cut her gloves shook her hat over her ear
cries of alarm followed her
you've hurt yourself exclaimed charles jumping after her
of course i've hurt myself
she retorted
may i ask what  there's nothing to ask said margaret
your hand's bleeding
i know
i'm in for a frightful row from the pater
you should have thought of that sooner charles
charles had never been in such a position before
it was a woman in revolt who was hobbling away from him and the sight was too strange to leave any room for anger
he recovered himself when the others caught them up their sort he understood
he commanded them to go back
albert fussell was seen walking towards them
it's all right
he called
it wasn't a dog it was a cat
there
exclaimed charles triumphantly
it's only a rotten cat
got room in your car for a little un
i cut as soon as i saw it wasn't a dog the chauffeurs are tackling the girl
but margaret walked forward steadily
why should the chauffeurs tackle the girl
ladies sheltering behind men men sheltering behind servantsthe whole system's wrong and she must challenge it
miss schlegel
'pon my word you've hurt your hand
i'm just going to see said margaret
don't you wait mr
fussell
the second motor came round the corner
lt is all right madam said crane in his turn
he had taken to calling her madam
what's all right
the cat
yes madam
the girl will receive compensation for it
she was a very ruda girla said angelo from the third motor thoughtfully
wouldn't you have been rude
the italian spread out his hands implying that he had not thought of rudeness but would produce it if it pleased her
the situation became absurd
the gentlemen were again buzzing round miss schlegel with offers of assistance and lady edser began to bind up her hand
she yielded apologizing slightly and was led back to the car and soon the landscape resumed its motion the lonely cottage disappeared the castle swelled on its cushion of turf and they had arrived
no doubt she had disgraced herself
but she felt their whole journey from london had been unreal
they had no part with the earth and its emotions
they were dust and a stink and cosmopolitan chatter and the girl whose cat had been killed had lived more deeply than they
oh henry she exclaimed i have been so naughty for she had decided to take up this line
we ran over a cat
charles told me not to jump out but i would and look
she held out her bandaged hand
your poor meg went such a flop
mr wilcox looked bewildered
in evening dress he was standing to welcome his guests in the hall
thinking it was a dog added mrs warrington
ah a dog's a companion
said colonel fussell
a dog'll remember you
have you hurt yourself margaret
not to speak about and it's my left hand
well hurry up and change
she obeyed as did the others
mr wilcox then turned to his son
now charles what's happened
charles was absolutely honest
he described what he believed to have happened
albert had flattened out a cat and miss schlegel had lost her nerve as any woman might
she had been got safely into the other car but when it was in motion had leapt outagain in spite of all that they could say
after walking a little on the road she had calmed down and had said that she was sorry
his father accepted this explanation and neither knew that margaret had artfully prepared the way for it
it fitted in too well with their view of feminine nature
in the smokingroom after dinner the colonel put forward the view that miss schlegel had jumped it out of devilry
well he remembered as a young man in the harbour of gibraltar once how a girla handsome girl toohad jumped overboard for a bet
he could see her now and all the lads overboard after her
but charles and mr wilcox agreed it was much more probably nerves in miss schlegel's case
charles was depressed
that woman had a tongue
she would bring worse disgrace on his father before she had done with them
he strolled out on to the castle mound to think the matter over
the evening was exquisite
on three sides of him a little river whispered full of messages from the west above his head the ruins made patterns against the sky
he carefully reviewed their dealings with this family until he fitted helen and margaret and aunt juley into an orderly conspiracy
paternity had made him suspicious
he had two children to look after and more coming and day by day they seemed less likely to grow up rich men
it is all very well he reflected the pater saying that he will be just to all but one can't be just indefinitely
money isn't elastic
what's to happen if evie has a family
and come to that so may the pater
there'll not be enough to go round for there's none coming in either through dolly or percy
it's damnable
he looked enviously at the grange whose windows poured light and laughter
first and last this wedding would cost a pretty penny
two ladies were strolling up and down the garden terrace and as the syllables imperialism were wafted to his ears he guessed that one of them was his aunt
she might have helped him if she too had not had a family to provide for
every one for himself he repeateda maxim which had cheered him in the past but which rang grimly enough among the ruins of oniton
he lacked his father's ability in business and so had an ever higher regard for money unless he could inherit plenty he feared to leave his children poor
as he sat thinking one of the ladies left the terrace and walked into the meadow he recognized her as margaret by the white bandage that gleamed on her arm and put out his cigar lest the gleam should betray him
she climbed up the mound in zigzags and at times stooped down as if she was stroking the turf
it sounds absolutely incredible but for a moment charles thought that she was in love with him and had come out to tempt him
charles believed in temptresses who are indeed the strong man's necessary complement and having no sense of humour he could not purge himself of the thought by a smile
margaret who was engaged to his father and his sister's weddingguest kept on her way without noticing him and he admitted that he had wronged her on this point
but what was she doing
why was she stumbling about amongst the rubble and catching her dress in brambles and burrs
as she edged round the keep she must have got to leeward and smelt his cigarsmoke for she exclaimed hullo
who's that
charles made no answer
saxon or kelt
she continued laughing in the darkness
but it doesn't matter
whichever you are you will have to listen to me
i love this place
i love shropshire
i hate london
i am glad that this will be my home
ah dearshe was now moving back towards the housewhat a comfort to have arrived
that woman means mischief thought charles and compressed his lips
in a few minutes he followed her indoors as the ground was getting damp
mists were rising from the river and presently it became invisible though it whispered more loudly
there had been a heavy downpour in the welsh hills
chapter   next morning a fine mist covered the peninsula
the weather promised well and the outline of the castle mound grew clearer each moment that margaret watched it
presently she saw the keep and the sun painted the rubble gold and charged the white sky with blue
the shadow of the house gathered itself together and fell over the garden
a cat looked up at her window and mewed
lastly the river appeared still holding the mists between its banks and its overhanging alders and only visible as far as a hill which cut off its upper reaches
margaret was fascinated by oniton
she had said that she loved it but it was rather its romantic tension that held her
the rounded druids of whom she had caught glimpses in her drive the rivers hurrying down from them to england the carelessly modelled masses of the lower hills thrilled her with poetry
the house was insignificant but the prospect from it would be an eternal joy and she thought of all the friends she would have to stop in it and of the conversion of henry himself to a rural life
society too promised favourably
the rector of the parish had dined with them last night and she found that he was a friend of her father's and so knew what to find in her
she liked him
he would introduce her to the town
while on her other side sir james bidder sat repeating that she only had to give the word and he would whip up the county families for twenty miles round
whether sir james who was garden seeds had promised what he could perform she doubted but so long as henry mistook them for the county families when they did call she was content
charles and albert fussell now crossed the lawn
they were going for a morning dip and a servant followed them with their bathingdresses
she had meant to take a stroll herself before breakfast but saw that the day was still sacred to men and amused herself by watching their contretemps
in the first place the key of the bathingshed could not be found
charles stood by the riverside with folded hands tragical while the servant shouted and was misunderstood by another servant in the garden
then came a difficulty about a springboard and soon three people were running backwards and forwards over the meadow with orders and counter orders and recriminations and apologies
if margaret wanted to jump from a motorcar she jumped if tibby thought paddling would benefit his ankles he paddled if a clerk desired adventure he took a walk in the dark
but these athletes seemed paralysed
they could not bathe without their appliances though the morning sun was calling and the last mists were rising from the dimpling stream
had they found the life of the body after all
could not the men whom they despised as milksops beat them even on their own ground
she thought of the bathing arrangements as they should be in her dayno worrying of servants no appliances beyond good sense
her reflections were disturbed by the quiet child who had come out to speak to the cat but was now watching her watch the men
she called goodmorning dear a little sharply
her voice spread consternation
charles looked round and though completely attired in indigo blue vanished into the shed and was seen no more
miss wilcox is up the child whispered and then became unintelligible
what's that
it sounded like cutyokesack back  i can't hear
on the bedtissuepaper  gathering that the weddingdress was on view and that a visit would be seemly she went to evie's room
all was hilarity here
evie in a petticoat was dancing with one of the angloindian ladies while the other was adoring yards of white satin
they screamed they laughed they sang and the dog barked
margaret screamed a little too but without conviction
she could not feel that a wedding was so funny
perhaps something was missing in her equipment
evie gasped dolly is a rotter not to be here
oh we would rag just then
then margaret went down to breakfast
henry was already installed he ate slowly and spoke little and was in margaret's eyes the only member of their party who dodged emotion successfully
she could not suppose him indifferent either to the loss of his daughter or to the presence of his future wife
yet he dwelt intact only issuing orders occasionallyorders that promoted the comfort of his guests
he inquired after her hand he set her to pour out the coffee and mrs warrington to pour out the tea
when evie came down there was a moment's awkwardness and both ladies rose to vacate their places
burton called henry serve tea and coffee from the sideboard
it wasn't genuine tact but it was tact of a sortthe sort that is as useful as the genuine and saves even more situations at board meetings
henry treated a marriage like a funeral item by item never raising his eyes to the whole and death where is thy sting
love where is thy victory
one would exclaim at the close
after breakfast she claimed a few words with him
it was always best to approach him formally
she asked for the interview because he was going on to shoot grouse tomorrow and she was returning to helen in town
certainly dear said he
of course i have the time
what do you want
nothing
i was afraid something had gone wrong
no i have nothing to say but you may talk
glancing at his watch he talked of the nasty curve at the lychgate
she heard him with interest
her surface could always respond to his without contempt though all her deeper being might be yearning to help him
she had abandoned any plan of action
love is the best and the more she let herself love him the more chance was there that he would set his soul in order
such a moment as this when they sat under fair weather by the walks of their future home was so sweet to her that its sweetness would surely pierce to him
each lift of his eyes each parting of the thatched lip from the cleanshaven must prelude the tenderness that kills the monk and the beast at a single blow
disappointed a hundred times she still hoped
she loved him with too clear a vision to fear his cloudiness
whether he droned trivialities as today or sprang kisses on her in the twilight she could pardon him she could respond
if there is this nasty curve she suggested couldn't we walk to the church
not of course you and evie but the rest of us might very well go on first and that would mean fewer carriages
one can't have ladies walking through the market square
the fussells wouldn't like it they were awfully particular at charles's wedding
mysheone of our party was anxious to walk and certainly the church was just round the corner and i shouldn't have minded but the colonel made a great point of it
you men shouldn't be so chivalrous said margaret thoughtfully
why not
she knew why not but said that she did not know
he then announced that unless she had anything special to say he must visit the winecellar and they went off together in search of burton
though clumsy and a little inconvenient oniton was a genuine country house
they clattered down flagged passages looking into room after room and scaring unknown maids from the performance of obscure duties
the weddingbreakfast must be in readiness when they came back from church and tea would be served in the garden
the sight of so many agitated and serious people made margaret smile but she reflected that they were paid to be serious and enjoyed being agitated
here were the lower wheels of the machine that was tossing evie up into nuptial glory
a little boy blocked their way with pigtails
his mind could not grasp their greatness and he said by your leave let me pass please
henry asked him where burton was
but the servants were so new that they did not know one another's names
in the stillroom sat the band who had stipulated for champagne as part of their fee and who were already drinking beer
scents of araby came from the kitchen mingled with cries
margaret knew what had happened there for it happened at wickham place
one of the wedding dishes had boiled over and the cook was throwing cedarshavings to hide the smell
at last they came upon the butler
henry gave him the keys and handed margaret down the cellarstairs
two doors were unlocked
she who kept all her wine at the bottom of the linencupboard was astonished at the sight
we shall never get through it
she cried and the two men were suddenly drawn into brotherhood and exchanged smiles
she felt as if she had again jumped out of the car while it was moving
certainly oniton would take some digesting
it would be no small business to remain herself and yet to assimilate such an establishment
she must remain herself for his sake as well as her own since a shadowy wife degrades the husband whom she accompanies and she must assimilate for reasons of common honesty since she had no right to marry a man and make him uncomfortable
her only ally was the power of home
the loss of wickham place had taught her more than its possession
howards end had repeated the lesson
she was determined to create new sanctities among these hills
after visiting the winecellar she dressed and then came the wedding which seemed a small affair when compared with the preparations for it
everything went like one o'clock
mr cahill materialized out of space and was waiting for his bride at the church door
no one dropped the ring or mispronounced the responses or trod on evie's train or cried
in a few minutesthe clergymen performed their duty the register was signed and they were back in their carriages negotiating the dangerous curve by the lychgate
margaret was convinced that they had not been married at all and that the norman church had been intent all the time on other business
there were more documents to sign at the house and the breakfast to eat and then a few more people dropped in for the garden party
there had been a great many refusals and after all it was not a very big affairnot as big as margaret's would be
she noted the dishes and the strips of red carpet that outwardly she might give henry what was proper
but inwardly she hoped for something better than this blend of sunday church and foxhunting
if only someone had been upset
but this wedding had gone off so particularly wellquite like a durbar in the opinion of lady edser and she thoroughly agreed with her
so the wasted day lumbered forward the bride and bridegroom drove off yelling with laughter and for the second time the sun retreated towards the hills of wales
henry who was more tired than he owned came up to her in the castle meadow and in tones of unusual softness said that he was pleased
everything had gone off so well
she felt that he was praising her too and blushed certainly she had done all she could with his intractable friends and had made a special point of kowtowing to the men
they were breaking camp this evening only the warringtons and quiet child would stay the night and the others were already moving towards the house to finish their packing
i think it did go off well she agreed
since i had to jump out of the motor i'm thankful i lighted on my left hand
i am so very glad about it henry dear i only hope that the guests at ours may be half as comfortable
you must all remember that we have no practical person among us except my aunt and she is not used to entertainments on a large scale
i know he said gravely
under the circumstances it would be better to put everything into the hands of harrod's or whiteley's or even to go to some hotel
you desire a hotel
yes becausewell i mustn't interfere with you
no doubt you want to be married from your old home
my old home's falling into pieces henry
i only want my new
isn't it a perfect evening  the alexandrina isn't bad  the alexandrina she echoed more occupied with the threads of smoke that were issuing from their chimneys and ruling the sunlit slopes with parallels of grey
it's off curzon street
is it
let's be married from off curzon street
then she turned westward to gaze at the swirling gold
just where the river rounded the hill the sun caught it
fairyland must lie above the bend and its precious liquid was pouring towards them past charles's bathingshed
she gazed so long that her eyes were dazzled and when they moved back to the house she could not recognize the faces of people who were coming out of it
a parlourmaid was preceding them
who are those people
she asked
they're callers
exclaimed henry
it's too late for callers
perhaps they're town people who want to see the wedding presents
i'm not at home yet to townees
well hide among the ruins and if i can stop them i will
he thanked her
margaret went forward smiling socially
she supposed that these were unpunctual guests who would have to be content with vicarious civility since evie and charles were gone henry tired and the others in their rooms
she assumed the airs of a hostess not for long
for one of the group was helenhelen in her oldest clothes and dominated by that tense wounding excitement that had made her a terror in their nursery days
what is it
she called
oh what's wrong
is tibby ill
helen spoke to her two companions who fell back
then she bore forward furiously
they're starving
she shouted
i found them starving
who
why have you come
the basts
oh helen
moaned margaret
whatever have you done now
he has lost his place
he has been turned out of his bank
yes he's done for
we upper classes have ruined him and i suppose you'll tell me it's the battle of life
starving
his wife is ill
starving
she fainted in the train
helen are you mad
perhaps
yes
if you like i'm mad
but i've brought them
i'll stand injustice no longer
i'll show up the wretchedness that lies under this luxury this talk of impersonal forces this cant about god doing what we're too slack to do ourselves
have you actually brought two starving people from london to shropshire helen
helen was checked
she had not thought of this and her hysteria abated
there was a restaurant car on the train she said
don't be absurd
they aren't starving and you know it
now begin from the beginning
i won't have such theatrical nonsense
how dare you
yes how dare you
she repeated as anger filled her bursting in to evie's wedding in this heartless way
my goodness
but you've a perverted notion of philanthropy
lookshe indicated the houseservants people out of the windows
they think it's some vulgar scandal and i must explain 'oh no it's only my sister screaming and only two hangerson of ours whom she has brought here for no conceivable reason'
kindly take back that word 'hangerson' said helen ominously calm
very well conceded margaret who for all her wrath was determined to avoid a real quarrel
i too am sorry about them but it beats me why you've brought them here or why you're here yourself
it's our last chance of seeing mr
wilcox
margaret moved towards the house at this
she was determined not to worry henry
he's going to scotland
i know he is
i insist on seeing him
yes tomorrow
i knew it was our last chance
how do you do mr
bast
said margaret trying to control her voice
this is an odd business
what view do you take of it
there is mrs bast too prompted helen
jacky also shook hands
she like her husband was shy and furthermore ill and furthermore so bestially stupid that she could not grasp what was happening
she only knew that the lady had swept down like a whirlwind last night had paid the rent redeemed the furniture provided them with a dinner and breakfast and ordered them to meet her at paddington next morning
leonard had feebly protested and when the morning came had suggested that they shouldn't go
but she half mesmerized had obeyed
the lady had told them to and they must and their bedsittingroom had accordingly changed into paddington and paddington into a railway carriage that shook and grew hot and grew cold and vanished entirely and reappeared amid torrents of expensive scent
you have fainted said the lady in an awestruck voice
perhaps the air will do you good
and perhaps it had for here she was feeling rather better among a lot of flowers
i'm sure i don't want to intrude began leonard in answer to margaret's question
but you have been so kind to me in the past in warning me about the porphyrion that i wonderedwhy i wondered whether  whether we could get him back into the porphyrion again supplied helen
meg this has been a cheerful business
a bright evening's work that was on chelsea embankment
margaret shook her head and returned to mr bast
i don't understand
you left the porphyrion because we suggested it was a bad concern didn't you
that's right
and went into a bank instead
i told you all that said helen and they reduced their staff after he had been in a month and now he's penniless and i consider that we and our informant are directly to blame
i hate all this leonard muttered
i hope you do mr bast
but it's no good mincing matters
you have done yourself no good by coming here
if you intend to confront mr wilcox and to call him to account for a chance remark you will make a very great mistake
i brought them
i did it all cried helen
i can only advise you to go at once
my sister has put you in a false position and it is kindest to tell you so
it's too late to get to town but you'll find a comfortable hotel in oniton where mrs bast can rest and i hope you'll be my guests there
that isn't what i want miss schlegel said leonard
you're very kind and no doubt it's a false position but you make me miserable
i seem no good at all
it's work he wants interpreted helen
can't you see
then he said jacky let's go
we're more bother than we're worth
we're costing these ladies pounds and pounds already to get work for us and they never will
there's nothing we're good enough to do
we would like to find you work said margaret rather conventionally
we want toi like my sister
you're only down in your luck
go to the hotel have a good night's rest and some day you shall pay me back the bill if you prefer it
but leonard was near the abyss and at such moments men see clearly
you don't know what you're talking about he said
i shall never get work now
if rich people fail at one profession they can try another
not i  i had my groove and i've got out of it
i could do one particular branch of insurance in one particular office well enough to command a salary but that's all
poetry's nothing miss schlegel
one's thoughts about this and that are nothing
your money too is nothing if you'll understand me
i mean if a man over twenty once loses his own particular job it's all over with him
i have seen it happen to others
their friends gave them money for a little but in the end they fall over the edge
it's no good
it's the whole world pulling
there always will be rich and poor
he ceased
won't you have something to eat
said margaret
i don't know what to do
it isn't my house and though mr wilcox would have been glad to see you at any other timeas i say i don't know what to do but i undertake to do what i can for you
helen offer them something
do try a sandwich mrs
bast
they moved to a long table behind which a servant was still standing
iced cakes sandwiches innumerable coffee claretcup champagne remained almost intact their overfed guests could do no more
leonard refused
jacky thought she could manage a little
margaret left them whispering together and had a few more words with helen
she said helen i like mr bast
i agree that he's worth helping
i agree that we are directly responsible
no indirectly
via mr
wilcox
let me tell you once for all that if you take up that attitude i'll do nothing
no doubt you're right logically and are entitled to say a great many scathing things about henry
only i won't have it
so choose
helen looked at the sunset
if you promise to take them quietly to the george i will speak to henry about themin my own way mind there is to be none of this absurd screaming about justice
i have no use for justice
if it was only a question of money we could do it ourselves
but he wants work and that we can't give him but possibly henry can
it's his duty to grumbled helen
nor am i concerned with duty
i'm concerned with the characters of various people whom we know and how things being as they are things may be made a little better
mr wilcox hates being asked favours all business men do
but i am going to ask him at the risk of a rebuff because i want to make things a little better
very well
i promise
you take it very calmly 
take them off to the george then and i'll try
poor creatures
but they look tried
as they parted she added i haven't nearly done with you though helen
you have been most selfindulgent
i can't get over it
you have less restraint rather than more as you grow older
think it over and alter yourself or we shan't have happy lives
she rejoined henry
fortunately he had been sitting down these physical matters were important
was it townees
he asked greeting her with a pleasant smile
you'll never believe me said margaret sitting down beside him
it's all right now but it was my sister
helen here
he cried preparing to rise
but she refused the invitation
i thought she despised weddings
don't get up
she has not come to the wedding
i've bundled her off to the george
inherently hospitable he protested
no she has two of her proteges with her and must keep with them
let 'em all come
my dear henry did you see them
i did catch sight of a brown bunch of a woman certainly
the brown bunch was helen but did you catch sight of a seagreen and salmon bunch
what
are they out beanfeasting
no business
they wanted to see me and later on i want to talk to you about them
she was ashamed of her own diplomacy
in dealing with a wilcox how tempting it was to lapse from comradeship and to give him the kind of woman that he desired
henry took the hint at once and said why later on
tell me now
no time like the present
shall i
if it isn't a long story
oh not five minutes but there's a sting at the end of it for i want you to find the man some work in your office
what are his qualifications
i don't know
he's a clerk
how old
twentyfive perhaps
what's his name
bast said margaret and was about to remind him that they had met at wickham place but stopped herself
it had not been a successful meeting
where was he before
dempster's bank
why did he leave
he asked still remembering nothing
they reduced their staff
all right i'll see him
it was the reward of her tact and devotion through the day
now she understood why some women prefer influence to rights
mrs plynlimmon when condemning suffragettes had said the woman who can't influence her husband to vote the way she wants ought to be ashamed of herself
margaret had winced but she was influencing henry now and though pleased at her little victory she knew that she had won it by the methods of the harem
i should be glad if you took him she said but i don't know whether he's qualified
i'll do what i can
but margaret this mustn't be taken as a precedent
no of courseof course  i can't fit in your proteges every day
business would suffer
i can promise you he's the last
hehe's rather a special case
proteges always are
she let it stand at that
he rose with a little extra touch of complacency and held out his hand to help her up
how wide the gulf between henry as he was and henry as helen thought he ought to be
and she herselfhovering as usual between the two now accepting men as they are now yearning with her sister for truth
love and truththeir warfare seems eternal
perhaps the whole visible world rests on it and if they were one life itself like the spirits when prospero was reconciled to his brother might vanish into air into thin air
your protege has made us late said he
the fussells will just be starting
on the whole she sided with men as they are
henry would save the basts as he had saved howards end while helen and her friends were discussing the ethics of salvation
his was a slapdash method but the world has been built slapdash and the beauty of mountain and river and sunset may be but the varnish with which the unskilled artificer hides his joins
oniton like herself was imperfect
its appletrees were stunted its castle ruinous
it too had suffered in the border warfare between the anglo saxon and the kelt between things as they are and as they ought to be
once more the west was retreating once again the orderly stars were dotting the eastern sky
there is certainly no rest for us on the earth
but there is happiness and as margaret descended the mound on her lover's arm she felt that she was having her share
to her annoyance mrs bast was still in the garden the husband and helen had left her there to finish her meal while they went to engage rooms
margaret found this woman repellent
she had felt when shaking her hand an overpowering shame
she remembered the motive of her call at wickham place and smelt again odours from the abyssodours the more disturbing because they were involuntary
for there was no malice in jacky
there she sat a piece of cake in one hand an empty champagne glass in the other doing no harm to anybody
she's overtired margaret whispered
she's something else said henry
this won't do
i can't have her in my garden in this state
is she margaret hesitated to add drunk
now that she was going to marry him he had grown particular
he discountenanced risque conversations now
henry went up to the woman
she raised her face which gleamed in the twilight like a puffball
madam you will be more comfortable at the hotel he said sharply
jacky replied if it isn't hen
ne crois pas que le mari lui ressemble apologized margaret
il est tout a fait different
henry
she repeated quite distinctly
mr wilcox was much annoyed
i can't congratulate you on your proteges he remarked
hen don't go
you do love me dear don't you
bless us what a person
sighed margaret gathering up her skirts
jacky pointed with her cake
you're a nice boy you are
she yawned
there now i love you
henry i am awfully sorry
and pray why
he asked and looked at her so sternly that she feared he was ill
he seemed more scandalized than the facts demanded
to have brought this down on you
pray don't apologize
the voice continued
why does she call you 'hen'
said margaret innocently
has she ever seen you before
seen hen before
said jacky
who hasn't seen hen
he's serving you like me my dear
these boys
you waitstill we love 'em
are you now satisfied
henry asked
margaret began to grow frightened
i don't know what it is all about she said
let's come in
but he thought she was acting
he thought he was trapped
he saw his whole life crumbling
don't you indeed
he said bitingly
i do
allow me to congratulate you on the success of your plan
this is helen's plan not mine
i now understand your interest in the basts
very well thought out
i am amused at your caution margaret
you are quite rightit was necessary
i am a man and have lived a man's past
i have the honour to release you from your engagement
still she could not understand
she knew of life's seamy side as a theory she could not grasp it as a fact
more words from jacky were necessarywords unequivocal undenied
so that burst from her and she went indoors
she stopped herself from saying more
so what
asked colonel fussell who was getting ready to start in the hall
we were sayinghenry and i were just having the fiercest argument my point being seizing his fur coat from a footman she offered to help him on
he protested and there was a playful little scene
no let me do that said henry following
thanks so much
you seehe has forgiven me
the colonel said gallantly i don't expect there's much to forgive
he got into the car
the ladies followed him after an interval
maids courier and heavier luggage had been sent on earlier by the branchline
still chattering still thanking their host and patronizing their future hostess the guests were home away
then margaret continued so that woman has been your mistress
you put it with your usual delicacy he replied
when please
why
when please
ten years ago
she left him without a word
for it was not her tragedy it was mrs wilcox's
chapter   helen began to wonder why she had spent a matter of eight pounds in making some people ill and others angry
now that the wave of excitement was ebbing and had left her mr bast and mrs bast stranded for the night in a shropshire hotel she asked herself what forces had made the wave flow
at all events no harm was done
margaret would play the game properly now and though helen disapproved of her sister's methods she knew that the basts would benefit by them in the long run
mr wilcox is so illogical she explained to leonard who had put his wife to bed and was sitting with her in the empty coffeeroom
if we told him it was his duty to take you on he might refuse to do it
the fact is he isn't properly educated
i don't want to set you against him but you'll find him a trial
i can never thank you sufficiently miss schlegel was all that leonard felt equal to
i believe in personal responsibility
don't you
and in personal everything
i hatei suppose i oughtn't to say thatbut the wilcoxes are on the wrong tack surely
or perhaps it isn't their fault
perhaps the little thing that says 'i' is missing out of the middle of their heads and then it's a waste of time to blame them
there's a nightmare of a theory that says a special race is being born which will rule the rest of us in the future just because it lacks the little thing that says 'i'
had you heard that
i get no time for reading
had you thought it then
that there are two kinds of peopleour kind who live straight from the middle of their heads and the other kind who can't because their heads have no middle
they can't say 'i'
they aren't in fact and so they're supermen
pierpont morgan has never said 'i' in his life
leonard roused himself
if his benefactress wanted intellectual conversation she must have it
she was more important than his ruined past
i never got on to nietzsche he said
but i always understood that those supermen were rather what you may call egoists
oh no that's wrong replied helen
no superman ever said 'i want' because 'i want' must lead to the question 'who am i'
and so to pity and to justice
he only says 'want'
'want europe' if he's napoleon 'want wives' if he's bluebeard 'want botticelli' if he's pierpont morgan
never the 'i' and if you could pierce through him you'd find panic and emptiness in the middle
leonard was silent for a moment
then he said may i take it miss schlegel that you and i are both the sort that say 'i'
of course
and your sister too
of course repeated helen a little sharply
she was annoyed with margaret but did not want her discussed
all presentable people say 'i'
but mr wilcoxhe is not perhaps  i don't know that it's any good discussing mr wilcox either
quite so quite so he agreed
helen asked herself why she had snubbed him
once or twice during the day she had encouraged him to criticize and then had pulled him up short
was she afraid of him presuming
if so it was disgusting of her
but he was thinking the snub quite natural
everything she did was natural and incapable of causing offence
while the miss schlegels were together he had felt them scarcely humana sort of admonitory whirligig
but a miss schlegel alone was different
she was in helen's case unmarried in margaret's about to be married in neither case an echo of her sister
a light had fallen at last into this rich upper world and he saw that it was full of men and women some of whom were more friendly to him than others
helen had become his miss schlegel who scolded him and corresponded with him and had swept down yesterday with grateful vehemence
margaret though not unkind was severe and remote
he would not presume to help her for instance
he had never liked her and began to think that his original impression was true and that her sister did not like her either
helen was certainly lonely
she who gave away so much was receiving too little
leonard was pleased to think that he could spare her vexation by holding his tongue and concealing what he knew about mr wilcox
jacky had announced her discovery when he fetched her from the lawn
after the first shock he did not mind for himself
by now he had no illusions about his wife and this was only one new stain on the face of a love that had never been pure
to keep perfection perfect that should be his ideal if the future gave him time to have ideals
helen and margaret for helen's sake must not know
helen disconcerted him by fuming the conversation to his wife
mrs bastdoes she ever say 'i'
she asked half mischievously and then is she very tired
it's better she stops in her room said leonard
shall i sit up with her
no thank you she does not need company
mr bast what kind of woman is your wife
leonard blushed up to his eyes
you ought to know my ways by now
does that question offend you
no oh no miss schlegel no
because i love honesty
don't pretend your marriage has been a happy one
you and she can have nothing in common
he did not deny it but said shyly i suppose that's pretty obvious but jacky never meant to do anybody any harm
when things went wrong or i heard things i used to think it was her fault but looking back it's more mine
i needn't have married her but as i have i must stick to her and keep her
how long have you been married
nearly three years
what did your people say
they will not have anything to do with us
they had a sort of family council when they heard i was married and cut us off altogether
helen began to pace up and down the room
my good boy what a mess
she said gently
who are your people
he could answer this
his parents who were dead had been in trade his sisters had married commercial travellers his brother was a layreader
and your grandparents
leonard told her a secret that he had held shameful up to now
they were just nothing at all he said agricultural labourers and that sort
so
from which part
lincolnshire mostly but my mother's fatherhe oddly enough came from these parts round here
from this very shropshire
yes that is odd
my mother's people were lancashire
but why do your brother and your sisters object to mrs
bast
oh i don't know
excuse me you do know
i am not a baby
i can bear anything you tell me and the more you tell the more i shall be able to help
have they heard anything against her
he was silent
i think i have guessed now said helen very gravely
i don't think so miss schlegel i hope not
we must be honest even over these things
i have guessed
i am frightfully dreadfully sorry but it does not make the least difference to me
i shall feel just the same to both of you
i blame not your wife for these things but men
leonard left it at thatso long as she did not guess the man
she stood at the window and slowly pulled up the blinds
the hotel looked over a dark square
the mists had begun
when she turned back to him her eyes were shining
don't you worry he pleaded
i can't bear that
we shall be all right if i get work
if i could only get worksomething regular to do
then it wouldn't be so bad again
i don't trouble after books as i used
i can imagine that with regular work we should settle down again
it stops one thinking 
settle down to what
oh just settle down
and that's to be life
said helen with a catch in her throat
how can you with all the beautiful things to see and dowith musicwith walking at night  walking is well enough when a man's in work he answered
oh i did talk a lot of nonsense once but there's nothing like a bailiff in the house to drive it out of you
when i saw him fingering my ruskins and stevensons i seemed to see life straight real and it isn't a pretty sight
my books are back again thanks to you but they'll never be the same to me again and i shan't ever again think night in the woods is wonderful
why not
asked helen throwing up the window
because i see one must have money
well you're wrong
i wish i was wrong butthe clergymanhe has money of his own or else he's paid the poet or the musicianjust the same the tramphe's no different
the tramp goes to the workhouse in the end and is paid for with other people's money
miss schlegel the real thing's money and all the rest is a dream
you're still wrong
you've forgotten death
leonard could not understand
if we lived for ever what you say would be true
but we have to die we have to leave life presently
injustice and greed would be the real thing if we lived for ever
as it is we must hold to other things because death is coming
i love deathnot morbidly but because he explains
he shows me the emptiness of money
death and money are the eternal foes
not death and life
never mind what lies behind death mr bast but be sure that the poet and the musician and the tramp will be happier in it than the man who has never learnt to say 'i am i'
i wonder
we are all in a misti know but i can help you this farmen like the wilcoxes are deeper in the mist than any
sane sound englishmen
building up empires levelling all the world into what they call common sense
but mention death to them and they're offended because death's really imperial and he cries out against them for ever
i am as afraid of death as any one
but not of the idea of death
but what is the difference
infinite difference said helen more gravely than before
leonard looked at her wondering and had the sense of great things sweeping out of the shrouded night
but he could not receive them because his heart was still full of little things
as the lost umbrella had spoilt the concert at queen's hall so the lost situation was obscuring the diviner harmonies now
death life and materialism were fine words but would mr wilcox take him on as a clerk
talk as one would mr wilcox was king of this world the superman with his own morality whose head remained in the clouds
i must be stupid he said apologetically
while to helen the paradox became clearer and clearer
death destroys a man the idea of death saves him
behind the coffins and the skeletons that stay the vulgar mind lies something so immense that all that is great in us responds to it
men of the world may recoil from the charnelhouse that they will one day enter but love knows better
death is his foe but his peer and in their agelong struggle the thews of love have been strengthened and his vision cleared until there is no one who can stand against him
so never give in continued the girl and restated again and again the vague yet convincing plea that the invisible lodges against the visible
her excitement grew as she tried to cut the rope that fastened leonard to the earth
woven of bitter experience it resisted her
presently the waitress entered and gave her a letter from margaret
another note addressed to leonard was inside
they read them listening to the murmurings of the river
chapter   for many hours margaret did nothing then she controlled herself and wrote some letters
she was too bruised to speak to henry she could pity him and even determine to marry him but as yet all lay too deep in her heart for speech
on the surface the sense of his degradation was too strong
she could not command voice or look and the gentle words that she forced out through her pen seemed to proceed from some other person
my dearest boy she began this is not to part us
it is everything or nothing and i mean it to be nothing
it happened long before we ever met and even if it had happened since i should be writing the same i hope
i do understand
but she crossed out i do understand it struck a false note
henry could not bear to be understood
she also crossed out it is everything or nothing
henry would resent so strong a grasp of the situation
she must not comment comment is unfeminine
i think that'll about do she thought
then the sense of his degradation choked her
was he worth all this bother
to have yielded to a woman of that sort was everything yes it was and she could not be his wife
she tried to translate his temptation into her own language and her brain reeled
men must be different even to want to yield to such a temptation
her belief in comradeship was stifled and she saw life as from that glass saloon on the great western which sheltered male and female alike from the fresh air
are the sexes really races each with its own code of morality and their mutual love a mere device of nature to keep things going
strip human intercourse of the proprieties and is it reduced to this
her judgment told her no
she knew that out of nature's device we have built a magic that will win us immortality
far more mysterious than the call of sex to sex is the tenderness that we throw into that call far wider is the gulf between us and the farmyard than between the farmyard and the garbage that nourishes it
we are evolving in ways that science cannot measure to ends that theology dares not contemplate
men did produce one jewel the gods will say and saying will give us immortality
margaret knew all this but for the moment she could not feel it and transformed the marriage of evie and mr cahill into a carnival of fools and her own marriagetoo miserable to think of that she tore up the letter and then wrote another   dear mr bast  i have spoken to mr wilcox about you as i promised and am sorry to say that he has no vacancy for you
yours truly                                          m j schlegel   she enclosed this in a note to helen over which she took less trouble than she might have done but her head was aching and she could not stop to pick her words   dear helen  give him this
the basts are no good
henry found the woman drunk on the lawn
i am having a room got ready for you here and will you please come round at once on getting this
the basts are not at all the type we should trouble about
i may go round to them myself in the morning and do anything that is fair
m   in writing this margaret felt that she was being practical
something might be arranged for the basts later on but they must be silenced for the moment
she hoped to avoid a conversation between the woman and helen
she rang the bell for a servant but no one answered it mr wilcox and the warringtons were gone to bed and the kitchen was abandoned to saturnalia
consequently she went over to the george herself
she did not enter the hotel for discussion would have been perilous and saying that the letter was important she gave it to the waitress
as she recrossed the square she saw helen and mr bast looking out of the window of the coffeeroom and feared she was already too late
her task was not yet over she ought to tell henry what she had done
this came easily for she saw him in the hall
the night wind had been rattling the pictures against the wall and the noise had disturbed him
who's there
he called quite the householder
margaret walked in and past him
i have asked helen to sleep she said
she is best here so don't lock the frontdoor
i thought someone had got in said henry
at the same time i told the man that we could do nothing for him
i don't know about later but now the basts must clearly go
did you say that your sister is sleeping here after all
probably
is she to be shown up to your room
i have naturally nothing to say to her i am going to bed
will you tell the servants about helen
could someone go to carry her bag
he tapped a little gong which had been bought to summon the servants
you must make more noise than that if you want them to hear
henry opened a door and down the corridor came shouts of laughter
far too much screaming there he said and strode towards it
margaret went upstairs uncertain whether to be glad that they had met or sorry
they had behaved as if nothing had happened and her deepest instincts told her that this was wrong
for his own sake some explanation was due
and yetwhat could an explanation tell her
a date a place a few details which she could imagine all too clearly
now that the first shock was over she saw that there was every reason to premise a mrs bast
henry's inner life had long laid open to herhis intellectual confusion his obtuseness to personal influence his strong but furtive passions
should she refuse him because his outer life corresponded
perhaps
perhaps if the dishonour had been done to her but it was done long before her day
she struggled against the feeling
she told herself that mrs wilcox's wrong was her own
but she was not a bargain theorist
as she undressed her anger her regard for the dead her desire for a scene all grew weak
henry must have it as he liked for she loved him and some day she would use her love to make him a better man
pity was at the bottom of her actions all through this crisis
pity if one may generalize is at the bottom of woman
when men like us it is for our better qualities and however tender their liking we dare not be unworthy of it or they will quietly let us go
but unworthiness stimulates woman
it brings out her deeper nature for good or for evil
here was the core of the question
henry must be forgiven and made better by love nothing else mattered
mrs wilcox that unquiet yet kindly ghost must be left to her own wrong
to her everything was in proportion now and she too would pity the man who was blundering up and down their lives
had mrs wilcox known of his trespass
an interesting question but margaret fell asleep tethered by affection and lulled by the murmurs of the river that descended all the night from wales
she felt herself at one with her future home colouring it and coloured by it and awoke to see for the second time oniton castle conquering the morning mists
chapter   henry dear was her greeting
he had finished his breakfast and was beginning the times
his sisterinlaw was packing
she knelt by him and took the paper from him feeling that it was unusually heavy and thick
then putting her face where it had been she looked up in his eyes
henry dear look at me
no i won't have you shirking
look at me
there
that's all
you're referring to last evening he said huskily
i have released you from your engagement
i could find excuses but i won't
no i won't
a thousand times no
i'm a bad lot and must be left at that
expelled from his old fortress mr wilcox was building a new one
he could no longer appear respectable to her so he defended himself instead in a lurid past
it was not true repentance
leave it where you will boy
it's not going to trouble us i know what i'm talking about and it will make no difference
no difference
he inquired
no difference when you find that i am not the fellow you thought
he was annoyed with miss schlegel here
he would have preferred her to be prostrated by the blow or even to rage
against the tide of his sin flowed the feeling that she was not altogether womanly
her eyes gazed too straight they had read books that are suitable for men only
and though he had dreaded a scene and though she had determined against one there was a scene all the same
it was somehow imperative
i am unworthy of you he began
had i been worthy i should not have released you from your engagement
i know what i am talking about
i can't bear to talk of such things
we had better leave it 
she kissed his hand
he jerked it from her and rising to his feet went on you with your sheltered life and refined pursuits and friends and books you and your sister and women like youi say how can you guess the temptations that lie round a man
it is difficult for us said margaret but if we are worth marrying we do guess
cut off from decent society and family ties what do you suppose happens to thousands of young fellows overseas
isolated
no one near
i know by bitter experience and yet you say it makes 'no difference'
not to me
he laughed bitterly
margaret went to the sideboard and helped herself to one of the breakfast dishes
being the last down she turned out the spiritlamp that kept them warm
she was tender but grave
she knew that henry was not so much confessing his soul as pointing out the gulf between the male soul and the female and she did not desire to hear him on this point
did helen come
she asked
he shook his head
but that won't do at all at all
we don't want her gossiping with mrs
bast
good god
no
he exclaimed suddenly natural
then he caught himself up
let them gossip
my game's up though i thank you for your unselfishnesslittle as my thanks are worth
didn't she send me a message or anything
i heard of none
would you ring the bell please
what to do
why to inquire
he swaggered up to it tragically and sounded a peal
margaret poured herself out some coffee
the butler came and said that miss schlegel had slept at the george so far as he had heard
should he go round to the george
i'll go thank you said margaret and dismissed him
it is no good said henry
those things leak out you cannot stop a story once it has started
i have known cases of other meni despised them once i thought that i'm different i shall never be tempted
oh margaret he came and sat down near her improvising emotion
she could not bear to listen to him
we fellows all come to grief once in our time
will you believe that
there are moments when the strongest man'let him who standeth take heed lest he fall'
that's true isn't it
if you knew all you would excuse me
i was far from good influencesfar even from england
i was very very lonely and longed for a woman's voice
that's enough
i have told you too much already for you to forgive me now
yes that's enough dear
i havehe lowered his voicei have been through hell
gravely she considered this claim
had he
had he suffered tortures of remorse or had it been there
that's over
now for respectable life again
the latter if she read him rightly
a man who has been through hell does not boast of his virility
he is humble and hides it if indeed it still exists
only in legend does the sinner come forth penitent but terrible to conquer pure woman by his resistless power
henry was anxious to be terrible but had not got it in him
he was a good average englishman who had slipped
the really culpable pointhis faithlessness to mrs wilcoxnever seemed to strike him
she longed to mention mrs wilcox
and bit by bit the story was told her
it was a very simple story
ten years ago was the time a garrison town in cyprus the place
now and then he asked her whether she could possibly forgive him and she answered i have already forgiven you henry
she chose her words carefully and so saved him from panic
she played the girl until he could rebuild his fortress and hide his soul from the world
when the butler came to clear away henry was in a very different moodasked the fellow what he was in such a hurry for complained of the noise last night in the servants' hall
margaret looked intently at the butler
he as a handsome young man was faintly attractive to her as a womanan attraction so faint as scarcely to be perceptible yet the skies would have fallen if she had mentioned it to henry
on her return from the george the building operations were complete and the old henry fronted her competent cynical and kind
he had made a clean breast had been forgiven and the great thing now was to forget his failure and to send it the way of other unsuccessful investments
jacky rejoined howards end and ducie street and the vermilion motorcar and the argentine hard dollars and all the things and people for whom he had never had much use and had less now
their memory hampered him
he could scarcely attend to margaret who brought back disquieting news from the george
helen and her clients had gone
well let them gothe man and his wife i mean for the more we see of your sister the better
but they have gone separatelyhelen very early the basts just before i arrived
they have left no message
they have answered neither of my notes
i don't like to think what it all means
what did you say in the notes
i told you last night
ohahyes
dear would you like one turn in the garden
margaret took his arm
the beautiful weather soothed her
but the wheels of evie's wedding were still at work tossing the guests outwards as deftly as they had drawn them in and she could not be with him long
it had been arranged that they should motor to shrewsbury whence he would go north and she back to london with the warringtons
for a fraction of time she was happy
then her brain recommenced
i am afraid there has been gossiping of some kind at the george
helen would not have left unless she had heard something
i mismanaged that
it is wretched
i ought tohave parted her from that woman at once
margaret
he exclaimed loosing her arm impressively
yesyes henry
i am far from a saintin fact the reversebut you have taken me for better or worse
bygones must be bygones
you have promised to forgive me
margaret a promise is a promise
never mention that woman again
except for some practical reasonnever
practical
you practical
yes i'm practical she murmured stooping over the mowingmachine and playing with the grass which trickled through her fingers like sand
he had silenced her but her fears made him uneasy
not for the first time he was threatened with blackmail
he was rich and supposed to be moral the basts knew that he was not and might find it profitable to hint as much
at all events you mustn't worry he said
this is a man's business
he thought intently
on no account mention it to anybody
margaret flushed at advice so elementary but he was really paving the way for a lie
if necessary he would deny that he had ever known mrs bast and prosecute her for libel
perhaps he never had known her
here was margaret who behaved as if he had not
there the house
round them were half a dozen gardeners clearing up after his daughter's wedding
all was so solid and spruce that the past flew up out of sight like a springblind leaving only the last five minutes unrolled
glancing at these he saw that the car would be round during the next five and plunged into action
gongs were tapped orders issued margaret was sent to dress and the housemaid to sweep up the long trickle of grass that she had left across the hall
as is man to the universe so was the mind of mr wilcox to the minds of some mena concentrated light upon a tiny spot a little ten minutes moving selfcontained through its appointed years
no pagan he who lives for the now and may be wiser than all philosophers
he lived for the five minutes that have past and the five to come he had the business mind
how did he stand now as his motor slipped out of oniton and breasted the great round hills
margaret had heard a certain rumour but was all right
she had forgiven him god bless her and he felt the manlier for it
charles and evie had not heard it and never must hear
no more must paul
over his children he felt great tenderness which he did not try to track to a cause mrs wilcox was too far back in his life
he did not connect her with the sudden aching love that he felt for evie
poor little evie
he trusted that cahill would make her a decent husband
and margaret
how did she stand
she had several minor worries
clearly her sister had heard something
she dreaded meeting her in town
and she was anxious about leonard for whom they certainly were responsible
nor ought mrs bast to starve
but the main situation had not altered
she still loved henry
his actions not his disposition had disappointed her and she could bear that
and she loved her future home
standing up in the car just where she had leapt from it two days before she gazed back with deep emotion upon oniton
besides the grange and the castle keep she could now pick out the church and the blackandwhite gables of the george
there was the bridge and the river nibbling its green peninsula
she could even see the bathingshed but while she was looking for charles's new springboard the forehead of the hill rose up and hid the whole scene
she never saw it again
day and night the river flows down into england day after day the sun retreats into the welsh mountains and the tower chimes see the conquering hero
but the wilcoxes have no part in the place nor in any place
it is not their names that recur in the parish register
it is not their ghosts that sigh among the alders at evening
they have swept into the valley and swept out of it leaving a little dust and a little money behind
chapter   tibby was now approaching his last year at oxford
he had moved out of college and was contemplating the universe or such portions of it as concerned him from his comfortable lodgings in long wall
he was not concerned with much
when a young man is untroubled by passions and sincerely indifferent to public opinion his outlook is necessarily limited
tibby neither wished to strengthen the position of the rich nor to improve that of the poor and so was well content to watch the elms nodding behind the mildly embattled parapets of magdalen
there are worse lives
though selfish he was never cruel though affected in manner he never posed
like margaret he disdained the heroic equipment and it was only after many visits that men discovered schlegel to possess a character and a brain
he had done well in mods much to the surprise of those who attended lectures and took proper exercise and was now glancing disdainfully at chinese in case he should some day consent to qualify as a student interpreter
to him thus employed helen entered
a telegram had preceded her
he noticed in a distant way that his sister had altered
as a rule he found her too pronounced and had never come across this look of appeal pathetic yet dignifiedthe look of a sailor who has lost everything at sea
i have come from oniton she began
there has been a great deal of trouble there
who's for lunch
said tibby picking up the claret which was warming in the hearth
helen sat down submissively at the table
why such an early start
he asked
sunrise or somethingwhen i could get away
so i surmise
why
i don't know what's to be done tibby
i am very much upset at a piece of news that concerns meg and do not want to face her and i am not going back to wickham place
i stopped here to tell you this
the landlady came in with the cutlets
tibby put a marker in the leaves of his chinese grammar and helped them
oxfordthe oxford of the vacationdreamed and rustled outside and indoors the little fire was coated with grey where the sunshine touched it
helen continued her odd story
give meg my love and say that i want to be alone
i mean to go to munich or else bonn
such a message is easily given said her brother
as regards wickham place and my share of the furniture you and she are to do exactly as you like
my own feeling is that everything may just as well be sold
what does one want with dusty economic books which have made the world no better or with mother's hideous chiffoniers
i have also another commission for you
i want you to deliver a letter
she got up
i haven't written it yet
why shouldn't i post it though
she sat down again
my head is rather wretched
i hope that none of your friends are likely to come in
tibby locked the door
his friends often found it in this condition
then he asked whether anything had gone wrong at evie's wedding
not there said helen and burst into tears
he had known her hystericalit was one of her aspects with which he had no concernand yet these tears touched him as something unusual
they were nearer the things that did concern him such as music
he laid down his knife and looked at her curiously
then as she continued to sob he went on with his lunch
the time came for the second course and she was still crying
apple charlotte was to follow which spoils by waiting
do you mind mrs martlett coming in
he asked or shall i take it from her at the door
could i bathe my eyes tibby
he took her to his bedroom and introduced the pudding in her absence
having helped himself he put it down to warm in the hearth
his hand stretched towards the grammar and soon he was turning over the pages raising his eyebrows scornfully perhaps at human nature perhaps at chinese
to him thus employed helen returned
she had pulled herself together but the grave appeal had not vanished from her eyes
now for the explanation she said
why didn't i begin with it
i have found out something about mr wilcox
he has behaved very wrongly indeed and ruined two people's lives
it all came on me very suddenly last night i am very much upset and i do not know what to do
mrs bast  oh those people
helen seemed silenced
shall i lock the door again
no thanks tibbikins
you're being very good to me
i want to tell you the story before i go abroad
you must do exactly what you liketreat it as part of the furniture
meg cannot have heard it yet i think
but i cannot face her and tell her that the man she is going to marry has misconducted himself
i don't even know whether she ought to be told
knowing as she does that i dislike him she will suspect me and think that i want to ruin her match
i simply don't know what to make of such a thing
i trust your judgment
what would you do
i gather he has had a mistress said tibby
helen flushed with shame and anger
and ruined two people's lives
and goes about saying that personal actions count for nothing and there always will be rich and poor
he met her when he was trying to get rich out in cyprusi don't wish to make him worse than he is and no doubt she was ready enough to meet him
but there it is
they met
he goes his way and she goes hers
what do you suppose is the end of such women
he conceded that it was a bad business
they end in two ways either they sink till the lunatic asylums and the workhouses are full of them and cause mr wilcox to write letters to the papers complaining of our national degeneracy or else they entrap a boy into marriage before it is too late
shei can't blame her
but this isn't all she continued after a long pause during which the landlady served them with coffee
i come now to the business that took us to oniton
we went all three
acting on mr wilcox's advice the man throws up a secure situation and takes an insecure one from which he is dismissed
there are certain excuses but in the main mr wilcox is to blame as meg herself admitted
it is only common justice that he should employ the man himself
but he meets the woman and like the cur that he is he refuses and tries to get rid of them
he makes meg write
two notes came from her late that eveningone for me one for leonard dismissing him with barely a reason
i couldn't understand
then it comes out that mrs bast had spoken to mr wilcox on the lawn while we left her to get rooms and was still speaking about him when leonard came back to her
this leonard knew all along
he thought it natural he should be ruined twice
natural
could you have contained yourself
it is certainly a very bad business said tibby
his reply seemed to calm his sister
i was afraid that i saw it out of proportion
but you are right outside it and you must know
in a day or twoor perhaps a weektake whatever steps you think fit
i leave it in your hands
she concluded her charge
the facts as they touch meg are all before you she added and tibby sighed and felt it rather hard that because of his open mind he should be empanelled to serve as a juror
he had never been interested in human beings for which one must blame him but he had had rather too much of them at wickham place
just as some people cease to attend when books are mentioned so tibby's attention wandered when personal relations came under discussion
ought margaret to know what helen knew the basts to know
similar questions had vexed him from infancy and at oxford he had learned to say that the importance of human beings has been vastly overrated by specialists
the epigram with its faint whiff of the eighties meant nothing
but he might have let it off now if his sister had not been ceaselessly beautiful
you see helenhave a cigarettei don't see what i'm to do
then there's nothing to be done
i dare say you are right
let them marry
there remains the question of compensation 
do you want me to adjudicate that too
had you not better consult an expert
this part is in confidence said helen
it has nothing to do with meg and do not mention it to her
the compensationi do not see who is to pay it if i don't and i have already decided on the minimum sum
as soon as possible i am placing it to your account and when i am in germany you will pay it over for me
i shall never forget your kindness tibbikins if you do this
what is the sum
five thousand
good god alive
said tibby and went crimson
now what is the good of driblets
to go through life having done one thingto have raised one person from the abyss not these puny gifts of shillings and blanketsmaking the grey more grey
no doubt people will think me extraordinary
i don't care a damn what people think
cried he heated to unusual manliness of diction
but it's half what you have
not nearly half
she spread out her hands over her soiled skirt
i have far too much and we settled at chelsea last spring that three hundred a year is necessary to set a man on his feet
what i give will bring in a hundred and fifty between two
it isn't enough
he could not recover
he was not angry or even shocked and he saw that helen would still have plenty to live on
but it amazed him to think what haycocks people can make of their lives
his delicate intonations would not work and he could only blurt out that the five thousand pounds would mean a great deal of bother for him personally
i didn't expect you to understand me
i
i understand nobody
but you'll do it
apparently
i leave you two commissions then
the first concerns mr wilcox and you are to use your discretion
the second concerns the money and is to be mentioned to no one and carried out literally
you will send a hundred pounds on account tomorrow
he walked with her to the station passing through those streets whose serried beauty never bewildered him and never fatigued
the lovely creature raised domes and spires into the cloudless blue and only the ganglion of vulgarity round carfax showed how evanescent was the phantom how faint its claim to represent england
helen rehearsing her commission noticed nothing the basts were in her brain and she retold the crisis in a meditative way which might have made other men curious
she was seeing whether it would hold
he asked her once why she had taken the basts right into the heart of evie's wedding
she stopped like a frightened animal and said does that seem to you so odd
her eyes the hand laid on the mouth quite haunted him until they were absorbed into the figure of st mary the virgin before whom he paused for a moment on the walk home
it is convenient to follow him in the discharge of his duties
margaret summoned him the next day
she was terrified at helen's flight and he had to say that she had called in at oxford
then she said did she seem worried at any rumour about henry
he answered yes
i knew it was that
she exclaimed
i'll write to her
tibby was relieved
he then sent the cheque to the address that helen gave him and stated that later on he was instructed to forward five thousand pounds
an answer came back very civil and quiet in tonesuch an answer as tibby himself would have given
the cheque was returned the legacy refused the writer being in no need of money
tibby forwarded this to helen adding in the fulness of his heart that leonard bast seemed somewhat a monumental person after all
helen's reply was frantic
he was to take no notice
he was to go down at once and say that she commanded acceptance
he went
a scurf of books and china ornaments awaited them
the basts had just been evicted for not paying their rent and had wandered no one knew whither
helen had begun bungling with her money by this time and had even sold out her shares in the nottingham and derby railway
for some weeks she did nothing
then she reinvested and owing to the good advice of her stockbrokers became rather richer than she had been before
chapter   houses have their own ways of dying falling as variously as the generations of men some with a tragic roar some quietly but to an afterlife in the city of ghosts while from othersand thus was the death of wickham placethe spirit slips before the body perishes
it had decayed in the spring disintegrating the girls more than they knew and causing either to accost unfamiliar regions
by september it was a corpse void of emotion and scarcely hallowed by the memories of thirty years of happiness
through its roundtopped doorway passed furniture and pictures and books until the last room was gutted and the last van had rumbled away
it stood for a week or two longer openeyed as if astonished at its own emptiness
then it fell
navvies came and spilt it back into the grey
with their muscles and their beery good temper they were not the worst of undertakers for a house which had always been human and had not mistaken culture for an end
the furniture with a few exceptions went down into hertfordshire mr wilcox having most kindly offered howards end as a warehouse
mr bryce had died abroadan unsatisfactory affairand as there seemed little guarantee that the rent would be paid regularly he cancelled the agreement and resumed possession himself
until he relet the house the schlegels were welcome to stack their furniture in the garage and lower rooms
margaret demurred but tibby accepted the offer gladly it saved him from coming to any decision about the future
the plate and the more valuable pictures found a safer home in london but the bulk of the things went countryways and were entrusted to the guardianship of miss avery
shortly before the move our hero and heroine were married
they have weathered the storm and may reasonably expect peace
to have no illusions and yet to lovewhat stronger surety can a woman find
she had seen her husband's past as well as his heart
she knew her own heart with a thoroughness that commonplace people believe impossible
the heart of mrs wilcox was alone hidden and perhaps it is superstitious to speculate on the feelings of the dead
they were married quietlyreally quietly for as the day approached she refused to go through another oniton
her brother gave her away her aunt who was out of health presided over a few colourless refreshments
the wilcoxes were represented by charles who witnessed the marriage settlement and by mr cahill
paul did send a cablegram
in a few minutes and without the aid of music the clergyman made them man and wife and soon the glass shade had fallen that cuts off married couples from the world
she a monogamist regretted the cessation of some of life's innocent odours he whose instincts were polygamous felt morally braced by the change and less liable to the temptations that had assailed him in the past
they spent their honeymoon near innsbruck
henry knew of a reliable hotel there and margaret hoped for a meeting with her sister
in this she was disappointed
as they came south helen retreated over the brenner and wrote an unsatisfactory postcard from the shores of the lake of garda saying that her plans were uncertain and had better be ignored
evidently she disliked meeting henry
two months are surely enough to accustom an outsider to a situation which a wife has accepted in two days and margaret had again to regret her sister's lack of selfcontrol
in a long letter she pointed out the need of charity in sexual matters so little is known about them it is hard enough for those who are personally touched to judge then how futile must be the verdict of society
i don't say there is no standard for that would destroy morality only that there can be no standard until our impulses are classified and better understood
helen thanked her for her kind letterrather a curious reply
she moved south again and spoke of wintering in naples
mr wilcox was not sorry that the meeting failed
helen left him time to grow skin over his wound
there were still moments when it pained him
had he only known that margaret was awaiting himmargaret so lively and intelligent and yet so submissivehe would have kept himself worthier of her
incapable of grouping the past he confused the episode of jacky with another episode that had taken place in the days of his bachelorhood
the two made one crop of wild oats for which he was heartily sorry and he could not see that those oats are of a darker stock which are rooted in another's dishonour
unchastity and infidelity were as confused to him as to the middle ages his only moral teacher
ruth poor old ruth
did not enter into his calculations at all for poor old ruth had never found him out
his affection for his present wife grew steadily
her cleverness gave him no trouble and indeed he liked to see her reading poetry or something about social questions it distinguished her from the wives of other men
he had only to call and she clapped the book up and was ready to do what he wished
then they would argue so jollily and once or twice she had him in quite a tight corner but as soon as he grew really serious she gave in
man is for war woman for the recreation of the warrior but he does not dislike it if she makes a show of fight
she cannot win in a real battle having no muscles only nerves
nerves make her jump out of a moving motorcar or refuse to be married fashionably
the warrior may well allow her to triumph on such occasions they move not the imperishable plinth of things that touch his peace
margaret had a bad attack of these nerves during the honeymoon
he told hercasually as was his habitthat oniton grange was let
she showed her annoyance and asked rather crossly why she had not been consulted
i didn't want to bother you he replied
besides i have only heard for certain this morning
where are we to live
said margaret trying to laugh
i loved the place extraordinarily
don't you believe in having a permanent home henry
he assured her that she misunderstood him
it is home life that distinguishes us from the foreigner
but he did not believe in a damp home
this is news
i never heard till this minute that oniton was damp
my dear girl
he flung out his handhave you eyes
have you a skin
how could it be anything but damp in such a situation
in the first place the grange is on clay and built where the castle moat must have been then there's that destestable little river steaming all night like a kettle
feel the cellar walls look up under the eaves
ask sir james or anyone
those shropshire valleys are notorious
the only possible place for a house in shropshire is on a hill but for my part i think the country is too far from london and the scenery nothing special 
margaret could not resist saying why did you go there then
ibecause he drew his head back and grew rather angry
why have we come to the tyrol if it comes to that
one might go on asking such questions indefinitely
one might but he was only gaining time for a plausible answer
out it came and he believed it as soon as it was spoken
the truth is i took oniton on account of evie
don't let this go any further
certainly not
i shouldn't like her to know that she nearly let me in for a very bad bargain
no sooner did i sign the agreement than she got engaged
poor little girl
she was so keen on it all and wouldn't even wait to make proper inquiries about the shooting
afraid it would get snapped upjust like all of your sex
well no harm's done
she has had her country wedding and i've got rid of my house to some fellows who are starting a preparatory school
where shall we live then henry
i should enjoy living somewhere
i have not yet decided
what about norfolk
margaret was silent
marriage had not saved her from the sense of flux
london was but a foretaste of this nomadic civilization which is altering human nature so profoundly and throws upon personal relations a stress greater than they have ever borne before
under cosmopolitanism if it comes we shall receive no help from the earth
trees and meadows and mountains will only be a spectacle and the binding force that they once exercised on character must be entrusted to love alone
may love be equal to the task
it is now what
continued henry
nearly october
let us camp for the winter at ducie street and look out for something in the spring
if possible something permanent
i can't be as young as i was for these alterations don't suit me 
but my dear which would you rather havealterations or rheumatism
i see your point said margaret getting up
if oniton is really damp it is impossible and must be inhabited by little boys
only in the spring let us look before we leap
i will take warning by evie and not hurry you
remember that you have a free hand this time
these endless moves must be bad for the furniture and are certainly expensive
what a practical little woman it is
what's it been reading
theotheohow much
theosophy
so ducie street was her first fatea pleasant enough fate
the house being only a little larger than wickham place trained her for the immense establishment that was promised in the spring
they were frequently away but at home life ran fairly regularly
in the morning henry went to the business and his sandwicha relic this of some prehistoric cravingwas always cut by her own hand
he did not rely upon the sandwich for lunch but liked to have it by him in case he grew hungry at eleven
when he had gone there was the house to look after and the servants to humanize and several kettles of helen's to keep on the boil
her conscience pricked her a little about the basts she was not sorry to have lost sight of them
no doubt leonard was worth helping but being henry's wife she preferred to help someone else
as for theatres and discussion societies they attracted her less and less
she began to miss new movements and to spend her spare time rereading or thinking rather to the concern of her chelsea friends
they attributed the change to her marriage and perhaps some deep instinct did warn her not to travel further from her husband than was inevitable
yet the main cause lay deeper still she had outgrown stimulants and was passing from words to things
it was doubtless a pity not to keep up with wedekind or john but some closing of the gates is inevitable after thirty if the mind itself is to become a creative power
chapter   she was looking at plans one day in the following springthey had finally decided to go down into sussex and buildwhen mrs charles wilcox was announced
have you heard the news
dolly cried as soon as she entered the room
charles is so angi mean he is sure you know about it or rather that you don't know
why dolly
said margaret placidly kissing her
here's a surprise
how are the boys and the baby
boys and the baby were well and in describing a great row that there had been at hilton tennis club dolly forgot her news
the wrong people had tried to get in
the rector as representing the older inhabitants had saidcharles had saidthe taxcollector had saidcharles had regretted not sayingand she closed the description with but lucky you with four courts of your own at midhurst
it will be very jolly replied margaret
are those the plans
does it matter me seeing them
of course not
charles has never seen the plans
they have only just arrived
here is the ground floorno that's rather difficult
try the elevation
we are to have a good many gables and a picturesque skyline
what makes it smell so funny
said dolly after a moment's inspection
she was incapable of understanding plans or maps
i suppose the paper
and which way up is it
just the ordinary way up
that's the skyline and the part that smells strongest is the sky
well ask me another
margaretohwhat was i going to say
how's helen
quite well
is she never coming back to england
every one thinks it's awfully odd she doesn't
so it is said margaret trying to conceal her vexation
she was getting rather sore on this point
helen is odd awfully
she has now been away eight months
but hasn't she any address
a poste restante somewhere in bavaria is her address
do write her a line
i will look it up for you
no don't bother
that's eight months she has been away surely
exactly
she left just after evie's wedding
it would be eight months
just when baby was born then
just so
dolly sighed and stared enviously round the drawingroom
she was beginning to lose her brightness and good looks
the charles' were not well off for mr wilcox having brought up his children with expensive tastes believed in letting them shift for themselves
after all he had not treated them generously
yet another baby was expected she told margaret and they would have to give up the motor
margaret sympathized but in a formal fashion and dolly little imagined that the stepmother was urging mr wilcox to make them a more liberal allowance
she sighed again and at last the particular grievance was remembered
oh yes she cried that is it miss avery has been unpacking your packingcases
why has she done that
how unnecessary
ask another
i suppose you ordered her to
i gave no such orders
perhaps she was airing the things
she did undertake to light an occasional fire
it was far more than an air said dolly solemnly
the floor sounds covered with books
charles sent me to know what is to be done for he feels certain you don't know
books
cried margaret moved by the holy word
dolly are you serious
has she been touching our books
hasn't she though
what used to be the hall's full of them
charles thought for certain you knew of it
i am very much obliged to you dolly
what can have come over miss avery
i must go down about it at once
some of the books are my brother's and are quite valuable
she had no right to open any of the cases
i say she's dotty
she was the one that never got married you know
oh i say perhaps she thinks your books are weddingpresents to herself
old maids are taken that way sometimes
miss avery hates us all like poison ever since her frightful dustup with evie
i hadn't heard of that said margaret
a visit from dolly had its compensations
didn't you know she gave evie a present last august and evie returned it and thenoh goloshes
you never read such a letter as miss avery wrote
but it was wrong of evie to return it
it wasn't like her to do such a heartless thing
but the present was so expensive
why does that make any difference dolly
still when it costs over five poundsi didn't see it but it was a lovely enamel pendant from a bond street shop
you can't very well accept that kind of thing from a farm woman
now can you
you accepted a present from miss avery when you were married
oh mine was old earthenware stuffnot worth a halfpenny
evie's was quite different
you'd have to ask anyone to the wedding who gave you a pendant like that
uncle percy and albert and father and charles all said it was quite impossible and when four men agree what is a girl to do
evie didn't want to upset the old thing so thought a sort of joking letter best and returned the pendant straight to the shop to save miss avery trouble
but miss avery said  dolly's eyes grew round
it was a perfectly awful letter
charles said it was the letter of a madman
in the end she had the pendant back again from the shop and threw it into the duckpond
did she give any reasons
we think she meant to be invited to oniton and so climb into society
she's rather old for that said margaret pensively
may not she have given the present to evie in remembrance of her mother
that's a notion
give every one their due eh
well i suppose i ought to be toddling
come along mr muffyou want a new coat but i don't know who'll give it you i'm sure and addressing her apparel with mournful humour dolly moved from the room
margaret followed her to ask whether henry knew about miss avery's rudeness
oh yes
i wonder then why he let me ask her to look after the house
but she's only a farm woman said dolly and her explanation proved correct
henry only censured the lower classes when it suited him
he bore with miss avery as with cranebecause he could get good value out of them
i have patience with a man who knows his job he would say really having patience with the job and not the man
paradoxical as it may sound he had something of the artist about him he would pass over an insult to his daughter sooner than lose a good charwoman for his wife
margaret judged it better to settle the little trouble herself
parties were evidently ruffled
with henry's permission she wrote a pleasant note to miss avery asking her to leave the cases untouched
then at the first convenient opportunity she went down herself intending to repack her belongings and store them properly in the local warehouse the plan had been amateurish and a failure
tibby promised to accompany her but at the last moment begged to be excused
so for the second time in her life she entered the house alone
chapter   the day of her visit was exquisite and the last of unclouded happiness that she was to have for many months
her anxiety about helen's extraordinary absence was still dormant and as for a possible brush with miss averythat only gave zest to the expedition
she had also eluded dolly's invitation to luncheon
walking straight up from the station she crossed the village green and entered the long chestnut avenue that connects it with the church
the church itself stood in the village once
but it there attracted so many worshippers that the devil in a pet snatched it from its foundations and poised it on an inconvenient knoll threequarters of a mile away
if this story is true the chestnut avenue must have been planted by the angels
no more tempting approach could be imagined for the lukewarm christian and if he still finds the walk too long the devil is defeated all the same science having built holy trinity a chapel of ease near the charles' and roofed it with tin
up the avenue margaret strolled slowly stopping to watch the sky that gleamed through the upper branches of the chestnuts or to finger the little horseshoes on the lower branches
why has not england a great mythology
our folklore has never advanced beyond daintiness and the greater melodies about our countryside have all issued through the pipes of greece
deep and true as the native imagination can be it seems to have failed here
it has stopped with the witches and the fairies
it cannot vivify one fraction of a summer field or give names to half a dozen stars
england still waits for the supreme moment of her literaturefor the great poet who shall voice her or better still for the thousand little poets whose voices shall pass into our common talk
at the church the scenery changed
the chestnut avenue opened into a road smooth but narrow which led into the untouched country
she followed it for over a mile
its little hesitations pleased her
having no urgent destiny it strolled downhill or up as it wished taking no trouble about the gradients nor about the view which nevertheless expanded
the great estates that throttle the south of hertfordshire were less obtrusive here and the appearance of the land was neither aristocratic nor suburban
to define it was difficult but margaret knew what it was not it was not snobbish
though its contours were slight there was a touch of freedom in their sweep to which surrey will never attain and the distant brow of the chilterns towered like a mountain
left to itself was margaret's opinion this county would vote liberal
the comradeship not passionate that is our highest gift as a nation was promised by it as by the low brick farm where she called for the key
but the inside of the farm was disappointing
a most finished young person received her
yes mrs wilcox no mrs wilcox oh yes mrs wilcox auntie received your letter quite duly
auntie has gone up to your little place at the present moment
shall i send the servant to direct you
followed by of course auntie does not generally look after your place she only does it to oblige a neighbour as something exceptional
it gives her something to do
she spends quite a lot of her time there
my husband says to me sometimes 'where's auntie'
i say 'need you ask
she's at howards end'
yes mrs wilcox
mrs wilcox could i prevail upon you to accept a piece of cake
not if i cut it for you
margaret refused the cake but unfortunately this acquired her gentility in the eyes of miss avery's niece
i cannot let you go on alone
now don't
you really mustn't
i will direct you myself if it comes to that
i must get my hat
nowroguishlymrs wilcox don't you move while i'm gone
stunned margaret did not move from the best parlour over which the touch of art nouveau had fallen
but the other rooms looked in keeping though they conveyed the peculiar sadness of a rural interior
here had lived an elder race to which we look back with disquietude
the country which we visit at weekends was really a home to it and the graver sides of life the deaths the partings the yearnings for love have their deepest expression in the heart of the fields
all was not sadness
the sun was shining without
the thrush sang his two syllables on the budding guelderrose
some children were playing uproariously in heaps of golden straw
it was the presence of sadness at all that surprised margaret and ended by giving her a feeling of completeness
in these english farms if anywhere one might see life steadily and see it whole group in one vision its transitoriness and its eternal youth connectconnect without bitterness until all men are brothers
but her thoughts were interrupted by the return of miss avery's niece and were so tranquillizing that she suffered the interruption gladly
it was quicker to go out by the back door and after due explanations they went out by it
the niece was now mortified by unnumerable chickens who rushed up to her feet for food and by a shameless and maternal sow
she did not know what animals were coming to
but her gentility withered at the touch of the sweet air
the wind was rising scattering the straw and ruffling the tails of the ducks as they floated in families over evie's pendant
one of those delicious gales of spring in which leaves stiff in bud seem to rustle swept over the land and then fell silent
georgia sang the thrush
cuckoo came furtively from the cliff of pinetrees
georgia pretty georgia and the other birds joined in with nonsense
the hedge was a halfpainted picture which would be finished in a few days
celandines grew on its banks lords and ladies and primroses in the defended hollows the wild rosebushes still bearing their withered hips showed also the promise of blossom
spring had come clad in no classical garb yet fairer than all springs fairer even than she who walks through the myrtles of tuscany with the graces before her and the zephyr behind
the two women walked up the lane full of outward civility
but margaret was thinking how difficult it was to be earnest about furniture on such a day and the niece was thinking about hats
thus engaged they reached howards end
petulant cries of auntie
severed the air
there was no reply and the front door was locked
are you sure that miss avery is up here
asked margaret
oh yes mrs wilcox quite sure
she is here daily
margaret tried to look in through the diningroom window but the curtain inside was drawn tightly
so with the drawingroom and the hall
the appearance of these curtains was familiar yet she did not remember them being there on her other visit her impression was that mr bryce had taken everything away
they tried the back
here again they received no answer and could see nothing the kitchenwindow was fitted with a blind while the pantry and scullery had pieces of wood propped up against them which looked ominously like the lids of packingcases
margaret thought of her books and she lifted up her voice also
at the first cry she succeeded
well well
replied someone inside the house
if it isn't mrs wilcox come at last
have you got the key auntie
madge go away said miss avery still invisible
auntie it's mrs wilcox  margaret supported her
your niece and i have come together  madge go away
this is no moment for your hat
the poor woman went red
auntie gets more eccentric lately she said nervously
miss avery
called margaret
i have come about the furniture
could you kindly let me in
yes mrs wilcox said the voice of course
but after that came silence
they called again without response
they walked round the house disconsolately
i hope miss avery is not ill hazarded margaret
well if you'll excuse me said madge perhaps i ought to be leaving you now
the servants need seeing to at the farm
auntie is so odd at times
gathering up her elegancies she retired defeated and as if her departure had loosed a spring the front door opened at once
miss avery said well come right in mrs
wilcox
quite pleasantly and calmly
thank you so much began margaret but broke off at the sight of an umbrellastand
it was her own
come right into the hall first said miss avery
she drew the curtain and margaret uttered a cry of despair
for an appalling thing had happened
the hall was fitted up with the contents of the library from wickham place
the carpet had been laid the big worktable drawn up near the window the bookcases filled the wall opposite the fireplace and her father's swordthis is what bewildered her particularlyhad been drawn from its scabbard and hung naked amongst the sober volumes
miss avery must have worked for days
i'm afraid this isn't what we meant she began
mr wilcox and i never intended the cases to be touched
for instance these books are my brother's
we are storing them for him and for my sister who is abroad
when you kindly undertook to look after things we never expected you to do so much
the house has been empty long enough said the old woman
margaret refused to argue
i dare say we didn't explain she said civilly
it has been a mistake and very likely our mistake
mrs wilcox it has been mistake upon mistake for fifty years
the house is mrs wilcox's and she would not desire it to stand empty any longer
to help the poor decaying brain margaret said  yes mrs wilcox's house the mother of mr
charles
mistake upon mistake said miss avery
mistake upon mistake
well i don't know said margaret sitting down in one of her own chairs
i really don't know what's to be done
she could not help laughing
the other said yes it should be a merry house enough
i don't knowi dare say
well thank you very much miss avery
yes that's all right
delightful
there is still the parlour
she went through the door opposite and drew a curtain
light flooded the drawingroom and the drawingroom furniture from wickham place
and the diningroom
more curtains were drawn more windows were flung open to the spring
then through here miss avery continued passing and repassing through the hall
her voice was lost but margaret heard her pulling up the kitchen blind
i've not finished here yet she announced returning
there's still a deal to do
the farm lads will carry your great wardrobes upstairs for there is no need to go into expense at hilton
it is all a mistake repeated margaret feeling that she must put her foot down
a misunderstanding
mr wilcox and i are not going to live at howards end
oh indeed
on account of his hay fever
we have settled to build a new home for ourselves in sussex and part of this furnituremy partwill go down there presently
she looked at miss avery intently trying to understand the kink in her brain
here was no maundering old woman
her wrinkles were shrewd and humorous
she looked capable of scathing wit and also of high but unostentatious nobility
you think that you won't come back to live here mrs wilcox but you will
that remains to be seen said margaret smiling
we have no intention of doing so for the present
we happen to need a much larger house
circumstances oblige us to give big parties
of course some dayone never knows does one
miss avery retorted some day
tcha
tcha
don't talk about some day
you are living here now
am i
you are living here and have been for the last ten minutes if you ask me
it was a senseless remark but with a queer feeling of disloyalty margaret rose from her chair
she felt that henry had been obscurely censured
they went into the diningroom where the sunlight poured in upon her mother's chiffonier and upstairs where many an old god peeped from a new niche
the furniture fitted extraordinarily well
in the central roomover the hall the room that helen had slept in four years agomiss avery had placed tibby's old bassinette
the nursery she said
margaret turned away without speaking
at last everything was seen
the kitchen and lobby were still stacked with furniture and straw but as far as she could make out nothing had been broken or scratched
a pathetic display of ingenuity
then they took a friendly stroll in the garden
it had gone wild since her last visit
the gravel sweep was weedy and grass had sprung up at the very jaws of the garage
and evie's rockery was only bumps
perhaps evie was responsible for miss avery's oddness
but margaret suspected that the cause lay deeper and that the girl's silly letter had but loosed the irritation of years
it's a beautiful meadow she remarked
it was one of those openair drawingrooms that have been formed hundreds of years ago out of the smaller fields
so the boundary hedge zigzagged down the hill at right angles and at the bottom there was a little green annexa sort of powdercloset for the cows
yes the maidy's well enough said miss avery for those that is who don't suffer from sneezing
and she cackled maliciously
i've seen charlie wilcox go out to my lads in hay timeoh they ought to do thisthey mustn't do thathe'd learn them to be lads
and just then the tickling took him
he has it from his father with other things
there's not one wilcox that can stand up against a field in junei laughed fit to burst while he was courting ruth
my brother gets hay fever too said margaret
this house lies too much on the land for them
naturally they were glad enough to slip in at first
but wilcoxes are better than nothing as i see you've found
margaret laughed
they keep a place going don't they
yes it is just that
they keep england going it is my opinion
but miss avery upset her by replying ay they breed like rabbits
well well it's a funny world
but he who made it knows what he wants in it i suppose
if mrs charlie is expecting her fourth it isn't for us to repine
they breed and they also work said margaret conscious of some invitation to disloyalty which was echoed by the very breeze and by the songs of the birds
it certainly is a funny world but so long as men like my husband and his sons govern it i think it'll never be a bad onenever really bad
no better'n nothing said miss avery and turned to the wychelm
on their way back to the farm she spoke of her old friend much more clearly than before
in the house margaret had wondered whether she quite distinguished the first wife from the second
now she said i never saw much of ruth after her grandmother died but we stayed civil
it was a very civil family
old mrs howard never spoke against anybody nor let anyone be turned away without food
then it was never 'trespassers will be prosecuted' in their land but would people please not come in
mrs howard was never created to run a farm
had they no men to help them
margaret asked
miss avery replied things went on until there were no men
until mr wilcox came along corrected margaret anxious that her husband should receive his dues
i suppose so but ruth should have married ano disrespect to you to say this for i take it you were intended to get wilcox any way whether she got him first or no
whom should she have married
a soldier
exclaimed the old woman
some real soldier
margaret was silent
it was a criticism of henry's character far more trenchant than any of her own
she felt dissatisfied
but that's all over she went on
a better time is coming now though you've kept me long enough waiting
in a couple of weeks i'll see your lights shining through the hedge of an evening
have you ordered in coals
we are not coming said margaret firmly
she respected miss avery too much to humour her
no
not coming
never coming
it has all been a mistake
the furniture must be repacked at once and i am very sorry but i am making other arrangements and must ask you to give me the keys
certainly mrs wilcox said miss avery and resigned her duties with a smile
relieved at this conclusion and having sent her compliments to madge margaret walked back to the station
she had intended to go to the furniture warehouse and give directions for removal but the muddle had turned out more extensive than she expected so she decided to consult henry
it was as well that she did this
he was strongly against employing the local man whom he had previously recommended and advised her to store in london after all
but before this could be done an unexpected trouble fell upon her
chapter   it was not unexpected entirely
aunt juley's health had been bad all the winter
she had had a long series of colds and coughs and had been too busy to get rid of them
she had scarcely promised her niece to really take my tiresome chest in hand when she caught a chill and developed acute pneumonia
margaret and tibby went down to swanage
helen was telegraphed for and that spring party that after all gathered in that hospitable house had all the pathos of fair memories
on a perfect day when the sky seemed blue porcelain and the waves of the discreet little bay beat gentlest of tattoos upon the sand margaret hurried up through the rhododendrons confronted again by the senselessness of death
one death may explain itself but it throws no light upon another the groping inquiry must begin anew
preachers or scientists may generalize but we know that no generality is possible about those whom we love not one heaven awaits them not even one oblivion
aunt juley incapable of tragedy slipped out of life with odd little laughs and apologies for having stopped in it so long
she was very weak she could not rise to the occasion or realize the great mystery which all agree must await her it only seemed to her that she was quite done upmore done up than ever before that she saw and heard and felt less every moment and that unless something changed she would soon feel nothing
her spare strength she devoted to plans could not margaret take some steamer expeditions
were mackerel cooked as tibby liked them
she worried herself about helen's absence and also that she could be the cause of helen's return
the nurses seemed to think such interests quite natural and perhaps hers was an average approach to the great gate
but margaret saw death stripped of any false romance whatever the idea of death may contain the process can be trivial and hideous
importantmargaret dear take the lulworth when helen comes
helen won't be able to stop aunt juley
she has telegraphed that she can only get away just to see you
she must go back to germany as soon as you are well
how very odd of helen
mr wilcox  yes dear
can he spare you
henry wished her to come and had been very kind
yet again margaret said so
mrs munt did not die
quite outside her will a more dignified power took hold of her and checked her on the downward slope
she returned without emotion as fidgety as ever
on the fourth day she was out of danger
margaretimportant it went on i should like you to have some companion to take walks with
do try miss conder
i have been a little walk with miss conder
but she is not really interesting
if only you had helen
i have tibby aunt juley
no but he has to do his chinese
some real companion is what you need
really helen is odd
helen is odd very agreed margaret
not content with going abroad why does she want to go back there at once
no doubt she will change her mind when she sees us
she has not the least balance
that was the stock criticism about helen but margaret's voice trembled as she made it
by now she was deeply pained at her sister's behaviour
it may be unbalanced to fly out of england but to stop away eight months argues that the heart is awry as well as the head
a sickbed could recall helen but she was deaf to more human calls after a glimpse at her aunt she would retire into her nebulous life behind some poste restante
she scarcely existed her letters had become dull and infrequent she had no wants and no curiosity
and it was all put down to poor henry's account
henry long pardoned by his wife was still too infamous to be greeted by his sisterinlaw
it was morbid and to her alarm margaret fancied that she could trace the growth of morbidity back in helen's life for nearly four years
the flight from oniton the unbalanced patronage of the basts the explosion of grief up on the downsall connected with paul an insignificant boy whose lips had kissed hers for a fraction of time
margaret and mrs wilcox had feared that they might kiss again
foolishly the real danger was reaction
reaction against the wilcoxes had eaten into her life until she was scarcely sane
at twentyfive she had an idee fixe
what hope was there for her as an old woman
the more margaret thought about it the more alarmed she became
for many months she had put the subject away but it was too big to be slighted now
there was almost a taint of madness
were all helen's actions to be governed by a tiny mishap such as may happen to any young man or woman
can human nature be constructed on lines so insignificant
the blundering little encounter at howards end was vital
it propagated itself where graver intercourse lay barren it was stronger than sisterly intimacy stronger than reason or books
in one of her moods helen had confessed that she still enjoyed it in a certain sense
paul had faded but the magic of his caress endured
and where there is enjoyment of the past there may also be reactionpropagation at both ends
well it is odd and sad that our minds should be such seedbeds and we without power to choose the seed
but man is an odd sad creature as yet intent on pilfering the earth and heedless of the growths within himself
he cannot be bored about psychology
he leaves it to the specialist which is as if he should leave his dinner to be eaten by a steamengine
he cannot be bothered to digest his own soul
margaret and helen have been more patient and it is suggested that margaret has succeededso far as success is yet possible
she does understand herself she has some rudimentary control over her own growth
whether helen has succeeded one cannot say
the day that mrs munt rallied helen's letter arrived
she had posted it at munich and would be in london herself on the morrow
it was a disquieting letter though the opening was affectionate and sane
dearest meg  give helen's love to aunt juley
tell her that i love and have loved her ever since i can remember
i shall be in london thursday
my address will be care of the bankers
i have not yet settled on a hotel so write or wire to me there and give me detailed news
if aunt juley is much better or if for a terrible reason it would be no good my coming down to swanage you must not think it odd if i do not come
i have all sorts of plans in my head
i am living abroad at present and want to get back as quickly as possible
will you please tell me where our furniture is
i should like to take out one or two books the rest are for you
forgive me dearest meg
this must read like rather a tiresome letter but all letters are from your loving                                                    helen   it was a tiresome letter for it tempted margaret to tell a lie
if she wrote that aunt juley was still in danger her sister would come
unhealthiness is contagious
we cannot be in contact with those who are in a morbid state without ourselves deteriorating
to act for the best might do helen good but would do herself harm and at the risk of disaster she kept her colours flying a little longer
she replied that their aunt was much better and awaited developments
tibby approved of her reply
mellowing rapidly he was a pleasanter companion than before
oxford had done much for him
he had lost his peevishness and could hide his indifference to people and his interest in food
but he had not grown more human
the years between eighteen and twentytwo so magical for most were leading him gently from boyhood to middle age
he had never known youngmanliness that quality which warms the heart till death and gives mr wilcox an imperishable charm
he was frigid through no fault of his own and without cruelty
he thought helen wrong and margaret right but the family trouble was for him what a scene behind footlights is for most people
he had only one suggestion to make and that was characteristic
why don't you tell mr
wilcox
about helen
perhaps he has come across that sort of thing
he would do all he could but  oh you know best
but he is practical
it was the student's belief in experts
margaret demurred for one or two reasons
presently helen's answer came
she sent a telegram requesting the address of the furniture as she would now return at once
margaret replied certainly not meet me at the bankers at four
she and tibby went up to london
helen was not at the bankers and they were refused her address
helen had passed into chaos
margaret put her arm round her brother
he was all that she had left and never had he seemed more unsubstantial
tibby love what next
he replied it is extraordinary
dear your judgment's often clearer than mine
have you any notion what's at the back
none unless it's something mental
ohthat
said margaret
quite impossible
but the suggestion had been uttered and in a few minutes she took it up herself
nothing else explained
and london agreed with tibby
the mask fell off the city and she saw it for what it really isa caricature of infinity
the familiar barriers the streets along which she moved the houses between which she had made her little journeys for so many years became negligible suddenly
helen seemed one with grimy trees and the traffic and the slowlyflowing slabs of mud
she had accomplished a hideous act of renunciation and returned to the one
margaret's own faith held firm
she knew the human soul will be merged if it be merged at all with the stars and the sea
yet she felt that her sister had been going amiss for many years
it was symbolic the catastrophe should come now on a london afternoon while rain fell slowly
henry was the only hope
henry was definite
he might know of some paths in the chaos that were hidden from them and she determined to take tibby's advice and lay the whole matter in his hands
they must call at his office
he could not well make it worse
she went for a few moments into st paul's whose dome stands out of the welter so bravely as if preaching the gospel of form
but within st  paul's is as its surroundingsechoes and whispers inaudible songs invisible mosaics wet footmarks crossing and recrossing the floor
si monumentum requiris circumspice it points us back to london
there was no hope of helen here
henry was unsatisfactory at first
that she had expected
he was overjoyed to see her back from swanage and slow to admit the growth of a new trouble
when they told him of their search he only chaffed tibby and the schlegels generally and declared that it was just like helen to lead her relatives a dance
that is what we all say replied margaret
but why should it be just like helen
why should she be allowed to be so queer and to grow queerer
don't ask me
i'm a plain man of business
i live and let live
my advice to you both is don't worry
margaret you've got black marks again under your eyes
you know that's strictly forbidden
first your auntthen your sister
no we aren't going to have it
are we theobald
he rang the bell
i'll give you some tea and then you go straight to ducie street
i can't have my girl looking as old as her husband
all the same you have not quite seen our point said tibby
mr wilcox who was in good spirits retorted i don't suppose i ever shall
he leant back laughing at the gifted but ridiculous family while the fire flickered over the map of africa
margaret motioned to her brother to go on
rather diffident he obeyed her
margaret's point is this he said
our sister may be mad
charles who was working in the inner room looked round
come in charles said margaret kindly
could you help us at all
we are again in trouble
i'm afraid i cannot
what are the facts
we are all mad more or less you know in these days
the facts are as follows replied tibby who had at times a pedantic lucidity
the facts are that she has been in england for three days and will not see us
she has forbidden the bankers to give us her address
she refuses to answer questions
margaret finds her letters colourless
there are other facts but these are the most striking
she has never behaved like this before then
asked henry
of course not
said his wife with a frown
well my dear how am i to know
a senseless spasm of annoyance came over her
you know quite well that helen never sins against affection she said
you must have noticed that much in her surely
oh yes she and i have always hit it off together
no henrycan't you see
i don't mean that
she recovered herself but not before charles had observed her
stupid and attentive he was watching the scene
i was meaning that when she was eccentric in the past one could trace it back to the heart in the long run
she behaved oddly because she cared for someone or wanted to help them
there's no possible excuse for her now
she is grieving us deeply and that is why i am sure that she is not well
'mad' is too terrible a word but she is not well
i shall never believe it
i shouldn't discuss my sister with you if i thought she was welltrouble you about her i mean
henry began to grow serious
illhealth was to him something perfectly definite
generally well himself he could not realize that we sink to it by slow gradations
the sick had no rights they were outside the pale one could lie to them remorselessly
when his first wife was seized he had promised to take her down into hertfordshire but meanwhile arranged with a nursinghome instead
helen too was ill  and the plan that he sketched out for her capture clever and wellmeaning as it was drew its ethics from the wolfpack
you want to get hold of her
he said
that's the problem isn't it
she has got to see a doctor
for all i know she has seen one already
yes yes don't interrupt
he rose to his feet and thought intently
the genial tentative host disappeared and they saw instead the man who had carved money out of greece and africa and bought forests from the natives for a few bottles of gin
i've got it he said at last
it's perfectly easy
leave it to me
we'll send her down to howards end
how will you do that
after her books
tell her that she must unpack them herself
then you can meet her there
but henry that's just what she won't let me do
it's part of herwhatever it isnever to see me
of course you won't tell her you're going
when she is there looking at the cases you'll just stroll in
if nothing is wrong with her so much the better
but there'll be the motor round the corner and we can run her up to a specialist in no time
margaret shook her head
it's quite impossible
why
it doesn't seem impossible to me said tibby it is surely a very tippy plan
it is impossible because she looked at her husband sadly
it's not the particular language that helen and i talk if you see my meaning
it would do splendidly for other people whom i don't blame
but helen doesn't talk said tibby
that's our whole difficulty
she won't talk your particular language and on that account you think she's ill  no henry it's sweet of you but i couldn't
i see he said you have scruples
i suppose so
and sooner than go against them you would have your sister suffer
you could have got her down to swanage by a word but you had scruples
and scruples are all very well
i am as scrupulous as any man alive i hope but when it is a case like this when there is a question of madness  i deny it's madness
you said just now  it's madness when i say it but not when you say it
henry shrugged his shoulders
margaret
margaret
he groaned
no education can teach a woman logic
now my dear my time is valuable
do you want me to help you or not
not in that way
answer my question
plain question plain answer
do  charles surprised them by interrupting
pater we may as well keep howards end out of it he said
why charles
charles could give no reason but margaret felt as if over tremendous distance a salutation had passed between them
the whole house is at sixes and sevens he said crossly
we don't want any more mess
who's 'we'
asked his father
my boy pray who's 'we'
i am sure i beg your pardon said charles
i appear always to be intruding
by now margaret wished she had never mentioned her trouble to her husband
retreat was impossible
he was determined to push the matter to a satisfactory conclusion and helen faded as he talked
her fair flying hair and eager eyes counted for nothing for she was ill without rights and any of her friends might hunt her
sick at heart margaret joined in the chase
she wrote her sister a lying letter at her husband's dictation she said the furniture was all at howards end but could be seen on monday next at  pm when a charwoman would be in attendance
it was a cold letter and the more plausible for that
helen would think she was offended
and on monday next she and henry were to lunch with dolly and then ambush themselves in the garden
after they had gone mr wilcox said to his son i can't have this sort of behaviour my boy
margaret's too sweetnatured to mind but i mind for her
charles made no answer
is anything wrong with you charles this afternoon
no pater but you may be taking on a bigger business than you reckon
how
don't ask me
chapter   one speaks of the moods of spring but the days that are her true children have only one mood they are all full of the rising and dropping of winds and the whistling of birds
new flowers may come out the green embroidery of the hedges increase but the same heaven broods overhead soft thick and blue the same figures seen and unseen are wandering by coppice and meadow
the morning that margaret had spent with miss avery and the afternoon she set out to entrap helen were the scales of a single balance
time might never have moved rain never have fallen and man alone with his schemes and ailments was troubling nature until he saw her through a veil of tears
she protested no more
whether henry was right or wrong he was most kind and she knew of no other standard by which to judge him
she must trust him absolutely
as soon as he had taken up a business his obtuseness vanished
he profited by the slightest indications and the capture of helen promised to be staged as deftly as the marriage of evie
they went down in the morning as arranged and he discovered that their victim was actually in hilton
on his arrival he called at all the liverystables in the village and had a few minutes' serious conversation with the proprietors
what he said margaret did not knowperhaps not the truth but news arrived after lunch that a lady had come by the london train and had taken a fly to howards end
she was bound to drive said henry
there will be her books
i cannot make it out said margaret for the hundredth time
finish your coffee dear
we must be off
yes margaret you know you must take plenty said dolly
margaret tried but suddenly lifted her hand to her eyes
dolly stole glances at her fatherinlaw which he did not answer
in the silence the motor came round to the door
you're not fit for it he said anxiously
let me go alone
i know exactly what to do
oh yes i am fit said margaret uncovering her face
only most frightfully worried
i cannot feel that helen is really alive
her letters and telegrams seem to have come from someone else
her voice isn't in them
i don't believe your driver really saw her at the station
i wish i'd never mentioned it
i know that charles is vexed
yes he is she seized dolly's hand and kissed it
there dolly will forgive me
there
now we'll be off
henry had been looking at her closely
he did not like this breakdown
don't you want to tidy yourself
he asked
have i time
yes plenty
she went to the lavatory by the front door and as soon as the bolt slipped mr wilcox said quietly  dolly i'm going without her
dolly's eyes lit up with vulgar excitement
she followed him on tiptoe out to the car
tell her i thought it best
yes mr wilcox i see
say anything you like
all right
the car started well and with ordinary luck would have got away
but porglywoggles who was playing in the garden chose this moment to sit down in the middle of the path
crane in trying to pass him ran one wheel over a bed of wallflowers
dolly screamed
margaret hearing the noise rushed out hatless and was in time to jump on the footboard
she said not a single word he was only treating her as she had treated helen and her rage at his dishonesty only helped to indicate what helen would feel against them
she thought i deserve it i am punished for lowering my colours
and she accepted his apologies with a calmness that astonished him
i still consider you are not fit for it he kept saying
perhaps i was not at lunch
but the whole thing is spread clearly before me now
i was meaning to act for the best
just lend me your scarf will you
this wind takes one's hair so
certainly dear girl
are you all right now
look
my hands have stopped trembling
and have quite forgiven me
then listen
her cab should already have arrived at howards end
we're a little late but no matter
our first move will be to send it down to wait at the farm as if possible one doesn't want a scene before servants
a certain gentlemanhe pointed at crane's backwon't drive in but will wait a little short of the front gate behind the laurels
have you still the keys of the house
yes
well they aren't wanted
do you remember how the house stands
yes
if we don't find her in the porch we can stroll round into the garden
our object  here they stopped to pick up the doctor
i was just saying to my wife mansbridge that our main object is not to frighten miss schlegel
the house as you know is my property so it should seem quite natural for us to be there
the trouble is evidently nervouswouldn't you say so margaret
the doctor a very young man began to ask questions about helen
was she normal
was there anything congenital or hereditary
had anything occurred that was likely to alienate her from her family
nothing answered margaret wondering what would have happened if she had added though she did resent my husband's immorality
she always was highly strung pursued henry leaning back in the car as it shot past the church
a tendency to spiritualism and those things though nothing serious
musical literary artistic but i should say normala very charming girl
margaret's anger and terror increased every moment
how dare these men label her sister
what horrors lay ahead
what impertinences that shelter under the name of science
the pack was turning on helen to deny her human rights and it seemed to margaret that all schlegels were threatened with her
were they normal
what a question to ask
and it is always those who know nothing about human nature who are bored by psychology and shocked by physiology who ask it
however piteous her sister's state she knew that she must be on her side
they would be mad together if the world chose to consider them so
it was now five minutes past three
the car slowed down by the farm in the yard of which miss avery was standing
henry asked her whether a cab had gone past
she nodded and the next moment they caught sight of it at the end of the lane
the car ran silently like a beast of prey
so unsuspicious was helen that she was sitting on the porch with her back to the road
she had come
only her head and shoulders were visible
she sat framed in the vine and one of her hands played with the buds
the wind ruffled her hair the sun glorified it she was as she had always been
margaret was seated next to the door
before her husband could prevent her she slipped out
she ran to the garden gate which was shut passed through it and deliberately pushed it in his face
the noise alarmed helen
margaret saw her rise with an unfamiliar movement and rushing into the porch learnt the simple explanation of all their fearsher sister was with child
is the truant all right
called henry
she had time to whisper oh my darling the keys of the house were in her hand
she unlocked howards end and thrust helen into it
yes all right she said and stood with her back to the door
chapter   margaret you look upset
said henry
mansbridge had followed
crane was at the gate and the flyman had stood up on the box
margaret shook her head at them she could not speak any more
she remained clutching the keys as if all their future depended on them
henry was asking more questions
she shook her head again
his words had no sense
she heard him wonder why she had let helen in
you might have given me a knock with the gate was another of his remarks
presently she heard herself speaking
she or someone for her said go away
henry came nearer
he repeated margaret you look upset again
my dear give me the keys
what are you doing with helen
oh dearest do go away and i will manage it all
manage what
he stretched out his hand for the keys
she might have obeyed if it had not been for the doctor
stop that at least she said piteously the doctor had turned back and was questioning the driver of helen's cab
a new feeling came over her she was fighting for women against men
she did not care about rights but if men came into howards end it should be over her body
come this is an odd beginning said her husband
the doctor came forward now and whispered two words to mr wilcoxthe scandal was out
sincerely horrified henry stood gazing at the earth
i cannot help it said margaret
do wait
it's not my fault
please all four of you to go away now
now the flyman was whispering to crane
we are relying on you to help us mrs wilcox said the young doctor
could you go in and persuade your sister to come out
on what grounds
said margaret suddenly looking him straight in the eyes
thinking it professional to prevaricate he murmured something about a nervous breakdown
i beg your pardon but it is nothing of the sort
you are not qualified to attend my sister mr mansbridge
if we require your services we will let you know
i can diagnose the case more bluntly if you wish he retorted
you could but you have not
you are therefore not qualified to attend my sister
come come margaret
said henry never raising his eyes
this is a terrible business an appalling business
it's doctor's orders
open the door
forgive me but i will not
i don't agree
margaret was silent
this business is as broad as it's long contributed the doctor
we had better all work together
you need us mrs wilcox and we need you
quite so said henry
i do not need you in the least said margaret
the two men looked at each other anxiously
no more does my sister who is still many weeks from her confinement
margaret margaret
well henry send your doctor away
what possible use is he now
mr wilcox ran his eye over the house
he had a vague feeling that he must stand firm and support the doctor
he himself might need support for there was trouble ahead
it all turns on affection now said margaret
affection
don't you see
resuming her usual methods she wrote the word on the house with her finger
surely you see
i like helen very much you not so much
mr mansbridge doesn't know her
that's all
and affection when reciprocated gives rights
put that down in your notebook mr mansbridge
it's a useful formula
henry told her to be calm
you don't know what you want yourselves said margaret folding her arms
for one sensible remark i will let you in
but you cannot make it
you would trouble my sister for no reason
i will not permit it
i'll stand here all the day sooner
mansbridge said henry in a low voice perhaps not now
the pack was breaking up
at a sign from his master crane also went back into the car
now henry you she said gently
none of her bitterness had been directed at him
go away now dear
i shall want your advice later no doubt
forgive me if i have been cross
but seriously you must go
he was too stupid to leave her
now it was mr mansbridge who called in a low voice to him
i shall soon find you down at dolly's she called as the gate at last clanged between them
the fly moved out of the way the motor backed turned a little backed again and turned in the narrow road
a string of farm carts came up in the middle but she waited through all for there was no hurry
when all was over and the car had started she opened the door
oh my darling
she said
my darling forgive me
helen was standing in the hall
chapter   margaret bolted the door on the inside
then she would have kissed her sister but helen in a dignified voice that came strangely from her said  convenient
you did not tell me that the books were unpacked
i have found nearly everything that i want
i told you nothing that was true
it has been a great surprise certainly
has aunt juley been ill
helen you wouldn't think i'd invent that
i suppose not said helen turning away and crying a very little
but one loses faith in everything after this
we thought it was illness but even theni haven't behaved worthily
helen selected another book
i ought not to have consulted anyone
what would our father have thought of me
she did not think of questioning her sister nor of rebuking her
both might be necessary in the future but she had first to purge a greater crime than any that helen could have committedthat want of confidence that is the work of the devil
yes i am annoyed replied helen
my wishes should have been respected
i would have gone through this meeting if it was necessary but after aunt juley recovered it was not necessary
planning my life as i now have to do  come away from those books called margaret
helen do talk to me
i was just saying that i have stopped living haphazard
one can't go through a great deal ofshe missed out the nounwithout planning one's actions in advance
i am going to have a child in june and in the first place conversations discussions excitement are not good for me
i will go through them if necessary but only then
in the second place i have no right to trouble people
i cannot fit in with england as i know it
i have done something that the english never pardon
it would not be right for them to pardon it
so i must live where i am not known
but why didn't you tell me dearest
yes replied helen judicially
i might have but decided to wait
 i believe you would never have told me
oh yes i should
we have taken a flat in munich
margaret glanced out of window
by 'we' i mean myself and monica
but for her i am and have been and always wish to be alone
i have not heard of monica
you wouldn't have
she's an italianby birth at least
she makes her living by journalism
i met her originally on garda
monica is much the best person to see me through
you are very fond of her then
she has been extraordinarily sensible with me
margaret guessed at monica's typeitaliano inglesiato they had named it the crude feminist of the south whom one respects but avoids
and helen had turned to it in her need
you must not think that we shall never meet said helen with a measured kindness
i shall always have a room for you when you can be spared and the longer you can be with me the better
but you haven't understood yet meg and of course it is very difficult for you
this is a shock to you
it isn't to me who have been thinking over our futures for many months and they won't be changed by a slight contretemps such as this
i cannot live in england
helen you've not forgiven me for my treachery
you couldn't talk like this to me if you had
oh meg dear why do we talk at all
she dropped a book and sighed wearily
then recovering herself she said tell me how is it that all the books are down here
series of mistakes
and a great deal of the furniture has been unpacked
all
who lives here then
no one
i suppose you are letting it though  the house is dead said margaret with a frown
why worry on about it
but i am interested
you talk as if i had lost all my interest in life
i am still helen i hope
now this hasn't the feel of a dead house
the hall seems more alive even than in the old days when it held the wilcoxes' own things
interested are you
very well i must tell you i suppose
my husband lent it on condition webut by a mistake all our things were unpacked and miss avery instead of she stopped
look here i can't go on like this
i warn you i won't
helen why should you be so miserably unkind to me simply because you hate henry
i don't hate him now said helen
i have stopped being a schoolgirl and meg once again i'm not being unkind
but as for fitting in with your english lifeno put it out of your head at once
imagine a visit from me at ducie street
it's unthinkable
margaret could not contradict her
it was appalling to see her quietly moving forward with her plans not bitter or excitable neither asserting innocence nor confessing guilt merely desiring freedom and the company of those who would not blame her
she had been throughhow much
margaret did not know
but it was enough to part her from old habits as well as old friends
tell me about yourself said helen who had chosen her books and was lingering over the furniture
there's nothing to tell
but your marriage has been happy meg
yes but i don't feel inclined to talk
you feel as i do
not that but i can't
no more can i
it is a nuisance but no good trying
something had come between them
perhaps it was society which henceforward would exclude helen
perhaps it was a third life already potent as a spirit
they could find no meetingplace
both suffered acutely and were not comforted by the knowledge that affection survived
look here meg is the coast clear
you mean that you want to go away from me
i suppose sodear old lady
it isn't any use
i knew we should have nothing to say
give my love to aunt juley and tibby and take more yourself than i can say
promise to come and see me in munich later
certainly dearest
for that is all we can do
it seemed so
most ghastly of all was helen's common sense monica had been extraordinarily good for her
i am glad to have seen you and the things
she looked at the bookcase lovingly as if she was saying farewell to the past
margaret unbolted the door
she remarked the car has gone and here's your cab
she led the way to it glancing at the leaves and the sky
the spring had never seemed more beautiful
the driver who was leaning on the gate called out please lady a message and handed her henry's visitingcard through the bars
how did this come
she asked
crane had returned with it almost at once
she read the card with annoyance
it was covered with instructions in domestic french
when she and her sister had talked she was to come back for the night to dolly's
il faut dormir sur ce sujet
while helen was to be found une comfortable chambre a l'hotel
the final sentence displeased her greatly until she remembered that the charles' had only one spare room and so could not invite a third guest
henry would have done what he could she interpreted
helen had not followed her into the garden
the door once open she lost her inclination to fly
she remained in the hall going from bookcase to table
she grew more like the old helen irresponsible and charming
this is mr wilcox's house
she inquired
surely you remember howards end
remember
i who remember everything
but it looks to be ours now
miss avery was extraordinary said margaret her own spirits lightening a little
again she was invaded by a slight feeling of disloyalty
but it brought her relief and she yielded to it
she loved mrs wilcox and would rather furnish her house with our things than think of it empty
in consequence here are all the library books 
not all the books
she hasn't unpacked the art books in which she may show her sense
and we never used to have the sword here
the sword looks well though
magnificent
yes doesn't it
where's the piano meg
i warehoused that in london
why
nothing
curious too that the carpet fits
the carpet's a mistake announced helen
i know that we had it in london but this floor ought to be bare
it is far too beautiful
you still have a mania for underfurnishing
would you care to come into the diningroom before you start
there's no carpet there
they went in and each minute their talk became more natural
oh what a place for mother's chiffonier
cried helen
look at the chairs though
oh look at them
wickham place faced north didn't it
northwest
anyhow it is thirty years since any of those chairs have felt the sun
feel
their little backs are quite warm
but why has miss avery made them set to partners
i shall just  over here meg
put it so that any one sitting will see the lawn
margaret moved a chair
helen sat down in it
yees
the window's too high
try a drawingroom chair
no i don't like the drawingroom so much
the beam has been matchboarded
it would have been so beautiful otherwise 
helen what a memory you have for some things
you're perfectly right
it's a room that men have spoilt through trying to make it nice for women
men don't know what we want  and never will
i don't agree
in two thousand years they'll know
but the chairs show up wonderfully
look where tibby spilt the soup
coffee
it was coffee surely
helen shook her head
impossible
tibby was far too young to be given coffee at that time
was father alive
yes
then you're right and it must have been soup
i was thinking of much laterthat unsuccessful visit of aunt juley's when she didn't realize that tibby had grown up
it was coffee then for he threw it down on purpose
there was some rhyme 'tea coffeecoffee tea' that she said to him every morning at breakfast
wait a minutehow did it go
i knowno i don't
what a detestable boy tibby was
but the rhyme was simply awful
no decent person could have put up with it
ah that greengage tree cried helen as if the garden was also part of their childhood
why do i connect it with dumbbells
and there come the chickens
the grass wants cutting
i love yellowhammers  margaret interrupted her
i have got it she announced
'tea tea coffee teabr    or chocolaritee'
that every morning for three weeks
no wonder tibby was wild
tibby is moderately a dear now said helen
there
i knew you'd say that in the end
of course he's a dear
a bell rang
listen
what's that
helen said perhaps the wilcoxes are beginning the siege
what nonsenselisten
and the triviality faded from their faces though it left something behindthe knowledge that they never could be parted because their love was rooted in common things
explanations and appeals had failed they had tried for a common meetingground and had only made each other unhappy
and all the time their salvation was lying round themthe past sanctifying the present the present with wild heartthrob declaring that there would after all be a future with laughter and the voices of children
helen still smiling came up to her sister
she said it is always meg
they looked into each other's eyes
the inner life had paid
solemnly the clapper tolled
no one was in the front
margaret went to the kitchen and struggled between packingcases to the window
their visitor was only a little boy with a tin can
and triviality returned
little boy what do you want
please i am the milk
did miss avery send you
said margaret rather sharply
yes please
then take it back and say we require no milk
while she called to helen no it's not the siege but possibly an attempt to provision us against one
but i like milk cried helen
why send it away
do you
oh very well
but we've nothing to put it in and he wants the can
please i'm to call in the morning for the can said the boy
the house will be locked up then
in the morning would i bring eggs too
are you the boy whom i saw playing in the stacks last week
the child hung his head
well run away and do it again
nice little boy whispered helen
i say what's your name
mine's helen
tom
that was helen all over
the wilcoxes too would ask a child its name but they never told their names in return
tom this one here is margaret
and at home we've another called tibby
mine are lopeared replied tom supposing tibby to be a rabbit
you're a very good and rather a clever little boy
mind you come againisn't he charming
undoubtedly said margaret
he is probably the son of madge and madge is dreadful
but this place has wonderful powers
what do you mean
i don't know
because i probably agree with you
it kills what is dreadful and makes what is beautiful live
i do agree said helen as she sipped the milk
but you said that the house was dead not half an hour ago
meaning that i was dead
i felt it
yes the house has a surer life than we even if it was empty and as it is i can't get over that for thirty years the sun has never shone full on our furniture
after all wickham place was a grave
meg i've a startling idea
what is it
drink some milk to steady you
margaret obeyed
no i won't tell you yet said helen because you may laugh or be angry
let's go upstairs first and give the rooms an airing
they opened window after window till the inside too was rustling to the spring
curtains blew pictureframes tapped cheerfully
helen uttered cries of excitement as she found this bed obviously in its right place that in its wrong one
she was angry with miss avery for not having moved the wardrobes up
then one would see really
she admired the view
she was the helen who had written the memorable letters four years ago
as they leant out looking westward she said about my idea
couldn't you and i camp out in this house for the night
i don't think we could well do that said margaret
here are beds tables towels  i know but the house isn't supposed to be slept in and henry's suggestion was  i require no suggestions
i shall not alter anything in my plans
but it would give me so much pleasure to have one night here with you
it will be something to look back on
oh meg lovey do let's
but helen my pet said margaret we can't without getting henry's leave
of course he would give it but you said yourself that you couldn't visit at ducie street now and this is equally intimate
ducie street is his house
this is ours
our furniture our sort of people coming to the door
do let us camp out just one night and tom shall feed us on eggs and milk
why not
it's a moon
margaret hesitated
i feel charles wouldn't like it she said at last
even our furniture annoyed him and i was going to clear it out when aunt juley's illness prevented me
i sympathize with charles
he feels it's his mother's house
he loves it in rather an untaking way
henry i could answer fornot charles
i know he won't like it said helen
but i am going to pass out of their lives
what difference will it make in the long run if they say 'and she even spent the night at howards end'
how do you know you'll pass out of their lives
we have thought that twice before
because my plans  which you change in a moment
then because my life is great and theirs are little said helen taking fire
i know of things they can't know of and so do you
we know that there's poetry
we know that there's death
they can only take them on hearsay
we know this is our house because it feels ours
oh they may take the titledeeds and the doorkeys but for this one night we are at home
it would be lovely to have you once more alone said margaret
it may be a chance in a thousand
yes and we could talk
she dropped her voice
it won't be a very glorious story
but under that wychelmhonestly i see little happiness ahead
cannot i have this one night with you
i needn't say how much it would mean to me
then let us
it is no good hesitating
shall i drive down to hilton now and get leave
oh we don't want leave
but margaret was a loyal wife
in spite of imagination and poetryperhaps on account of themshe could sympathize with the technical attitude that henry would adopt
if possible she would be technical too
a night's lodgingand they demanded no moreneed not involve the discussion of general principles
charles may say no grumbled helen
we shan't consult him
go if you like i should have stopped without leave
it was the touch of selfishness which was not enough to mar helen's character and even added to its beauty
she would have stopped without leave and escaped to germany the next morning
margaret kissed her
expect me back before dark
i am looking forward to it so much
it is like you to have thought of such a beautiful thing
not a thing only an ending said helen rather sadly and the sense of tragedy closed in on margaret again as soon as she left the house
she was afraid of miss avery
it is disquieting to fulfil a prophecy however superficially
she was glad to see no watching figure as she drove past the farm but only little tom turning somersaults in the straw
chapter   the tragedy began quietly enough and like many another talk by the man's deft assertion of his superiority
henry heard her arguing with the driver stepped out and settled the fellow who was inclined to be rude and then led the way to some chairs on the lawn
dolly who had not been told ran out with offers of tea
he refused them and ordered her to wheel baby's perambulator away as they desired to be alone
but the diddums can't listen he isn't nine months old she pleaded
that's not what i was saying retorted her fatherinlaw
baby was wheeled out of earshot and did not hear about the crisis till later years
it was now the turn of margaret
is it what we feared
he asked
it is
dear girl he began there is a troublesome business ahead of us and nothing but the most absolute honesty and plain speech will see us through
margaret bent her head
i am obliged to question you on subjects we'd both prefer to leave untouched
as you know i am not one of your bernard shaws who consider nothing sacred
to speak as i must will pain me but there are occasionswe are husband and wife not children
i am a man of the world and you are a most exceptional woman
all margaret's senses forsook her
she blushed and looked past him at the six hills covered with spring herbage
noting her colour he grew still more kind
i see that you feel as i felt whenmy poor little wife
oh be brave
just one or two questions and i have done with you
was your sister wearing a weddingring
margaret stammered a no
there was an appalling silence
henry i really came to ask a favour about howards end
one point at a time
i am now obliged to ask for the name of her seducer
she rose to her feet and held the chair between them
her colour had ebbed and she was grey
it did not displease him that she should receive his question thus
take your time he counselled her
remember that this is far worse for me than for you
she swayed he feared she was going to faint
then speech came and she said slowly seducer
no i do not know her seducer's name
would she not tell you
i never even asked her who seduced her said margaret dwelling on the hateful word thoughtfully
that is singular
then he changed his mind
natural perhaps dear girl that you shouldn't ask
but until his name is known nothing can be done
sit down
how terrible it is to see you so upset
i knew you weren't fit for it
i wish i hadn't taken you
margaret answered i like to stand if you don't mind for it gives me a pleasant view of the six hills
as you like
have you anything else to ask me henry
next you must tell me whether you have gathered anything
i have often noticed your insight dear
i only wish my own was as good
you may have guessed something even though your sister said nothing
the slightest hint would help us
who is 'we'
i thought it best to ring up charles
that was unnecessary said margaret growing warmer
this news will give charles disproportionate pain
he has at once gone to call on your brother
that too was unnecessary
let me explain dear how the matter stands
you don't think that i and my son are other than gentlemen
it is in helen's interests that we are acting
it is still not too late to save her name
then margaret hit out for the first time
are we to make her seducer marry her
she asked
if possible
yes
but henry suppose he turned out to be married already
one has heard of such cases
in that case he must pay heavily for his misconduct and be thrashed within an inch of his life
so her first blow missed
she was thankful of it
what had tempted her to imperil both of their lives
henry's obtuseness had saved her as well as himself
exhausted with anger she sat down again blinking at him as he told her as much as he thought fit
at last she said may i ask you my question now
certainly my dear
tomorrow helen goes to munich  well possibly she is right
henry let a lady finish
tomorrow she goes tonight with your permission she would like to sleep at howards end
it was the crisis of his life
again she would have recalled the words as soon as they were uttered
she had not led up to them with sufficient care
she longed to warn him that they were far more important than he supposed
she saw him weighing them as if they were a business proposition
why howards end
he said at last
would she not be more comfortable as i suggested at the hotel
margaret hastened to give him reasons
it is an odd request but you know what helen is and what women in her state are
he frowned and moved irritably
she has the idea that one night in your house would give her pleasure and do her good
i think she's right
being one of those imaginative girls the presence of all our books and furniture soothes her
this is a fact
it is the end of her girlhood
her last words to me were 'a beautiful ending'
she values the old furniture for sentimental reasons in fact
exactly
you have quite understood
it is her last hope of being with it
i don't agree there my dear
helen will have her share of the goods wherever she goespossibly more than her share for you are so fond of her that you'd give her anything of yours that she fancies wouldn't you
and i'd raise no objection
i could understand it if it was her old home because a home or a househe changed the word designedly he had thought of a telling pointbecause a house in which one has once lived becomes in a sort of way sacred i don't know why
associations and so on
now helen has no associations with howards end though i and charles and evie have
i do not see why she wants to stay the night there
she will only catch cold
leave it that you don't see cried margaret
call it fancy
but realize that fancy is a scientific fact
helen is fanciful and wants to
then he surprised hera rare occurrence
he shot an unexpected bolt
if she wants to sleep one night she may want to sleep two
we shall never get her out of the house perhaps
well
said margaret with the precipice in sight
and suppose we don't get her out of the house
would it matter
she would do no one any harm
again the irritated gesture
no henry she panted receding
i didn't mean that
we will only trouble howards end for this one night
i take her to london tomorrow  do you intend to sleep in a damp house too
she cannot be left alone
that's quite impossible
madness
you must be here to meet charles
i have already told you that your message to charles was unnecessary and i have no desire to meet him
margaretmy margaret  what has this business to do with charles
if it concerns me little it concerns you less and charles not at all
as the future owner of howards end said mr wilcox arching his fingers i should say that it did concern charles
in what way
will helen's condition depreciate the property
my dear you are forgetting yourself
i think you yourself recommended plain speaking
they looked at each other in amazement
the precipice was at their feet now
helen commands my sympathy said henry
as your husband i shall do all for her that i can and i have no doubt that she will prove more sinned against than sinning
but i cannot treat her as if nothing has happened
i should be false to my position in society if i did
she controlled herself for the last time
no let us go back to helen's request she said
it is unreasonable but the request of an unhappy girl
tomorrow she will go to germany and trouble society no longer
tonight she asks to sleep in your empty housea house which you do not care about and which you have not occupied for over a year
may she
will you give my sister leave
will you forgive heras you hope to be forgiven and as you have actually been forgiven
forgive her for one night only
that will be enough
as i have actually been forgiven
never mind for the moment what i mean by that said margaret
answer my question
perhaps some hint of her meaning did dawn on him
if so he blotted it out
straight from his fortress he answered i seem rather unaccommodating but i have some experience of life and know how one thing leads to another
i am afraid that your sister had better sleep at the hotel
i have my children and the memory of my dear wife to consider
i am sorry but see that she leaves my house at once
you mentioned mrs
wilcox
i beg your pardon
a rare occurrence
in reply may i mention mrs
bast
you have not been yourself all day said henry and rose from his seat with face unmoved
margaret rushed at him and seized both his hands
she was transfigured
not any more of this
she cried
you shall see the connection if it kills you henry
you have had a mistressi forgave you
my sister has a loveryou drive her from the house
do you see the connection
stupid hypocritical crueloh contemptible
a man who insults his wife when she's alive and cants with her memory when she's dead
a man who ruins a woman for his pleasure and casts her off to ruin other men
and gives bad financial advice and then says he is not responsible
these man are you
you can't recognize them because you cannot connect
i've had enough of your unweeded kindness
i've spoilt you long enough
all your life you have been spoiled
mrs wilcox spoiled you
no one has ever told what you aremuddled criminally muddled
men like you use repentance as a blind so don't repent
only say to yourself 'what helen has done i've done'
the two cases are different henry stammered
his real retort was not quite ready
his brain was still in a whirl and he wanted a little longer
in what way different
you have betrayed mrs wilcox helen only herself
you remain in society helen can't
you have had only pleasure she may die
you have the insolence to talk to me of differences henry
oh the uselessness of it
henry's retort came
i perceive you are attempting blackmail
it is scarcely a pretty weapon for a wife to use against her husband
my rule through life has been never to pay the least attention to threats and i can only repeat what i said before i do not give you and your sister leave to sleep at howards end
margaret loosed his hands
he went into the house wiping first one and then the other on his handkerchief
for a little she stood looking at the six hills tombs of warriors breasts of the spring
then she passed out into what was now the evening
chapter   charles and tibby met at ducie street where the latter was staying
their interview was short and absurd
they had nothing in common but the english language and tried by its help to express what neither of them understood
charles saw in helen the family foe
he had singled her out as the most dangerous of the schlegels and angry as he was looked forward to telling his wife how right he had been
his mind was made up at once the girl must be got out of the way before she disgraced them farther
if occasion offered she might be married to a villain or possibly to a fool
but this was a concession to morality it formed no part of his main scheme
honest and hearty was charles's dislike and the past spread itself out very clearly before him hatred is a skilful compositor
as if they were heads in a notebook he ran through all the incidents of the schlegels' campaign the attempt to compromise his brother his mother's legacy his father's marriage the introduction of the furniture the unpacking of the same
he had not yet heard of the request to sleep at howards end that was to be their masterstroke and the opportunity for his
but he already felt that howards end was the objective and though he disliked the house was determined to defend it
tibby on the other hand had no opinions
he stood above the conventions his sister had a right to do what she thought right
it is not difficult to stand above the conventions when we leave no hostages among them men can always be more unconventional than women and a bachelor of independent means need encounter no difficulties at all
unlike charles tibby had money enough his ancestors had earned it for him and if he shocked the people in one set of lodgings he had only to move into another
his was the leisure without sympathyan attitude as fatal as the strenuous a little cold culture may be raised on it but no art
his sisters had seen the family danger and had never forgotten to discount the gold islets that raised them from the sea
tibby gave all the praise to himself and so despised the struggling and the submerged
hence the absurdity of the interview the gulf between them was economic as well as spiritual
but several facts passed charles pressed for them with an impertinence that the undergraduate could not withstand
on what date had helen gone abroad
to whom
charles was anxious to fasten the scandal on germany
then changing his tactics he said roughly i suppose you realize that you are your sister's protector
in what sense
if a man played about with my sister i'd send a bullet through him but perhaps you don't mind
i mind very much protested tibby
who d'ye suspect then
speak out man
one always suspects someone
no one
i don't think so
involuntarily he blushed
he had remembered the scene in his oxford rooms
you are hiding something said charles
as interviews go he got the best of this one
when you saw her last did she mention anyone's name
yes or no
he thundered so that tibby started
in my rooms she mentioned some friends called the basts  who are the basts
peoplefriends of hers at evie's wedding
i don't remember
but by great scott
i do
my aunt told me about some tagrag
was she full of them when you saw her
is there a man
did she speak of the man
orlook herehave you had any dealings with him
tibby was silent
without intending it he had betrayed his sister's confidence he was not enough interested in human life to see where things will lead to
he had a strong regard for honesty and his word once given had always been kept up to now
he was deeply vexed not only for the harm he had done helen but for the flaw he had discovered in his own equipment
i seeyou are in his confidence
they met at your rooms
oh what a family what a family
god help the poor pater  and tibby found himself alone
chapter   leonardhe would figure at length in a newspaper report but that evening he did not count for much
the foot of the tree was in shadow since the moon was still hidden behind the house
but above to right to left down the long meadow the moonlight was streaming
leonard seemed not a man but a cause
perhaps it was helen's way of falling in lovea curious way to margaret whose agony and whose contempt of henry were yet imprinted with his image
helen forgot people
they were husks that had enclosed her emotion
she could pity or sacrifice herself or have instincts but had she ever loved in the noblest way where man and woman having lost themselves in sex desire to lose sex itself in comradeship
margaret wondered but said no word of blame
this was helen's evening
troubles enough lay ahead of herthe loss of friends and of social advantages the agony the supreme agony of motherhood which is even yet not a matter of common knowledge
for the present let the moon shine brightly and the breezes of the spring blow gently dying away from the gale of the day and let the earth who brings increase bring peace
not even to herself dare she blame helen
she could not assess her trespass by any moral code it was everything or nothing
morality can tell us that murder is worse than stealing and group most sins in an order all must approve but it cannot group helen
the surer its pronouncements on this point the surer may we be that morality is not speaking
christ was evasive when they questioned him
it is those that cannot connect who hasten to cast the first stone
this was helen's eveningwon at what cost and not to be marred by the sorrows of others
of her own tragedy margaret never uttered a word
one isolates said helen slowly
i isolated mr wilcox from the other forces that were pulling leonard downhill
consequently i was full of pity and almost of revenge
for weeks i had blamed mr wilcox only and so when your letters came  i need never have written them sighed margaret
they never shielded henry
how hopeless it is to tidy away the past even for others
i did not know that it was your own idea to dismiss the basts
looking back that was wrong of me
looking back darling i know that it was right
it is right to save the man whom one loves
i am less enthusiastic about justice now
but we both thought you wrote at his dictation
it seemed the last touch of his callousness
being very much wrought up by this timeand mrs bast was upstairs
i had not seen her and had talked for a long time to leonardi had snubbed him for no reason and that should have warned me i was in danger
so when the notes came i wanted us to go to you for an explanation
he said that he guessed the explanationhe knew of it and you mustn't know
i pressed him to tell me
he said no one must know it was something to do with his wife
right up to the end we were mr bast and miss schlegel
i was going to tell him that he must be frank with me when i saw his eyes and guessed that mr wilcox had ruined him in two ways not one
i drew him to me
i made him tell me
i felt very lonely myself
he is not to blame
he would have gone on worshipping me
i want never to see him again though it sounds appalling
i wanted to give him money and feel finished
oh meg the little that is known about these things
she laid her face against the tree
the little too that is known about growth
both times it was loneliness and the night and panic afterwards
did leonard grow out of paul
margaret did not speak for a moment
so tired was she that her attention had actually wandered to the teeththe teeth that had been thrust into the tree's bark to medicate it
from where she sat she could see them gleam
she had been trying to count them
leonard is a better growth than madness she said
i was afraid that you would react against paul until you went over the verge
i did react until i found poor leonard
i am steady now
i shan't ever like your henry dearest meg or even speak kindly about him but all that blinding hate is over
i shall never rave against wilcoxes any more
i understand how you married him and you will now be very happy
margaret did not reply
yes repeated helen her voice growing more tender i do at last understand
except mrs wilcox dearest no one understands our little movements
because in deathi agree
not quite
i feel that you and i and henry are only fragments of that woman's mind
she knows everything
she is everything
she is the house and the tree that leans over it
people have their own deaths as well as their own lives and even if there is nothing beyond death we shall differ in our nothingness
i cannot believe that knowledge such as hers will perish with knowledge such as mine
she knew about realities
she knew when people were in love though she was not in the room
i don't doubt that she knew when henry deceived her
goodnight mrs wilcox called a voice
oh goodnight miss avery
why should miss avery work for us
helen murmured
why indeed
miss avery crossed the lawn and merged into the hedge that divided it from the farm
an old gap which mr wilcox had filled up had reappeared and her track through the dew followed the path that he had turfed over when he improved the garden and made it possible for games
this is not quite our house yet said helen
when miss avery called i felt we are only a couple of tourists
we shall be that everywhere and for ever
but affectionate tourists  but tourists who pretend each hotel is their home
i can't pretend very long said helen
sitting under this tree one forgets but i know that tomorrow i shall see the moon rise out of germany
not all your goodness can alter the facts of the case
unless you will come with me
margaret thought for a moment
in the past year she had grown so fond of england that to leave it was a real grief
yet what detained her
no doubt henry would pardon her outburst and go on blustering and muddling into a ripe old age
but what was the good
she had just as soon vanish from his mind
are you serious in asking me helen
should i get on with your monica
you would not but i am serious in asking you
still no more plans now
and no more reminiscences
they were silent for a little
it was helen's evening
the present flowed by them like a stream
the tree rustled
it had made music before they were born and would continue after their deaths but its song was of the moment
the moment had passed
the tree rustled again
their senses were sharpened and they seemed to apprehend life
life passed
the tree nestled again
sleep now said margaret
the peace of the country was entering into her
it has no commerce with memory and little with hope
least of all is it concerned with the hopes of the next five minutes
it is the peace of the present which passes understanding
its murmur came now and now once more as they trod the gravel and now as the moonlight fell upon their father's sword
they passed upstairs kissed and amidst the endless iterations fell asleep
the house had enshadowed the tree at first but as the moon rose higher the two disentangled and were clear for a few moments at midnight
margaret awoke and looked into the garden
how incomprehensible that leonard bast should have won her this night of peace
was he also part of mrs wilcox's mind
chapter   far different was leonard's development
the months after oniton whatever minor troubles they might bring him were all overshadowed by remorse
when helen looked back she could philosophize or she could look into the future and plan for her child
but the father saw nothing beyond his own sin
weeks afterwards in the midst of other occupations he would suddenly cry out bruteyou brute i couldn't have and be rent into two people who held dialogues
or brown rain would descend blotting out faces and the sky
even jacky noticed the change in him
most terrible were his sufferings when he awoke from sleep
sometimes he was happy at first but grew conscious of a burden hanging to him and weighing down his thoughts when they would move
or little irons scorched his body
or a sword stabbed him
he would sit at the edge of his bed holding his heart and moaning oh what shall i do whatever shall i do
nothing brought ease
he could put distance between him and the trespass but it grew in his soul
remorse is not among the eternal verities
the greeks were right to dethrone her
her action is too capricious as though the erinyes selected for punishment only certain men and certain sins
and of all means to regeneration remorse is surely the most wasteful
it cuts away healthy tissues with the poisoned
it is a knife that probes far deeper than the evil
leonard was driven straight through its torments and emerged pure but enfeebleda better man who would never lose control of himself again but also a smaller who had less to control
nor did purity mean peace
the use of the knife can become a habit as hard to shake off as passion itself and leonard continued to start with a cry out of dreams
he built up a situation that was far enough from the truth
it never occurred to him that helen was to blame
he forgot the intensity of their talk the charm that had been lent him by sincerity the magic of oniton under darkness and of the whispering river
helen loved the absolute
leonard had been ruined absolutely and had appeared to her as a man apart isolated from the world
a real man who cared for adventure and beauty who desired to live decently and pay his way who could have travelled more gloriously through life than the juggernaut car that was crushing him
memories of evie's wedding had warped her the starched servants the yards of uneaten food the rustle of overdressed women motorcars oozing grease on the gravel rubbish on a pretentious band
she had tasted the lees of this on her arrival in the darkness after failure they intoxicated her
she and the victim seemed alone in a world of unreality and she loved him absolutely perhaps for half an hour
in the morning she was gone
the note that she left tender and hysterical in tone and intended to be most kind hurt her lover terribly
it was as if some work of art had been broken by him some picture in the national gallery slashed out of its frame
when he recalled her talents and her social position he felt that the first passerby had a right to shoot him down
he was afraid of the waitress and the porters at the railwaystation
he was afraid at first of his wife though later he was to regard her with a strange new tenderness and to think there is nothing to choose between us after all
the expedition to shropshire crippled the basts permanently
helen in her flight forgot to settle the hotel bill and took their return tickets away with her they had to pawn jacky's bangles to get home and the smash came a few days afterwards
it is true that helen offered him five thousands pounds but such a sum meant nothing to him
he could not see that the girl was desperately righting herself and trying to save something out of the disaster if it was only five thousand pounds
but he had to live somehow
he turned to his family and degraded himself to a professional beggar
there was nothing else for him to do
a letter from leonard thought blanche his sister and after all this time
she hid it so that her husband should not see and when he had gone to his work read it with some emotion and sent the prodigal a little money out of her dress allowance
a letter from leonard
said the other sister laura a few days later
she showed it to her husband
he wrote a cruel insolent reply but sent more money than blanche so leonard soon wrote to him again
and during the winter the system was developed
leonard realized that they need never starve because it would be too painful for his relatives
society is based on the family and the clever wastrel can exploit this indefinitely
without a generous thought on either side pounds and pounds passed
the donors disliked leonard and he grew to hate them intensely
when laura censured his immoral marriage he thought bitterly she minds that
what would she say if she knew the truth
when blanche's husband offered him work he found some pretext for avoiding it
he had wanted work keenly at oniton but too much anxiety had shattered him he was joining the unemployable
when his brother the layreader did not reply to a letter he wrote again saying that he and jacky would come down to his village on foot
he did not intend this as blackmail
still the brother sent a postal order and it became part of the system
and so passed his winter and his spring
in the horror there are two bright spots
he never confused the past
he remained alive and blessed are those who live if it is only to a sense of sinfulness
the anodyne of muddledom by which most men blur and blend their mistakes never passed leonard's lips    and if i drink oblivion of a day   so shorten i the stature of my soul
it is a hard saying and a hard man wrote it but it lies at the foot of all character
and the other bright spot was his tenderness for jacky
he pitied her with nobility nownot the contemptuous pity of a man who sticks to a woman through thick and thin
he tried to be less irritable
he wondered what her hungry eyes desirednothing that she could express or that he or any man could give her
would she ever receive the justice that is mercythe justice for byproducts that the world is too busy to bestow
she was fond of flowers generous with money and not revengeful
if she had borne him a child he might have cared for her
unmarried leonard would never have begged he would have flickered out and died
but the whole of life is mixed
he had to provide for jacky and went down dirty paths that she might have a few feathers and dishes of food that suited her
one day he caught sight of margaret and her brother
he was in st  paul's
he had entered the cathedral partly to avoid the rain and partly to see a picture that had educated him in former years
but the light was bad the picture ill placed and time and judgment were inside him now
death alone still charmed him with her lap of poppies on which all men shall sleep
he took one glance and turned aimlessly away towards a chair
then down the nave he saw miss schlegel and her brother
they stood in the fairway of passengers and their faces were extremely grave
he was perfectly certain that they were in trouble about their sister
once outsideand he fled immediatelyhe wished that he had spoken to them
what was his life
what were a few angry words or even imprisonment
he had done wrongthat was the true terror
whatever they might know he would tell them everything he knew
he reentered st paul's
but they had moved in his absence and had gone to lay their difficulties before mr wilcox and charles
the sight of margaret turned remorse into new channels
he desired to confess and though the desire is proof of a weakened nature which is about to lose the essence of human intercourse it did not take an ignoble form
he did not suppose that confession would bring him happiness
it was rather that he yearned to get clear of the tangle
so does the suicide yearn
the impulses are akin and the crime of suicide lies rather in its disregard for the feelings of those whom we leave behind
confession need harm no oneit can satisfy that testand though it was unenglish and ignored by our anglican cathedral leonard had a right to decide upon it
moreover he trusted margaret
he wanted her hardness now
that cold intellectual nature of hers would be just if unkind
he would do whatever she told him even if he had to see helen
that was the supreme punishment she would exact
and perhaps she would tell him how helen was
that was the supreme reward
he knew nothing about margaret not even whether she was married to mr wilcox and tracking her out took several days
that evening he toiled through the wet to wickham place where the new flats were now appearing
was he also the cause of their move
were they expelled from society on his account
thence to a public library but could find no satisfactory schlegel in the directory
on the morrow he searched again
he hung about outside mr wilcox's office at lunch time and as the clerks came out said excuse me sir but is your boss married
most of them stared some said what's that to you
but one who had not yet acquired reticence told him what he wished
leonard could not learn the private address
that necessitated more trouble with directories and tubes
ducie street was not discovered till the monday the day that margaret and her husband went down on their hunting expedition to howards end
he called at about four o'clock
the weather had changed and the sun shone gaily on the ornamental stepsblack and white marble in triangles
leonard lowered his eyes to them after ringing the bell
he felt in curious health doors seemed to be opening and shutting inside his body and he had been obliged to steep sitting up in bed with his back propped against the wall
when the parlourmaid came he could not see her face the brown rain had descended suddenly
does mrs wilcox live here
he asked
she's out was the answer
when will she be back
i'll ask said the parlourmaid
margaret had given instructions that no one who mentioned her name should ever be rebuffed
putting the door on the chainfor leonard's appearance demanded thisshe went through to the smokingroom which was occupied by tibby
tibby was asleep
he had had a good lunch
charles wilcox had not yet rung him up for the distracting interview
he said drowsily i don't know
hilton
howards end
who is it
i'll ask sir
no don't bother
they have taken the car to howards end said the parlourmaid to leonard
he thanked her and asked whereabouts that place was
you appear to want to know a good deal she remarked
but margaret had forbidden her to be mysterious
she told him against her better judgment that howards end was in hertfordshire
is it a village please
village
it's mr wilcox's private houseat least it's one of them
mrs wilcox keeps her furniture there
hilton is the village
yes
and when will they be back
mr schlegel doesn't know
we can't know everything can we
she shut him out and went to attend to the telephone which was ringing furiously
he loitered away another night of agony
confession grew more difficult
as soon as possible he went to bed
he watched a patch of moonlight cross the floor of their lodging and as sometimes happens when the mind is overtaxed he fell asleep for the rest of the room but kept awake for the patch of moonlight
horrible
then began one of those disintegrating dialogues
part of him said why horrible
it's ordinary light from the room
but it moves
so does the moon
but it is a clenched fist
why not
but it is going to touch me
let it
and seeming to gather motion the patch ran up his blanket
presently a blue snake appeared then another parallel to it
is there life in the moon
of course
but i thought it was uninhabited
not by time death judgment and the smaller snakes
smaller snakes
said leonard indignantly and aloud
what a notion
by a rending effort of the will he woke the rest of the room up
jacky the bed their food their clothes on the chair gradually entered his consciousness and the horror vanished outwards like a ring that is spreading through water
i say jacky i'm going out for a bit
she was breathing regularly
the patch of light fell clear of the striped blanket and began to cover the shawl that lay over her feet
why had he been afraid
he went to the window and saw that the moon was descending through a clear sky
he saw her volcanoes and the bright expanses that a gracious error has named seas
they paled for the sun who had lit them up was coming to light the earth
sea of serenity sea of tranquillity ocean of the lunar storms merged into one lucent drop itself to slip into the sempiternal dawn
and he had been afraid of the moon
he dressed among the contending lights and went through his money
it was running low again but enough for a return ticket to hilton
as it clinked jacky opened her eyes
hullo len
what ho len
what ho jacky
see you again later
she turned over and slept
the house was unlocked their landlord being a salesman at convent garden
leonard passed out and made his way down to the station
the train though it did not start for an hour was already drawn up at the end of the platform and he lay down in it and slept
with the first jolt he was in daylight they had left the gateways of king's cross and were under blue sky
tunnels followed and after each the sky grew bluer and from the embankment at finsbury park he had his first sight of the sun
it rolled along behind the eastern smokesa wheel whose fellow was the descending moonand as yet it seemed the servant of the blue sky not its lord
he dozed again
over tewin water it was day
to the left fell the shadow of the embankment and its arches to the right leonard saw up into the tewin woods and towards the church with its wild legend of immortality
six forest treesthat is a factgrow out of one of the graves in tewin churchyard
the grave's occupantthat is the legendis an atheist who declared that if god existed six forest trees would grow out of her grave
these things in hertfordshire and farther afield lay the house of a hermitmrs wilcox had known himwho barred himself up and wrote prophecies and gave all he had to the poor
while powdered in between were the villas of business men who saw life more steadily though with the steadiness of the halfclosed eye
over all the sun was streaming to all the birds were singing to all the primroses were yellow and the speedwell blue and the country however they interpreted her was uttering her cry of now
she did not free leonard yet and the knife plunged deeper into his heart as the train drew up at hilton
but remorse had become beautiful
hilton was asleep or at the earliest breakfasting
leonard noticed the contrast when he stepped out of it into the country
here men had been up since dawn
their hours were ruled not by a london office but by the movements of the crops and the sun
that they were men of the finest type only the sentimentalist can declare
but they kept to the life of daylight
they are england's hope
clumsily they carry forward the torch of the sun until such time as the nation sees fit to take it up
half clodhopper half boardschool prig they can still throw back to a nobler stock and breed yeomen
at the chalk pit a motor passed him
in it was another type whom nature favoursthe imperial
healthy ever in motion it hopes to inherit the earth
it breeds as quickly as the yeoman and as soundly strong is the temptation to acclaim it as a superyeoman who carries his country's virtue overseas
but the imperialist is not what he thinks or seems
he is a destroyer
he prepares the way for cosmopolitanism and though his ambitions may be fulfilled the earth that he inherits will be grey
to leonard intent on his private sin there came the conviction of innate goodness elsewhere
it was not the optimism which he had been taught at school
again and again must the drums tap and the goblins stalk over the universe before joy can be purged of the superficial
it was rather paradoxical and arose from his sorrow
death destroys a man but the idea of death saves himthat is the best account of it that has yet been given
squalor and tragedy can beckon to all that is great in us and strengthen the wings of love
they can beckon it is not certain that they will for they are not love's servants
but they can beckon and the knowledge of this incredible truth comforted him
as he approached the house all thought stopped
contradictory notions stood side by side in his mind
he was terrified but happy ashamed but had done no sin
he knew the confession mrs wilcox i have done wrong but sunrise had robbed its meaning and he felt rather on a supreme adventure
he entered a garden steadied himself against a motorcar that he found in it found a door open and entered a house
yes it would be very easy
from a room to the left he heard voices margaret's amongst them
his own name was called aloud and a man whom he had never seen said oh is he there
i am not surprised
i now thrash him within an inch of his life
mrs wilcox said leonard i have done wrong
the man took him by the collar and cried bring me a stick
women were screaming
a stick very bright descended
it hurt him not where it descended but in the heart
books fell over him in a shower
nothing had sense
get some water commanded charles who had all through kept very calm
he's shamming
of course i only used the blade
here carry him out into the air
thinking that he understood these things margaret obeyed him
they laid leonard who was dead on the gravel helen poured water over him
that's enough said charles
yes murder's enough said miss avery coming out of the house with the sword
chapter   when charles left ducie street he had caught the first train home but had no inkling of the newest development until late at night
then his father who had dined alone sent for him and in very grave tones inquired for margaret
i don't know where she is pater said charles
dolly kept back dinner nearly an hour for her
tell me when she comes in
another hour passed
the servants went to bed and charles visited his father again to receive further instructions
mrs wilcox had still not returned
i'll sit up for her as late as you like but she can hardly be coming
isn't she stopping with her sister at the hotel
perhaps said mr wilcox thoughtfullyperhaps
can i do anything for you sir
not tonight my boy
mr wilcox liked being called sir
he raised his eyes and gave his son more open a look of tenderness than he usually ventured
he saw charles as little boy and strong man in one
though his wife had proved unstable his children were left to him
after midnight he tapped on charles's door
i can't sleep he said
i had better have a talk with you and get it over
he complained of the heat
charles took him out into the garden and they paced up and down in their dressinggowns
charles became very quiet as the story unrolled he had known all along that margaret was as bad as her sister
she will feel differently in the morning said mr wilcox who had of course said nothing about mrs bast
but i cannot let this kind of thing continue without comment
i am morally certain that she is with her sister at howards end
the house is mineand charles it will be yoursand when i say that no one is to live there i mean that no one is to live there
i won't have it
he looked angrily at the moon
to my mind this question is connected with something far greater the rights of property itself
undoubtedly said charles
mr wilcox linked his arm in his son's but somehow liked him less as he told him more
i don't want you to conclude that my wife and i had anything of the nature of a quarrel
she was only overwrought as who would not be
i shall do what i can for helen but on the understanding that they clear out of the house at once
do you see
that is a sine qua non
then at eight tomorrow i may go up in the car
eight or earlier
say that you are acting as my representative and of course use no violence charles
on the morrow as charles returned leaving leonard dead upon the gravel it did not seem to him that he had used violence
death was due to heart disease
his stepmother herself had said so and even miss avery had acknowledged that he only used the flat of the sword
on his way through the village he informed the police who thanked him and said there must be an inquest
he found his father in the garden shading his eyes from the sun
it has been pretty horrible said charles gravely
they were there and they had the man up there with them too
whatwhat man
i told you last night
his name was bast
my god is it possible
said mr wilcox
in your mother's house
charles in your mother's house
i know pater
that was what i felt
as a matter of fact there is no need to trouble about the man
he was in the last stages of heart disease and just before i could show him what i thought of him he went off
the police are seeing about it at this moment
mr wilcox listened attentively
i got up thereoh it couldn't have been more than halfpast seven
the avery woman was lighting a fire for them
they were still upstairs
i waited in the drawingroom
we were all moderately civil and collected though i had my suspicions
i gave them your message and mrs wilcox said 'oh yes i see yes' in that way of hers
nothing else
i promised to tell you 'with her love' that she was going to germany with her sister this evening
that was all we had time for
mr wilcox seemed relieved
because by then i suppose the man got tired of hiding for suddenly mrs wilcox screamed out his name
i recognized it and i went for him in the hall
was i right pater
i thought things were going a little too far
right my dear boy
i don't know
but you would have been no son of mine if you hadn't
then did he justjustcrumple up as you said
he shrunk from the simple word
he caught hold of the bookcase which came down over him
so i merely put the sword down and carried him into the garden
we all thought he was shamming
however he's dead right enough
awful business
sword
cried his father with anxiety in his voice
what sword
whose sword
a sword of theirs
what were you doing with it
well didn't you see pater i had to snatch up the first thing handy i hadn't a ridingwhip or stick
i caught him once or twice over the shoulders with the flat of their old german sword
then what
he pulled over the bookcase as i said and fell said charles with a sigh
it was no fun doing errands for his father who was never quite satisfied
but the real cause was heart disease
of that you're sure
that or a fit
however we shall hear more than enough at the inquest on such unsavoury topics
they went into breakfast
charles had a racking headache consequent on motoring before food
he was also anxious about the future reflecting that the police must detain helen and margaret for the inquest and ferret the whole thing out
he saw himself obliged to leave hilton
one could not afford to live near the scene of a scandalit was not fair on one's wife
his comfort was that the pater's eyes were opened at last
there would be a horrible smash up and probably a separation from margaret then they would all start again more as they had been in his mother's time
i think i'll go round to the policestation said his father when breakfast was over
what for
cried dolly who had still not been told
very well sir
which car will you have
i think i'll walk
it's a good halfmile said charles stepping into the garden
the sun's very hot for april
shan't i take you up and then perhaps a little spin round by tewin
you go on as if i didn't know my own mind said mr wilcox fretfully
charles hardened his mouth
you young fellows' one idea is to get into a motor
i tell you i want to walk i'm very fond of walking
oh all right i'm about the house if you want me for anything
i thought of not going up to the office today if that is your wish
it is indeed my boy said mr wilcox and laid a hand on his sleeve
charles did not like it he was uneasy about his father who did not seem himself this morning
there was a petulant touch about himmore like a woman
could it be that he was growing old
the wilcoxes were not lacking in affection they had it royally but they did not know how to use it
it was the talent in the napkin and for a warmhearted man charles had conveyed very little joy
as he watched his father shuffling up the road he had a vague regreta wish that something had been different somewherea wish though he did not express it thus that he had been taught to say i in his youth
he meant to make up for margaret's defection but knew that his father had been very happy with her until yesterday
how had she done it
by some dishonest trick no doubtbut how
mr wilcox reappeared at eleven looking very tired
there was to be an inquest on leonard's' body tomorrow and the police required his son to attend
i expected that said charles
i shall naturally be the most important witness there
chapter   out of the turmoil and horror that had begun with aunt juley's illness and was not even to end with leonard's death it seemed impossible to margaret that healthy life should reemerge
events succeeded in a logical yet senseless train
people lost their humanity and took values as arbitrary as those in a pack of playingcards
it was natural that henry should do this and cause helen to do that and then think her wrong for doing it natural that she herself should think him wrong natural that leonard should want to know how helen was and come and charles be angry with him for comingnatural but unreal
in this jangle of causes and effects what had become of their true selves
here leonard lay dead in the garden from natural causes yet life was a deep deep river death a blue sky life was a house death a wisp of hay a flower a tower life and death were anything and everything except this ordered insanity where the king takes the queen and the ace the king
ah no there was beauty and adventure behind such as the man at her feet had yearned for there was hope this side of the grave there were truer relationships beyond the limits that fetter us now
as a prisoner looks up and sees stars beckoning so she from the turmoil and horror of those days caught glimpses of the diviner wheels
and helen dumb with fright but trying to keep calm for the child's sake and miss avery calm but murmuring tenderly no one ever told the lad he'll have a childthey also reminded her that horror is not the end
to what ultimate harmony we tend she did not know but there seemed great chance that a child would be born into the world to take the great chances of beauty and adventure that the world offers
she moved through the sunlit garden gathering narcissi crimsoneyed and white
there was nothing else to be done the time for telegrams and anger was over and it seemed wisest that the hands of leonard should be folded on his breast and be filled with flowers
here was the father leave it at that
let squalor be turned into tragedy whose eyes are the stars and whose hands hold the sunset and the dawn
and even the influx of officials even the return of the doctor vulgar and acute could not shake her belief in the eternity of beauty
science explained people but could not understand them
after long centuries among the bones and muscles it might be advancing to knowledge of the nerves but this would never give understanding
one could open the heart to mr mansbridge and his sort without discovering its secrets to them for they wanted everything down in black and white and black and white was exactly what they were left with
they questioned her closely about charles
she never suspected why
death had come and the doctor agreed that it was due to heart disease
they asked to see her father's sword
she explained that charles's anger was natural but mistaken
miserable questions about leonard followed all of which she answered unfalteringly
then back to charles again
no doubt mr wilcox may have induced death she said but if it wasn't one thing it would have been another as you yourselves know
at last they thanked her and took the sword and the body down to hilton
she began to pick up the books from the floor
helen had gone to the farm
it was the best place for her since she had to wait for the inquest
though as if things were not hard enough madge and her husband had raised trouble they did not see why they should receive the offscourings of howards end
and of course they were right
the whole world was going to be right and amply avenge any brave talk against the conventions
nothing matters the schlegels had said in the past except one's selfrespect and that of one's friends
when the time came other things mattered terribly
however madge had yielded and helen was assured of peace for one day and night and tomorrow she would return to germany
as for herself she determined to go too
no message came from henry perhaps he expected her to apologize
now that she had time to think over her own tragedy she was unrepentant
she neither forgave him for his behaviour nor wished to forgive him
her speech to him seemed perfect
she would not have altered a word
it had to be uttered once in a life to adjust the lopsidedness of the world
it was spoken not only to her husband but to thousands of men like hima protest against the inner darkness in high places that comes with a commercial age
though he would build up his life without hers she could not apologize
he had refused to connect on the clearest issue that can be laid before a man and their love must take the consequences
no there was nothing more to be done
they had tried not to go over the precipice but perhaps the fall was inevitable
and it comforted her to think that the future was certainly inevitable cause and effect would go jangling forward to some goal doubtless but to none that she could imagine
at such moments the soul retires within to float upon the bosom of a deeper stream and has communion with the dead and sees the world's glory not diminished but different in kind to what she has supposed
she alters her focus until trivial things are blurred
margaret had been tending this way all the winter
leonard's death brought her to the goal
alas
that henry should fade away as reality emerged and only her love for him should remain clear stamped with his image like the cameos we rescue out of dreams
with unfaltering eye she traced his future
he would soon present a healthy mind to the world again and what did he or the world care if he was rotten at the core
he would grow into a rich jolly old man at times a little sentimental about women but emptying his glass with anyone
tenacious of power he would keep charles and the rest dependent and retire from business reluctantly and at an advanced age
he would settle downthough she could not realize this
in her eyes henry was always moving and causing others to move until the ends of the earth met
but in time he must get too tired to move and settle down
what next
the inevitable word
the release of the soul to its appropriate heaven
would they meet in it
margaret believed in immortality for herself
an eternal future had always seemed natural to her
and henry believed in it for himself
yet would they meet again
are there not rather endless levels beyond the grave as the theory that he had censured teaches
and his level whether higher or lower could it possibly be the same as hers
thus gravely meditating she was summoned by him
he sent up crane in the motor
other servants passed like water but the chauffeur remained though impertinent and disloyal
margaret disliked crane and he knew it
is it the keys that mr wilcox wants
she asked
he didn't say madam
you haven't any note for me
he didn't say madam
after a moment's thought she locked up howards end
it was pitiable to see in it the stirrings of warmth that would be quenched for ever
she raked out the fire that was blazing in the kitchen and spread the coals in the gravelled yard
she closed the windows and drew the curtains
henry would probably sell the place now
she was determined not to spare him for nothing new had happened as far as they were concerned
her mood might never have altered from yesterday evening
he was standing a little outside charles's gate and motioned the car to stop
when his wife got out he said hoarsely i prefer to discuss things with you outside
it will be more appropriate in the road i am afraid said margaret
did you get my message
what about
i am going to germany with my sister
i must tell you now that i shall make it my permanent home
our talk last night was more important than you have realized
i am unable to forgive you and am leaving you
i am extremely tired said henry in injured tones
i have been walking about all the morning and wish to sit down
certainly if you will consent to sit on the grass
the great north road should have been bordered all its length with glebe
henry's kind had filched most of it
she moved to the scrap opposite wherein were the six hills
they sat down on the farther side so that they could not be seen by charles or dolly
here are your keys said margaret
she tossed them towards him
they fell on the sunlit slope of grass and he did not pick them up
i have something to tell you he said gently
she knew this superficial gentleness this confession of hastiness that was only intended to enhance her admiration of the male
i don't want to hear it she replied
my sister is going to be ill  my life is going to be with her now
we must manage to build up something she and i and her child
where are you going
munich
we start after the inquest if she is not too ill  after the inquest
yes
have you realized what the verdict at the inquest will be
yes heart disease
no my dear manslaughter
margaret drove her fingers through the grass
the hill beneath her moved as if it was alive
manslaughter repeated mr wilcox
charles may go to prison
i dare not tell him
i don't know what to dowhat to do
i'm brokeni'm ended 
no sudden warmth arose in her
she did not see that to break him was her only hope
she did not enfold the sufferer in her arms
but all through that day and the next a new life began to move
the verdict was brought in
charles was committed for trial
it was against all reason that he should be punished but the law being made in his image sentenced him to three years' imprisonment
then henry's fortress gave way
he could bear no one but his wife he shambled up to margaret afterwards and asked her to do what she could with him
she did what seemed easiestshe took him down to recruit at howards end
chapter   tom's father was cutting the big meadow
he passed again and again amid whirring blades and sweet odours of grass encompassing with narrowing circles the sacred centre of the field
tom was negotiating with helen
i haven't any idea she replied
do you suppose baby may meg
margaret put down her work and regarded them absently
what was that
she asked
tom wants to know whether baby is old enough to play with hay
i haven't the least notion answered margaret and took up her work again
now tom baby is not to stand he is not to lie on his face he is not to lie so that his head wags he is not to be teased or tickled and he is not to be cut into two or more pieces by the cutter
will you be as careful as all that
tom held out his arms
that child is a wonderful nursemaid remarked margaret
he is fond of baby
that's why he does it
was helen's answer
they're going to be lifelong friends
starting at the ages of six and one
of course
it will be a great thing for tom
it may be a greater thing for baby
fourteen months had passed but margaret still stopped at howards end
no better plan had occurred to her
the meadow was being recut the great red poppies were reopening in the garden
july would follow with the little red poppies among the wheat august with the cutting of the wheat
these little events would become part of her year after year
every summer she would fear lest the well should give out every winter lest the pipes should freeze every westerly gale might blow the wychelm down and bring the end of all things and so she could not read or talk during a westerly gale
the air was tranquil now
she and her sister were sitting on the remains of evie's mockery where the lawn merged into the field
what a time they all are
said helen
what can they be doing inside
margaret who was growing less talkative made no answer
the noise of the cutter came intermittently like the breaking of waves
close by them a man was preparing to scythe out one of the dellholes
i wish henry was out to enjoy this said helen
this lovely weather and to be shut up in the house
it's very hard
it has to be said margaret
the hayfever is his chief objection against living here but he thinks it worth while
meg is or isn't he ill
i can't make out
not ill  eternally tired
he has worked very hard all his life and noticed nothing
those are the people who collapse when they do notice a thing
i suppose he worries dreadfully about his part of the tangle
dreadfully
that is why i wish dolly had not come too today
still he wanted them all to come
it has to be
why does he want them
margaret did not answer
meg may i tell you something
i like henry
you'd be odd if you didn't said margaret
i usen't to
usen't
she lowered her eyes a moment to the black abyss of the past
they had crossed it always excepting leonard and charles
they were building up a new life obscure yet gilded with tranquillity
leonard was dead charles had two years more in prison
one usen't always to see clearly before that time
it was different now
i like henry because he does worry
and he likes you because you don't
helen sighed
she seemed humiliated and buried her face in her hands
after a time she said above love a transition less abrupt than it appeared
margaret never stopped working
i mean a woman's love for a man
i supposed i should hang my life on to that once and was driven up and down and about as if something was worrying through me
but everything is peaceful now i seem cured
that herr forstmeister whom frieda keeps writing about must be a noble character but he doesn't see that i shall never marry him or anyone
it isn't shame or mistrust of myself
i simply couldn't
i'm ended
i used to be so dreamy about a man's love as a girl and think that for good or evil love must be the great thing
but it hasn't been it has been itself a dream
do you agree
i do not agree
i do not
i ought to remember leonard as my lover said helen stepping down into the field
i tempted him and killed him and it is surely the least i can do
i would like to throw out all my heart to leonard on such an afternoon as this
but i cannot
it is no good pretending
i am forgetting him
her eyes filled with tears
how nothing seems to matchhow my darling my precious she broke off
tommy
yes please
baby's not to try and standthere's something wanting in me
i see you loving henry and understanding him better daily and i know that death wouldn't part you in the least
but iis it some awful appalling criminal defect
margaret silenced her
she said it is only that people are far more different than is pretended
all over the world men and women are worrying because they cannot develop as they are supposed to develop
here and there they have the matter out and it comforts them
don't fret yourself helen
develop what you have love your child
i do not love children
i am thankful to have none
i can play with their beauty and charm but that is allnothing real not one scrap of what there ought to be
and othersothers go farther still and move outside humanity altogether
a place as well as a person may catch the glow
don't you see that all this leads to comfort in the end
it is part of the battle against sameness
differenceseternal differences planted by god in a single family so that there may always be colour sorrow perhaps but colour in the daily grey
then i can't have you worrying about leonard
don't drag in the personal when it will not come
forget him
yes yes but what has leonard got out of life
perhaps an adventure
is that enough
not for us
but for him
helen took up a bunch of grass
she looked at the sorrel and the red and white and yellow clover and the quaker grass and the daisies and the bents that composed it
she raised it to her face
is it sweetening yet
asked margaret
no only withered
it will sweeten tomorrow
helen smiled
oh meg you are a person she said
think of the racket and torture this time last year
but now i couldn't stop unhappy if i tried
what a changeand all through you
oh we merely settled down
you and henry learnt to understand one another and to forgive all through the autumn and the winter
yes but who settled us down
margaret did not reply
the scything had begun and she took off her pincenez to watch it
you
cried helen
you did it all sweetest though you're too stupid to see
living here was your plani wanted you he wanted you and every one said it was impossible but you knew
just think of our lives without you megi and baby with monica revolting by theory he handed about from dolly to evie
but you picked up the pieces and made us a home
can't it strike youeven for a momentthat your life has been heroic
can't you remember the two months after charles's arrest when you began to act and did all
you were both ill at the time said margaret
i did the obvious things
i had two invalids to nurse
here was a house ready furnished and empty
it was obvious
i didn't know myself it would turn into a permanent home
no doubt i have done a little towards straightening the tangle but things that i can't phrase have helped me
i hope it will be permanent said helen drifting away to other thoughts
i think so
there are moments when i feel howards end peculiarly our own
all the same london's creeping
she pointed over the meadowover eight or nine meadows but at the end of them was a red rust
you see that in surrey and even hampshire now she continued
i can see it from the purbeck downs
and london is only part of something else i'm afraid
life's going to be melted down all over the world
margaret knew that her sister spoke truly
howards end oniton the purbeck downs the oderberge were all survivals and the meltingpot was being prepared for them
logically they had no right to be alive
one's hope was in the weakness of logic
were they possibly the earth beating time
because a thing is going strong now it need not go strong for ever she said
this craze for motion has only set in during the last hundred years
it may be followed by a civilization that won't be a movement because it will rest on the earth
all the signs are against it now but i can't help hoping and very early in the morning in the garden i feel that our house is the future as well as the past
they turned and looked at it
their own memories coloured it now for helen's child had been born in the central room of the nine
then margaret said oh take care
for something moved behind the window of the hall and the door opened
the conclave's breaking at last
i'll go
it was paul
helen retreated with the children far into the field
friendly voices greeted her
margaret rose to encounter a man with a heavy black moustache
my father has asked for you he said with hostility
she took her work and followed him
we have been talking business he continued but i dare say you knew all about it beforehand
yes i did
clumsy of movementfor he had spent all his life in the saddlepaul drove his foot against the paint of the front door
mrs wilcox gave a little cry of annoyance
she did not like anything scratched she stopped in the hall to take dolly's boa and gloves out of a vase
her husband was lying in a great leather chair in the diningroom and by his side holding his hand rather ostentatiously was evie
dolly dressed in purple sat near the window
the room was a little dark and airless they were obliged to keep it like this until the carting of the hay
margaret joined the family without speaking the five of them had met already at tea and she knew quite well what was going to be said
averse to wasting her time she went on sewing
the clock struck six
is this going to suit every one
said henry in a weary voice
he used the old phrases but their effect was unexpected and shadowy
because i don't want you all coming here later on and complaining that i have been unfair
it's apparently got to suit us said paul
i beg your pardon my boy
you have only to speak and i will leave the house to you instead
paul frowned illtemperedly and began scratching at his arm
as i've given up the outdoor life that suited me and i have come home to look after the business it's no good my settling down here he said at last
it's not really the country and it's not the town
very well
does my arrangement suit you evie
of course father
and you dolly
dolly raised her faded little face which sorrow could wither but not steady
perfectly splendidly she said
i thought charles wanted it for the boys but last time i saw him he said no because we cannot possibly live in this part of england again
charles says we ought to change our name but i cannot think what to for wilcox just suits charles and me and i can't think of any other name
there was a general silence
dolly looked nervously round fearing that she had been inappropriate
paul continued to scratch his arm
then i leave howards end to my wife absolutely said henry
and let every one understand that and after i am dead let there be no jealousy and no surprise
margaret did not answer
there was something uncanny in her triumph
she who had never expected to conquer anyone had charged straight through these wilcoxes and broken up their lives
in consequence i leave my wife no money said henry
that is her own wish
all that she would have had will be divided among you
i am also giving you a great deal in my lifetime so that you may be independent of me
that is her wish too
she also is giving away a great deal of money
she intends to diminish her income by half during the next ten years she intends when she dies to leave the house to herto her nephew down in the field
is all that clear
does every one understand
paul rose to his feet
he was accustomed to natives and a very little shook him out of the englishman
feeling manly and cynical he said down in the field
oh come
i think we might have had the whole establishment piccaninnies included
mrs cahill whispered don't paul
you promised you'd take care
feeling a woman of the world she rose and prepared to take her leave
her father kissed her
goodbye old girl he said don't you worry about me 
goodbye dad
then it was dolly's turn
anxious to contribute she laughed nervously and said goodbye mr wilcox
it does seem curious that mrs wilcox should have left margaret howards end and yet she get it after all
from evie came a sharplydrawn breath
goodbye she said to margaret and kissed her
and again and again fell the word like the ebb of a dying sea
goodbye
goodbye dolly
so long father
goodbye my boy always take care of yourself
goodbye mrs
wilcox
goodbye
margaret saw their visitors to the gate
then she returned to her husband and laid her head in his hands
he was pitiably tired
but dolly's remark had interested her
at last she said could you tell me henry what was that about mrs wilcox having left me howards end
tranquilly he replied yes she did
but that is a very old story
when she was ill and you were so kind to her she wanted to make you some return and not being herself at the time scribbled 'howards end' on a piece of paper
i went into it thoroughly and as it was clearly fanciful i set it aside little knowing what my margaret would be to me in the future
margaret was silent
something shook her life in its inmost recesses and she shivered
i didn't do wrong did i
he asked bending down
you didn't darling
nothing has been done wrong
from the garden came laughter
here they are at last
exclaimed henry disengaging himself with a smile
helen rushed into the gloom holding tom by one hand and carrying her baby on the other
there were shouts of infectious joy
the field's cut
helen cried excitedlythe big meadow
we've seen to the very end and it'll be such a crop of hay as never
