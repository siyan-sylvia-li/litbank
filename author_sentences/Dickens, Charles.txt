a last retrospect preface to edition i do not find it easy to get sufficiently far away from this book in the first sensations of having finished it to refer to it with the composure which this formal heading would seem to require
my interest in it is so recent and strong and my mind is so divided between pleasure and regretpleasure in the achievement of a long design regret in the separation from many companionsthat i am in danger of wearying the reader whom i love with personal confidences and private emotions
besides which all that i could say of the story to any purpose i have endeavoured to say in it
it would concern the reader little perhaps to know how sorrowfully the pen is laid down at the close of a twoyears imaginative task or how an author feels as if he were dismissing some portion of himself into the shadowy world when a crowd of the creatures of his brain are going from him for ever
yet i have nothing else to tell unless indeed i were to confess which might be of less moment still that no one can ever believe this narrative in the reading more than i have believed it in the writing
instead of looking back therefore i will look forward
i cannot close this volume more agreeably to myself than with a hopeful glance towards the time when i shall again put forth my two green leaves once a month and with a faithful remembrance of the genial sun and showers that have fallen on these leaves of david copperfield and made me happy

preface to the charles dickens edition i remarked in the original preface to this book that i did not find it easy to get sufficiently far away from it in the first sensations of having finished it to refer to it with the composure which this formal heading would seem to require
my interest in it was so recent and strong and my mind was so divided between pleasure and regretpleasure in the achievement of a long design regret in the separation from many companionsthat i was in danger of wearying the reader with personal confidences and private emotions
besides which all that i could have said of the story to any purpose i had endeavoured to say in it
it would concern the reader little perhaps to know how sorrowfully the pen is laid down at the close of a twoyears imaginative task or how an author feels as if he were dismissing some portion of himself into the shadowy world when a crowd of the creatures of his brain are going from him for ever
yet i had nothing else to tell unless indeed i were to confess which might be of less moment still that no one can ever believe this narrative in the reading more than i believed it in the writing
so true are these avowals at the present day that i can now only take the reader into one confidence more
of all my books i like this the best
it will be easily believed that i am a fond parent to every child of my fancy and that no one can ever love that family as dearly as i love them
but like many fond parents i have in my heart of hearts a favourite child
and his name is david copperfield
the personal history and experience of david copperfield the younger whether i shall turn out to be the hero of my own life or whether that station will be held by anybody else these pages must show
to begin my life with the beginning of my life i record that i was born as i have been informed and believe on a friday at twelve oclock at night
it was remarked that the clock began to strike and i began to cry simultaneously
in consideration of the day and hour of my birth it was declared by the nurse and by some sage women in the neighbourhood who had taken a lively interest in me several months before there was any possibility of our becoming personally acquainted first that i was destined to be unlucky in life and secondly that i was privileged to see ghosts and spirits both these gifts inevitably attaching as they believed to all unlucky infants of either gender born towards the small hours on a friday night
i need say nothing here on the first head because nothing can show better than my history whether that prediction was verified or falsified by the result
on the second branch of the question i will only remark that unless i ran through that part of my inheritance while i was still a baby i have not come into it yet
but i do not at all complain of having been kept out of this property and if anybody else should be in the present enjoyment of it he is heartily welcome to keep it
i was born with a caul which was advertised for sale in the newspapers at the low price of fifteen guineas
whether seagoing people were short of money about that time or were short of faith and preferred cork jackets i dont know all i know is that there was but one solitary bidding and that was from an attorney connected with the billbroking business who offered two pounds in cash and the balance in sherry but declined to be guaranteed from drowning on any higher bargain
consequently the advertisement was withdrawn at a dead lossfor as to sherry my poor dear mothers own sherry was in the market thenand ten years afterwards the caul was put up in a raffle down in our part of the country to fifty members at halfacrown a head the winner to spend five shillings
i was present myself and i remember to have felt quite uncomfortable and confused at a part of myself being disposed of in that way
the caul was won i recollect by an old lady with a handbasket who very reluctantly produced from it the stipulated five shillings all in halfpence and twopence halfpenny shortas it took an immense time and a great waste of arithmetic to endeavour without any effect to prove to her
it is a fact which will be long remembered as remarkable down there that she was never drowned but died triumphantly in bed at ninetytwo
i have understood that it was to the last her proudest boast that she never had been on the water in her life except upon a bridge and that over her tea to which she was extremely partial she to the last expressed her indignation at the impiety of mariners and others who had the presumption to go meandering about the world
it was in vain to represent to her that some conveniences tea perhaps included resulted from this objectionable practice
she always returned with greater emphasis and with an instinctive knowledge of the strength of her objection let us have no meandering not to meander myself at present i will go back to my birth
i was born at blunderstone in suffolk or there by as they say in scotland
i was a posthumous child
my fathers eyes had closed upon the light of this world six months when mine opened on it
there is something strange to me even now in the reflection that he never saw me and something stranger yet in the shadowy remembrance that i have of my first childish associations with his white gravestone in the churchyard and of the indefinable compassion i used to feel for it lying out alone there in the dark night when our little parlour was warm and bright with fire and candle and the doors of our house werealmost cruelly it seemed to me sometimesbolted and locked against it
an aunt of my fathers and consequently a greataunt of mine of whom i shall have more to relate by and by was the principal magnate of our family
miss trotwood or miss betsey as my poor mother always called her when she sufficiently overcame her dread of this formidable personage to mention her at all which was seldom had been married to a husband younger than herself who was very handsome except in the sense of the homely adage handsome is that handsome doesfor he was strongly suspected of having beaten miss betsey and even of having once on a disputed question of supplies made some hasty but determined arrangements to throw her out of a two pair of stairs window
these evidences of an incompatibility of temper induced miss betsey to pay him off and effect a separation by mutual consent
he went to india with his capital and there according to a wild legend in our family he was once seen riding on an elephant in company with a baboon but i think it must have been a babooor a begum
anyhow from india tidings of his death reached home within ten years
how they affected my aunt nobody knew for immediately upon the separation she took her maiden name again bought a cottage in a hamlet on the seacoast a long way off established herself there as a single woman with one servant and was understood to live secluded ever afterwards in an inflexible retirement
my father had once been a favourite of hers i believe but she was mortally affronted by his marriage on the ground that my mother was a wax doll
she had never seen my mother but she knew her to be not yet twenty
my father and miss betsey never met again
he was double my mothers age when he married and of but a delicate constitution
he died a year afterwards and as i have said six months before i came into the world
this was the state of matters on the afternoon of what i may be excused for calling that eventful and important friday
i can make no claim therefore to have known at that time how matters stood or to have any remembrance founded on the evidence of my own senses of what follows
my mother was sitting by the fire but poorly in health and very low in spirits looking at it through her tears and desponding heavily about herself and the fatherless little stranger who was already welcomed by some grosses of prophetic pins in a drawer upstairs to a world not at all excited on the subject of his arrival my mother i say was sitting by the fire that bright windy march afternoon very timid and sad and very doubtful of ever coming alive out of the trial that was before her when lifting her eyes as she dried them to the window opposite she saw a strange lady coming up the garden
my mother had a sure foreboding at the second glance that it was miss betsey
the setting sun was glowing on the strange lady over the gardenfence and she came walking up to the door with a fell rigidity of figure and composure of countenance that could have belonged to nobody else
when she reached the house she gave another proof of her identity
my father had often hinted that she seldom conducted herself like any ordinary christian and now instead of ringing the bell she came and looked in at that identical window pressing the end of her nose against the glass to that extent that my poor dear mother used to say it became perfectly flat and white in a moment
she gave my mother such a turn that i have always been convinced i am indebted to miss betsey for having been born on a friday
my mother had left her chair in her agitation and gone behind it in the corner
miss betsey looking round the room slowly and inquiringly began on the other side and carried her eyes on like a saracens head in a dutch clock until they reached my mother
then she made a frown and a gesture to my mother like one who was accustomed to be obeyed to come and open the door
my mother went
mrs
david copperfield i think said miss betsey the emphasis referring perhaps to my mothers mourning weeds and her condition
yes said my mother faintly
miss trotwood said the visitor
you have heard of her i dare say my mother answered she had had that pleasure
and she had a disagreeable consciousness of not appearing to imply that it had been an overpowering pleasure
now you see her said miss betsey
my mother bent her head and begged her to walk in
they went into the parlour my mother had come from the fire in the best room on the other side of the passage not being lightednot having been lighted indeed since my fathers funeral and when they were both seated and miss betsey said nothing my mother after vainly trying to restrain herself began to cry
oh tut tut tut said miss betsey in a hurry
dont do that
come come my mother couldnt help it notwithstanding so she cried until she had had her cry out
take off your cap child said miss betsey and let me see you my mother was too much afraid of her to refuse compliance with this odd request if she had any disposition to do so
therefore she did as she was told and did it with such nervous hands that her hair which was luxuriant and beautiful fell all about her face
why bless my heart exclaimed miss betsey
you are a very baby my mother was no doubt unusually youthful in appearance even for her years she hung her head as if it were her fault poor thing and said sobbing that indeed she was afraid she was but a childish widow and would be but a childish mother if she lived
in a short pause which ensued she had a fancy that she felt miss betsey touch her hair and that with no ungentle hand but looking at her in her timid hope she found that lady sitting with the skirt of her dress tucked up her hands folded on one knee and her feet upon the fender frowning at the fire
in the name of heaven said miss betsey suddenly why rookery do you mean the house maam asked my mother
why rookery said miss betsey
cookery would have been more to the purpose if you had had any practical ideas of life either of you the name was mr copperfields choice returned my mother
when he bought the house he liked to think that there were rooks about it the evening wind made such a disturbance just now among some tall old elmtrees at the bottom of the garden that neither my mother nor miss betsey could forbear glancing that way
as the elms bent to one another like giants who were whispering secrets and after a few seconds of such repose fell into a violent flurry tossing their wild arms about as if their late confidences were really too wicked for their peace of mind some weatherbeaten ragged old rooksnests burdening their higher branches swung like wrecks upon a stormy sea
where are the birds asked miss betsey
the my mother had been thinking of something else
the rookswhat has become of them asked miss betsey
there have not been any since we have lived here said my mother
we thoughtmr copperfield thoughtit was quite a large rookery but the nests were very old ones and the birds have deserted them a long while david copperfield all over cried miss betsey
david copperfield from head to foot
calls a house a rookery when theres not a rook near it and takes the birds on trust because he sees the nests mr
copperfield returned my mother is dead and if you dare to speak unkindly of him to me my poor dear mother i suppose had some momentary intention of committing an assault and battery upon my aunt who could easily have settled her with one hand even if my mother had been in far better training for such an encounter than she was that evening
but it passed with the action of rising from her chair and she sat down again very meekly and fainted
when she came to herself or when miss betsey had restored her whichever it was she found the latter standing at the window
the twilight was by this time shading down into darkness and dimly as they saw each other they could not have done that without the aid of the fire
well said miss betsey coming back to her chair as if she had only been taking a casual look at the prospect and when do you expect i am all in a tremble faltered my mother
i dont know whats the matter
i shall die i am sure no no no said miss betsey
have some tea oh dear me dear me do you think it will do me any good cried my mother in a helpless manner
of course it will said miss betsey
its nothing but fancy
what do you call your girl i dont know that it will be a girl yet maam said my mother innocently
bless the baby exclaimed miss betsey unconsciously quoting the second sentiment of the pincushion in the drawer upstairs but applying it to my mother instead of me i dont mean that
i mean your servantgirl peggotty said my mother
peggotty repeated miss betsey with some indignation
do you mean to say child that any human being has gone into a christian church and got herself named peggotty its her surname said my mother faintly
mr
copperfield called her by it because her christian name was the same as mine here
peggotty cried miss betsey opening the parlour door
tea
your mistress is a little unwell
dont dawdle having issued this mandate with as much potentiality as if she had been a recognized authority in the house ever since it had been a house and having looked out to confront the amazed peggotty coming along the passage with a candle at the sound of a strange voice miss betsey shut the door again and sat down as before with her feet on the fender the skirt of her dress tucked up and her hands folded on one knee
you were speaking about its being a girl said miss betsey
i have no doubt it will be a girl
i have a presentiment that it must be a girl
now child from the moment of the birth of this girl perhaps boy my mother took the liberty of putting in
i tell you i have a presentiment that it must be a girl returned miss betsey
dont contradict
from the moment of this girls birth child i intend to be her friend
i intend to be her godmother and i beg youll call her betsey trotwood copperfield
there must be no mistakes in life with this betsey trotwood
there must be no trifling with her affections poor dear
she must be well brought up and well guarded from reposing any foolish confidences where they are not deserved
i must make that my care there was a twitch of miss betseys head after each of these sentences as if her own old wrongs were working within her and she repressed any plainer reference to them by strong constraint
so my mother suspected at least as she observed her by the low glimmer of the fire too much scared by miss betsey too uneasy in herself and too subdued and bewildered altogether to observe anything very clearly or to know what to say
and was david good to you child asked miss betsey when she had been silent for a little while and these motions of her head had gradually ceased
were you comfortable together we were very happy said my mother
mr
copperfield was only too good to me what he spoilt you i suppose returned miss betsey
for being quite alone and dependent on myself in this rough world again yes i fear he did indeed sobbed my mother
well
dont cry said miss betsey
you were not equally matched childif any two people can be equally matchedand so i asked the question
you were an orphan werent you yes and a governess i was nurserygoverness in a family where mr copperfield came to visit
mr copperfield was very kind to me and took a great deal of notice of me and paid me a good deal of attention and at last proposed to me
and i accepted him
and so we were married said my mother simply
ha
poor baby mused miss betsey with her frown still bent upon the fire
do you know anything i beg your pardon maam faltered my mother
about keeping house for instance said miss betsey
not much i fear returned my mother
not so much as i could wish
but mr copperfield was teaching me much he knew about it himself said miss betsey in a parenthesis
and i hope i should have improved being very anxious to learn and he very patient to teach me if the great misfortune of his deathmy mother broke down again here and could get no farther
well well said miss betsey
i kept my housekeepingbook regularly and balanced it with mr copperfield every night cried my mother in another burst of distress and breaking down again
well well said miss betsey
dont cry any more and i am sure we never had a word of difference respecting it except when mr copperfield objected to my threes and fives being too much like each other or to my putting curly tails to my sevens and nines resumed my mother in another burst and breaking down again
youll make yourself ill said miss betsey and you know that will not be good either for you or for my goddaughter
come
you mustnt do it this argument had some share in quieting my mother though her increasing indisposition had a larger one
there was an interval of silence only broken by miss betseys occasionally ejaculating ha as she sat with her feet upon the fender
david had bought an annuity for himself with his money i know said she by and by
what did he do for you mr
copperfield said my mother answering with some difficulty was so considerate and good as to secure the reversion of a part of it to me how much asked miss betsey
a hundred and five pounds a year said my mother
he might have done worse said my aunt
the word was appropriate to the moment
my mother was so much worse that peggotty coming in with the teaboard and candles and seeing at a glance how ill she wasas miss betsey might have done sooner if there had been light enoughconveyed her upstairs to her own room with all speed and immediately dispatched ham peggotty her nephew who had been for some days past secreted in the house unknown to my mother as a special messenger in case of emergency to fetch the nurse and doctor
those allied powers were considerably astonished when they arrived within a few minutes of each other to find an unknown lady of portentous appearance sitting before the fire with her bonnet tied over her left arm stopping her ears with jewellers cotton
peggotty knowing nothing about her and my mother saying nothing about her she was quite a mystery in the parlour and the fact of her having a magazine of jewellers cotton in her pocket and sticking the article in her ears in that way did not detract from the solemnity of her presence
the doctor having been upstairs and come down again and having satisfied himself i suppose that there was a probability of this unknown lady and himself having to sit there face to face for some hours laid himself out to be polite and social
he was the meekest of his sex the mildest of little men
he sidled in and out of a room to take up the less space
he walked as softly as the ghost in hamlet and more slowly
he carried his head on one side partly in modest depreciation of himself partly in modest propitiation of everybody else
it is nothing to say that he hadnt a word to throw at a dog
he couldnt have thrown a word at a mad dog
he might have offered him one gently or half a one or a fragment of one for he spoke as slowly as he walked but he wouldnt have been rude to him and he couldnt have been quick with him for any earthly consideration
mr chillip looking mildly at my aunt with his head on one side and making her a little bow said in allusion to the jewellers cotton as he softly touched his left ear some local irritation maam what replied my aunt pulling the cotton out of one ear like a cork
mr chillip was so alarmed by her abruptnessas he told my mother afterwardsthat it was a mercy he didnt lose his presence of mind
but he repeated sweetly some local irritation maam nonsense replied my aunt and corked herself again at one blow
mr chillip could do nothing after this but sit and look at her feebly as she sat and looked at the fire until he was called upstairs again
after some quarter of an hours absence he returned
well said my aunt taking the cotton out of the ear nearest to him
well maam returned mr chillip we arewe are progressing slowly maam baaah said my aunt with a perfect shake on the contemptuous interjection
and corked herself as before
reallyreallyas mr chillip told my mother he was almost shocked speaking in a professional point of view alone he was almost shocked
but he sat and looked at her notwithstanding for nearly two hours as she sat looking at the fire until he was again called out
after another absence he again returned
well said my aunt taking out the cotton on that side again
well maam returned mr chillip we arewe are progressing slowly maam yaaah said my aunt
with such a snarl at him that mr chillip absolutely could not bear it
it was really calculated to break his spirit he said afterwards
he preferred to go and sit upon the stairs in the dark and a strong draught until he was again sent for
ham peggotty who went to the national school and was a very dragon at his catechism and who may therefore be regarded as a credible witness reported next day that happening to peep in at the parlourdoor an hour after this he was instantly descried by miss betsey then walking to and fro in a state of agitation and pounced upon before he could make his escape
that there were now occasional sounds of feet and voices overhead which he inferred the cotton did not exclude from the circumstance of his evidently being clutched by the lady as a victim on whom to expend her superabundant agitation when the sounds were loudest
that marching him constantly up and down by the collar as if he had been taking too much laudanum she at those times shook him rumpled his hair made light of his linen stopped his ears as if she confounded them with her own and otherwise tousled and maltreated him
this was in part confirmed by his aunt who saw him at half past twelve oclock soon after his release and affirmed that he was then as red as i was
the mild mr chillip could not possibly bear malice at such a time if at any time
he sidled into the parlour as soon as he was at liberty and said to my aunt in his meekest manner well maam i am happy to congratulate you what upon said my aunt sharply
mr chillip was fluttered again by the extreme severity of my aunts manner so he made her a little bow and gave her a little smile to mollify her
mercy on the man whats he doing cried my aunt impatiently
cant he speak be calm my dear maam said mr chillip in his softest accents
there is no longer any occasion for uneasiness maam
be calm it has since been considered almost a miracle that my aunt didnt shake him and shake what he had to say out of him
she only shook her own head at him but in a way that made him quail
well maam resumed mr chillip as soon as he had courage i am happy to congratulate you
all is now over maam and well over during the five minutes or so that mr chillip devoted to the delivery of this oration my aunt eyed him narrowly
how is she said my aunt folding her arms with her bonnet still tied on one of them
well maam she will soon be quite comfortable i hope returned mr chillip
quite as comfortable as we can expect a young mother to be under these melancholy domestic circumstances
there cannot be any objection to your seeing her presently maam
it may do her good and she
how is she said my aunt sharply
mr chillip laid his head a little more on one side and looked at my aunt like an amiable bird
the baby said my aunt
how is she maam returned mr chillip i apprehended you had known
its a boy my aunt said never a word but took her bonnet by the strings in the manner of a sling aimed a blow at mr chillips head with it put it on bent walked out and never came back
she vanished like a discontented fairy or like one of those supernatural beings whom it was popularly supposed i was entitled to see and never came back any more
no
i lay in my basket and my mother lay in her bed but betsey trotwood copperfield was for ever in the land of dreams and shadows the tremendous region whence i had so lately travelled and the light upon the window of our room shone out upon the earthly bourne of all such travellers and the mound above the ashes and the dust that once was he without whom i had never been
the first objects that assume a distinct presence before me as i look far back into the blank of my infancy are my mother with her pretty hair and youthful shape and peggotty with no shape at all and eyes so dark that they seemed to darken their whole neighbourhood in her face and cheeks and arms so hard and red that i wondered the birds didnt peck her in preference to apples
i believe i can remember these two at a little distance apart dwarfed to my sight by stooping down or kneeling on the floor and i going unsteadily from the one to the other
i have an impression on my mind which i cannot distinguish from actual remembrance of the touch of peggottys forefinger as she used to hold it out to me and of its being roughened by needlework like a pocket nutmeggrater
this may be fancy though i think the memory of most of us can go farther back into such times than many of us suppose just as i believe the power of observation in numbers of very young children to be quite wonderful for its closeness and accuracy
indeed i think that most grown men who are remarkable in this respect may with greater propriety be said not to have lost the faculty than to have acquired it the rather as i generally observe such men to retain a certain freshness and gentleness and capacity of being pleased which are also an inheritance they have preserved from their childhood
i might have a misgiving that i am meandering in stopping to say this but that it brings me to remark that i build these conclusions in part upon my own experience of myself and if it should appear from anything i may set down in this narrative that i was a child of close observation or that as a man i have a strong memory of my childhood i undoubtedly lay claim to both of these characteristics
looking back as i was saying into the blank of my infancy the first objects i can remember as standing out by themselves from a confusion of things are my mother and peggotty
what else do i remember
let me see
there comes out of the cloud our housenot new to me but quite familiar in its earliest remembrance
on the groundfloor is peggottys kitchen opening into a back yard with a pigeonhouse on a pole in the centre without any pigeons in it a great dogkennel in a corner without any dog and a quantity of fowls that look terribly tall to me walking about in a menacing and ferocious manner
there is one cock who gets upon a post to crow and seems to take particular notice of me as i look at him through the kitchen window who makes me shiver he is so fierce
of the geese outside the sidegate who come waddling after me with their long necks stretched out when i go that way i dream at night as a man environed by wild beasts might dream of lions
here is a long passagewhat an enormous perspective i make of itleading from peggottys kitchen to the front door
a dark storeroom opens out of it and that is a place to be run past at night for i dont know what may be among those tubs and jars and old teachests when there is nobody in there with a dimlyburning light letting a mouldy air come out of the door in which there is the smell of soap pickles pepper candles and coffee all at one whiff
then there are the two parlours the parlour in which we sit of an evening my mother and i and peggottyfor peggotty is quite our companion when her work is done and we are aloneand the best parlour where we sit on a sunday grandly but not so comfortably
there is something of a doleful air about that room to me for peggotty has told mei dont know when but apparently ages agoabout my fathers funeral and the company having their black cloaks put on
one sunday night my mother reads to peggotty and me in there how lazarus was raised up from the dead
and i am so frightened that they are afterwards obliged to take me out of bed and show me the quiet churchyard out of the bedroom window with the dead all lying in their graves at rest below the solemn moon
there is nothing half so green that i know anywhere as the grass of that churchyard nothing half so shady as its trees nothing half so quiet as its tombstones
the sheep are feeding there when i kneel up early in the morning in my little bed in a closet within my mothers room to look out at it and i see the red light shining on the sundial and think within myself is the sundial glad i wonder that it can tell the time again here is our pew in the church
what a highbacked pew
with a window near it out of which our house can be seen and is seen many times during the mornings service by peggotty who likes to make herself as sure as she can that its not being robbed or is not in flames
but though peggottys eye wanders she is much offended if mine does and frowns to me as i stand upon the seat that i am to look at the clergyman
but i cant always look at himi know him without that white thing on and i am afraid of his wondering why i stare so and perhaps stopping the service to inquireand what am i to do
its a dreadful thing to gape but i must do something
i look at my mother but she pretends not to see me
i look at a boy in the aisle and he makes faces at me
i look at the sunlight coming in at the open door through the porch and there i see a stray sheepi dont mean a sinner but muttonhalf making up his mind to come into the church
i feel that if i looked at him any longer i might be tempted to say something out loud and what would become of me then
i look up at the monumental tablets on the wall and try to think of mr bodgers late of this parish and what the feelings of mrs bodgers must have been when affliction sore long time mr bodgers bore and physicians were in vain
i wonder whether they called in mr chillip and he was in vain and if so how he likes to be reminded of it once a week
i look from mr chillip in his sunday neckcloth to the pulpit and think what a good place it would be to play in and what a castle it would make with another boy coming up the stairs to attack it and having the velvet cushion with the tassels thrown down on his head
in time my eyes gradually shut up and from seeming to hear the clergyman singing a drowsy song in the heat i hear nothing until i fall off the seat with a crash and am taken out more dead than alive by peggotty
and now i see the outside of our house with the latticed bedroomwindows standing open to let in the sweetsmelling air and the ragged old rooksnests still dangling in the elmtrees at the bottom of the front garden
now i am in the garden at the back beyond the yard where the empty pigeonhouse and dogkennel area very preserve of butterflies as i remember it with a high fence and a gate and padlock where the fruit clusters on the trees riper and richer than fruit has ever been since in any other garden and where my mother gathers some in a basket while i stand by bolting furtive gooseberries and trying to look unmoved
a great wind rises and the summer is gone in a moment
we are playing in the winter twilight dancing about the parlour
when my mother is out of breath and rests herself in an elbowchair i watch her winding her bright curls round her fingers and straitening her waist and nobody knows better than i do that she likes to look so well and is proud of being so pretty
that is among my very earliest impressions
that and a sense that we were both a little afraid of peggotty and submitted ourselves in most things to her direction were among the first opinionsif they may be so calledthat i ever derived from what i saw
peggotty and i were sitting one night by the parlour fire alone
i had been reading to peggotty about crocodiles
i must have read very perspicuously or the poor soul must have been deeply interested for i remember she had a cloudy impression after i had done that they were a sort of vegetable
i was tired of reading and dead sleepy but having leave as a high treat to sit up until my mother came home from spending the evening at a neighbours i would rather have died upon my post of course than have gone to bed
i had reached that stage of sleepiness when peggotty seemed to swell and grow immensely large
i propped my eyelids open with my two forefingers and looked perseveringly at her as she sat at work at the little bit of waxcandle she kept for her threadhow old it looked being so wrinkled in all directionsat the little house with a thatched roof where the yardmeasure lived at her workbox with a sliding lid with a view of st pauls cathedral with a pink dome painted on the top at the brass thimble on her finger at herself whom i thought lovely
i felt so sleepy that i knew if i lost sight of anything for a moment i was gone
peggotty says i suddenly were you ever married lord master davy replied peggotty
whats put marriage in your head she answered with such a start that it quite awoke me
and then she stopped in her work and looked at me with her needle drawn out to its threads length
but were you ever married peggotty says i
you are a very handsome woman ant you i thought her in a different style from my mother certainly but of another school of beauty i considered her a perfect example
there was a red velvet footstool in the best parlour on which my mother had painted a nosegay
the groundwork of that stool and peggottys complexion appeared to me to be one and the same thing
the stool was smooth and peggotty was rough but that made no difference
me handsome davy said peggotty
lawk no my dear
but what put marriage in your head i dont knowyou mustnt marry more than one person at a time may you peggotty certainly not says peggotty with the promptest decision
but if you marry a person and the person dies why then you may marry another person maynt you peggotty you may says peggotty if you choose my dear
thats a matter of opinion but what is your opinion peggotty said i i asked her and looked curiously at her because she looked so curiously at me
my opinion is said peggotty taking her eyes from me after a little indecision and going on with her work that i never was married myself master davy and that i dont expect to be
thats all i know about the subject you ant cross i suppose peggotty are you said i after sitting quiet for a minute
i really thought she was she had been so short with me but i was quite mistaken for she laid aside her work which was a stocking of her own and opening her arms wide took my curly head within them and gave it a good squeeze
i know it was a good squeeze because being very plump whenever she made any little exertion after she was dressed some of the buttons on the back of her gown flew off
and i recollect two bursting to the opposite side of the parlour while she was hugging me
now let me hear some more about the crorkindills said peggotty who was not quite right in the name yet for i ant heard half enough i couldnt quite understand why peggotty looked so queer or why she was so ready to go back to the crocodiles
however we returned to those monsters with fresh wakefulness on my part and we left their eggs in the sand for the sun to hatch and we ran away from them and baffled them by constantly turning which they were unable to do quickly on account of their unwieldy make and we went into the water after them as natives and put sharp pieces of timber down their throats and in short we ran the whole crocodile gauntlet
i did at least but i had my doubts of peggotty who was thoughtfully sticking her needle into various parts of her face and arms all the time
we had exhausted the crocodiles and begun with the alligators when the gardenbell rang
we went out to the door and there was my mother looking unusually pretty i thought and with her a gentleman with beautiful black hair and whiskers who had walked home with us from church last sunday
as my mother stooped down on the threshold to take me in her arms and kiss me the gentleman said i was a more highly privileged little fellow than a monarchor something like that for my later understanding comes i am sensible to my aid here
what does that mean i asked him over her shoulder
he patted me on the head but somehow i didnt like him or his deep voice and i was jealous that his hand should touch my mothers in touching mewhich it did
i put it away as well as i could
oh davy remonstrated my mother
dear boy said the gentleman
i cannot wonder at his devotion i never saw such a beautiful colour on my mothers face before
she gently chid me for being rude and keeping me close to her shawl turned to thank the gentleman for taking so much trouble as to bring her home
she put out her hand to him as she spoke and as he met it with his own she glanced i thought at me
let us say good night my fine boy said the gentleman when he had bent his headi saw himover my mothers little glove
good night said i
come
let us be the best friends in the world said the gentleman laughing
shake hands my right hand was in my mothers left so i gave him the other
why thats the wrong hand davy laughed the gentleman
my mother drew my right hand forward but i was resolved for my former reason not to give it him and i did not
i gave him the other and he shook it heartily and said i was a brave fellow and went away
at this minute i see him turn round in the garden and give us a last look with his illomened black eyes before the door was shut
peggotty who had not said a word or moved a finger secured the fastenings instantly and we all went into the parlour
my mother contrary to her usual habit instead of coming to the elbowchair by the fire remained at the other end of the room and sat singing to herself
hope you have had a pleasant evening maam said peggotty standing as stiff as a barrel in the centre of the room with a candlestick in her hand
much obliged to you peggotty returned my mother in a cheerful voice i have had a very pleasant evening a stranger or so makes an agreeable change suggested peggotty
a very agreeable change indeed returned my mother
peggotty continuing to stand motionless in the middle of the room and my mother resuming her singing i fell asleep though i was not so sound asleep but that i could hear voices without hearing what they said
when i half awoke from this uncomfortable doze i found peggotty and my mother both in tears and both talking
not such a one as this mr copperfield wouldnt have liked said peggotty
that i say and that i swear good heavens cried my mother youll drive me mad
was ever any poor girl so illused by her servants as i am
why do i do myself the injustice of calling myself a girl
have i never been married peggotty god knows you have maam returned peggotty
then how can you dare said my motheryou know i dont mean how can you dare peggotty but how can you have the heartto make me so uncomfortable and say such bitter things to me when you are well aware that i havent out of this place a single friend to turn to the mores the reason returned peggotty for saying that it wont do
no
that it wont do
no
no price could make it do
noi thought peggotty would have thrown the candlestick away she was so emphatic with it
how can you be so aggravating said my mother shedding more tears than before as to talk in such an unjust manner
how can you go on as if it was all settled and arranged peggotty when i tell you over and over again you cruel thing that beyond the commonest civilities nothing has passed
you talk of admiration
what am i to do
if people are so silly as to indulge the sentiment is it my fault
what am i to do i ask you
would you wish me to shave my head and black my face or disfigure myself with a burn or a scald or something of that sort
i dare say you would peggotty
i dare say youd quite enjoy it peggotty seemed to take this aspersion very much to heart i thought
and my dear boy cried my mother coming to the elbowchair in which i was and caressing me my own little davy
is it to be hinted to me that i am wanting in affection for my precious treasure the dearest little fellow that ever was nobody never went and hinted no such a thing said peggotty
you did peggotty returned my mother
you know you did
what else was it possible to infer from what you said you unkind creature when you know as well as i do that on his account only last quarter i wouldnt buy myself a new parasol though that old green one is frayed the whole way up and the fringe is perfectly mangy
you know it is peggotty
you cant deny it then turning affectionately to me with her cheek against mine am i a naughty mama to you davy
am i a nasty cruel selfish bad mama
say i am my child say yes dear boy and peggotty will love you and peggottys love is a great deal better than mine davy
i dont love you at all do i at this we all fell acrying together
i think i was the loudest of the party but i am sure we were all sincere about it
i was quite heartbroken myself and am afraid that in the first transports of wounded tenderness i called peggotty a beast
that honest creature was in deep affliction i remember and must have become quite buttonless on the occasion for a little volley of those explosives went off when after having made it up with my mother she kneeled down by the elbowchair and made it up with me
we went to bed greatly dejected
my sobs kept waking me for a long time and when one very strong sob quite hoisted me up in bed i found my mother sitting on the coverlet and leaning over me
i fell asleep in her arms after that and slept soundly
whether it was the following sunday when i saw the gentleman again or whether there was any greater lapse of time before he reappeared i cannot recall
i dont profess to be clear about dates
but there he was in church and he walked home with us afterwards
he came in too to look at a famous geranium we had in the parlourwindow
it did not appear to me that he took much notice of it but before he went he asked my mother to give him a bit of the blossom
she begged him to choose it for himself but he refused to do thati could not understand whyso she plucked it for him and gave it into his hand
he said he would never never part with it any more and i thought he must be quite a fool not to know that it would fall to pieces in a day or two
peggotty began to be less with us of an evening than she had always been
my mother deferred to her very muchmore than usual it occurred to meand we were all three excellent friends still we were different from what we used to be and were not so comfortable among ourselves
sometimes i fancied that peggotty perhaps objected to my mothers wearing all the pretty dresses she had in her drawers or to her going so often to visit at that neighbours but i couldnt to my satisfaction make out how it was
gradually i became used to seeing the gentleman with the black whiskers
i liked him no better than at first and had the same uneasy jealousy of him but if i had any reason for it beyond a childs instinctive dislike and a general idea that peggotty and i could make much of my mother without any help it certainly was not the reason that i might have found if i had been older
no such thing came into my mind or near it
i could observe in little pieces as it were but as to making a net of a number of these pieces and catching anybody in it that was as yet beyond me
one autumn morning i was with my mother in the front garden when mr murdstonei knew him by that name nowcame by on horseback
he reined up his horse to salute my mother and said he was going to lowestoft to see some friends who were there with a yacht and merrily proposed to take me on the saddle before him if i would like the ride
the air was so clear and pleasant and the horse seemed to like the idea of the ride so much himself as he stood snorting and pawing at the gardengate that i had a great desire to go
so i was sent upstairs to peggotty to be made spruce and in the meantime mr murdstone dismounted and with his horses bridle drawn over his arm walked slowly up and down on the outer side of the sweetbriar fence while my mother walked slowly up and down on the inner to keep him company
i recollect peggotty and i peeping out at them from my little window i recollect how closely they seemed to be examining the sweetbriar between them as they strolled along and how from being in a perfectly angelic temper peggotty turned cross in a moment and brushed my hair the wrong way excessively hard
mr murdstone and i were soon off and trotting along on the green turf by the side of the road
he held me quite easily with one arm and i dont think i was restless usually but i could not make up my mind to sit in front of him without turning my head sometimes and looking up in his face
he had that kind of shallow black eyei want a better word to express an eye that has no depth in it to be looked intowhich when it is abstracted seems from some peculiarity of light to be disfigured for a moment at a time by a cast
several times when i glanced at him i observed that appearance with a sort of awe and wondered what he was thinking about so closely
his hair and whiskers were blacker and thicker looked at so near than even i had given them credit for being
a squareness about the lower part of his face and the dotted indication of the strong black beard he shaved close every day reminded me of the waxwork that had travelled into our neighbourhood some halfayear before
this his regular eyebrows and the rich white and black and brown of his complexionconfound his complexion and his memorymade me think him in spite of my misgivings a very handsome man
i have no doubt that my poor dear mother thought him so too
we went to an hotel by the sea where two gentlemen were smoking cigars in a room by themselves
each of them was lying on at least four chairs and had a large rough jacket on
in a corner was a heap of coats and boatcloaks and a flag all bundled up together
they both rolled on to their feet in an untidy sort of manner when we came in and said halloa murdstone
we thought you were dead not yet said mr murdstone
and whos this shaver said one of the gentlemen taking hold of me
thats davy returned mr murdstone
davy who said the gentleman
jones copperfield said mr murdstone
what
bewitching mrs copperfields encumbrance cried the gentleman
the pretty little widow quinion said mr murdstone take care if you please
somebodys sharp who is asked the gentleman laughing
i looked up quickly being curious to know
only brooks of sheffield said mr murdstone
i was quite relieved to find that it was only brooks of sheffield for at first i really thought it was i
there seemed to be something very comical in the reputation of mr brooks of sheffield for both the gentlemen laughed heartily when he was mentioned and mr murdstone was a good deal amused also
after some laughing the gentleman whom he had called quinion said and what is the opinion of brooks of sheffield in reference to the projected business why i dont know that brooks understands much about it at present replied mr murdstone but he is not generally favourable i believe there was more laughter at this and mr quinion said he would ring the bell for some sherry in which to drink to brooks
this he did and when the wine came he made me have a little with a biscuit and before i drank it stand up and say confusion to brooks of sheffield the toast was received with great applause and such hearty laughter that it made me laugh too at which they laughed the more
in short we quite enjoyed ourselves
we walked about on the cliff after that and sat on the grass and looked at things through a telescopei could make out nothing myself when it was put to my eye but i pretended i couldand then we came back to the hotel to an early dinner
all the time we were out the two gentlemen smoked incessantlywhich i thought if i might judge from the smell of their rough coats they must have been doing ever since the coats had first come home from the tailors
i must not forget that we went on board the yacht where they all three descended into the cabin and were busy with some papers
i saw them quite hard at work when i looked down through the open skylight
they left me during this time with a very nice man with a very large head of red hair and a very small shiny hat upon it who had got a crossbarred shirt or waistcoat on with skylark in capital letters across the chest
i thought it was his name and that as he lived on board ship and hadnt a street door to put his name on he put it there instead but when i called him mr skylark he said it meant the vessel
i observed all day that mr murdstone was graver and steadier than the two gentlemen
they were very gay and careless
they joked freely with one another but seldom with him
it appeared to me that he was more clever and cold than they were and that they regarded him with something of my own feeling
i remarked that once or twice when mr quinion was talking he looked at mr murdstone sideways as if to make sure of his not being displeased and that once when mr passnidge the other gentleman was in high spirits he trod upon his foot and gave him a secret caution with his eyes to observe mr murdstone who was sitting stern and silent
nor do i recollect that mr murdstone laughed at all that day except at the sheffield jokeand that by the by was his own
we went home early in the evening
it was a very fine evening and my mother and he had another stroll by the sweetbriar while i was sent in to get my tea
when he was gone my mother asked me all about the day i had had and what they had said and done
i mentioned what they had said about her and she laughed and told me they were impudent fellows who talked nonsensebut i knew it pleased her
i knew it quite as well as i know it now
i took the opportunity of asking if she was at all acquainted with mr brooks of sheffield but she answered no only she supposed he must be a manufacturer in the knife and fork way
can i say of her facealtered as i have reason to remember it perished as i know it isthat it is gone when here it comes before me at this instant as distinct as any face that i may choose to look on in a crowded street
can i say of her innocent and girlish beauty that it faded and was no more when its breath falls on my cheek now as it fell that night
can i say she ever changed when my remembrance brings her back to life thus only and truer to its loving youth than i have been or man ever is still holds fast what it cherished then
i write of her just as she was when i had gone to bed after this talk and she came to bid me good night
she kneeled down playfully by the side of the bed and laying her chin upon her hands and laughing said what was it they said davy
tell me again
i cant believe it bewitching i began
my mother put her hands upon my lips to stop me
it was never bewitching she said laughing
it never could have been bewitching davy
now i know it wasnt yes it was
bewitching mrs copperfield i repeated stoutly
and pretty no no it was never pretty
not pretty interposed my mother laying her fingers on my lips again
yes it was
pretty little widow what foolish impudent creatures cried my mother laughing and covering her face
what ridiculous men
ant they
davy dear well ma dont tell peggotty she might be angry with them
i am dreadfully angry with them myself but i would rather peggotty didnt know i promised of course and we kissed one another over and over again and i soon fell fast asleep
it seems to me at this distance of time as if it were the next day when peggotty broached the striking and adventurous proposition i am about to mention but it was probably about two months afterwards
we were sitting as before one evening when my mother was out as before in company with the stocking and the yardmeasure and the bit of wax and the box with st pauls on the lid and the crocodile book when peggotty after looking at me several times and opening her mouth as if she were going to speak without doing itwhich i thought was merely gaping or i should have been rather alarmedsaid coaxingly master davy how should you like to go along with me and spend a fortnight at my brothers at yarmouth
wouldnt that be a treat is your brother an agreeable man peggotty i inquired provisionally
oh what an agreeable man he is cried peggotty holding up her hands
then theres the sea and the boats and ships and the fishermen and the beach and am to play with peggotty meant her nephew ham mentioned in my first chapter but she spoke of him as a morsel of english grammar
i was flushed by her summary of delights and replied that it would indeed be a treat but what would my mother say
why then ill as good as bet a guinea said peggotty intent upon my face that shell let us go
ill ask her if you like as soon as ever she comes home
there now but whats she to do while were away said i putting my small elbows on the table to argue the point
she cant live by herself if peggotty were looking for a hole all of a sudden in the heel of that stocking it must have been a very little one indeed and not worth darning
i say
peggotty
she cant live by herself you know oh bless you said peggotty looking at me again at last
dont you know
shes going to stay for a fortnight with mrs grayper
mrs graypers going to have a lot of company oh
if that was it i was quite ready to go
i waited in the utmost impatience until my mother came home from mrs graypers for it was that identical neighbour to ascertain if we could get leave to carry out this great idea
without being nearly so much surprised as i had expected my mother entered into it readily and it was all arranged that night and my board and lodging during the visit were to be paid for
the day soon came for our going
it was such an early day that it came soon even to me who was in a fever of expectation and half afraid that an earthquake or a fiery mountain or some other great convulsion of nature might interpose to stop the expedition
we were to go in a carriers cart which departed in the morning after breakfast
i would have given any money to have been allowed to wrap myself up overnight and sleep in my hat and boots
it touches me nearly now although i tell it lightly to recollect how eager i was to leave my happy home to think how little i suspected what i did leave for ever
i am glad to recollect that when the carriers cart was at the gate and my mother stood there kissing me a grateful fondness for her and for the old place i had never turned my back upon before made me cry
i am glad to know that my mother cried too and that i felt her heart beat against mine
i am glad to recollect that when the carrier began to move my mother ran out at the gate and called to him to stop that she might kiss me once more
i am glad to dwell upon the earnestness and love with which she lifted up her face to mine and did so
as we left her standing in the road mr murdstone came up to where she was and seemed to expostulate with her for being so moved
i was looking back round the awning of the cart and wondered what business it was of his
peggotty who was also looking back on the other side seemed anything but satisfied as the face she brought back in the cart denoted
i sat looking at peggotty for some time in a reverie on this supposititious case whether if she were employed to lose me like the boy in the fairy tale i should be able to track my way home again by the buttons she would shed
the carriers horse was the laziest horse in the world i should hope and shuffled along with his head down as if he liked to keep people waiting to whom the packages were directed
i fancied indeed that he sometimes chuckled audibly over this reflection but the carrier said he was only troubled with a cough
the carrier had a way of keeping his head down like his horse and of drooping sleepily forward as he drove with one of his arms on each of his knees
i say drove but it struck me that the cart would have gone to yarmouth quite as well without him for the horse did all that and as to conversation he had no idea of it but whistling
peggotty had a basket of refreshments on her knee which would have lasted us out handsomely if we had been going to london by the same conveyance
we ate a good deal and slept a good deal
peggotty always went to sleep with her chin upon the handle of the basket her hold of which never relaxed and i could not have believed unless i had heard her do it that one defenceless woman could have snored so much
we made so many deviations up and down lanes and were such a long time delivering a bedstead at a publichouse and calling at other places that i was quite tired and very glad when we saw yarmouth
it looked rather spongy and soppy i thought as i carried my eye over the great dull waste that lay across the river and i could not help wondering if the world were really as round as my geography book said how any part of it came to be so flat
but i reflected that yarmouth might be situated at one of the poles which would account for it
as we drew a little nearer and saw the whole adjacent prospect lying a straight low line under the sky i hinted to peggotty that a mound or so might have improved it and also that if the land had been a little more separated from the sea and the town and the tide had not been quite so much mixed up like toast and water it would have been nicer
but peggotty said with greater emphasis than usual that we must take things as we found them and that for her part she was proud to call herself a yarmouth bloater
when we got into the street which was strange enough to me and smelt the fish and pitch and oakum and tar and saw the sailors walking about and the carts jingling up and down over the stones i felt that i had done so busy a place an injustice and said as much to peggotty who heard my expressions of delight with great complacency and told me it was well known i suppose to those who had the good fortune to be born bloaters that yarmouth was upon the whole the finest place in the universe
heres my am screamed peggotty growed out of knowledge he was waiting for us in fact at the publichouse and asked me how i found myself like an old acquaintance
i did not feel at first that i knew him as well as he knew me because he had never come to our house since the night i was born and naturally he had the advantage of me
but our intimacy was much advanced by his taking me on his back to carry me home
he was now a huge strong fellow of six feet high broad in proportion and roundshouldered but with a simpering boys face and curly light hair that gave him quite a sheepish look
he was dressed in a canvas jacket and a pair of such very stiff trousers that they would have stood quite as well alone without any legs in them
and you couldnt so properly have said he wore a hat as that he was covered in atop like an old building with something pitchy
ham carrying me on his back and a small box of ours under his arm and peggotty carrying another small box of ours we turned down lanes bestrewn with bits of chips and little hillocks of sand and went past gasworks ropewalks boatbuilders yards shipwrights yards shipbreakers yards caulkers yards riggers lofts smiths forges and a great litter of such places until we came out upon the dull waste i had already seen at a distance when ham said yons our house masr davy i looked in all directions as far as i could stare over the wilderness and away at the sea and away at the river but no house could i make out
there was a black barge or some other kind of superannuated boat not far off high and dry on the ground with an iron funnel sticking out of it for a chimney and smoking very cosily but nothing else in the way of a habitation that was visible to me
thats not it said i
that shiplooking thing thats it masr davy returned ham
if it had been aladdins palace rocs egg and all i suppose i could not have been more charmed with the romantic idea of living in it
there was a delightful door cut in the side and it was roofed in and there were little windows in it but the wonderful charm of it was that it was a real boat which had no doubt been upon the water hundreds of times and which had never been intended to be lived in on dry land
that was the captivation of it to me
if it had ever been meant to be lived in i might have thought it small or inconvenient or lonely but never having been designed for any such use it became a perfect abode
it was beautifully clean inside and as tidy as possible
there was a table and a dutch clock and a chest of drawers and on the chest of drawers there was a teatray with a painting on it of a lady with a parasol taking a walk with a militarylooking child who was trundling a hoop
the tray was kept from tumbling down by a bible and the tray if it had tumbled down would have smashed a quantity of cups and saucers and a teapot that were grouped around the book
on the walls there were some common coloured pictures framed and glazed of scripture subjects such as i have never seen since in the hands of pedlars without seeing the whole interior of peggottys brothers house again at one view
abraham in red going to sacrifice isaac in blue and daniel in yellow cast into a den of green lions were the most prominent of these
over the little mantelshelf was a picture of the sarah jane lugger built at sunderland with a real little wooden stern stuck on to it a work of art combining composition with carpentry which i considered to be one of the most enviable possessions that the world could afford
there were some hooks in the beams of the ceiling the use of which i did not divine then and some lockers and boxes and conveniences of that sort which served for seats and eked out the chairs
all this i saw in the first glance after i crossed the thresholdchildlike according to my theoryand then peggotty opened a little door and showed me my bedroom
it was the completest and most desirable bedroom ever seenin the stern of the vessel with a little window where the rudder used to go through a little lookingglass just the right height for me nailed against the wall and framed with oystershells a little bed which there was just room enough to get into and a nosegay of seaweed in a blue mug on the table
the walls were whitewashed as white as milk and the patchwork counterpane made my eyes quite ache with its brightness
one thing i particularly noticed in this delightful house was the smell of fish which was so searching that when i took out my pockethandkerchief to wipe my nose i found it smelt exactly as if it had wrapped up a lobster
on my imparting this discovery in confidence to peggotty she informed me that her brother dealt in lobsters crabs and crawfish and i afterwards found that a heap of these creatures in a state of wonderful conglomeration with one another and never leaving off pinching whatever they laid hold of were usually to be found in a little wooden outhouse where the pots and kettles were kept
we were welcomed by a very civil woman in a white apron whom i had seen curtseying at the door when i was on hams back about a quarter of a mile off
likewise by a most beautiful little girl or i thought her so with a necklace of blue beads on who wouldnt let me kiss her when i offered to but ran away and hid herself
by and by when we had dined in a sumptuous manner off boiled dabs melted butter and potatoes with a chop for me a hairy man with a very goodnatured face came home
as he called peggotty lass and gave her a hearty smack on the cheek i had no doubt from the general propriety of her conduct that he was her brother and so he turned outbeing presently introduced to me as mr peggotty the master of the house
glad to see you sir said mr peggotty
youll find us rough sir but youll find us ready i thanked him and replied that i was sure i should be happy in such a delightful place
hows your ma sir said mr peggotty
did you leave her pretty jolly i gave mr peggotty to understand that she was as jolly as i could wish and that she desired her complimentswhich was a polite fiction on my part
im much obleeged to her im sure said mr peggotty
well sir if you can make out here fur a fortnut long wi her nodding at his sister and ham and little emly we shall be proud of your company having done the honours of his house in this hospitable manner mr peggotty went out to wash himself in a kettleful of hot water remarking that cold would never get his muck off
he soon returned greatly improved in appearance but so rubicund that i couldnt help thinking his face had this in common with the lobsters crabs and crawfishthat it went into the hot water very black and came out very red
after tea when the door was shut and all was made snug the nights being cold and misty now it seemed to me the most delicious retreat that the imagination of man could conceive
to hear the wind getting up out at sea to know that the fog was creeping over the desolate flat outside and to look at the fire and think that there was no house near but this one and this one a boat was like enchantment
little emly had overcome her shyness and was sitting by my side upon the lowest and least of the lockers which was just large enough for us two and just fitted into the chimney corner
mrs peggotty with the white apron was knitting on the opposite side of the fire
peggotty at her needlework was as much at home with st pauls and the bit of waxcandle as if they had never known any other roof
ham who had been giving me my first lesson in allfours was trying to recollect a scheme of telling fortunes with the dirty cards and was printing off fishy impressions of his thumb on all the cards he turned
mr peggotty was smoking his pipe
i felt it was a time for conversation and confidence
mr
peggotty says i
sir says he
did you give your son the name of ham because you lived in a sort of ark mr peggotty seemed to think it a deep idea but answered no sir
i never giv him no name who gave him that name then said i putting question number two of the catechism to mr peggotty
why sir his father giv it him said mr peggotty
i thought you were his father my brother joe was his father said mr peggotty
dead mr peggotty i hinted after a respectful pause
drowndead said mr peggotty
i was very much surprised that mr peggotty was not hams father and began to wonder whether i was mistaken about his relationship to anybody else there
i was so curious to know that i made up my mind to have it out with mr peggotty
little emly i said glancing at her
she is your daughter isnt she mr peggotty no sir
my brotherinlaw tom was her father i couldnt help it
dead mr peggotty i hinted after another respectful silence
drowndead said mr peggotty
i felt the difficulty of resuming the subject but had not got to the bottom of it yet and must get to the bottom somehow
so i said havent you any children mr peggotty no master he answered with a short laugh
im a bacheldore a bachelor i said astonished
why whos that mr peggotty pointing to the person in the apron who was knitting
thats missis gummidge said mr peggotty
gummidge mr peggotty but at this point peggottyi mean my own peculiar peggottymade such impressive motions to me not to ask any more questions that i could only sit and look at all the silent company until it was time to go to bed
then in the privacy of my own little cabin she informed me that ham and emly were an orphan nephew and niece whom my host had at different times adopted in their childhood when they were left destitute and that mrs gummidge was the widow of his partner in a boat who had died very poor
he was but a poor man himself said peggotty but as good as gold and as true as steelthose were her similes
the only subject she informed me on which he ever showed a violent temper or swore an oath was this generosity of his and if it were ever referred to by any one of them he struck the table a heavy blow with his right hand had split it on one such occasion and swore a dreadful oath that he would be gormed if he didnt cut and run for good if it was ever mentioned again
it appeared in answer to my inquiries that nobody had the least idea of the etymology of this terrible verb passive to be gormed but that they all regarded it as constituting a most solemn imprecation
i was very sensible of my entertainers goodness and listened to the womens going to bed in another little crib like mine at the opposite end of the boat and to him and ham hanging up two hammocks for themselves on the hooks i had noticed in the roof in a very luxurious state of mind enhanced by my being sleepy
as slumber gradually stole upon me i heard the wind howling out at sea and coming on across the flat so fiercely that i had a lazy apprehension of the great deep rising in the night
but i bethought myself that i was in a boat after all and that a man like mr peggotty was not a bad person to have on board if anything did happen
nothing happened however worse than morning
almost as soon as it shone upon the oystershell frame of my mirror i was out of bed and out with little emly picking up stones upon the beach
youre quite a sailor i suppose i said to emly
i dont know that i supposed anything of the kind but i felt it an act of gallantry to say something and a shining sail close to us made such a pretty little image of itself at the moment in her bright eye that it came into my head to say this
no replied emly shaking her head im afraid of the sea afraid i said with a becoming air of boldness and looking very big at the mighty ocean
i ant ah
but its cruel said emly
i have seen it very cruel to some of our men
i have seen it tear a boat as big as our house all to pieces i hope it wasnt the boat that that father was drownded in said emly
no
not that one i never see that boat nor him i asked her
little emly shook her head
not to remember here was a coincidence
i immediately went into an explanation how i had never seen my own father and how my mother and i had always lived by ourselves in the happiest state imaginable and lived so then and always meant to live so and how my fathers grave was in the churchyard near our house and shaded by a tree beneath the boughs of which i had walked and heard the birds sing many a pleasant morning
but there were some differences between emlys orphanhood and mine it appeared
she had lost her mother before her father and where her fathers grave was no one knew except that it was somewhere in the depths of the sea
besides said emly as she looked about for shells and pebbles your father was a gentleman and your mother is a lady and my father was a fisherman and my mother was a fishermans daughter and my uncle dan is a fisherman dan is mr peggotty is he said i
uncle danyonder answered emly nodding at the boathouse
yes
i mean him
he must be very good i should think good said emly
if i was ever to be a lady id give him a skyblue coat with diamond buttons nankeen trousers a red velvet waistcoat a cocked hat a large gold watch a silver pipe and a box of money i said i had no doubt that mr peggotty well deserved these treasures
i must acknowledge that i felt it difficult to picture him quite at his ease in the raiment proposed for him by his grateful little niece and that i was particularly doubtful of the policy of the cocked hat but i kept these sentiments to myself
little emly had stopped and looked up at the sky in her enumeration of these articles as if they were a glorious vision
we went on again picking up shells and pebbles
you would like to be a lady i said
emily looked at me and laughed and nodded yes
i should like it very much
we would all be gentlefolks together then
me and uncle and ham and mrs gummidge
we wouldnt mind then when there comes stormy weathernot for our own sakes i mean
we would for the poor fishermens to be sure and wed help em with money when they come to any hurt this seemed to me to be a very satisfactory and therefore not at all improbable picture
i expressed my pleasure in the contemplation of it and little emly was emboldened to say shyly dont you think you are afraid of the sea now it was quiet enough to reassure me but i have no doubt if i had seen a moderately large wave come tumbling in i should have taken to my heels with an awful recollection of her drowned relations
however i said no and i added you dont seem to be either though you say you arefor she was walking much too near the brink of a sort of old jetty or wooden causeway we had strolled upon and i was afraid of her falling over
im not afraid in this way said little emly
but i wake when it blows and tremble to think of uncle dan and ham and believe i hear em crying out for help
thats why i should like so much to be a lady
but im not afraid in this way
not a bit
look here she started from my side and ran along a jagged timber which protruded from the place we stood upon and overhung the deep water at some height without the least defence
the incident is so impressed on my remembrance that if i were a draughtsman i could draw its form here i dare say accurately as it was that day and little emly springing forward to her destruction as it appeared to me with a look that i have never forgotten directed far out to sea
the light bold fluttering little figure turned and came back safe to me and i soon laughed at my fears and at the cry i had uttered fruitlessly in any case for there was no one near
but there have been times since in my manhood many times there have been when i have thought is it possible among the possibilities of hidden things that in the sudden rashness of the child and her wild look so far off there was any merciful attraction of her into danger any tempting her towards him permitted on the part of her dead father that her life might have a chance of ending that day
there has been a time since when i have wondered whether if the life before her could have been revealed to me at a glance and so revealed as that a child could fully comprehend it and if her preservation could have depended on a motion of my hand i ought to have held it up to save her
there has been a time sincei do not say it lasted long but it has beenwhen i have asked myself the question would it have been better for little emly to have had the waters close above her head that morning in my sight and when i have answered yes it would have been
this may be premature
i have set it down too soon perhaps
but let it stand
we strolled a long way and loaded ourselves with things that we thought curious and put some stranded starfish carefully back into the wateri hardly know enough of the race at this moment to be quite certain whether they had reason to feel obliged to us for doing so or the reverseand then made our way home to mr peggottys dwelling
we stopped under the lee of the lobsterouthouse to exchange an innocent kiss and went in to breakfast glowing with health and pleasure
like two young mavishes mr peggotty said
i knew this meant in our local dialect like two young thrushes and received it as a compliment
of course i was in love with little emly
i am sure i loved that baby quite as truly quite as tenderly with greater purity and more disinterestedness than can enter into the best love of a later time of life high and ennobling as it is
i am sure my fancy raised up something round that blueeyed mite of a child which etherealized and made a very angel of her
if any sunny forenoon she had spread a little pair of wings and flown away before my eyes i dont think i should have regarded it as much more than i had had reason to expect
we used to walk about that dim old flat at yarmouth in a loving manner hours and hours
the days sported by us as if time had not grown up himself yet but were a child too and always at play
i told emly i adored her and that unless she confessed she adored me i should be reduced to the necessity of killing myself with a sword
she said she did and i have no doubt she did
as to any sense of inequality or youthfulness or other difficulty in our way little emly and i had no such trouble because we had no future
we made no more provision for growing older than we did for growing younger
we were the admiration of mrs gummidge and peggotty who used to whisper of an evening when we sat lovingly on our little locker side by side lor
wasnt it beautiful mr peggotty smiled at us from behind his pipe and ham grinned all the evening and did nothing else
they had something of the sort of pleasure in us i suppose that they might have had in a pretty toy or a pocket model of the colosseum
i soon found out that mrs gummidge did not always make herself so agreeable as she might have been expected to do under the circumstances of her residence with mr peggotty
mrs gummidges was rather a fretful disposition and she whimpered more sometimes than was comfortable for other parties in so small an establishment
i was very sorry for her but there were moments when it would have been more agreeable i thought if mrs gummidge had had a convenient apartment of her own to retire to and had stopped there until her spirits revived
mr peggotty went occasionally to a publichouse called the willing mind
i discovered this by his being out on the second or third evening of our visit and by mrs gummidges looking up at the dutch clock between eight and nine and saying he was there and that what was more she had known in the morning he would go there
mrs gummidge had been in a low state all day and had burst into tears in the forenoon when the fire smoked
i am a lone lorn creetur were mrs gummidges words when that unpleasant occurrence took place and everythink goes contrary with me oh itll soon leave off said peggottyi again mean our peggottyand besides you know its not more disagreeable to you than to us i feel it more said mrs gummidge
it was a very cold day with cutting blasts of wind
mrs gummidges peculiar corner of the fireside seemed to me to be the warmest and snuggest in the place as her chair was certainly the easiest but it didnt suit her that day at all
she was constantly complaining of the cold and of its occasioning a visitation in her back which she called the creeps
at last she shed tears on that subject and said again that she was a lone lorn creetur and everythink went contrary with her
it is certainly very cold said peggotty
everybody must feel it so i feel it more than other people said mrs gummidge
so at dinner when mrs gummidge was always helped immediately after me to whom the preference was given as a visitor of distinction
the fish were small and bony and the potatoes were a little burnt
we all acknowledged that we felt this something of a disappointment but mrs gummidge said she felt it more than we did and shed tears again and made that former declaration with great bitterness
accordingly when mr peggotty came home about nine oclock this unfortunate mrs gummidge was knitting in her corner in a very wretched and miserable condition
peggotty had been working cheerfully
ham had been patching up a great pair of waterboots and i with little emly by my side had been reading to them
mrs gummidge had never made any other remark than a forlorn sigh and had never raised her eyes since tea
well mates said mr peggotty taking his seat and how are you we all said something or looked something to welcome him except mrs gummidge who only shook her head over her knitting
whats amiss said mr peggotty with a clap of his hands
cheer up old mawther mr peggotty meant old girl
mrs gummidge did not appear to be able to cheer up
she took out an old black silk handkerchief and wiped her eyes but instead of putting it in her pocket kept it out and wiped them again and still kept it out ready for use
whats amiss dame said mr peggotty
nothing returned mrs gummidge
youve come from the willing mind danl why yes ive took a short spell at the willing mind tonight said mr peggotty
im sorry i should drive you there said mrs gummidge
drive
i dont want no driving returned mr peggotty with an honest laugh
i only go too ready very ready said mrs gummidge shaking her head and wiping her eyes
yes yes very ready
i am sorry it should be along of me that youre so ready along o you
it ant along o you said mr peggotty
dont ye believe a bit on it yes yes it is cried mrs gummidge
i know what i am
i know that i am a lone lorn creetur and not only that everythink goes contrary with me but that i go contrary with everybody
yes yes
i feel more than other people do and i show it more
its my misfortun i really couldnt help thinking as i sat taking in all this that the misfortune extended to some other members of that family besides mrs gummidge
but mr peggotty made no such retort only answering with another entreaty to mrs gummidge to cheer up
i ant what i could wish myself to be said mrs gummidge
i am far from it
i know what i am
my troubles has made me contrary
i feel my troubles and they make me contrary
i wish i didnt feel em but i do
i wish i could be hardened to em but i ant
i make the house uncomfortable
i dont wonder at it
ive made your sister so all day and master davy here i was suddenly melted and roared out no you havent mrs gummidge in great mental distress
its far from right that i should do it said mrs gummidge
it ant a fit return
i had better go into the house and die
i am a lone lorn creetur and had much better not make myself contrary here
if thinks must go contrary with me and i must go contrary myself let me go contrary in my parish
danl id better go into the house and die and be a riddance mrs gummidge retired with these words and betook herself to bed
when she was gone mr peggotty who had not exhibited a trace of any feeling but the profoundest sympathy looked round upon us and nodding his head with a lively expression of that sentiment still animating his face said in a whisper shes been thinking of the old un i did not quite understand what old one mrs gummidge was supposed to have fixed her mind upon until peggotty on seeing me to bed explained that it was the late mr gummidge and that her brother always took that for a received truth on such occasions and that it always had a moving effect upon him
some time after he was in his hammock that night i heard him myself repeat to ham poor thing
shes been thinking of the old un and whenever mrs gummidge was overcome in a similar manner during the remainder of our stay which happened some few times he always said the same thing in extenuation of the circumstance and always with the tenderest commiseration
so the fortnight slipped away varied by nothing but the variation of the tide which altered mr peggottys times of going out and coming in and altered hams engagements also
when the latter was unemployed he sometimes walked with us to show us the boats and ships and once or twice he took us for a row
i dont know why one slight set of impressions should be more particularly associated with a place than another though i believe this obtains with most people in reference especially to the associations of their childhood
i never hear the name or read the name of yarmouth but i am reminded of a certain sunday morning on the beach the bells ringing for church little emly leaning on my shoulder ham lazily dropping stones into the water and the sun away at sea just breaking through the heavy mist and showing us the ships like their own shadows
at last the day came for going home
i bore up against the separation from mr peggotty and mrs gummidge but my agony of mind at leaving little emly was piercing
we went arminarm to the publichouse where the carrier put up and i promised on the road to write to her
i redeemed that promise afterwards in characters larger than those in which apartments are usually announced in manuscript as being to let
we were greatly overcome at parting and if ever in my life i have had a void made in my heart i had one made that day
now all the time i had been on my visit i had been ungrateful to my home again and had thought little or nothing about it
but i was no sooner turned towards it than my reproachful young conscience seemed to point that way with a ready finger and i felt all the more for the sinking of my spirits that it was my nest and that my mother was my comforter and friend
this gained upon me as we went along so that the nearer we drew the more familiar the objects became that we passed the more excited i was to get there and to run into her arms
but peggotty instead of sharing in those transports tried to check them though very kindly and looked confused and out of sorts
blunderstone rookery would come however in spite of her when the carriers horse pleasedand did
how well i recollect it on a cold grey afternoon with a dull sky threatening rain
the door opened and i looked half laughing and half crying in my pleasant agitation for my mother
it was not she but a strange servant
why peggotty i said ruefully isnt she come home yes yes master davy said peggotty
shes come home
wait a bit master davy and illill tell you something between her agitation and her natural awkwardness in getting out of the cart peggotty was making a most extraordinary festoon of herself but i felt too blank and strange to tell her so
when she had got down she took me by the hand led me wondering into the kitchen and shut the door
peggotty said i quite frightened
whats the matter nothings the matter bless you master davy dear she answered assuming an air of sprightliness
somethings the matter im sure
wheres mama wheres mama master davy repeated peggotty
yes
why hasnt she come out to the gate and what have we come in here for
oh peggotty my eyes were full and i felt as if i were going to tumble down
bless the precious boy cried peggotty taking hold of me
what is it
speak my pet not dead too
oh shes not dead peggotty peggotty cried out no
with an astonishing volume of voice and then sat down and began to pant and said i had given her a turn
i gave her a hug to take away the turn or to give her another turn in the right direction and then stood before her looking at her in anxious inquiry
you see dear i should have told you before now said peggotty but i hadnt an opportunity
i ought to have made it perhaps but i couldnt azacklythat was always the substitute for exactly in peggottys militia of wordsbring my mind to it go on peggotty said i more frightened than before
master davy said peggotty untying her bonnet with a shaking hand and speaking in a breathless sort of way
what do you think
you have got a pa i trembled and turned white
somethingi dont know what or howconnected with the grave in the churchyard and the raising of the dead seemed to strike me like an unwholesome wind
a new one said peggotty
a new one i repeated
peggotty gave a gasp as if she were swallowing something that was very hard and putting out her hand said come and see him i dont want to see him and your mama said peggotty
i ceased to draw back and we went straight to the best parlour where she left me
on one side of the fire sat my mother on the other mr murdstone
my mother dropped her work and arose hurriedly but timidly i thought
now clara my dear said mr murdstone
recollect
control yourself always control yourself
davy boy how do you do i gave him my hand
after a moment of suspense i went and kissed my mother she kissed me patted me gently on the shoulder and sat down again to her work
i could not look at her i could not look at him i knew quite well that he was looking at us both and i turned to the window and looked out there at some shrubs that were drooping their heads in the cold
as soon as i could creep away i crept upstairs
my old dear bedroom was changed and i was to lie a long way off
i rambled downstairs to find anything that was like itself so altered it all seemed and roamed into the yard
i very soon started back from there for the empty dogkennel was filled up with a great dogdeep mouthed and blackhaired like himand he was very angry at the sight of me and sprang out to get at me
if the room to which my bed was removed were a sentient thing that could give evidence i might appeal to it at this daywho sleeps there now i wonderto bear witness for me what a heavy heart i carried to it
i went up there hearing the dog in the yard bark after me all the way while i climbed the stairs and looking as blank and strange upon the room as the room looked upon me sat down with my small hands crossed and thought
i thought of the oddest things
of the shape of the room of the cracks in the ceiling of the paper on the walls of the flaws in the windowglass making ripples and dimples on the prospect of the washingstand being rickety on its three legs and having a discontented something about it which reminded me of mrs gummidge under the influence of the old one
i was crying all the time but except that i was conscious of being cold and dejected i am sure i never thought why i cried
at last in my desolation i began to consider that i was dreadfully in love with little emly and had been torn away from her to come here where no one seemed to want me or to care about me half as much as she did
this made such a very miserable piece of business of it that i rolled myself up in a corner of the counterpane and cried myself to sleep
i was awoke by somebody saying here he is and uncovering my hot head
my mother and peggotty had come to look for me and it was one of them who had done it
davy said my mother
whats the matter i thought it was very strange that she should ask me and answered nothing i turned over on my face i recollect to hide my trembling lip which answered her with greater truth
davy said my mother
davy my child i dare say no words she could have uttered would have affected me so much then as her calling me her child
i hid my tears in the bedclothes and pressed her from me with my hand when she would have raised me up
this is your doing peggotty you cruel thing said my mother
i have no doubt at all about it
how can you reconcile it to your conscience i wonder to prejudice my own boy against me or against anybody who is dear to me
what do you mean by it peggotty poor peggotty lifted up her hands and eyes and only answered in a sort of paraphrase of the grace i usually repeated after dinner lord forgive you mrs copperfield and for what you have said this minute may you never be truly sorry its enough to distract me cried my mother
in my honeymoon too when my most inveterate enemy might relent one would think and not envy me a little peace of mind and happiness
davy you naughty boy
peggotty you savage creature
oh dear me cried my mother turning from one of us to the other in her pettish wilful manner what a troublesome world this is when one has the most right to expect it to be as agreeable as possible i felt the touch of a hand that i knew was neither hers nor peggottys and slipped to my feet at the bedside
it was mr murdstones hand and he kept it on my arm as he said whats this
clara my love have you forgottenfirmness my dear i am very sorry edward said my mother
i meant to be very good but i am so uncomfortable indeed he answered
thats a bad hearing so soon clara i say its very hard i should be made so now returned my mother pouting and it isvery hardisnt it he drew her to him whispered in her ear and kissed her
i knew as well when i saw my mothers head lean down upon his shoulder and her arm touch his necki knew as well that he could mould her pliant nature into any form he chose as i know now that he did it
go you below my love said mr murdstone
david and i will come down together
my friend turning a darkening face on peggotty when he had watched my mother out and dismissed her with a nod and a smile do you know your mistresss name she has been my mistress a long time sir answered peggotty i ought to know it thats true he answered
but i thought i heard you as i came upstairs address her by a name that is not hers
she has taken mine you know
will you remember that peggotty with some uneasy glances at me curtseyed herself out of the room without replying seeing i suppose that she was expected to go and had no excuse for remaining
when we two were left alone he shut the door and sitting on a chair and holding me standing before him looked steadily into my eyes
i felt my own attracted no less steadily to his
as i recall our being opposed thus face to face i seem again to hear my heart beat fast and high
david he said making his lips thin by pressing them together if i have an obstinate horse or dog to deal with what do you think i do i dont know i beat him i had answered in a kind of breathless whisper but i felt in my silence that my breath was shorter now
i make him wince and smart
i say to myself ill conquer that fellow and if it were to cost him all the blood he had i should do it
what is that upon your face dirt i said
he knew it was the mark of tears as well as i
but if he had asked the question twenty times each time with twenty blows i believe my baby heart would have burst before i would have told him so
you have a good deal of intelligence for a little fellow he said with a grave smile that belonged to him and you understood me very well i see
wash that face sir and come down with me he pointed to the washingstand which i had made out to be like mrs gummidge and motioned me with his head to obey him directly
i had little doubt then and i have less doubt now that he would have knocked me down without the least compunction if i had hesitated
clara my dear he said when i had done his bidding and he walked me into the parlour with his hand still on my arm you will not be made uncomfortable any more i hope
we shall soon improve our youthful humours god help me i might have been improved for my whole life i might have been made another creature perhaps for life by a kind word at that season
a word of encouragement and explanation of pity for my childish ignorance of welcome home of reassurance to me that it was home might have made me dutiful to him in my heart henceforth instead of in my hypocritical outside and might have made me respect instead of hate him
i thought my mother was sorry to see me standing in the room so scared and strange and that presently when i stole to a chair she followed me with her eyes more sorrowfully stillmissing perhaps some freedom in my childish treadbut the word was not spoken and the time for it was gone
we dined alone we three together
he seemed to be very fond of my motheri am afraid i liked him none the better for thatand she was very fond of him
i gathered from what they said that an elder sister of his was coming to stay with them and that she was expected that evening
i am not certain whether i found out then or afterwards that without being actively concerned in any business he had some share in or some annual charge upon the profits of a winemerchants house in london with which his family had been connected from his greatgrandfathers time and in which his sister had a similar interest but i may mention it in this place whether or no
after dinner when we were sitting by the fire and i was meditating an escape to peggotty without having the hardihood to slip away lest it should offend the master of the house a coach drove up to the gardengate and he went out to receive the visitor
my mother followed him
i was timidly following her when she turned round at the parlour door in the dusk and taking me in her embrace as she had been used to do whispered me to love my new father and be obedient to him
she did this hurriedly and secretly as if it were wrong but tenderly and putting out her hand behind her held mine in it until we came near to where he was standing in the garden where she let mine go and drew hers through his arm
it was miss murdstone who was arrived and a gloomylooking lady she was dark like her brother whom she greatly resembled in face and voice and with very heavy eyebrows nearly meeting over her large nose as if being disabled by the wrongs of her sex from wearing whiskers she had carried them to that account
she brought with her two uncompromising hard black boxes with her initials on the lids in hard brass nails
when she paid the coachman she took her money out of a hard steel purse and she kept the purse in a very jail of a bag which hung upon her arm by a heavy chain and shut up like a bite
i had never at that time seen such a metallic lady altogether as miss murdstone was
she was brought into the parlour with many tokens of welcome and there formally recognized my mother as a new and near relation
then she looked at me and said is that your boy sisterinlaw my mother acknowledged me
generally speaking said miss murdstone i dont like boys
how dye do boy under these encouraging circumstances i replied that i was very well and that i hoped she was the same with such an indifferent grace that miss murdstone disposed of me in two words wants manner having uttered which with great distinctness she begged the favour of being shown to her room which became to me from that time forth a place of awe and dread wherein the two black boxes were never seen open or known to be left unlocked and where for i peeped in once or twice when she was out numerous little steel fetters and rivets with which miss murdstone embellished herself when she was dressed generally hung upon the lookingglass in formidable array
as well as i could make out she had come for good and had no intention of ever going again
she began to help my mother next morning and was in and out of the storecloset all day putting things to rights and making havoc in the old arrangements
almost the first remarkable thing i observed in miss murdstone was her being constantly haunted by a suspicion that the servants had a man secreted somewhere on the premises
under the influence of this delusion she dived into the coalcellar at the most untimely hours and scarcely ever opened the door of a dark cupboard without clapping it to again in the belief that she had got him
though there was nothing very airy about miss murdstone she was a perfect lark in point of getting up
she was up and as i believe to this hour looking for that man before anybody in the house was stirring
peggotty gave it as her opinion that she even slept with one eye open but i could not concur in this idea for i tried it myself after hearing the suggestion thrown out and found it couldnt be done
on the very first morning after her arrival she was up and ringing her bell at cockcrow
when my mother came down to breakfast and was going to make the tea miss murdstone gave her a kind of peck on the cheek which was her nearest approach to a kiss and said now clara my dear i am come here you know to relieve you of all the trouble i can
youre much too pretty and thoughtlessmy mother blushed but laughed and seemed not to dislike this characterto have any duties imposed upon you that can be undertaken by me
if youll be so good as give me your keys my dear ill attend to all this sort of thing in future from that time miss murdstone kept the keys in her own little jail all day and under her pillow all night and my mother had no more to do with them than i had
my mother did not suffer her authority to pass from her without a shadow of protest
one night when miss murdstone had been developing certain household plans to her brother of which he signified his approbation my mother suddenly began to cry and said she thought she might have been consulted
clara said mr murdstone sternly
clara
i wonder at you oh its very well to say you wonder edward cried my mother and its very well for you to talk about firmness but you wouldnt like it yourself firmness i may observe was the grand quality on which both mr and miss murdstone took their stand
however i might have expressed my comprehension of it at that time if i had been called upon i nevertheless did clearly comprehend in my own way that it was another name for tyranny and for a certain gloomy arrogant devils humour that was in them both
the creed as i should state it now was this
mr murdstone was firm nobody in his world was to be so firm as mr murdstone nobody else in his world was to be firm at all for everybody was to be bent to his firmness
miss murdstone was an exception
she might be firm but only by relationship and in an inferior and tributary degree
my mother was another exception
she might be firm and must be but only in bearing their firmness and firmly believing there was no other firmness upon earth
its very hard said my mother that in my own house my own house repeated mr murdstone
clara our own house i mean faltered my mother evidently frightenedi hope you must know what i mean edwardits very hard that in your own house i may not have a word to say about domestic matters
i am sure i managed very well before we were married
theres evidence said my mother sobbing ask peggotty if i didnt do very well when i wasnt interfered with edward said miss murdstone let there be an end of this
i go tomorrow jane murdstone said her brother be silent
how dare you to insinuate that you dont know my character better than your words imply i am sure my poor mother went on at a grievous disadvantage and with many tears i dont want anybody to go
i should be very miserable and unhappy if anybody was to go
i dont ask much
i am not unreasonable
i only want to be consulted sometimes
i am very much obliged to anybody who assists me and i only want to be consulted as a mere form sometimes
i thought you were pleased once with my being a little inexperienced and girlish edwardi am sure you said sobut you seem to hate me for it now you are so severe edward said miss murdstone again let there be an end of this
i go tomorrow jane murdstone thundered mr murdstone
will you be silent
how dare you miss murdstone made a jaildelivery of her pockethandkerchief and held it before her eyes
clara he continued looking at my mother you surprise me
you astound me
yes i had a satisfaction in the thought of marrying an inexperienced and artless person and forming her character and infusing into it some amount of that firmness and decision of which it stood in need
but when jane murdstone is kind enough to come to my assistance in this endeavour and to assume for my sake a condition something like a housekeepers and when she meets with a base return oh pray pray edward cried my mother dont accuse me of being ungrateful
i am sure i am not ungrateful
no one ever said i was before
i have many faults but not that
oh dont my dear when jane murdstone meets i say he went on after waiting until my mother was silent with a base return that feeling of mine is chilled and altered dont my love say that implored my mother very piteously
oh dont edward
i cant bear to hear it
whatever i am i am affectionate
i know i am affectionate
i wouldnt say it if i wasnt sure that i am
ask peggotty
i am sure shell tell you im affectionate there is no extent of mere weakness clara said mr murdstone in reply that can have the least weight with me
you lose breath pray let us be friends said my mother i couldnt live under coldness or unkindness
i am so sorry
i have a great many defects i know and its very good of you edward with your strength of mind to endeavour to correct them for me
jane i dont object to anything
i should be quite brokenhearted if you thought of leaving my mother was too much overcome to go on
jane murdstone said mr murdstone to his sister any harsh words between us are i hope uncommon
it is not my fault that so unusual an occurrence has taken place tonight
i was betrayed into it by another
nor is it your fault
you were betrayed into it by another
let us both try to forget it
and as this he added after these magnanimous words is not a fit scene for the boydavid go to bed i could hardly find the door through the tears that stood in my eyes
i was so sorry for my mothers distress but i groped my way out and groped my way up to my room in the dark without even having the heart to say good night to peggotty or to get a candle from her
when her coming up to look for me an hour or so afterwards awoke me she said that my mother had gone to bed poorly and that mr and miss murdstone were sitting alone
going down next morning rather earlier than usual i paused outside the parlour door on hearing my mothers voice
she was very earnestly and humbly entreating miss murdstones pardon which that lady granted and a perfect reconciliation took place
i never knew my mother afterwards to give an opinion on any matter without first appealing to miss murdstone or without having first ascertained by some sure means what miss murdstones opinion was and i never saw miss murdstone when out of temper she was infirm that way move her hand towards her bag as if she were going to take out the keys and offer to resign them to my mother without seeing that my mother was in a terrible fright
the gloomy taint that was in the murdstone blood darkened the murdstone religion which was austere and wrathful
i have thought since that its assuming that character was a necessary consequence of mr murdstones firmness which wouldnt allow him to let anybody off from the utmost weight of the severest penalties he could find any excuse for
be this as it may i well remember the tremendous visages with which we used to go to church and the changed air of the place
again the dreaded sunday comes round and i file into the old pew first like a guarded captive brought to a condemned service
again miss murdstone in a black velvet gown that looks as if it had been made out of a pall follows close upon me then my mother then her husband
there is no peggotty now as in the old time
again i listen to miss murdstone mumbling the responses and emphasizing all the dread words with a cruel relish
again i see her dark eyes roll round the church when she says miserable sinners as if she were calling all the congregation names
again i catch rare glimpses of my mother moving her lips timidly between the two with one of them muttering at each ear like low thunder
again i wonder with a sudden fear whether it is likely that our good old clergyman can be wrong and mr and miss murdstone right and that all the angels in heaven can be destroying angels
again if i move a finger or relax a muscle of my face miss murdstone pokes me with her prayerbook and makes my side ache
yes and again as we walk home i note some neighbours looking at my mother and at me and whispering
again as the three go on arminarm and i linger behind alone i follow some of those looks and wonder if my mothers step be really not so light as i have seen it and if the gaiety of her beauty be really almost worried away
again i wonder whether any of the neighbours call to mind as i do how we used to walk home together she and i and i wonder stupidly about that all the dreary dismal day
there had been some talk on occasions of my going to boardingschool
mr and miss murdstone had originated it and my mother had of course agreed with them
nothing however was concluded on the subject yet
in the meantime i learnt lessons at home
shall i ever forget those lessons
they were presided over nominally by my mother but really by mr murdstone and his sister who were always present and found them a favourable occasion for giving my mother lessons in that miscalled firmness which was the bane of both our lives
i believe i was kept at home for that purpose
i had been apt enough to learn and willing enough when my mother and i had lived alone together
i can faintly remember learning the alphabet at her knee
to this day when i look upon the fat black letters in the primer the puzzling novelty of their shapes and the easy goodnature of o and q and s seem to present themselves again before me as they used to do
but they recall no feeling of disgust or reluctance
on the contrary i seem to have walked along a path of flowers as far as the crocodilebook and to have been cheered by the gentleness of my mothers voice and manner all the way
but these solemn lessons which succeeded those i remember as the deathblow of my peace and a grievous daily drudgery and misery
they were very long very numerous very hardperfectly unintelligible some of them to meand i was generally as much bewildered by them as i believe my poor mother was herself
let me remember how it used to be and bring one morning back again
i come into the secondbest parlour after breakfast with my books and an exercisebook and a slate
my mother is ready for me at her writingdesk but not half so ready as mr murdstone in his easychair by the window though he pretends to be reading a book or as miss murdstone sitting near my mother stringing steel beads
the very sight of these two has such an influence over me that i begin to feel the words i have been at infinite pains to get into my head all sliding away and going i dont know where
i wonder where they do go by the by
i hand the first book to my mother
perhaps it is a grammar perhaps a history or geography
i take a last drowning look at the page as i give it into her hand and start off aloud at a racing pace while i have got it fresh
i trip over a word
mr murdstone looks up
i trip over another word
miss murdstone looks up
i redden tumble over halfadozen words and stop
i think my mother would show me the book if she dared but she does not dare and she says softly oh davy davy now clara says mr murdstone be firm with the boy
dont say oh davy davy thats childish
he knows his lesson or he does not know it he does not know it miss murdstone interposes awfully
i am really afraid he does not says my mother
then you see clara returns miss murdstone you should just give him the book back and make him know it yes certainly says my mother that is what i intend to do my dear jane
now davy try once more and dont be stupid i obey the first clause of the injunction by trying once more but am not so successful with the second for i am very stupid
i tumble down before i get to the old place at a point where i was all right before and stop to think
but i cant think about the lesson
i think of the number of yards of net in miss murdstones cap or of the price of mr murdstones dressinggown or any such ridiculous problem that i have no business with and dont want to have anything at all to do with
mr murdstone makes a movement of impatience which i have been expecting for a long time
miss murdstone does the same
my mother glances submissively at them shuts the book and lays it by as an arrear to be worked out when my other tasks are done
there is a pile of these arrears very soon and it swells like a rolling snowball
the bigger it gets the more stupid i get
the case is so hopeless and i feel that i am wallowing in such a bog of nonsense that i give up all idea of getting out and abandon myself to my fate
the despairing way in which my mother and i look at each other as i blunder on is truly melancholy
but the greatest effect in these miserable lessons is when my mother thinking nobody is observing her tries to give me the cue by the motion of her lips
at that instant miss murdstone who has been lying in wait for nothing else all along says in a deep warning voice clara my mother starts colours and smiles faintly
mr murdstone comes out of his chair takes the book throws it at me or boxes my ears with it and turns me out of the room by the shoulders
even when the lessons are done the worst is yet to happen in the shape of an appalling sum
this is invented for me and delivered to me orally by mr murdstone and begins if i go into a cheesemongers shop and buy five thousand doublegloucester cheeses at fourpencehalfpenny each present paymentat which i see miss murdstone secretly overjoyed
i pore over these cheeses without any result or enlightenment until dinnertime when having made a mulatto of myself by getting the dirt of the slate into the pores of my skin i have a slice of bread to help me out with the cheeses and am considered in disgrace for the rest of the evening
it seems to me at this distance of time as if my unfortunate studies generally took this course
i could have done very well if i had been without the murdstones but the influence of the murdstones upon me was like the fascination of two snakes on a wretched young bird
even when i did get through the morning with tolerable credit there was not much gained but dinner for miss murdstone never could endure to see me untasked and if i rashly made any show of being unemployed called her brothers attention to me by saying clara my dear theres nothing like workgive your boy an exercise which caused me to be clapped down to some new labour there and then
as to any recreation with other children of my age i had very little of that for the gloomy theology of the murdstones made all children out to be a swarm of little vipers though there was a child once set in the midst of the disciples and held that they contaminated one another
the natural result of this treatment continued i suppose for some six months or more was to make me sullen dull and dogged
i was not made the less so by my sense of being daily more and more shut out and alienated from my mother
i believe i should have been almost stupefied but for one circumstance
it was this
my father had left a small collection of books in a little room upstairs to which i had access for it adjoined my own and which nobody else in our house ever troubled
from that blessed little room roderick random peregrine pickle humphrey clinker tom jones the vicar of wakefield don quixote gil blas and robinson crusoe came out a glorious host to keep me company
they kept alive my fancy and my hope of something beyond that place and timethey and the arabian nights and the tales of the geniiand did me no harm for whatever harm was in some of them was not there for me i knew nothing of it
it is astonishing to me now how i found time in the midst of my porings and blunderings over heavier themes to read those books as i did
it is curious to me how i could ever have consoled myself under my small troubles which were great troubles to me by impersonating my favourite characters in themas i didand by putting mr and miss murdstone into all the bad oneswhich i did too
i have been tom jones a childs tom jones a harmless creature for a week together
i have sustained my own idea of roderick random for a month at a stretch i verily believe
i had a greedy relish for a few volumes of voyages and travelsi forget what nowthat were on those shelves and for days and days i can remember to have gone about my region of our house armed with the centrepiece out of an old set of boottreesthe perfect realization of captain somebody of the royal british navy in danger of being beset by savages and resolved to sell his life at a great price
the captain never lost dignity from having his ears boxed with the latin grammar
i did but the captain was a captain and a hero in despite of all the grammars of all the languages in the world dead or alive
this was my only and my constant comfort
when i think of it the picture always rises in my mind of a summer evening the boys at play in the churchyard and i sitting on my bed reading as if for life
every barn in the neighbourhood every stone in the church and every foot of the churchyard had some association of its own in my mind connected with these books and stood for some locality made famous in them
i have seen tom pipes go climbing up the churchsteeple i have watched strap with the knapsack on his back stopping to rest himself upon the wicketgate and i know that commodore trunnion held that club with mr pickle in the parlour of our little village alehouse
the reader now understands as well as i do what i was when i came to that point of my youthful history to which i am now coming again
one morning when i went into the parlour with my books i found my mother looking anxious miss murdstone looking firm and mr murdstone binding something round the bottom of a canea lithe and limber cane which he left off binding when i came in and poised and switched in the air
i tell you clara said mr murdstone i have been often flogged myself to be sure of course said miss murdstone
certainly my dear jane faltered my mother meekly
butbut do you think it did edward good do you think it did edward harm clara asked mr murdstone gravely
thats the point said his sister
to this my mother returned certainly my dear jane and said no more
i felt apprehensive that i was personally interested in this dialogue and sought mr murdstones eye as it lighted on mine
now david he saidand i saw that cast again as he said ityou must be far more careful today than usual he gave the cane another poise and another switch and having finished his preparation of it laid it down beside him with an impressive look and took up his book
this was a good freshener to my presence of mind as a beginning
i felt the words of my lessons slipping off not one by one or line by line but by the entire page i tried to lay hold of them but they seemed if i may so express it to have put skates on and to skim away from me with a smoothness there was no checking
we began badly and went on worse
i had come in with an idea of distinguishing myself rather conceiving that i was very well prepared but it turned out to be quite a mistake
book after book was added to the heap of failures miss murdstone being firmly watchful of us all the time
and when we came at last to the five thousand cheeses canes he made it that day i remember my mother burst out crying
clara said miss murdstone in her warning voice
i am not quite well my dear jane i think said my mother
i saw him wink solemnly at his sister as he rose and said taking up the cane why jane we can hardly expect clara to bear with perfect firmness the worry and torment that david has occasioned her today
that would be stoical
clara is greatly strengthened and improved but we can hardly expect so much from her
david you and i will go upstairs boy as he took me out at the door my mother ran towards us
miss murdstone said clara
are you a perfect fool and interfered
i saw my mother stop her ears then and i heard her crying
he walked me up to my room slowly and gravelyi am certain he had a delight in that formal parade of executing justiceand when we got there suddenly twisted my head under his arm
mr
murdstone
sir i cried to him
dont
pray dont beat me
i have tried to learn sir but i cant learn while you and miss murdstone are by
i cant indeed cant you indeed david he said
well try that he had my head as in a vice but i twined round him somehow and stopped him for a moment entreating him not to beat me
it was only a moment that i stopped him for he cut me heavily an instant afterwards and in the same instant i caught the hand with which he held me in my mouth between my teeth and bit it through
it sets my teeth on edge to think of it
he beat me then as if he would have beaten me to death
above all the noise we made i heard them running up the stairs and crying outi heard my mother crying outand peggotty
then he was gone and the door was locked outside and i was lying fevered and hot and torn and sore and raging in my puny way upon the floor
how well i recollect when i became quiet what an unnatural stillness seemed to reign through the whole house
how well i remember when my smart and passion began to cool how wicked i began to feel
i sat listening for a long while but there was not a sound
i crawled up from the floor and saw my face in the glass so swollen red and ugly that it almost frightened me
my stripes were sore and stiff and made me cry afresh when i moved but they were nothing to the guilt i felt
it lay heavier on my breast than if i had been a most atrocious criminal i dare say
it had begun to grow dark and i had shut the window i had been lying for the most part with my head upon the sill by turns crying dozing and looking listlessly out when the key was turned and miss murdstone came in with some bread and meat and milk
these she put down upon the table without a word glaring at me the while with exemplary firmness and then retired locking the door after her
long after it was dark i sat there wondering whether anybody else would come
when this appeared improbable for that night i undressed and went to bed and there i began to wonder fearfully what would be done to me
whether it was a criminal act that i had committed
whether i should be taken into custody and sent to prison
whether i was at all in danger of being hanged
i never shall forget the waking next morning the being cheerful and fresh for the first moment and then the being weighed down by the stale and dismal oppression of remembrance
miss murdstone reappeared before i was out of bed told me in so many words that i was free to walk in the garden for half an hour and no longer and retired leaving the door open that i might avail myself of that permission
i did so and did so every morning of my imprisonment which lasted five days
if i could have seen my mother alone i should have gone down on my knees to her and besought her forgiveness but i saw no one miss murdstone excepted during the whole timeexcept at evening prayers in the parlour to which i was escorted by miss murdstone after everybody else was placed where i was stationed a young outlaw all alone by myself near the door and whence i was solemnly conducted by my jailer before any one arose from the devotional posture
i only observed that my mother was as far off from me as she could be and kept her face another way so that i never saw it and that mr murdstones hand was bound up in a large linen wrapper
the length of those five days i can convey no idea of to any one
they occupy the place of years in my remembrance
the way in which i listened to all the incidents of the house that made themselves audible to me the ringing of bells the opening and shutting of doors the murmuring of voices the footsteps on the stairs to any laughing whistling or singing outside which seemed more dismal than anything else to me in my solitude and disgracethe uncertain pace of the hours especially at night when i would wake thinking it was morning and find that the family were not yet gone to bed and that all the length of night had yet to comethe depressed dreams and nightmares i hadthe return of day noon afternoon evening when the boys played in the churchyard and i watched them from a distance within the room being ashamed to show myself at the window lest they should know i was a prisonerthe strange sensation of never hearing myself speakthe fleeting intervals of something like cheerfulness which came with eating and drinking and went away with itthe setting in of rain one evening with a fresh smell and its coming down faster and faster between me and the church until it and gathering night seemed to quench me in gloom and fear and remorseall this appears to have gone round and round for years instead of days it is so vividly and strongly stamped on my remembrance
on the last night of my restraint i was awakened by hearing my own name spoken in a whisper
i started up in bed and putting out my arms in the dark said is that you peggotty there was no immediate answer but presently i heard my name again in a tone so very mysterious and awful that i think i should have gone into a fit if it had not occurred to me that it must have come through the keyhole
i groped my way to the door and putting my own lips to the keyhole whispered is that you peggotty dear yes my own precious davy she replied
be as soft as a mouse or the catll hear us i understood this to mean miss murdstone and was sensible of the urgency of the case her room being close by
hows mama dear peggotty
is she very angry with me i could hear peggotty crying softly on her side of the keyhole as i was doing on mine before she answered
no
not very what is going to be done with me peggotty dear
do you know school
near london was peggottys answer
i was obliged to get her to repeat it for she spoke it the first time quite down my throat in consequence of my having forgotten to take my mouth away from the keyhole and put my ear there and though her words tickled me a good deal i didnt hear them
when peggotty tomorrow is that the reason why miss murdstone took the clothes out of my drawers which she had done though i have forgotten to mention it
yes said peggotty
box shant i see mama yes said peggotty
morning then peggotty fitted her mouth close to the keyhole and delivered these words through it with as much feeling and earnestness as a keyhole has ever been the medium of communicating i will venture to assert shooting in each broken little sentence in a convulsive little burst of its own
davy dear
if i aint been azackly as intimate with you
lately as i used to be
it aint because i dont love you
just as well and more my pretty poppet
its because i thought it better for you
and for someone else besides
davy my darling are you listening
can you hear yeyeyeyes peggotty i sobbed
my own said peggotty with infinite compassion
what i want to say is
that you must never forget me
for ill never forget you
and ill take as much care of your mama davy
as ever i took of you
and i wont leave her
the day may come when shell be glad to lay her poor head
on her stupid cross old peggottys arm again
and ill write to you my dear
though i aint no scholar
and illill peggotty fell to kissing the keyhole as she couldnt kiss me
thank you dear peggotty said i
oh thank you
thank you
will you promise me one thing peggotty
will you write and tell mr peggotty and little emly and mrs gummidge and ham that i am not so bad as they might suppose and that i sent em all my loveespecially to little emly
will you if you please peggotty the kind soul promised and we both of us kissed the keyhole with the greatest affectioni patted it with my hand i recollect as if it had been her honest faceand parted
from that night there grew up in my breast a feeling for peggotty which i cannot very well define
she did not replace my mother no one could do that but she came into a vacancy in my heart which closed upon her and i felt towards her something i have never felt for any other human being
it was a sort of comical affection too and yet if she had died i cannot think what i should have done or how i should have acted out the tragedy it would have been to me
in the morning miss murdstone appeared as usual and told me i was going to school which was not altogether such news to me as she supposed
she also informed me that when i was dressed i was to come downstairs into the parlour and have my breakfast
there i found my mother very pale and with red eyes into whose arms i ran and begged her pardon from my suffering soul
oh davy she said
that you could hurt anyone i love
try to be better pray to be better
i forgive you but i am so grieved davy that you should have such bad passions in your heart they had persuaded her that i was a wicked fellow and she was more sorry for that than for my going away
i felt it sorely
i tried to eat my parting breakfast but my tears dropped upon my breadandbutter and trickled into my tea
i saw my mother look at me sometimes and then glance at the watchful miss murdstone and than look down or look away
master copperfields box there said miss murdstone when wheels were heard at the gate
i looked for peggotty but it was not she neither she nor mr murdstone appeared
my former acquaintance the carrier was at the door
the box was taken out to his cart and lifted in
clara said miss murdstone in her warning note
ready my dear jane returned my mother
goodbye davy
you are going for your own good
goodbye my child
you will come home in the holidays and be a better boy clara miss murdstone repeated
certainly my dear jane replied my mother who was holding me
i forgive you my dear boy
god bless you clara miss murdstone repeated
miss murdstone was good enough to take me out to the cart and to say on the way that she hoped i would repent before i came to a bad end and then i got into the cart and the lazy horse walked off with it
we might have gone about half a mile and my pockethandkerchief was quite wet through when the carrier stopped short
looking out to ascertain for what i saw to my amazement peggotty burst from a hedge and climb into the cart
she took me in both her arms and squeezed me to her stays until the pressure on my nose was extremely painful though i never thought of that till afterwards when i found it very tender
not a single word did peggotty speak
releasing one of her arms she put it down in her pocket to the elbow and brought out some paper bags of cakes which she crammed into my pockets and a purse which she put into my hand but not one word did she say
after another and a final squeeze with both arms she got down from the cart and ran away and my belief is and has always been without a solitary button on her gown
i picked up one of several that were rolling about and treasured it as a keepsake for a long time
the carrier looked at me as if to inquire if she were coming back
i shook my head and said i thought not
then come up said the carrier to the lazy horse who came up accordingly
having by this time cried as much as i possibly could i began to think it was of no use crying any more especially as neither roderick random nor that captain in the royal british navy had ever cried that i could remember in trying situations
the carrier seeing me in this resolution proposed that my pockethandkerchief should be spread upon the horses back to dry
i thanked him and assented and particularly small it looked under those circumstances
i had now leisure to examine the purse
it was a stiff leather purse with a snap and had three bright shillings in it which peggotty had evidently polished up with whitening for my greater delight
but its most precious contents were two halfcrowns folded together in a bit of paper on which was written in my mothers hand for davy
with my love i was so overcome by this that i asked the carrier to be so good as to reach me my pockethandkerchief again but he said he thought i had better do without it and i thought i really had so i wiped my eyes on my sleeve and stopped myself
for good too though in consequence of my previous emotions i was still occasionally seized with a stormy sob
after we had jogged on for some little time i asked the carrier if he was going all the way
all the way where inquired the carrier
there i said
wheres there inquired the carrier
near london i said
why that horse said the carrier jerking the rein to point him out would be deader than pork afore he got over half the ground are you only going to yarmouth then i asked
thats about it said the carrier
and there i shall take you to the stagecutch and the stagecutch thatll take you towherever it is as this was a great deal for the carrier whose name was mr barkis to sayhe being as i observed in a former chapter of a phlegmatic temperament and not at all conversationali offered him a cake as a mark of attention which he ate at one gulp exactly like an elephant and which made no more impression on his big face than it would have done on an elephants
did she make em now said mr barkis always leaning forward in his slouching way on the footboard of the cart with an arm on each knee
peggotty do you mean sir ah said mr barkis
her yes
she makes all our pastry and does all our cooking do she though said mr barkis
he made up his mouth as if to whistle but he didnt whistle
he sat looking at the horses ears as if he saw something new there and sat so for a considerable time
by and by he said no sweethearts i blieve sweetmeats did you say mr barkis for i thought he wanted something else to eat and had pointedly alluded to that description of refreshment
hearts said mr barkis
sweet hearts no person walks with her with peggotty ah he said
her oh no
she never had a sweetheart didnt she though said mr barkis
again he made up his mouth to whistle and again he didnt whistle but sat looking at the horses ears
so she makes said mr barkis after a long interval of reflection all the apple parsties and doos all the cooking do she i replied that such was the fact
well
ill tell you what said mr barkis
praps you might be writin to her i shall certainly write to her i rejoined
ah he said slowly turning his eyes towards me
well
if you was writin to her praps youd recollect to say that barkis was willin would you that barkis is willing i repeated innocently
is that all the message yees he said considering
yees
barkis is willin but you will be at blunderstone again tomorrow mr barkis i said faltering a little at the idea of my being far away from it then and could give your own message so much better as he repudiated this suggestion however with a jerk of his head and once more confirmed his previous request by saying with profound gravity barkis is willin
thats the message i readily undertook its transmission
while i was waiting for the coach in the hotel at yarmouth that very afternoon i procured a sheet of paper and an inkstand and wrote a note to peggotty which ran thus my dear peggotty
i have come here safe
barkis is willing
my love to mama
yours affectionately
ps
he says he particularly wants you to knowbarkis is willing when i had taken this commission on myself prospectively mr barkis relapsed into perfect silence and i feeling quite worn out by all that had happened lately lay down on a sack in the cart and fell asleep
i slept soundly until we got to yarmouth which was so entirely new and strange to me in the innyard to which we drove that i at once abandoned a latent hope i had had of meeting with some of mr peggottys family there perhaps even with little emly herself
the coach was in the yard shining very much all over but without any horses to it as yet and it looked in that state as if nothing was more unlikely than its ever going to london
i was thinking this and wondering what would ultimately become of my box which mr barkis had put down on the yardpavement by the pole he having driven up the yard to turn his cart and also what would ultimately become of me when a lady looked out of a bowwindow where some fowls and joints of meat were hanging up and said is that the little gentleman from blunderstone yes maam i said
what name inquired the lady
copperfield maam i said
that wont do returned the lady
nobodys dinner is paid for here in that name is it murdstone maam i said
if youre master murdstone said the lady why do you go and give another name first i explained to the lady how it was who than rang a bell and called out william
show the coffeeroom upon which a waiter came running out of a kitchen on the opposite side of the yard to show it and seemed a good deal surprised when he was only to show it to me
it was a large long room with some large maps in it
i doubt if i could have felt much stranger if the maps had been real foreign countries and i cast away in the middle of them
i felt it was taking a liberty to sit down with my cap in my hand on the corner of the chair nearest the door and when the waiter laid a cloth on purpose for me and put a set of castors on it i think i must have turned red all over with modesty
he brought me some chops and vegetables and took the covers off in such a bouncing manner that i was afraid i must have given him some offence
but he greatly relieved my mind by putting a chair for me at the table and saying very affably now sixfoot
come on i thanked him and took my seat at the board but found it extremely difficult to handle my knife and fork with anything like dexterity or to avoid splashing myself with the gravy while he was standing opposite staring so hard and making me blush in the most dreadful manner every time i caught his eye
after watching me into the second chop he said theres half a pint of ale for you
will you have it now i thanked him and said yes upon which he poured it out of a jug into a large tumbler and held it up against the light and made it look beautiful
my eye he said
it seems a good deal dont it it does seem a good deal i answered with a smile
for it was quite delightful to me to find him so pleasant
he was a twinklingeyed pimplefaced man with his hair standing upright all over his head and as he stood with one arm akimbo holding up the glass to the light with the other hand he looked quite friendly
there was a gentleman here yesterday he saida stout gentleman by the name of topsawyerperhaps you know him no i said i dont think in breeches and gaiters broadbrimmed hat grey coat speckled choker said the waiter
no i said bashfully i havent the pleasure he came in here said the waiter looking at the light through the tumbler ordered a glass of this alewould order iti told him notdrank it and fell dead
it was too old for him
it oughtnt to be drawn thats the fact i was very much shocked to hear of this melancholy accident and said i thought i had better have some water
why you see said the waiter still looking at the light through the tumbler with one of his eyes shut up our people dont like things being ordered and left
it offends em
but ill drink it if you like
im used to it and use is everything
i dont think itll hurt me if i throw my head back and take it off quick
shall i i replied that he would much oblige me by drinking it if he thought he could do it safely but by no means otherwise
when he did throw his head back and take it off quick i had a horrible fear i confess of seeing him meet the fate of the lamented mr topsawyer and fall lifeless on the carpet
but it didnt hurt him
on the contrary i thought he seemed the fresher for it
what have we got here he said putting a fork into my dish
not chops chops i said
lord bless my soul he exclaimed i didnt know they were chops
why a chops the very thing to take off the bad effects of that beer
aint it lucky so he took a chop by the bone in one hand and a potato in the other and ate away with a very good appetite to my extreme satisfaction
he afterwards took another chop and another potato and after that another chop and another potato
when we had done he brought me a pudding and having set it before me seemed to ruminate and to become absent in his mind for some moments
hows the pie he said rousing himself
its a pudding i made answer
pudding he exclaimed
why bless me so it is
what looking at it nearer
you dont mean to say its a batterpudding yes it is indeed why a batterpudding he said taking up a tablespoon is my favourite pudding
aint that lucky
come on little un and lets see wholl get most the waiter certainly got most
he entreated me more than once to come in and win but what with his tablespoon to my teaspoon his dispatch to my dispatch and his appetite to my appetite i was left far behind at the first mouthful and had no chance with him
i never saw anyone enjoy a pudding so much i think and he laughed when it was all gone as if his enjoyment of it lasted still
finding him so very friendly and companionable it was then that i asked for the pen and ink and paper to write to peggotty
he not only brought it immediately but was good enough to look over me while i wrote the letter
when i had finished it he asked me where i was going to school
i said near london which was all i knew
oh
my eye he said looking very lowspirited i am sorry for that why i asked him
oh lord he said shaking his head thats the school where they broke the boys ribstwo ribsa little boy he was
i should say he waslet me seehow old are you about i told him between eight and nine
thats just his age he said
he was eight years and six months old when they broke his first rib eight years and eight months old when they broke his second and did for him i could not disguise from myself or from the waiter that this was an uncomfortable coincidence and inquired how it was done
his answer was not cheering to my spirits for it consisted of two dismal words with whopping the blowing of the coachhorn in the yard was a seasonable diversion which made me get up and hesitatingly inquire in the mingled pride and diffidence of having a purse which i took out of my pocket if there were anything to pay
theres a sheet of letterpaper he returned
did you ever buy a sheet of letterpaper i could not remember that i ever had
its dear he said on account of the duty
threepence
thats the way were taxed in this country
theres nothing else except the waiter
never mind the ink
i lose by that what should youwhat should ihow much ought i towhat would it be right to pay the waiter if you please i stammered blushing
if i hadnt a family and that family hadnt the cowpock said the waiter i wouldnt take a sixpence
if i didnt support a aged pairint and a lovely sisterhere the waiter was greatly agitatedi wouldnt take a farthing
if i had a good place and was treated well here i should beg acceptance of a trifle instead of taking of it
but i live on broken wittlesand i sleep on the coalshere the waiter burst into tears
i was very much concerned for his misfortunes and felt that any recognition short of ninepence would be mere brutality and hardness of heart
therefore i gave him one of my three bright shillings which he received with much humility and veneration and spun up with his thumb directly afterwards to try the goodness of
it was a little disconcerting to me to find when i was being helped up behind the coach that i was supposed to have eaten all the dinner without any assistance
i discovered this from overhearing the lady in the bowwindow say to the guard take care of that child george or hell burst and from observing that the womenservants who were about the place came out to look and giggle at me as a young phenomenon
my unfortunate friend the waiter who had quite recovered his spirits did not appear to be disturbed by this but joined in the general admiration without being at all confused
if i had any doubt of him i suppose this half awakened it but i am inclined to believe that with the simple confidence of a child and the natural reliance of a child upon superior years qualities i am very sorry any children should prematurely change for worldly wisdom i had no serious mistrust of him on the whole even then
i felt it rather hard i must own to be made without deserving it the subject of jokes between the coachman and guard as to the coach drawing heavy behind on account of my sitting there and as to the greater expediency of my travelling by waggon
the story of my supposed appetite getting wind among the outside passengers they were merry upon it likewise and asked me whether i was going to be paid for at school as two brothers or three and whether i was contracted for or went upon the regular terms with other pleasant questions
but the worst of it was that i knew i should be ashamed to eat anything when an opportunity offered and that after a rather light dinner i should remain hungry all nightfor i had left my cakes behind at the hotel in my hurry
my apprehensions were realized
when we stopped for supper i couldnt muster courage to take any though i should have liked it very much but sat by the fire and said i didnt want anything
this did not save me from more jokes either for a huskyvoiced gentleman with a rough face who had been eating out of a sandwichbox nearly all the way except when he had been drinking out of a bottle said i was like a boaconstrictor who took enough at one meal to last him a long time after which he actually brought a rash out upon himself with boiled beef
we had started from yarmouth at three oclock in the afternoon and we were due in london about eight next morning
it was midsummer weather and the evening was very pleasant
when we passed through a village i pictured to myself what the insides of the houses were like and what the inhabitants were about and when boys came running after us and got up behind and swung there for a little way i wondered whether their fathers were alive and whether they were happy at home
i had plenty to think of therefore besides my mind running continually on the kind of place i was going towhich was an awful speculation
sometimes i remember i resigned myself to thoughts of home and peggotty and to endeavouring in a confused blind way to recall how i had felt and what sort of boy i used to be before i bit mr murdstone which i couldnt satisfy myself about by any means i seemed to have bitten him in such a remote antiquity
the night was not so pleasant as the evening for it got chilly and being put between two gentlemen the roughfaced one and another to prevent my tumbling off the coach i was nearly smothered by their falling asleep and completely blocking me up
they squeezed me so hard sometimes that i could not help crying out oh
if you pleasewhich they didnt like at all because it woke them
opposite me was an elderly lady in a great fur cloak who looked in the dark more like a haystack than a lady she was wrapped up to such a degree
this lady had a basket with her and she hadnt known what to do with it for a long time until she found that on account of my legs being short it could go underneath me
it cramped and hurt me so that it made me perfectly miserable but if i moved in the least and made a glass that was in the basket rattle against something else as it was sure to do she gave me the cruellest poke with her foot and said come dont you fidget
your bones are young enough im sure at last the sun rose and then my companions seemed to sleep easier
the difficulties under which they had laboured all night and which had found utterance in the most terrific gasps and snorts are not to be conceived
as the sun got higher their sleep became lighter and so they gradually one by one awoke
i recollect being very much surprised by the feint everybody made then of not having been to sleep at all and by the uncommon indignation with which everyone repelled the charge
i labour under the same kind of astonishment to this day having invariably observed that of all human weaknesses the one to which our common nature is the least disposed to confess i cannot imagine why is the weakness of having gone to sleep in a coach
what an amazing place london was to me when i saw it in the distance and how i believed all the adventures of all my favourite heroes to be constantly enacting and reenacting there and how i vaguely made it out in my own mind to be fuller of wonders and wickedness than all the cities of the earth i need not stop here to relate
we approached it by degrees and got in due time to the inn in the whitechapel district for which we were bound
i forget whether it was the blue bull or the blue boar but i know it was the blue something and that its likeness was painted up on the back of the coach
the guards eye lighted on me as he was getting down and he said at the bookingoffice door is there anybody here for a yoongster booked in the name of murdstone from bloonderstone sooffolk to be left till called for nobody answered
try copperfield if you please sir said i looking helplessly down
is there anybody here for a yoongster booked in the name of murdstone from bloonderstone sooffolk but owning to the name of copperfield to be left till called for said the guard
come
is there anybody no
there was nobody
i looked anxiously around but the inquiry made no impression on any of the bystanders if i except a man in gaiters with one eye who suggested that they had better put a brass collar round my neck and tie me up in the stable
a ladder was brought and i got down after the lady who was like a haystack not daring to stir until her basket was removed
the coach was clear of passengers by that time the luggage was very soon cleared out the horses had been taken out before the luggage and now the coach itself was wheeled and backed off by some hostlers out of the way
still nobody appeared to claim the dusty youngster from blunderstone suffolk
more solitary than robinson crusoe who had nobody to look at him and see that he was solitary i went into the bookingoffice and by invitation of the clerk on duty passed behind the counter and sat down on the scale at which they weighed the luggage
here as i sat looking at the parcels packages and books and inhaling the smell of stables ever since associated with that morning a procession of most tremendous considerations began to march through my mind
supposing nobody should ever fetch me how long would they consent to keep me there
would they keep me long enough to spend seven shillings
should i sleep at night in one of those wooden bins with the other luggage and wash myself at the pump in the yard in the morning or should i be turned out every night and expected to come again to be left till called for when the office opened next day
supposing there was no mistake in the case and mr murdstone had devised this plan to get rid of me what should i do
if they allowed me to remain there until my seven shillings were spent i couldnt hope to remain there when i began to starve
that would obviously be inconvenient and unpleasant to the customers besides entailing on the blue whateveritwas the risk of funeral expenses
if i started off at once and tried to walk back home how could i ever find my way how could i ever hope to walk so far how could i make sure of anyone but peggotty even if i got back
if i found out the nearest proper authorities and offered myself to go for a soldier or a sailor i was such a little fellow that it was most likely they wouldnt take me in
these thoughts and a hundred other such thoughts turned me burning hot and made me giddy with apprehension and dismay
i was in the height of my fever when a man entered and whispered to the clerk who presently slanted me off the scale and pushed me over to him as if i were weighed bought delivered and paid for
as i went out of the office hand in hand with this new acquaintance i stole a look at him
he was a gaunt sallow young man with hollow cheeks and a chin almost as black as mr murdstones but there the likeness ended for his whiskers were shaved off and his hair instead of being glossy was rusty and dry
he was dressed in a suit of black clothes which were rather rusty and dry too and rather short in the sleeves and legs and he had a white neckkerchief on that was not overclean
i did not and do not suppose that this neckkerchief was all the linen he wore but it was all he showed or gave any hint of
youre the new boy he said
yes sir i said
i supposed i was
i didnt know
im one of the masters at salem house he said
i made him a bow and felt very much overawed
i was so ashamed to allude to a commonplace thing like my box to a scholar and a master at salem house that we had gone some little distance from the yard before i had the hardihood to mention it
we turned back on my humbly insinuating that it might be useful to me hereafter and he told the clerk that the carrier had instructions to call for it at noon
if you please sir i said when we had accomplished about the same distance as before is it far its down by blackheath he said
is that far sir i diffidently asked
its a good step he said
we shall go by the stagecoach
its about six miles i was so faint and tired that the idea of holding out for six miles more was too much for me
i took heart to tell him that i had had nothing all night and that if he would allow me to buy something to eat i should be very much obliged to him
he appeared surprised at thisi see him stop and look at me nowand after considering for a few moments said he wanted to call on an old person who lived not far off and that the best way would be for me to buy some bread or whatever i liked best that was wholesome and make my breakfast at her house where we could get some milk
accordingly we looked in at a bakers window and after i had made a series of proposals to buy everything that was bilious in the shop and he had rejected them one by one we decided in favour of a nice little loaf of brown bread which cost me threepence
then at a grocers shop we bought an egg and a slice of streaky bacon which still left what i thought a good deal of change out of the second of the bright shillings and made me consider london a very cheap place
these provisions laid in we went on through a great noise and uproar that confused my weary head beyond description and over a bridge which no doubt was london bridge indeed i think he told me so but i was half asleep until we came to the poor persons house which was a part of some almshouses as i knew by their look and by an inscription on a stone over the gate which said they were established for twentyfive poor women
the master at salem house lifted the latch of one of a number of little black doors that were all alike and had each a little diamondpaned window on one side and another little diamondpaned window above and we went into the little house of one of these poor old women who was blowing a fire to make a little saucepan boil
on seeing the master enter the old woman stopped with the bellows on her knee and said something that i thought sounded like my charley but on seeing me come in too she got up and rubbing her hands made a confused sort of half curtsey
can you cook this young gentlemans breakfast for him if you please said the master at salem house
can i said the old woman
yes can i sure hows mrs fibbitson today said the master looking at another old woman in a large chair by the fire who was such a bundle of clothes that i feel grateful to this hour for not having sat upon her by mistake
ah shes poorly said the first old woman
its one of her bad days
if the fire was to go out through any accident i verily believe shed go out too and never come to life again as they looked at her i looked at her also
although it was a warm day she seemed to think of nothing but the fire
i fancied she was jealous even of the saucepan on it and i have reason to know that she took its impressment into the service of boiling my egg and broiling my bacon in dudgeon for i saw her with my own discomfited eyes shake her fist at me once when those culinary operations were going on and no one else was looking
the sun streamed in at the little window but she sat with her own back and the back of the large chair towards it screening the fire as if she were sedulously keeping it warm instead of it keeping her warm and watching it in a most distrustful manner
the completion of the preparations for my breakfast by relieving the fire gave her such extreme joy that she laughed aloudand a very unmelodious laugh she had i must say
i sat down to my brown loaf my egg and my rasher of bacon with a basin of milk besides and made a most delicious meal
while i was yet in the full enjoyment of it the old woman of the house said to the master have you got your flute with you yes he returned
have a blow at it said the old woman coaxingly
do the master upon this put his hand underneath the skirts of his coat and brought out his flute in three pieces which he screwed together and began immediately to play
my impression is after many years of consideration that there never can have been anybody in the world who played worse
he made the most dismal sounds i have ever heard produced by any means natural or artificial
i dont know what the tunes wereif there were such things in the performance at all which i doubtbut the influence of the strain upon me was first to make me think of all my sorrows until i could hardly keep my tears back then to take away my appetite and lastly to make me so sleepy that i couldnt keep my eyes open
they begin to close again and i begin to nod as the recollection rises fresh upon me
once more the little room with its open corner cupboard and its squarebacked chairs and its angular little staircase leading to the room above and its three peacocks feathers displayed over the mantelpiecei remember wondering when i first went in what that peacock would have thought if he had known what his finery was doomed to come tofades from before me and i nod and sleep
the flute becomes inaudible the wheels of the coach are heard instead and i am on my journey
the coach jolts i wake with a start and the flute has come back again and the master at salem house is sitting with his legs crossed playing it dolefully while the old woman of the house looks on delighted
she fades in her turn and he fades and all fades and there is no flute no master no salem house no david copperfield no anything but heavy sleep
i dreamed i thought that once while he was blowing into this dismal flute the old woman of the house who had gone nearer and nearer to him in her ecstatic admiration leaned over the back of his chair and gave him an affectionate squeeze round the neck which stopped his playing for a moment
i was in the middle state between sleeping and waking either then or immediately afterwards for as he resumedit was a real fact that he had stopped playingi saw and heard the same old woman ask mrs fibbitson if it wasnt delicious meaning the flute to which mrs fibbitson replied ay ay
yes and nodded at the fire to which i am persuaded she gave the credit of the whole performance
when i seemed to have been dozing a long while the master at salem house unscrewed his flute into the three pieces put them up as before and took me away
we found the coach very near at hand and got upon the roof but i was so dead sleepy that when we stopped on the road to take up somebody else they put me inside where there were no passengers and where i slept profoundly until i found the coach going at a footpace up a steep hill among green leaves
presently it stopped and had come to its destination
a short walk brought usi mean the master and meto salem house which was enclosed with a high brick wall and looked very dull
over a door in this wall was a board with salem house upon it and through a grating in this door we were surveyed when we rang the bell by a surly face which i found on the door being opened belonged to a stout man with a bullneck a wooden leg overhanging temples and his hair cut close all round his head
the new boy said the master
the man with the wooden leg eyed me all overit didnt take long for there was not much of meand locked the gate behind us and took out the key
we were going up to the house among some dark heavy trees when he called after my conductor
hallo we looked back and he was standing at the door of a little lodge where he lived with a pair of boots in his hand
here
the cobblers been he said since youve been out mr mell and he says he cant mend em any more
he says there aint a bit of the original boot left and he wonders you expect it with these words he threw the boots towards mr mell who went back a few paces to pick them up and looked at them very disconsolately i was afraid as we went on together
i observed then for the first time that the boots he had on were a good deal the worse for wear and that his stocking was just breaking out in one place like a bud
salem house was a square brick building with wings of a bare and unfurnished appearance
all about it was so very quiet that i said to mr mell i supposed the boys were out but he seemed surprised at my not knowing that it was holidaytime
that all the boys were at their several homes
that mr creakle the proprietor was down by the seaside with mrs and miss creakle and that i was sent in holidaytime as a punishment for my misdoing all of which he explained to me as we went along
i gazed upon the schoolroom into which he took me as the most forlorn and desolate place i had ever seen
i see it now
a long room with three long rows of desks and six of forms and bristling all round with pegs for hats and slates
scraps of old copybooks and exercises litter the dirty floor
some silkworms houses made of the same materials are scattered over the desks
two miserable little white mice left behind by their owner are running up and down in a fusty castle made of pasteboard and wire looking in all the corners with their red eyes for anything to eat
a bird in a cage very little bigger than himself makes a mournful rattle now and then in hopping on his perch two inches high or dropping from it but neither sings nor chirps
there is a strange unwholesome smell upon the room like mildewed corduroys sweet apples wanting air and rotten books
there could not well be more ink splashed about it if it had been roofless from its first construction and the skies had rained snowed hailed and blown ink through the varying seasons of the year
mr mell having left me while he took his irreparable boots upstairs i went softly to the upper end of the room observing all this as i crept along
suddenly i came upon a pasteboard placard beautifully written which was lying on the desk and bore these words take care of him
he bites i got upon the desk immediately apprehensive of at least a great dog underneath
but though i looked all round with anxious eyes i could see nothing of him
i was still engaged in peering about when mr mell came back and asked me what i did up there
i beg your pardon sir says i if you please im looking for the dog dog he says
what dog isnt it a dog sir isnt what a dog thats to be taken care of sir that bites no copperfield says he gravely thats not a dog
thats a boy
my instructions are copperfield to put this placard on your back
i am sorry to make such a beginning with you but i must do it with that he took me down and tied the placard which was neatly constructed for the purpose on my shoulders like a knapsack and wherever i went afterwards i had the consolation of carrying it
what i suffered from that placard nobody can imagine
whether it was possible for people to see me or not i always fancied that somebody was reading it
it was no relief to turn round and find nobody for wherever my back was there i imagined somebody always to be
that cruel man with the wooden leg aggravated my sufferings
he was in authority and if he ever saw me leaning against a tree or a wall or the house he roared out from his lodge door in a stupendous voice hallo you sir
you copperfield
show that badge conspicuous or ill report you the playground was a bare gravelled yard open to all the back of the house and the offices and i knew that the servants read it and the butcher read it and the baker read it that everybody in a word who came backwards and forwards to the house of a morning when i was ordered to walk there read that i was to be taken care of for i bit i recollect that i positively began to have a dread of myself as a kind of wild boy who did bite
there was an old door in this playground on which the boys had a custom of carving their names
it was completely covered with such inscriptions
in my dread of the end of the vacation and their coming back i could not read a boys name without inquiring in what tone and with what emphasis he would read take care of him
he bites there was one boya certain j steerforthwho cut his name very deep and very often who i conceived would read it in a rather strong voice and afterwards pull my hair
there was another boy one tommy traddles who i dreaded would make game of it and pretend to be dreadfully frightened of me
there was a third george demple who i fancied would sing it
i have looked a little shrinking creature at that door until the owners of all the namesthere were fiveandforty of them in the school then mr mell saidseemed to send me to coventry by general acclamation and to cry out each in his own way take care of him
he bites it was the same with the places at the desks and forms
it was the same with the groves of deserted bedsteads i peeped at on my way to and when i was in my own bed
i remember dreaming night after night of being with my mother as she used to be or of going to a party at mr peggottys or of travelling outside the stagecoach or of dining again with my unfortunate friend the waiter and in all these circumstances making people scream and stare by the unhappy disclosure that i had nothing on but my little nightshirt and that placard
in the monotony of my life and in my constant apprehension of the reopening of the school it was such an insupportable affliction
i had long tasks every day to do with mr mell but i did them there being no mr and miss murdstone here and got through them without disgrace
before and after them i walked aboutsupervised as i have mentioned by the man with the wooden leg
how vividly i call to mind the damp about the house the green cracked flagstones in the court an old leaky waterbutt and the discoloured trunks of some of the grim trees which seemed to have dripped more in the rain than other trees and to have blown less in the sun
at one we dined mr mell and i at the upper end of a long bare diningroom full of deal tables and smelling of fat
then we had more tasks until tea which mr mell drank out of a blue teacup and i out of a tin pot
all day long and until seven or eight in the evening mr mell at his own detached desk in the schoolroom worked hard with pen ink ruler books and writingpaper making out the bills as i found for last halfyear
when he had put up his things for the night he took out his flute and blew at it until i almost thought he would gradually blow his whole being into the large hole at the top and ooze away at the keys
i picture my small self in the dimlylighted rooms sitting with my head upon my hand listening to the doleful performance of mr mell and conning tomorrows lessons
i picture myself with my books shut up still listening to the doleful performance of mr mell and listening through it to what used to be at home and to the blowing of the wind on yarmouth flats and feeling very sad and solitary
i picture myself going up to bed among the unused rooms and sitting on my bedside crying for a comfortable word from peggotty
i picture myself coming downstairs in the morning and looking through a long ghastly gash of a staircase window at the schoolbell hanging on the top of an outhouse with a weathercock above it and dreading the time when it shall ring j steerforth and the rest to work which is only second in my foreboding apprehensions to the time when the man with the wooden leg shall unlock the rusty gate to give admission to the awful mr creakle
i cannot think i was a very dangerous character in any of these aspects but in all of them i carried the same warning on my back
mr mell never said much to me but he was never harsh to me
i suppose we were company to each other without talking
i forgot to mention that he would talk to himself sometimes and grin and clench his fist and grind his teeth and pull his hair in an unaccountable manner
but he had these peculiarities and at first they frightened me though i soon got used to them
i had led this life about a month when the man with the wooden leg began to stump about with a mop and a bucket of water from which i inferred that preparations were making to receive mr creakle and the boys
i was not mistaken for the mop came into the schoolroom before long and turned out mr mell and me who lived where we could and got on how we could for some days during which we were always in the way of two or three young women who had rarely shown themselves before and were so continually in the midst of dust that i sneezed almost as much as if salem house had been a great snuffbox
one day i was informed by mr mell that mr creakle would be home that evening
in the evening after tea i heard that he was come
before bedtime i was fetched by the man with the wooden leg to appear before him
mr creakles part of the house was a good deal more comfortable than ours and he had a snug bit of garden that looked pleasant after the dusty playground which was such a desert in miniature that i thought no one but a camel or a dromedary could have felt at home in it
it seemed to me a bold thing even to take notice that the passage looked comfortable as i went on my way trembling to mr creakles presence which so abashed me when i was ushered into it that i hardly saw mrs creakle or miss creakle who were both there in the parlour or anything but mr creakle a stout gentleman with a bunch of watchchain and seals in an armchair with a tumbler and bottle beside him
so said mr creakle
this is the young gentleman whose teeth are to be filed
turn him round the woodenlegged man turned me about so as to exhibit the placard and having afforded time for a full survey of it turned me about again with my face to mr creakle and posted himself at mr creakles side
mr creakles face was fiery and his eyes were small and deep in his head he had thick veins in his forehead a little nose and a large chin
he was bald on the top of his head and had some thin wetlooking hair that was just turning grey brushed across each temple so that the two sides interlaced on his forehead
but the circumstance about him which impressed me most was that he had no voice but spoke in a whisper
the exertion this cost him or the consciousness of talking in that feeble way made his angry face so much more angry and his thick veins so much thicker when he spoke that i am not surprised on looking back at this peculiarity striking me as his chief one
now said mr creakle
whats the report of this boy theres nothing against him yet returned the man with the wooden leg
there has been no opportunity i thought mr creakle was disappointed
i thought mrs and miss creakle at whom i now glanced for the first time and who were both thin and quiet were not disappointed
come here sir said mr creakle beckoning to me
come here said the man with the wooden leg repeating the gesture
i have the happiness of knowing your fatherinlaw whispered mr creakle taking me by the ear and a worthy man he is and a man of a strong character
he knows me and i know him
do you know me
hey said mr creakle pinching my ear with ferocious playfulness
not yet sir i said flinching with the pain
not yet
hey repeated mr creakle
but you will soon
hey you will soon
hey repeated the man with the wooden leg
i afterwards found that he generally acted with his strong voice as mr creakles interpreter to the boys
i was very much frightened and said i hoped so if he pleased
i felt all this while as if my ear were blazing he pinched it so hard
ill tell you what i am whispered mr creakle letting it go at last with a screw at parting that brought the water into my eyes
im a tartar a tartar said the man with the wooden leg
when i say ill do a thing i do it said mr creakle and when i say i will have a thing done i will have it done will have a thing done i will have it done repeated the man with the wooden leg
i am a determined character said mr creakle
thats what i am
i do my duty
thats what i do
my flesh and bloodhe looked at mrs creakle as he said thiswhen it rises against me is not my flesh and blood
i discard it
has that fellowto the man with the wooden legbeen here again no was the answer
no said mr creakle
he knows better
he knows me
let him keep away
i say let him keep away said mr creakle striking his hand upon the table and looking at mrs creakle for he knows me
now you have begun to know me too my young friend and you may go
take him away i was very glad to be ordered away for mrs and miss creakle were both wiping their eyes and i felt as uncomfortable for them as i did for myself
but i had a petition on my mind which concerned me so nearly that i couldnt help saying though i wondered at my own courage if you please sir mr creakle whispered hah
whats this and bent his eyes upon me as if he would have burnt me up with them
if you please sir i faltered if i might be allowed i am very sorry indeed sir for what i did to take this writing off before the boys come back whether mr creakle was in earnest or whether he only did it to frighten me i dont know but he made a burst out of his chair before which i precipitately retreated without waiting for the escort of the man with the wooden leg and never once stopped until i reached my own bedroom where finding i was not pursued i went to bed as it was time and lay quaking for a couple of hours
next morning mr sharp came back
mr sharp was the first master and superior to mr mell
mr mell took his meals with the boys but mr sharp dined and supped at mr creakles table
he was a limp delicatelooking gentleman i thought with a good deal of nose and a way of carrying his head on one side as if it were a little too heavy for him
his hair was very smooth and wavy but i was informed by the very first boy who came back that it was a wig a secondhand one he said and that mr sharp went out every saturday afternoon to get it curled
it was no other than tommy traddles who gave me this piece of intelligence
he was the first boy who returned
he introduced himself by informing me that i should find his name on the righthand corner of the gate over the topbolt upon that i said traddles to which he replied the same and then he asked me for a full account of myself and family
it was a happy circumstance for me that traddles came back first
he enjoyed my placard so much that he saved me from the embarrassment of either disclosure or concealment by presenting me to every other boy who came back great or small immediately on his arrival in this form of introduction look here
heres a game happily too the greater part of the boys came back lowspirited and were not so boisterous at my expense as i had expected
some of them certainly did dance about me like wild indians and the greater part could not resist the temptation of pretending that i was a dog and patting and soothing me lest i should bite and saying lie down sir and calling me towzer
this was naturally confusing among so many strangers and cost me some tears but on the whole it was much better than i had anticipated
i was not considered as being formally received into the school however until j steerforth arrived
before this boy who was reputed to be a great scholar and was very goodlooking and at least halfadozen years my senior i was carried as before a magistrate
he inquired under a shed in the playground into the particulars of my punishment and was pleased to express his opinion that it was a jolly shame for which i became bound to him ever afterwards
what money have you got copperfield he said walking aside with me when he had disposed of my affair in these terms
i told him seven shillings
you had better give it to me to take care of he said
at least you can if you like
you neednt if you dont like i hastened to comply with his friendly suggestion and opening peggottys purse turned it upside down into his hand
do you want to spend anything now he asked me
no thank you i replied
you can if you like you know said steerforth
say the word no thank you sir i repeated
perhaps youd like to spend a couple of shillings or so in a bottle of currant wine by and by up in the bedroom said steerforth
you belong to my bedroom i find it certainly had not occurred to me before but i said yes i should like that
very good said steerforth
youll be glad to spend another shilling or so in almond cakes i dare say i said yes i should like that too
and another shilling or so in biscuits and another in fruit eh said steerforth
i say young copperfield youre going it i smiled because he smiled but i was a little troubled in my mind too
well said steerforth
we must make it stretch as far as we can thats all
ill do the best in my power for you
i can go out when i like and ill smuggle the prog in with these words he put the money in his pocket and kindly told me not to make myself uneasy he would take care it should be all right
he was as good as his word if that were all right which i had a secret misgiving was nearly all wrongfor i feared it was a waste of my mothers two halfcrownsthough i had preserved the piece of paper they were wrapped in which was a precious saving
when we went upstairs to bed he produced the whole seven shillings worth and laid it out on my bed in the moonlight saying there you are young copperfield and a royal spread youve got i couldnt think of doing the honours of the feast at my time of life while he was by my hand shook at the very thought of it
i begged him to do me the favour of presiding and my request being seconded by the other boys who were in that room he acceded to it and sat upon my pillow handing round the viandswith perfect fairness i must sayand dispensing the currant wine in a little glass without a foot which was his own property
as to me i sat on his left hand and the rest were grouped about us on the nearest beds and on the floor
how well i recollect our sitting there talking in whispers or their talking and my respectfully listening i ought rather to say the moonlight falling a little way into the room through the window painting a pale window on the floor and the greater part of us in shadow except when steerforth dipped a match into a phosphorusbox when he wanted to look for anything on the board and shed a blue glare over us that was gone directly
a certain mysterious feeling consequent on the darkness the secrecy of the revel and the whisper in which everything was said steals over me again and i listen to all they tell me with a vague feeling of solemnity and awe which makes me glad that they are all so near and frightens me though i feign to laugh when traddles pretends to see a ghost in the corner
i heard all kinds of things about the school and all belonging to it
i heard that mr creakle had not preferred his claim to being a tartar without reason that he was the sternest and most severe of masters that he laid about him right and left every day of his life charging in among the boys like a trooper and slashing away unmercifully
that he knew nothing himself but the art of slashing being more ignorant j steerforth said than the lowest boy in the school that he had been a good many years ago a small hopdealer in the borough and had taken to the schooling business after being bankrupt in hops and making away with mrs creakles money
with a good deal more of that sort which i wondered how they knew
i heard that the man with the wooden leg whose name was tungay was an obstinate barbarian who had formerly assisted in the hop business but had come into the scholastic line with mr creakle in consequence as was supposed among the boys of his having broken his leg in mr creakles service and having done a deal of dishonest work for him and knowing his secrets
i heard that with the single exception of mr creakle tungay considered the whole establishment masters and boys as his natural enemies and that the only delight of his life was to be sour and malicious
i heard that mr creakle had a son who had not been tungays friend and who assisting in the school had once held some remonstrance with his father on an occasion when its discipline was very cruelly exercised and was supposed besides to have protested against his fathers usage of his mother
i heard that mr creakle had turned him out of doors in consequence and that mrs and miss creakle had been in a sad way ever since
but the greatest wonder that i heard of mr creakle was there being one boy in the school on whom he never ventured to lay a hand and that boy being j steerforth
steerforth himself confirmed this when it was stated and said that he should like to begin to see him do it
on being asked by a mild boy not me how he would proceed if he did begin to see him do it he dipped a match into his phosphorusbox on purpose to shed a glare over his reply and said he would commence by knocking him down with a blow on the forehead from the sevenandsixpenny inkbottle that was always on the mantelpiece
we sat in the dark for some time breathless
i heard that mr sharp and mr mell were both supposed to be wretchedly paid and that when there was hot and cold meat for dinner at mr creakles table mr sharp was always expected to say he preferred cold which was again corroborated by j steerforth the only parlourboarder
i heard that mr sharps wig didnt fit him and that he neednt be so bounceablesomebody else said bumptiousabout it because his own red hair was very plainly to be seen behind
i heard that one boy who was a coalmerchants son came as a setoff against the coalbill and was called on that account exchange or bartera name selected from the arithmetic book as expressing this arrangement
i heard that the table beer was a robbery of parents and the pudding an imposition
i heard that miss creakle was regarded by the school in general as being in love with steerforth and i am sure as i sat in the dark thinking of his nice voice and his fine face and his easy manner and his curling hair i thought it very likely
i heard that mr mell was not a bad sort of fellow but hadnt a sixpence to bless himself with and that there was no doubt that old mrs mell his mother was as poor as job
i thought of my breakfast then and what had sounded like my charley but i was i am glad to remember as mute as a mouse about it
the hearing of all this and a good deal more outlasted the banquet some time
the greater part of the guests had gone to bed as soon as the eating and drinking were over and we who had remained whispering and listening halfundressed at last betook ourselves to bed too
good night young copperfield said steerforth
ill take care of you youre very kind i gratefully returned
i am very much obliged to you you havent got a sister have you said steerforth yawning
no i answered
thats a pity said steerforth
if you had had one i should think she would have been a pretty timid little brighteyed sort of girl
i should have liked to know her
good night young copperfield good night sir i replied
i thought of him very much after i went to bed and raised myself i recollect to look at him where he lay in the moonlight with his handsome face turned up and his head reclining easily on his arm
he was a person of great power in my eyes that was of course the reason of my mind running on him
no veiled future dimly glanced upon him in the moonbeams
there was no shadowy picture of his footsteps in the garden that i dreamed of walking in all night
school began in earnest next day
a profound impression was made upon me i remember by the roar of voices in the schoolroom suddenly becoming hushed as death when mr creakle entered after breakfast and stood in the doorway looking round upon us like a giant in a storybook surveying his captives
tungay stood at mr creakles elbow
he had no occasion i thought to cry out silence so ferociously for the boys were all struck speechless and motionless
mr creakle was seen to speak and tungay was heard to this effect
now boys this is a new half
take care what youre about in this new half
come fresh up to the lessons i advise you for i come fresh up to the punishment
i wont flinch
it will be of no use your rubbing yourselves you wont rub the marks out that i shall give you
now get to work every boy when this dreadful exordium was over and tungay had stumped out again mr creakle came to where i sat and told me that if i were famous for biting he was famous for biting too
he then showed me the cane and asked me what i thought of that for a tooth
was it a sharp tooth hey
was it a double tooth hey
had it a deep prong hey
did it bite hey
did it bite
at every question he gave me a fleshy cut with it that made me writhe so i was very soon made free of salem house as steerforth said and was very soon in tears also
not that i mean to say these were special marks of distinction which only i received
on the contrary a large majority of the boys especially the smaller ones were visited with similar instances of notice as mr creakle made the round of the schoolroom
half the establishment was writhing and crying before the days work began and how much of it had writhed and cried before the days work was over i am really afraid to recollect lest i should seem to exaggerate
i should think there never can have been a man who enjoyed his profession more than mr creakle did
he had a delight in cutting at the boys which was like the satisfaction of a craving appetite
i am confident that he couldnt resist a chubby boy especially that there was a fascination in such a subject which made him restless in his mind until he had scored and marked him for the day
i was chubby myself and ought to know
i am sure when i think of the fellow now my blood rises against him with the disinterested indignation i should feel if i could have known all about him without having ever been in his power but it rises hotly because i know him to have been an incapable brute who had no more right to be possessed of the great trust he held than to be lord high admiral or commanderinchiefin either of which capacities it is probable that he would have done infinitely less mischief
miserable little propitiators of a remorseless idol how abject we were to him
what a launch in life i think it now on looking back to be so mean and servile to a man of such parts and pretensions
here i sit at the desk again watching his eyehumbly watching his eye as he rules a cipheringbook for another victim whose hands have just been flattened by that identical ruler and who is trying to wipe the sting out with a pockethandkerchief
i have plenty to do
i dont watch his eye in idleness but because i am morbidly attracted to it in a dread desire to know what he will do next and whether it will be my turn to suffer or somebody elses
a lane of small boys beyond me with the same interest in his eye watch it too
i think he knows it though he pretends he dont
he makes dreadful mouths as he rules the cipheringbook and now he throws his eye sideways down our lane and we all droop over our books and tremble
a moment afterwards we are again eyeing him
an unhappy culprit found guilty of imperfect exercise approaches at his command
the culprit falters excuses and professes a determination to do better tomorrow
mr creakle cuts a joke before he beats him and we laugh at itmiserable little dogs we laugh with our visages as white as ashes and our hearts sinking into our boots
here i sit at the desk again on a drowsy summer afternoon
a buzz and hum go up around me as if the boys were so many bluebottles
a cloggy sensation of the lukewarm fat of meat is upon me we dined an hour or two ago and my head is as heavy as so much lead
i would give the world to go to sleep
i sit with my eye on mr creakle blinking at him like a young owl when sleep overpowers me for a minute he still looms through my slumber ruling those cipheringbooks until he softly comes behind me and wakes me to plainer perception of him with a red ridge across my back
here i am in the playground with my eye still fascinated by him though i cant see him
the window at a little distance from which i know he is having his dinner stands for him and i eye that instead
if he shows his face near it mine assumes an imploring and submissive expression
if he looks out through the glass the boldest boy steerforth excepted stops in the middle of a shout or yell and becomes contemplative
one day traddles the most unfortunate boy in the world breaks that window accidentally with a ball
i shudder at this moment with the tremendous sensation of seeing it done and feeling that the ball has bounded on to mr creakles sacred head
poor traddles
in a tight skyblue suit that made his arms and legs like german sausages or rolypoly puddings he was the merriest and most miserable of all the boys
he was always being canedi think he was caned every day that halfyear except one holiday monday when he was only rulerd on both handsand was always going to write to his uncle about it and never did
after laying his head on the desk for a little while he would cheer up somehow begin to laugh again and draw skeletons all over his slate before his eyes were dry
i used at first to wonder what comfort traddles found in drawing skeletons and for some time looked upon him as a sort of hermit who reminded himself by those symbols of mortality that caning couldnt last for ever
but i believe he only did it because they were easy and didnt want any features
he was very honourable traddles was and held it as a solemn duty in the boys to stand by one another
he suffered for this on several occasions and particularly once when steerforth laughed in church and the beadle thought it was traddles and took him out
i see him now going away in custody despised by the congregation
he never said who was the real offender though he smarted for it next day and was imprisoned so many hours that he came forth with a whole churchyardfull of skeletons swarming all over his latin dictionary
but he had his reward
steerforth said there was nothing of the sneak in traddles and we all felt that to be the highest praise
for my part i could have gone through a good deal though i was much less brave than traddles and nothing like so old to have won such a recompense
to see steerforth walk to church before us arminarm with miss creakle was one of the great sights of my life
i didnt think miss creakle equal to little emly in point of beauty and i didnt love her i didnt dare but i thought her a young lady of extraordinary attractions and in point of gentility not to be surpassed
when steerforth in white trousers carried her parasol for her i felt proud to know him and believed that she could not choose but adore him with all her heart
mr sharp and mr mell were both notable personages in my eyes but steerforth was to them what the sun was to two stars
steerforth continued his protection of me and proved a very useful friend since nobody dared to annoy one whom he honoured with his countenance
he couldntor at all events he didntdefend me from mr creakle who was very severe with me but whenever i had been treated worse than usual he always told me that i wanted a little of his pluck and that he wouldnt have stood it himself which i felt he intended for encouragement and considered to be very kind of him
there was one advantage and only one that i know of in mr creakles severity
he found my placard in his way when he came up or down behind the form on which i sat and wanted to make a cut at me in passing for this reason it was soon taken off and i saw it no more
an accidental circumstance cemented the intimacy between steerforth and me in a manner that inspired me with great pride and satisfaction though it sometimes led to inconvenience
it happened on one occasion when he was doing me the honour of talking to me in the playground that i hazarded the observation that something or somebodyi forget what nowwas like something or somebody in peregrine pickle
he said nothing at the time but when i was going to bed at night asked me if i had got that book
i told him no and explained how it was that i had read it and all those other books of which i have made mention
and do you recollect them steerforth said
oh yes i replied i had a good memory and i believed i recollected them very well
then i tell you what young copperfield said steerforth you shall tell em to me
i cant get to sleep very early at night and i generally wake rather early in the morning
well go over em one after another
well make some regular arabian nights of it i felt extremely flattered by this arrangement and we commenced carrying it into execution that very evening
what ravages i committed on my favourite authors in the course of my interpretation of them i am not in a condition to say and should be very unwilling to know but i had a profound faith in them and i had to the best of my belief a simple earnest manner of narrating what i did narrate and these qualities went a long way
the drawback was that i was often sleepy at night or out of spirits and indisposed to resume the story and then it was rather hard work and it must be done for to disappoint or to displease steerforth was of course out of the question
in the morning too when i felt weary and should have enjoyed another hours repose very much it was a tiresome thing to be roused like the sultana scheherazade and forced into a long story before the gettingup bell rang but steerforth was resolute and as he explained to me in return my sums and exercises and anything in my tasks that was too hard for me i was no loser by the transaction
let me do myself justice however
i was moved by no interested or selfish motive nor was i moved by fear of him
i admired and loved him and his approval was return enough
it was so precious to me that i look back on these trifles now with an aching heart
steerforth was considerate too and showed his consideration in one particular instance in an unflinching manner that was a little tantalizing i suspect to poor traddles and the rest
peggottys promised letterwhat a comfortable letter it wasarrived before the half was many weeks old and with it a cake in a perfect nest of oranges and two bottles of cowslip wine
this treasure as in duty bound i laid at the feet of steerforth and begged him to dispense
now ill tell you what young copperfield said he the wine shall be kept to wet your whistle when you are storytelling i blushed at the idea and begged him in my modesty not to think of it
but he said he had observed i was sometimes hoarsea little roopy was his exact expressionand it should be every drop devoted to the purpose he had mentioned
accordingly it was locked up in his box and drawn off by himself in a phial and administered to me through a piece of quill in the cork when i was supposed to be in want of a restorative
sometimes to make it a more sovereign specific he was so kind as to squeeze orange juice into it or to stir it up with ginger or dissolve a peppermint drop in it and although i cannot assert that the flavour was improved by these experiments or that it was exactly the compound one would have chosen for a stomachic the last thing at night and the first thing in the morning i drank it gratefully and was very sensible of his attention
we seem to me to have been months over peregrine and months more over the other stories
the institution never flagged for want of a story i am certain and the wine lasted out almost as well as the matter
poor traddlesi never think of that boy but with a strange disposition to laugh and with tears in my eyeswas a sort of chorus in general and affected to be convulsed with mirth at the comic parts and to be overcome with fear when there was any passage of an alarming character in the narrative
this rather put me out very often
it was a great jest of his i recollect to pretend that he couldnt keep his teeth from chattering whenever mention was made of an alguazill in connexion with the adventures of gil blas and i remember that when gil blas met the captain of the robbers in madrid this unlucky joker counterfeited such an ague of terror that he was overheard by mr creakle who was prowling about the passage and handsomely flogged for disorderly conduct in the bedroom
whatever i had within me that was romantic and dreamy was encouraged by so much storytelling in the dark and in that respect the pursuit may not have been very profitable to me
but the being cherished as a kind of plaything in my room and the consciousness that this accomplishment of mine was bruited about among the boys and attracted a good deal of notice to me though i was the youngest there stimulated me to exertion
in a school carried on by sheer cruelty whether it is presided over by a dunce or not there is not likely to be much learnt
i believe our boys were generally as ignorant a set as any schoolboys in existence they were too much troubled and knocked about to learn they could no more do that to advantage than any one can do anything to advantage in a life of constant misfortune torment and worry
but my little vanity and steerforths help urged me on somehow and without saving me from much if anything in the way of punishment made me for the time i was there an exception to the general body insomuch that i did steadily pick up some crumbs of knowledge
in this i was much assisted by mr mell who had a liking for me that i am grateful to remember
it always gave me pain to observe that steerforth treated him with systematic disparagement and seldom lost an occasion of wounding his feelings or inducing others to do so
this troubled me the more for a long time because i had soon told steerforth from whom i could no more keep such a secret than i could keep a cake or any other tangible possession about the two old women mr mell had taken me to see and i was always afraid that steerforth would let it out and twit him with it
we little thought any one of us i dare say when i ate my breakfast that first morning and went to sleep under the shadow of the peacocks feathers to the sound of the flute what consequences would come of the introduction into those almshouses of my insignificant person
but the visit had its unforeseen consequences and of a serious sort too in their way
one day when mr creakle kept the house from indisposition which naturally diffused a lively joy through the school there was a good deal of noise in the course of the mornings work
the great relief and satisfaction experienced by the boys made them difficult to manage and though the dreaded tungay brought his wooden leg in twice or thrice and took notes of the principal offenders names no great impression was made by it as they were pretty sure of getting into trouble tomorrow do what they would and thought it wise no doubt to enjoy themselves today
it was properly a halfholiday being saturday
but as the noise in the playground would have disturbed mr creakle and the weather was not favourable for going out walking we were ordered into school in the afternoon and set some lighter tasks than usual which were made for the occasion
it was the day of the week on which mr sharp went out to get his wig curled so mr mell who always did the drudgery whatever it was kept school by himself
if i could associate the idea of a bull or a bear with anyone so mild as mr mell i should think of him in connexion with that afternoon when the uproar was at its height as of one of those animals baited by a thousand dogs
i recall him bending his aching head supported on his bony hand over the book on his desk and wretchedly endeavouring to get on with his tiresome work amidst an uproar that might have made the speaker of the house of commons giddy
boys started in and out of their places playing at puss in the corner with other boys there were laughing boys singing boys talking boys dancing boys howling boys boys shuffled with their feet boys whirled about him grinning making faces mimicking him behind his back and before his eyes mimicking his poverty his boots his coat his mother everything belonging to him that they should have had consideration for
silence cried mr mell suddenly rising up and striking his desk with the book
what does this mean
its impossible to bear it
its maddening
how can you do it to me boys it was my book that he struck his desk with and as i stood beside him following his eye as it glanced round the room i saw the boys all stop some suddenly surprised some half afraid and some sorry perhaps
steerforths place was at the bottom of the school at the opposite end of the long room
he was lounging with his back against the wall and his hands in his pockets and looked at mr mell with his mouth shut up as if he were whistling when mr mell looked at him
silence mr steerforth said mr mell
silence yourself said steerforth turning red
whom are you talking to sit down said mr mell
sit down yourself said steerforth and mind your business there was a titter and some applause but mr mell was so white that silence immediately succeeded and one boy who had darted out behind him to imitate his mother again changed his mind and pretended to want a pen mended
if you think steerforth said mr mell that i am not acquainted with the power you can establish over any mind herehe laid his hand without considering what he did as i supposed upon my heador that i have not observed you within a few minutes urging your juniors on to every sort of outrage against me you are mistaken i dont give myself the trouble of thinking at all about you said steerforth coolly so im not mistaken as it happens and when you make use of your position of favouritism here sir pursued mr mell with his lip trembling very much to insult a gentleman a whatwhere is he said steerforth
here somebody cried out shame j steerforth
too bad it was traddles whom mr mell instantly discomfited by bidding him hold his tongue
to insult one who is not fortunate in life sir and who never gave you the least offence and the many reasons for not insulting whom you are old enough and wise enough to understand said mr mell with his lips trembling more and more you commit a mean and base action
you can sit down or stand up as you please sir
copperfield go on young copperfield said steerforth coming forward up the room stop a bit
i tell you what mr mell once for all
when you take the liberty of calling me mean or base or anything of that sort you are an impudent beggar
you are always a beggar you know but when you do that you are an impudent beggar i am not clear whether he was going to strike mr mell or mr mell was going to strike him or there was any such intention on either side
i saw a rigidity come upon the whole school as if they had been turned into stone and found mr creakle in the midst of us with tungay at his side and mrs and miss creakle looking in at the door as if they were frightened
mr mell with his elbows on his desk and his face in his hands sat for some moments quite still
mr
mell said mr creakle shaking him by the arm and his whisper was so audible now that tungay felt it unnecessary to repeat his words you have not forgotten yourself i hope no sir no returned the master showing his face and shaking his head and rubbing his hands in great agitation
no sir
no
i have remembered myself ino mr creakle i have not forgotten myself ii have remembered myself sir
iicould wish you had remembered me a little sooner mr creakle
ititwould have been more kind sir more just sir
it would have saved me something sir mr creakle looking hard at mr mell put his hand on tungays shoulder and got his feet upon the form close by and sat upon the desk
after still looking hard at mr mell from his throne as he shook his head and rubbed his hands and remained in the same state of agitation mr creakle turned to steerforth and said now sir as he dont condescend to tell me what is this steerforth evaded the question for a little while looking in scorn and anger on his opponent and remaining silent
i could not help thinking even in that interval i remember what a noble fellow he was in appearance and how homely and plain mr mell looked opposed to him
what did he mean by talking about favourites then said steerforth at length
favourites repeated mr creakle with the veins in his forehead swelling quickly
who talked about favourites he did said steerforth
and pray what did you mean by that sir demanded mr creakle turning angrily on his assistant
i meant mr creakle he returned in a low voice as i said that no pupil had a right to avail himself of his position of favouritism to degrade me to degrade you said mr creakle
my stars
but give me leave to ask you mr whatsyourname and here mr creakle folded his arms cane and all upon his chest and made such a knot of his brows that his little eyes were hardly visible below them whether when you talk about favourites you showed proper respect to me
to me sir said mr creakle darting his head at him suddenly and drawing it back again the principal of this establishment and your employer it was not judicious sir i am willing to admit said mr mell
i should not have done so if i had been cool here steerforth struck in
then he said i was mean and then he said i was base and then i called him a beggar
if i had been cool perhaps i shouldnt have called him a beggar
but i did and i am ready to take the consequences of it without considering perhaps whether there were any consequences to be taken i felt quite in a glow at this gallant speech
it made an impression on the boys too for there was a low stir among them though no one spoke a word
i am surprised steerforthalthough your candour does you honour said mr creakle does you honour certainlyi am surprised steerforth i must say that you should attach such an epithet to any person employed and paid in salem house sir steerforth gave a short laugh
thats not an answer sir said mr creakle to my remark
i expect more than that from you steerforth if mr mell looked homely in my eyes before the handsome boy it would be quite impossible to say how homely mr creakle looked
let him deny it said steerforth
deny that he is a beggar steerforth cried mr creakle
why where does he go abegging if he is not a beggar himself his near relations one said steerforth
its all the same he glanced at me and mr mells hand gently patted me upon the shoulder
i looked up with a flush upon my face and remorse in my heart but mr mells eyes were fixed on steerforth
he continued to pat me kindly on the shoulder but he looked at him
since you expect me mr creakle to justify myself said steerforth and to say what i meanwhat i have to say is that his mother lives on charity in an almshouse mr mell still looked at him and still patted me kindly on the shoulder and said to himself in a whisper if i heard right yes i thought so mr creakle turned to his assistant with a severe frown and laboured politeness now you hear what this gentleman says mr mell
have the goodness if you please to set him right before the assembled school he is right sir without correction returned mr mell in the midst of a dead silence what he has said is true be so good then as declare publicly will you said mr creakle putting his head on one side and rolling his eyes round the school whether it ever came to my knowledge until this moment i believe not directly he returned
why you know not said mr creakle
dont you man i apprehend you never supposed my worldly circumstances to be very good replied the assistant
you know what my position is and always has been here i apprehend if you come to that said mr creakle with his veins swelling again bigger than ever that youve been in a wrong position altogether and mistook this for a charity school
mr mell well part if you please
the sooner the better there is no time answered mr mell rising like the present sir to you said mr creakle
i take my leave of you mr creakle and all of you said mr mell glancing round the room and again patting me gently on the shoulders
james steerforth the best wish i can leave you is that you may come to be ashamed of what you have done today
at present i would prefer to see you anything rather than a friend to me or to anyone in whom i feel an interest once more he laid his hand upon my shoulder and then taking his flute and a few books from his desk and leaving the key in it for his successor he went out of the school with his property under his arm
mr creakle then made a speech through tungay in which he thanked steerforth for asserting though perhaps too warmly the independence and respectability of salem house and which he wound up by shaking hands with steerforth while we gave three cheersi did not quite know what for but i supposed for steerforth and so joined in them ardently though i felt miserable
mr creakle then caned tommy traddles for being discovered in tears instead of cheers on account of mr mells departure and went back to his sofa or his bed or wherever he had come from
we were left to ourselves now and looked very blank i recollect on one another
for myself i felt so much selfreproach and contrition for my part in what had happened that nothing would have enabled me to keep back my tears but the fear that steerforth who often looked at me i saw might think it unfriendlyor i should rather say considering our relative ages and the feeling with which i regarded him undutifulif i showed the emotion which distressed me
he was very angry with traddles and said he was glad he had caught it
poor traddles who had passed the stage of lying with his head upon the desk and was relieving himself as usual with a burst of skeletons said he didnt care
mr mell was illused
who has illused him you girl said steerforth
why you have returned traddles
what have i done said steerforth
what have you done retorted traddles
hurt his feelings and lost him his situation his feelings repeated steerforth disdainfully
his feelings will soon get the better of it ill be bound
his feelings are not like yours miss traddles
as to his situationwhich was a precious one wasnt itdo you suppose i am not going to write home and take care that he gets some money
polly we thought this intention very noble in steerforth whose mother was a widow and rich and would do almost anything it was said that he asked her
we were all extremely glad to see traddles so put down and exalted steerforth to the skies especially when he told us as he condescended to do that what he had done had been done expressly for us and for our cause and that he had conferred a great boon upon us by unselfishly doing it
but i must say that when i was going on with a story in the dark that night mr mells old flute seemed more than once to sound mournfully in my ears and that when at last steerforth was tired and i lay down in my bed i fancied it playing so sorrowfully somewhere that i was quite wretched
i soon forgot him in the contemplation of steerforth who in an easy amateur way and without any book he seemed to me to know everything by heart took some of his classes until a new master was found
the new master came from a grammar school and before he entered on his duties dined in the parlour one day to be introduced to steerforth
steerforth approved of him highly and told us he was a brick
without exactly understanding what learned distinction was meant by this i respected him greatly for it and had no doubt whatever of his superior knowledge though he never took the pains with menot that i was anybodythat mr mell had taken
there was only one other event in this halfyear out of the daily schoollife that made an impression upon me which still survives
it survives for many reasons
one afternoon when we were all harassed into a state of dire confusion and mr creakle was laying about him dreadfully tungay came in and called out in his usual strong way visitors for copperfield a few words were interchanged between him and mr creakle as who the visitors were and what room they were to be shown into and then i who had according to custom stood up on the announcement being made and felt quite faint with astonishment was told to go by the back stairs and get a clean frill on before i repaired to the diningroom
these orders i obeyed in such a flutter and hurry of my young spirits as i had never known before and when i got to the parlour door and the thought came into my head that it might be my motheri had only thought of mr or miss murdstone until theni drew back my hand from the lock and stopped to have a sob before i went in
at first i saw nobody but feeling a pressure against the door i looked round it and there to my amazement were mr peggotty and ham ducking at me with their hats and squeezing one another against the wall
i could not help laughing but it was much more in the pleasure of seeing them than at the appearance they made
we shook hands in a very cordial way and i laughed and laughed until i pulled out my pockethandkerchief and wiped my eyes
mr peggotty who never shut his mouth once i remember during the visit showed great concern when he saw me do this and nudged ham to say something
cheer up masr davy bor said ham in his simpering way
why how you have growed am i grown i said drying my eyes
i was not crying at anything in particular that i know of but somehow it made me cry to see old friends
growed masr davy bor
aint he growed said ham
aint he growed said mr peggotty
they made me laugh again by laughing at each other and then we all three laughed until i was in danger of crying again
do you know how mama is mr peggotty i said
and how my dear dear old peggotty is oncommon said mr peggotty
and little emly and mrs gummidge oncommon said mr peggotty
there was a silence
mr peggotty to relieve it took two prodigious lobsters and an enormous crab and a large canvas bag of shrimps out of his pockets and piled them up in hams arms
you see said mr peggotty knowing as you was partial to a little relish with your wittles when you was along with us we took the liberty
the old mawther biled em she did
mrs gummidge biled em
yes said mr peggotty slowly who i thought appeared to stick to the subject on account of having no other subject ready mrs
gummidge i do assure you she biled em i expressed my thanks and mr peggotty after looking at ham who stood smiling sheepishly over the shellfish without making any attempt to help him said we come you see the wind and tide making in our favour in one of our yarmouth lugs to gravesen
my sister she wrote to me the name of this here place and wrote to me as if ever i chanced to come to gravesen i was to come over and inquire for masr davy and give her dooty humbly wishing him well and reporting of the famly as they was oncommon toebesure
little emly you see shell write to my sister when i go back as i see you and as you was similarly oncommon and so we make it quite a merrygorounder i was obliged to consider a little before i understood what mr peggotty meant by this figure expressive of a complete circle of intelligence
i then thanked him heartily and said with a consciousness of reddening that i supposed little emly was altered too since we used to pick up shells and pebbles on the beach
shes getting to be a woman thats wot shes getting to be said mr peggotty
ask him he meant ham who beamed with delight and assent over the bag of shrimps
her pretty face said mr peggotty with his own shining like a light
her learning said ham
her writing said mr peggotty
why its as black as jet
and so large it is you might see it anywheres it was perfectly delightful to behold with what enthusiasm mr peggotty became inspired when he thought of his little favourite
he stands before me again his bluff hairy face irradiating with a joyful love and pride for which i can find no description
his honest eyes fire up and sparkle as if their depths were stirred by something bright
his broad chest heaves with pleasure
his strong loose hands clench themselves in his earnestness and he emphasizes what he says with a right arm that shows in my pigmy view like a sledgehammer
ham was quite as earnest as he
i dare say they would have said much more about her if they had not been abashed by the unexpected coming in of steerforth who seeing me in a corner speaking with two strangers stopped in a song he was singing and said i didnt know you were here young copperfield for it was not the usual visiting room and crossed by us on his way out
i am not sure whether it was in the pride of having such a friend as steerforth or in the desire to explain to him how i came to have such a friend as mr peggotty that i called to him as he was going away
but i said modestlygood heaven how it all comes back to me this long time afterwards
dont go steerforth if you please
these are two yarmouth boatmenvery kind good peoplewho are relations of my nurse and have come from gravesend to see me aye aye said steerforth returning
i am glad to see them
how are you both there was an ease in his mannera gay and light manner it was but not swaggeringwhich i still believe to have borne a kind of enchantment with it
i still believe him in virtue of this carriage his animal spirits his delightful voice his handsome face and figure and for aught i know of some inborn power of attraction besides which i think a few people possess to have carried a spell with him to which it was a natural weakness to yield and which not many persons could withstand
i could not but see how pleased they were with him and how they seemed to open their hearts to him in a moment
you must let them know at home if you please mr peggotty i said when that letter is sent that mr steerforth is very kind to me and that i dont know what i should ever do here without him nonsense said steerforth laughing
you mustnt tell them anything of the sort and if mr steerforth ever comes into norfolk or suffolk mr peggotty i said while i am there you may depend upon it i shall bring him to yarmouth if he will let me to see your house
you never saw such a good house steerforth
its made out of a boat made out of a boat is it said steerforth
its the right sort of a house for such a thoroughbuilt boatman so tis sir so tis sir said ham grinning
youre right young genlmn
masr davy bor genlmns right
a thoroughbuilt boatman
hor hor
thats what he is too mr peggotty was no less pleased than his nephew though his modesty forbade him to claim a personal compliment so vociferously
well sir he said bowing and chuckling and tucking in the ends of his neckerchief at his breast i thankee sir i thankee
i do my endeavours in my line of life sir the best of men can do no more mr peggotty said steerforth
he had got his name already
ill pound it its wot you do yourself sir said mr peggotty shaking his head and wot you do wellright well
i thankee sir
im obleeged to you sir for your welcoming manner of me
im rough sir but im readyleast ways i hope im ready you unnerstand
my house aint much for to see sir but its hearty at your service if ever you should come along with masr davy to see it
im a reglar dodman i am said mr peggotty by which he meant snail and this was in allusion to his being slow to go for he had attempted to go after every sentence and had somehow or other come back again but i wish you both well and i wish you happy ham echoed this sentiment and we parted with them in the heartiest manner
i was almost tempted that evening to tell steerforth about pretty little emly but i was too timid of mentioning her name and too much afraid of his laughing at me
i remember that i thought a good deal and in an uneasy sort of way about mr peggotty having said that she was getting on to be a woman but i decided that was nonsense
we transported the shellfish or the relish as mr peggotty had modestly called it up into our room unobserved and made a great supper that evening
but traddles couldnt get happily out of it
he was too unfortunate even to come through a supper like anybody else
he was taken ill in the nightquite prostrate he wasin consequence of crab and after being drugged with black draughts and blue pills to an extent which demple whose father was a doctor said was enough to undermine a horses constitution received a caning and six chapters of greek testament for refusing to confess
the rest of the halfyear is a jumble in my recollection of the daily strife and struggle of our lives of the waning summer and the changing season of the frosty mornings when we were rung out of bed and the cold cold smell of the dark nights when we were rung into bed again of the evening schoolroom dimly lighted and indifferently warmed and the morning schoolroom which was nothing but a great shiveringmachine of the alternation of boiled beef with roast beef and boiled mutton with roast mutton of clods of breadandbutter dogseared lessonbooks cracked slates tearblotted copybooks canings rulerings haircuttings rainy sundays suetpuddings and a dirty atmosphere of ink surrounding all
i well remember though how the distant idea of the holidays after seeming for an immense time to be a stationary speck began to come towards us and to grow and grow
how from counting months we came to weeks and then to days and how i then began to be afraid that i should not be sent for and when i learnt from steerforth that i had been sent for and was certainly to go home had dim forebodings that i might break my leg first
how the breakingup day changed its place fast at last from the week after next to next week this week the day after tomorrow tomorrow today tonightwhen i was inside the yarmouth mail and going home
i had many a broken sleep inside the yarmouth mail and many an incoherent dream of all these things
but when i awoke at intervals the ground outside the window was not the playground of salem house and the sound in my ears was not the sound of mr creakle giving it to traddles but the sound of the coachman touching up the horses
when we arrived before day at the inn where the mail stopped which was not the inn where my friend the waiter lived i was shown up to a nice little bedroom with dolphin painted on the door
very cold i was i know notwithstanding the hot tea they had given me before a large fire downstairs and very glad i was to turn into the dolphins bed pull the dolphins blankets round my head and go to sleep
mr barkis the carrier was to call for me in the morning at nine oclock
i got up at eight a little giddy from the shortness of my nights rest and was ready for him before the appointed time
he received me exactly as if not five minutes had elapsed since we were last together and i had only been into the hotel to get change for sixpence or something of that sort
as soon as i and my box were in the cart and the carrier seated the lazy horse walked away with us all at his accustomed pace
you look very well mr barkis i said thinking he would like to know it
mr barkis rubbed his cheek with his cuff and then looked at his cuff as if he expected to find some of the bloom upon it but made no other acknowledgement of the compliment
i gave your message mr barkis i said i wrote to peggotty ah said mr barkis
mr barkis seemed gruff and answered drily
wasnt it right mr barkis i asked after a little hesitation
why no said mr barkis
not the message the message was right enough perhaps said mr barkis but it come to an end there not understanding what he meant i repeated inquisitively came to an end mr barkis nothing come of it he explained looking at me sideways
no answer there was an answer expected was there mr barkis said i opening my eyes
for this was a new light to me
when a man says hes willin said mr barkis turning his glance slowly on me again its as much as to say that mans awaitin for a answer well mr barkis well said mr barkis carrying his eyes back to his horses ears that mans been awaitin for a answer ever since have you told her so mr barkis nono growled mr barkis reflecting about it
i aint got no call to go and tell her so
i never said six words to her myself i aint agoin to tell her so would you like me to do it mr barkis said i doubtfully
you might tell her if you would said mr barkis with another slow look at me that barkis was awaitin for a answer
says youwhat name is it her name ah said mr barkis with a nod of his head
peggotty chrisen name
or natral name said mr barkis
oh its not her christian name
her christian name is clara is it though said mr barkis
he seemed to find an immense fund of reflection in this circumstance and sat pondering and inwardly whistling for some time
well he resumed at length
says you peggotty
barkis is waitin for a answer says she perhaps answer to what says you to what i told you what is that says she
barkis is willin says you this extremely artful suggestion mr barkis accompanied with a nudge of his elbow that gave me quite a stitch in my side
after that he slouched over his horse in his usual manner and made no other reference to the subject except half an hour afterwards taking a piece of chalk from his pocket and writing up inside the tilt of the cart clara peggottyapparently as a private memorandum
ah what a strange feeling it was to be going home when it was not home and to find that every object i looked at reminded me of the happy old home which was like a dream i could never dream again
the days when my mother and i and peggotty were all in all to one another and there was no one to come between us rose up before me so sorrowfully on the road that i am not sure i was glad to be therenot sure but that i would rather have remained away and forgotten it in steerforths company
but there i was and soon i was at our house where the bare old elmtrees wrung their many hands in the bleak wintry air and shreds of the old rooksnests drifted away upon the wind
the carrier put my box down at the gardengate and left me
i walked along the path towards the house glancing at the windows and fearing at every step to see mr murdstone or miss murdstone lowering out of one of them
no face appeared however and being come to the house and knowing how to open the door before dark without knocking i went in with a quiet timid step
god knows how infantine the memory may have been that was awakened within me by the sound of my mothers voice in the old parlour when i set foot in the hall
she was singing in a low tone
i think i must have lain in her arms and heard her singing so to me when i was but a baby
the strain was new to me and yet it was so old that it filled my heart brimfull like a friend come back from a long absence
i believed from the solitary and thoughtful way in which my mother murmured her song that she was alone
and i went softly into the room
she was sitting by the fire suckling an infant whose tiny hand she held against her neck
her eyes were looking down upon its face and she sat singing to it
i was so far right that she had no other companion
i spoke to her and she started and cried out
but seeing me she called me her dear davy her own boy
and coming half across the room to meet me kneeled down upon the ground and kissed me and laid my head down on her bosom near the little creature that was nestling there and put its hand to my lips
i wish i had died
i wish i had died then with that feeling in my heart
i should have been more fit for heaven than i ever have been since
he is your brother said my mother fondling me
davy my pretty boy
my poor child then she kissed me more and more and clasped me round the neck
this she was doing when peggotty came running in and bounced down on the ground beside us and went mad about us both for a quarter of an hour
it seemed that i had not been expected so soon the carrier being much before his usual time
it seemed too that mr and miss murdstone had gone out upon a visit in the neighbourhood and would not return before night
i had never hoped for this
i had never thought it possible that we three could be together undisturbed once more and i felt for the time as if the old days were come back
we dined together by the fireside
peggotty was in attendance to wait upon us but my mother wouldnt let her do it and made her dine with us
i had my own old plate with a brown view of a manofwar in full sail upon it which peggotty had hoarded somewhere all the time i had been away and would not have had broken she said for a hundred pounds
i had my own old mug with david on it and my own old little knife and fork that wouldnt cut
while we were at table i thought it a favourable occasion to tell peggotty about mr barkis who before i had finished what i had to tell her began to laugh and throw her apron over her face
peggotty said my mother
whats the matter peggotty only laughed the more and held her apron tight over her face when my mother tried to pull it away and sat as if her head were in a bag
what are you doing you stupid creature said my mother laughing
oh drat the man cried peggotty
he wants to marry me it would be a very good match for you wouldnt it said my mother
oh
i dont know said peggotty
dont ask me
i wouldnt have him if he was made of gold
nor i wouldnt have anybody then why dont you tell him so you ridiculous thing said my mother
tell him so retorted peggotty looking out of her apron
he has never said a word to me about it
he knows better
if he was to make so bold as say a word to me i should slap his face her own was as red as ever i saw it or any other face i think but she only covered it again for a few moments at a time when she was taken with a violent fit of laughter and after two or three of those attacks went on with her dinner
i remarked that my mother though she smiled when peggotty looked at her became more serious and thoughtful
i had seen at first that she was changed
her face was very pretty still but it looked careworn and too delicate and her hand was so thin and white that it seemed to me to be almost transparent
but the change to which i now refer was superadded to this it was in her manner which became anxious and fluttered
at last she said putting out her hand and laying it affectionately on the hand of her old servant peggotty dear you are not going to be married me maam returned peggotty staring
lord bless you no not just yet said my mother tenderly
never cried peggotty
my mother took her hand and said dont leave me peggotty
stay with me
it will not be for long perhaps
what should i ever do without you me leave you my precious cried peggotty
not for all the world and his wife
why whats put that in your silly little headfor peggotty had been used of old to talk to my mother sometimes like a child
but my mother made no answer except to thank her and peggotty went running on in her own fashion
me leave you
i think i see myself
peggotty go away from you
i should like to catch her at it
no no no said peggotty shaking her head and folding her arms not she my dear
it isnt that there aint some cats that would be well enough pleased if she did but they shant be pleased
they shall be aggravated
ill stay with you till i am a cross cranky old woman
and when im too deaf and too lame and too blind and too mumbly for want of teeth to be of any use at all even to be found fault with than i shall go to my davy and ask him to take me in and peggotty says i i shall be glad to see you and ill make you as welcome as a queen bless your dear heart cried peggotty
i know you will and she kissed me beforehand in grateful acknowledgement of my hospitality
after that she covered her head up with her apron again and had another laugh about mr barkis
after that she took the baby out of its little cradle and nursed it
after that she cleared the dinner table after that came in with another cap on and her workbox and the yardmeasure and the bit of waxcandle all just the same as ever
we sat round the fire and talked delightfully
i told them what a hard master mr creakle was and they pitied me very much
i told them what a fine fellow steerforth was and what a patron of mine and peggotty said she would walk a score of miles to see him
i took the little baby in my arms when it was awake and nursed it lovingly
when it was asleep again i crept close to my mothers side according to my old custom broken now a long time and sat with my arms embracing her waist and my little red cheek on her shoulder and once more felt her beautiful hair drooping over melike an angels wing as i used to think i recollectand was very happy indeed
while i sat thus looking at the fire and seeing pictures in the redhot coals i almost believed that i had never been away that mr and miss murdstone were such pictures and would vanish when the fire got low and that there was nothing real in all that i remembered save my mother peggotty and i peggotty darned away at a stocking as long as she could see and then sat with it drawn on her left hand like a glove and her needle in her right ready to take another stitch whenever there was a blaze
i cannot conceive whose stockings they can have been that peggotty was always darning or where such an unfailing supply of stockings in want of darning can have come from
from my earliest infancy she seems to have been always employed in that class of needlework and never by any chance in any other
i wonder said peggotty who was sometimes seized with a fit of wondering on some most unexpected topic whats become of davys greataunt lor peggotty observed my mother rousing herself from a reverie what nonsense you talk well but i really do wonder maam said peggotty
what can have put such a person in your head inquired my mother
is there nobody else in the world to come there i dont know how it is said peggotty unless its on account of being stupid but my head never can pick and choose its people
they come and they go and they dont come and they dont go just as they like
i wonder whats become of her how absurd you are peggotty returned my mother
one would suppose you wanted a second visit from her lord forbid cried peggotty
well then dont talk about such uncomfortable things theres a good soul said my mother
miss betsey is shut up in her cottage by the sea no doubt and will remain there
at all events she is not likely ever to trouble us again no mused peggotty
no that aint likely at alli wonder if she was to die whether shed leave davy anything good gracious me peggotty returned my mother what a nonsensical woman you are
when you know that she took offence at the poor dear boys ever being born at all i suppose she wouldnt be inclined to forgive him now hinted peggotty
why should she be inclined to forgive him now said my mother rather sharply
now that hes got a brother i mean said peggotty
my mother immediately began to cry and wondered how peggotty dared to say such a thing
as if this poor little innocent in its cradle had ever done any harm to you or anybody else you jealous thing said she
you had much better go and marry mr barkis the carrier
why dont you i should make miss murdstone happy if i was to said peggotty
what a bad disposition you have peggotty returned my mother
you are as jealous of miss murdstone as it is possible for a ridiculous creature to be
you want to keep the keys yourself and give out all the things i suppose
i shouldnt be surprised if you did
when you know that she only does it out of kindness and the best intentions
you know she does peggottyyou know it well peggotty muttered something to the effect of bother the best intentions and something else to the effect that there was a little too much of the best intentions going on
i know what you mean you cross thing said my mother
i understand you peggotty perfectly
you know i do and i wonder you dont colour up like fire
but one point at a time
miss murdstone is the point now peggotty and you shant escape from it
havent you heard her say over and over again that she thinks i am too thoughtless and tooaa pretty suggested peggotty
well returned my mother half laughing and if she is so silly as to say so can i be blamed for it no one says you can said peggotty
no i should hope not indeed returned my mother
havent you heard her say over and over again that on this account she wished to spare me a great deal of trouble which she thinks i am not suited for and which i really dont know myself that i am suited for and isnt she up early and late and going to and fro continuallyand doesnt she do all sorts of things and grope into all sorts of places coalholes and pantries and i dont know where that cant be very agreeableand do you mean to insinuate that there is not a sort of devotion in that i dont insinuate at all said peggotty
you do peggotty returned my mother
you never do anything else except your work
you are always insinuating
you revel in it
and when you talk of mr murdstones good intentions i never talked of em said peggotty
no peggotty returned my mother but you insinuated
thats what i told you just now
thats the worst of you
you will insinuate
i said at the moment that i understood you and you see i did
when you talk of mr murdstones good intentions and pretend to slight them for i dont believe you really do in your heart peggotty you must be as well convinced as i am how good they are and how they actuate him in everything
if he seems to have been at all stern with a certain person peggottyyou understand and so i am sure does davy that i am not alluding to anybody presentit is solely because he is satisfied that it is for a certain persons benefit
he naturally loves a certain person on my account and acts solely for a certain persons good
he is better able to judge of it than i am for i very well know that i am a weak light girlish creature and that he is a firm grave serious man
and he takes said my mother with the tears which were engendered in her affectionate nature stealing down her face he takes great pains with me and i ought to be very thankful to him and very submissive to him even in my thoughts and when i am not peggotty i worry and condemn myself and feel doubtful of my own heart and dont know what to do peggotty sat with her chin on the foot of the stocking looking silently at the fire
there peggotty said my mother changing her tone dont let us fall out with one another for i couldnt bear it
you are my true friend i know if i have any in the world
when i call you a ridiculous creature or a vexatious thing or anything of that sort peggotty i only mean that you are my true friend and always have been ever since the night when mr copperfield first brought me home here and you came out to the gate to meet me peggotty was not slow to respond and ratify the treaty of friendship by giving me one of her best hugs
i think i had some glimpses of the real character of this conversation at the time but i am sure now that the good creature originated it and took her part in it merely that my mother might comfort herself with the little contradictory summary in which she had indulged
the design was efficacious for i remember that my mother seemed more at ease during the rest of the evening and that peggotty observed her less
when we had had our tea and the ashes were thrown up and the candles snuffed i read peggotty a chapter out of the crocodile book in remembrance of old timesshe took it out of her pocket i dont know whether she had kept it there ever sinceand then we talked about salem house which brought me round again to steerforth who was my great subject
we were very happy and that evening as the last of its race and destined evermore to close that volume of my life will never pass out of my memory
it was almost ten oclock before we heard the sound of wheels
we all got up then and my mother said hurriedly that as it was so late and mr and miss murdstone approved of early hours for young people perhaps i had better go to bed
i kissed her and went upstairs with my candle directly before they came in
it appeared to my childish fancy as i ascended to the bedroom where i had been imprisoned that they brought a cold blast of air into the house which blew away the old familiar feeling like a feather
i felt uncomfortable about going down to breakfast in the morning as i had never set eyes on mr murdstone since the day when i committed my memorable offence
however as it must be done i went down after two or three false starts halfway and as many runs back on tiptoe to my own room and presented myself in the parlour
he was standing before the fire with his back to it while miss murdstone made the tea
he looked at me steadily as i entered but made no sign of recognition whatever
i went up to him after a moment of confusion and said i beg your pardon sir
i am very sorry for what i did and i hope you will forgive me i am glad to hear you are sorry david he replied
the hand he gave me was the hand i had bitten
i could not restrain my eye from resting for an instant on a red spot upon it but it was not so red as i turned when i met that sinister expression in his face
how do you do maam i said to miss murdstone
ah dear me sighed miss murdstone giving me the teacaddy scoop instead of her fingers
how long are the holidays a month maam counting from when from today maam oh said miss murdstone
then heres one day off she kept a calendar of the holidays in this way and every morning checked a day off in exactly the same manner
she did it gloomily until she came to ten but when she got into two figures she became more hopeful and as the time advanced even jocular
it was on this very first day that i had the misfortune to throw her though she was not subject to such weakness in general into a state of violent consternation
i came into the room where she and my mother were sitting and the baby who was only a few weeks old being on my mothers lap i took it very carefully in my arms
suddenly miss murdstone gave such a scream that i all but dropped it
my dear jane cried my mother
good heavens clara do you see exclaimed miss murdstone
see what my dear jane said my mother where hes got it cried miss murdstone
the boy has got the baby she was limp with horror but stiffened herself to make a dart at me and take it out of my arms
then she turned faint and was so very ill that they were obliged to give her cherry brandy
i was solemnly interdicted by her on her recovery from touching my brother any more on any pretence whatever and my poor mother who i could see wished otherwise meekly confirmed the interdict by saying no doubt you are right my dear jane on another occasion when we three were together this same dear babyit was truly dear to me for our mothers sakewas the innocent occasion of miss murdstones going into a passion
my mother who had been looking at its eyes as it lay upon her lap said davy
come here and looked at mine
i saw miss murdstone lay her beads down
i declare said my mother gently they are exactly alike
i suppose they are mine
i think they are the colour of mine
but they are wonderfully alike what are you talking about clara said miss murdstone
my dear jane faltered my mother a little abashed by the harsh tone of this inquiry i find that the babys eyes and davys are exactly alike clara said miss murdstone rising angrily you are a positive fool sometimes my dear jane remonstrated my mother
a positive fool said miss murdstone
who else could compare my brothers baby with your boy
they are not at all alike
they are exactly unlike
they are utterly dissimilar in all respects
i hope they will ever remain so
i will not sit here and hear such comparisons made with that she stalked out and made the door bang after her
in short i was not a favourite with miss murdstone
in short i was not a favourite there with anybody not even with myself for those who did like me could not show it and those who did not showed it so plainly that i had a sensitive consciousness of always appearing constrained boorish and dull
i felt that i made them as uncomfortable as they made me
if i came into the room where they were and they were talking together and my mother seemed cheerful an anxious cloud would steal over her face from the moment of my entrance
if mr murdstone were in his best humour i checked him
if miss murdstone were in her worst i intensified it
i had perception enough to know that my mother was the victim always that she was afraid to speak to me or to be kind to me lest she should give them some offence by her manner of doing so and receive a lecture afterwards that she was not only ceaselessly afraid of her own offending but of my offending and uneasily watched their looks if i only moved
therefore i resolved to keep myself as much out of their way as i could and many a wintry hour did i hear the church clock strike when i was sitting in my cheerless bedroom wrapped in my little greatcoat poring over a book
in the evening sometimes i went and sat with peggotty in the kitchen
there i was comfortable and not afraid of being myself
but neither of these resources was approved of in the parlour
the tormenting humour which was dominant there stopped them both
i was still held to be necessary to my poor mothers training and as one of her trials could not be suffered to absent myself
david said mr murdstone one day after dinner when i was going to leave the room as usual i am sorry to observe that you are of a sullen disposition as sulky as a bear said miss murdstone
i stood still and hung my head
now david said mr murdstone a sullen obdurate disposition is of all tempers the worst and the boys is of all such dispositions that ever i have seen remarked his sister the most confirmed and stubborn
i think my dear clara even you must observe it i beg your pardon my dear jane said my mother but are you quite surei am certain youll excuse me my dear janethat you understand davy i should be somewhat ashamed of myself clara returned miss murdstone if i could not understand the boy or any boy
i dont profess to be profound but i do lay claim to common sense no doubt my dear jane returned my mother your understanding is very vigorous oh dear no
pray dont say that clara interposed miss murdstone angrily
but i am sure it is resumed my mother and everybody knows it is
i profit so much by it myself in many waysat least i ought tothat no one can be more convinced of it than myself and therefore i speak with great diffidence my dear jane i assure you well say i dont understand the boy clara returned miss murdstone arranging the little fetters on her wrists
well agree if you please that i dont understand him at all
he is much too deep for me
but perhaps my brothers penetration may enable him to have some insight into his character
and i believe my brother was speaking on the subject when wenot very decentlyinterrupted him i think clara said mr murdstone in a low grave voice that there may be better and more dispassionate judges of such a question than you edward replied my mother timidly you are a far better judge of all questions than i pretend to be
both you and jane are
i only said you only said something weak and inconsiderate he replied
try not to do it again my dear clara and keep a watch upon yourself my mothers lips moved as if she answered yes my dear edward but she said nothing aloud
i was sorry david i remarked said mr murdstone turning his head and his eyes stiffly towards me to observe that you are of a sullen disposition
this is not a character that i can suffer to develop itself beneath my eyes without an effort at improvement
you must endeavour sir to change it
we must endeavour to change it for you i beg your pardon sir i faltered
i have never meant to be sullen since i came back dont take refuge in a lie sir he returned so fiercely that i saw my mother involuntarily put out her trembling hand as if to interpose between us
you have withdrawn yourself in your sullenness to your own room
you have kept your own room when you ought to have been here
you know now once for all that i require you to be here and not there
further that i require you to bring obedience here
you know me david
i will have it done miss murdstone gave a hoarse chuckle
i will have a respectful prompt and ready bearing towards myself he continued and towards jane murdstone and towards your mother
i will not have this room shunned as if it were infected at the pleasure of a child
sit down he ordered me like a dog and i obeyed like a dog
one thing more he said
i observe that you have an attachment to low and common company
you are not to associate with servants
the kitchen will not improve you in the many respects in which you need improvement
of the woman who abets you i say nothingsince you clara addressing my mother in a lower voice from old associations and longestablished fancies have a weakness respecting her which is not yet overcome a most unaccountable delusion it is cried miss murdstone
i only say he resumed addressing me that i disapprove of your preferring such company as mistress peggotty and that it is to be abandoned
now david you understand me and you know what will be the consequence if you fail to obey me to the letter i knew wellbetter perhaps than he thought as far as my poor mother was concernedand i obeyed him to the letter
i retreated to my own room no more i took refuge with peggotty no more but sat wearily in the parlour day after day looking forward to night and bedtime
what irksome constraint i underwent sitting in the same attitude hours upon hours afraid to move an arm or a leg lest miss murdstone should complain as she did on the least pretence of my restlessness and afraid to move an eye lest she should light on some look of dislike or scrutiny that would find new cause for complaint in mine
what intolerable dulness to sit listening to the ticking of the clock and watching miss murdstones little shiny steel beads as she strung them and wondering whether she would ever be married and if so to what sort of unhappy man and counting the divisions in the moulding of the chimneypiece and wandering away with my eyes to the ceiling among the curls and corkscrews in the paper on the wall
what walks i took alone down muddy lanes in the bad winter weather carrying that parlour and mr and miss murdstone in it everywhere a monstrous load that i was obliged to bear a daymare that there was no possibility of breaking in a weight that brooded on my wits and blunted them
what meals i had in silence and embarrassment always feeling that there were a knife and fork too many and that mine an appetite too many and that mine a plate and chair too many and those mine a somebody too many and that i
what evenings when the candles came and i was expected to employ myself but not daring to read an entertaining book pored over some hardheaded harderhearted treatise on arithmetic when the tables of weights and measures set themselves to tunes as rule britannia or away with melancholy when they wouldnt stand still to be learnt but would go threading my grandmothers needle through my unfortunate head in at one ear and out at the other
what yawns and dozes i lapsed into in spite of all my care what starts i came out of concealed sleeps with what answers i never got to little observations that i rarely made what a blank space i seemed which everybody overlooked and yet was in everybodys way what a heavy relief it was to hear miss murdstone hail the first stroke of nine at night and order me to bed
thus the holidays lagged away until the morning came when miss murdstone said heres the last day off and gave me the closing cup of tea of the vacation
i was not sorry to go
i had lapsed into a stupid state but i was recovering a little and looking forward to steerforth albeit mr creakle loomed behind him
again mr barkis appeared at the gate and again miss murdstone in her warning voice said clara when my mother bent over me to bid me farewell
i kissed her and my baby brother and was very sorry then but not sorry to go away for the gulf between us was there and the parting was there every day
and it is not so much the embrace she gave me that lives in my mind though it was as fervent as could be as what followed the embrace
i was in the carriers cart when i heard her calling to me
i looked out and she stood at the gardengate alone holding her baby up in her arms for me to see
it was cold still weather and not a hair of her head nor a fold of her dress was stirred as she looked intently at me holding up her child
so i lost her
so i saw her afterwards in my sleep at schoola silent presence near my bedlooking at me with the same intent faceholding up her baby in her arms
i pass over all that happened at school until the anniversary of my birthday came round in march
except that steerforth was more to be admired than ever i remember nothing
he was going away at the end of the halfyear if not sooner and was more spirited and independent than before in my eyes and therefore more engaging than before but beyond this i remember nothing
the great remembrance by which that time is marked in my mind seems to have swallowed up all lesser recollections and to exist alone
it is even difficult for me to believe that there was a gap of full two months between my return to salem house and the arrival of that birthday
i can only understand that the fact was so because i know it must have been so otherwise i should feel convinced that there was no interval and that the one occasion trod upon the others heels
how well i recollect the kind of day it was
i smell the fog that hung about the place i see the hoar frost ghostly through it i feel my rimy hair fall clammy on my cheek i look along the dim perspective of the schoolroom with a sputtering candle here and there to light up the foggy morning and the breath of the boys wreathing and smoking in the raw cold as they blow upon their fingers and tap their feet upon the floor
it was after breakfast and we had been summoned in from the playground when mr sharp entered and said david copperfield is to go into the parlour i expected a hamper from peggotty and brightened at the order
some of the boys about me put in their claim not to be forgotten in the distribution of the good things as i got out of my seat with great alacrity
dont hurry david said mr sharp
theres time enough my boy dont hurry i might have been surprised by the feeling tone in which he spoke if i had given it a thought but i gave it none until afterwards
i hurried away to the parlour and there i found mr creakle sitting at his breakfast with the cane and a newspaper before him and mrs creakle with an opened letter in her hand
but no hamper
david copperfield said mrs creakle leading me to a sofa and sitting down beside me
i want to speak to you very particularly
i have something to tell you my child mr creakle at whom of course i looked shook his head without looking at me and stopped up a sigh with a very large piece of buttered toast
you are too young to know how the world changes every day said mrs creakle and how the people in it pass away
but we all have to learn it david some of us when we are young some of us when we are old some of us at all times of our lives i looked at her earnestly
when you came away from home at the end of the vacation said mrs creakle after a pause were they all well after another pause was your mama well i trembled without distinctly knowing why and still looked at her earnestly making no attempt to answer
because said she i grieve to tell you that i hear this morning your mama is very ill a mist rose between mrs creakle and me and her figure seemed to move in it for an instant
then i felt the burning tears run down my face and it was steady again
she is very dangerously ill she added
i knew all now
she is dead there was no need to tell me so
i had already broken out into a desolate cry and felt an orphan in the wide world
she was very kind to me
she kept me there all day and left me alone sometimes and i cried and wore myself to sleep and awoke and cried again
when i could cry no more i began to think and then the oppression on my breast was heaviest and my grief a dull pain that there was no ease for
and yet my thoughts were idle not intent on the calamity that weighed upon my heart but idly loitering near it
i thought of our house shut up and hushed
i thought of the little baby who mrs creakle said had been pining away for some time and who they believed would die too
i thought of my fathers grave in the churchyard by our house and of my mother lying there beneath the tree i knew so well
i stood upon a chair when i was left alone and looked into the glass to see how red my eyes were and how sorrowful my face
i considered after some hours were gone if my tears were really hard to flow now as they seemed to be what in connexion with my loss it would affect me most to think of when i drew near homefor i was going home to the funeral
i am sensible of having felt that a dignity attached to me among the rest of the boys and that i was important in my affliction
if ever child were stricken with sincere grief i was
but i remember that this importance was a kind of satisfaction to me when i walked in the playground that afternoon while the boys were in school
when i saw them glancing at me out of the windows as they went up to their classes i felt distinguished and looked more melancholy and walked slower
when school was over and they came out and spoke to me i felt it rather good in myself not to be proud to any of them and to take exactly the same notice of them all as before
i was to go home next night not by the mail but by the heavy nightcoach which was called the farmer and was principally used by countrypeople travelling short intermediate distances upon the road
we had no storytelling that evening and traddles insisted on lending me his pillow
i dont know what good he thought it would do me for i had one of my own but it was all he had to lend poor fellow except a sheet of letterpaper full of skeletons and that he gave me at parting as a soother of my sorrows and a contribution to my peace of mind
i left salem house upon the morrow afternoon
i little thought then that i left it never to return
we travelled very slowly all night and did not get into yarmouth before nine or ten oclock in the morning
i looked out for mr barkis but he was not there and instead of him a fat shortwinded merrylooking little old man in black with rusty little bunches of ribbons at the knees of his breeches black stockings and a broadbrimmed hat came puffing up to the coach window and said master copperfield yes sir will you come with me young sir if you please he said opening the door and i shall have the pleasure of taking you home i put my hand in his wondering who he was and we walked away to a shop in a narrow street on which was written omer draper tailor haberdasher funeral furnisher c it was a close and stifling little shop full of all sorts of clothing made and unmade including one window full of beaverhats and bonnets
we went into a little backparlour behind the shop where we found three young women at work on a quantity of black materials which were heaped upon the table and little bits and cuttings of which were littered all over the floor
there was a good fire in the room and a breathless smell of warm black crapei did not know what the smell was then but i know now
the three young women who appeared to be very industrious and comfortable raised their heads to look at me and then went on with their work
stitch stitch stitch
at the same time there came from a workshop across a little yard outside the window a regular sound of hammering that kept a kind of tune rattattat rattattat rattattat without any variation
well said my conductor to one of the three young women
how do you get on minnie we shall be ready by the tryingon time she replied gaily without looking up
dont you be afraid father mr omer took off his broadbrimmed hat and sat down and panted
he was so fat that he was obliged to pant some time before he could say thats right father said minnie playfully
what a porpoise you do grow well i dont know how it is my dear he replied considering about it
i am rather so you are such a comfortable man you see said minnie
you take things so easy no use taking em otherwise my dear said mr omer
no indeed returned his daughter
we are all pretty gay here thank heaven
aint we father i hope so my dear said mr omer
as i have got my breath now i think ill measure this young scholar
would you walk into the shop master copperfield i preceded mr omer in compliance with his request and after showing me a roll of cloth which he said was extra super and too good mourning for anything short of parents he took my various dimensions and put them down in a book
while he was recording them he called my attention to his stock in trade and to certain fashions which he said had just come up and to certain other fashions which he said had just gone out
and by that sort of thing we very often lose a little mint of money said mr omer
but fashions are like human beings
they come in nobody knows when why or how and they go out nobody knows when why or how
everything is like life in my opinion if you look at it in that point of view i was too sorrowful to discuss the question which would possibly have been beyond me under any circumstances and mr omer took me back into the parlour breathing with some difficulty on the way
he then called down a little breakneck range of steps behind a door bring up that tea and breadandbutter which after some time during which i sat looking about me and thinking and listening to the stitching in the room and the tune that was being hammered across the yard appeared on a tray and turned out to be for me
i have been acquainted with you said mr omer after watching me for some minutes during which i had not made much impression on the breakfast for the black things destroyed my appetite i have been acquainted with you a long time my young friend have you sir all your life said mr omer
i may say before it
i knew your father before you
he was five foot nine and a half and he lays in fiveandtwenty foot of ground rattattat rattattat rattattat across the yard
he lays in five and twenty foot of ground if he lays in a fraction said mr omer pleasantly
it was either his request or her direction i forget which do you know how my little brother is sir i inquired
mr omer shook his head
rattattat rattattat rattattat he is in his mothers arms said he
oh poor little fellow
is he dead dont mind it more than you can help said mr omer
yes
the babys dead my wounds broke out afresh at this intelligence
i left the scarcelytasted breakfast and went and rested my head on another table in a corner of the little room which minnie hastily cleared lest i should spot the mourning that was lying there with my tears
she was a pretty goodnatured girl and put my hair away from my eyes with a soft kind touch but she was very cheerful at having nearly finished her work and being in good time and was so different from me
presently the tune left off and a goodlooking young fellow came across the yard into the room
he had a hammer in his hand and his mouth was full of little nails which he was obliged to take out before he could speak
well joram said mr omer
how do you get on all right said joram
done sir minnie coloured a little and the other two girls smiled at one another
what
you were at it by candlelight last night when i was at the club then
were you said mr omer shutting up one eye
yes said joram
as you said we could make a little trip of it and go over together if it was done minnie and meand you oh
i thought you were going to leave me out altogether said mr omer laughing till he coughed
as you was so good as to say that resumed the young man why i turned to with a will you see
will you give me your opinion of it i will said mr omer rising
my dear and he stopped and turned to me would you like to see your no father minnie interposed
i thought it might be agreeable my dear said mr omer
but perhaps youre right i cant say how i knew it was my dear dear mothers coffin that they went to look at
i had never heard one making i had never seen one that i know ofbut it came into my mind what the noise was while it was going on and when the young man entered i am sure i knew what he had been doing
the work being now finished the two girls whose names i had not heard brushed the shreds and threads from their dresses and went into the shop to put that to rights and wait for customers
minnie stayed behind to fold up what they had made and pack it in two baskets
this she did upon her knees humming a lively little tune the while
joram who i had no doubt was her lover came in and stole a kiss from her while she was busy he didnt appear to mind me at all and said her father was gone for the chaise and he must make haste and get himself ready
then he went out again and then she put her thimble and scissors in her pocket and stuck a needle threaded with black thread neatly in the bosom of her gown and put on her outer clothing smartly at a little glass behind the door in which i saw the reflection of her pleased face
all this i observed sitting at the table in the corner with my head leaning on my hand and my thoughts running on very different things
the chaise soon came round to the front of the shop and the baskets being put in first i was put in next and those three followed
i remember it as a kind of half chaisecart half pianofortevan painted of a sombre colour and drawn by a black horse with a long tail
there was plenty of room for us all
i do not think i have ever experienced so strange a feeling in my life i am wiser now perhaps as that of being with them remembering how they had been employed and seeing them enjoy the ride
i was not angry with them i was more afraid of them as if i were cast away among creatures with whom i had no community of nature
they were very cheerful
the old man sat in front to drive and the two young people sat behind him and whenever he spoke to them leaned forward the one on one side of his chubby face and the other on the other and made a great deal of him
they would have talked to me too but i held back and moped in my corner scared by their lovemaking and hilarity though it was far from boisterous and almost wondering that no judgement came upon them for their hardness of heart
so when they stopped to bait the horse and ate and drank and enjoyed themselves i could touch nothing that they touched but kept my fast unbroken
so when we reached home i dropped out of the chaise behind as quickly as possible that i might not be in their company before those solemn windows looking blindly on me like closed eyes once bright
and oh how little need i had had to think what would move me to tears when i came backseeing the window of my mothers room and next it that which in the better time was mine
i was in peggottys arms before i got to the door and she took me into the house
her grief burst out when she first saw me but she controlled it soon and spoke in whispers and walked softly as if the dead could be disturbed
she had not been in bed i found for a long time
she sat up at night still and watched
as long as her poor dear pretty was above the ground she said she would never desert her
mr murdstone took no heed of me when i went into the parlour where he was but sat by the fireside weeping silently and pondering in his elbowchair
miss murdstone who was busy at her writingdesk which was covered with letters and papers gave me her cold fingernails and asked me in an iron whisper if i had been measured for my mourning
i said yes and your shirts said miss murdstone have you brought em home yes maam
i have brought home all my clothes this was all the consolation that her firmness administered to me
i do not doubt that she had a choice pleasure in exhibiting what she called her selfcommand and her firmness and her strength of mind and her common sense and the whole diabolical catalogue of her unamiable qualities on such an occasion
she was particularly proud of her turn for business and she showed it now in reducing everything to pen and ink and being moved by nothing
all the rest of that day and from morning to night afterwards she sat at that desk scratching composedly with a hard pen speaking in the same imperturbable whisper to everybody never relaxing a muscle of her face or softening a tone of her voice or appearing with an atom of her dress astray
her brother took a book sometimes but never read it that i saw
he would open it and look at it as if he were reading but would remain for a whole hour without turning the leaf and then put it down and walk to and fro in the room
i used to sit with folded hands watching him and counting his footsteps hour after hour
he very seldom spoke to her and never to me
he seemed to be the only restless thing except the clocks in the whole motionless house
in these days before the funeral i saw but little of peggotty except that in passing up or down stairs i always found her close to the room where my mother and her baby lay and except that she came to me every night and sat by my beds head while i went to sleep
a day or two before the buriali think it was a day or two before but i am conscious of confusion in my mind about that heavy time with nothing to mark its progressshe took me into the room
i only recollect that underneath some white covering on the bed with a beautiful cleanliness and freshness all around it there seemed to me to lie embodied the solemn stillness that was in the house and that when she would have turned the cover gently back i cried oh no
oh no and held her hand
if the funeral had been yesterday i could not recollect it better
the very air of the best parlour when i went in at the door the bright condition of the fire the shining of the wine in the decanters the patterns of the glasses and plates the faint sweet smell of cake the odour of miss murdstones dress and our black clothes
mr chillip is in the room and comes to speak to me
and how is master david he says kindly
i cannot tell him very well
i give him my hand which he holds in his
dear me says mr chillip meekly smiling with something shining in his eye
our little friends grow up around us
they grow out of our knowledge maam this is to miss murdstone who makes no reply
there is a great improvement here maam says mr chillip
miss murdstone merely answers with a frown and a formal bend mr chillip discomfited goes into a corner keeping me with him and opens his mouth no more
i remark this because i remark everything that happens not because i care about myself or have done since i came home
and now the bell begins to sound and mr omer and another come to make us ready
as peggotty was wont to tell me long ago the followers of my father to the same grave were made ready in the same room
there are mr murdstone our neighbour mr grayper mr chillip and i
when we go out to the door the bearers and their load are in the garden and they move before us down the path and past the elms and through the gate and into the churchyard where i have so often heard the birds sing on a summer morning
we stand around the grave
the day seems different to me from every other day and the light not of the same colourof a sadder colour
now there is a solemn hush which we have brought from home with what is resting in the mould and while we stand bareheaded i hear the voice of the clergyman sounding remote in the open air and yet distinct and plain saying i am the resurrection and the life saith the lord then i hear sobs and standing apart among the lookerson i see that good and faithful servant whom of all the people upon earth i love the best and unto whom my childish heart is certain that the lord will one day say well done there are many faces that i know among the little crowd faces that i knew in church when mine was always wondering there faces that first saw my mother when she came to the village in her youthful bloom
i do not mind themi mind nothing but my griefand yet i see and know them all and even in the background far away see minnie looking on and her eye glancing on her sweetheart who is near me
it is over and the earth is filled in and we turn to come away
before us stands our house so pretty and unchanged so linked in my mind with the young idea of what is gone that all my sorrow has been nothing to the sorrow it calls forth
but they take me on and mr chillip talks to me and when we get home puts some water to my lips and when i ask his leave to go up to my room dismisses me with the gentleness of a woman
all this i say is yesterdays event
events of later date have floated from me to the shore where all forgotten things will reappear but this stands like a high rock in the ocean
i knew that peggotty would come to me in my room
the sabbath stillness of the time the day was so like sunday
i have forgotten that was suited to us both
she sat down by my side upon my little bed and holding my hand and sometimes putting it to her lips and sometimes smoothing it with hers as she might have comforted my little brother told me in her way all that she had to tell concerning what had happened
she was never well said peggotty for a long time
she was uncertain in her mind and not happy
when her baby was born i thought at first she would get better but she was more delicate and sunk a little every day
she used to like to sit alone before her baby came and then she cried but afterwards she used to sing to itso soft that i once thought when i heard her it was like a voice up in the air that was rising away
i think she got to be more timid and more frightenedlike of late and that a hard word was like a blow to her
but she was always the same to me
she never changed to her foolish peggotty didnt my sweet girl here peggotty stopped and softly beat upon my hand a little while
the last time that i saw her like her own old self was the night when you came home my dear
the day you went away she said to me i never shall see my pretty darling again
something tells me so that tells the truth i know she tried to hold up after that and many a time when they told her she was thoughtless and lighthearted made believe to be so but it was all a bygone then
she never told her husband what she had told meshe was afraid of saying it to anybody elsetill one night a little more than a week before it happened when she said to him my dear i think i am dying its off my mind now peggotty she told me when i laid her in her bed that night
he will believe it more and more poor fellow every day for a few days to come and then it will be past
i am very tired
if this is sleep sit by me while i sleep dont leave me
god bless both my children
god protect and keep my fatherless boy i never left her afterwards said peggotty
she often talked to them two downstairsfor she loved them she couldnt bear not to love anyone who was about herbut when they went away from her bedside she always turned to me as if there was rest where peggotty was and never fell asleep in any other way
on the last night in the evening she kissed me and said if my baby should die too peggotty please let them lay him in my arms and bury us together it was done for the poor lamb lived but a day beyond her
let my dearest boy go with us to our restingplace she said and tell him that his mother when she lay here blessed him not once but a thousand times another silence followed this and another gentle beating on my hand
it was pretty far in the night said peggotty when she asked me for some drink and when she had taken it gave me such a patient smile the dearso beautiful
daybreak had come and the sun was rising when she said to me how kind and considerate mr copperfield had always been to her and how he had borne with her and told her when she doubted herself that a loving heart was better and stronger than wisdom and that he was a happy man in hers
peggotty my dear she said then put me nearer to you for she was very weak
lay your good arm underneath my neck she said and turn me to you for your face is going far off and i want it to be near i put it as she asked and oh davy
the time had come when my first parting words to you were truewhen she was glad to lay her poor head on her stupid cross old peggottys armand she died like a child that had gone to sleep thus ended peggottys narration
from the moment of my knowing of the death of my mother the idea of her as she had been of late had vanished from me
i remembered her from that instant only as the young mother of my earliest impressions who had been used to wind her bright curls round and round her finger and to dance with me at twilight in the parlour
what peggotty had told me now was so far from bringing me back to the later period that it rooted the earlier image in my mind
it may be curious but it is true
in her death she winged her way back to her calm untroubled youth and cancelled all the rest
the mother who lay in the grave was the mother of my infancy the little creature in her arms was myself as i had once been hushed for ever on her bosom
the first act of business miss murdstone performed when the day of the solemnity was over and light was freely admitted into the house was to give peggotty a months warning
much as peggotty would have disliked such a service i believe she would have retained it for my sake in preference to the best upon earth
she told me we must part and told me why and we condoled with one another in all sincerity
as to me or my future not a word was said or a step taken
happy they would have been i dare say if they could have dismissed me at a months warning too
i mustered courage once to ask miss murdstone when i was going back to school and she answered dryly she believed i was not going back at all
i was told nothing more
i was very anxious to know what was going to be done with me and so was peggotty but neither she nor i could pick up any information on the subject
there was one change in my condition which while it relieved me of a great deal of present uneasiness might have made me if i had been capable of considering it closely yet more uncomfortable about the future
it was this
the constraint that had been put upon me was quite abandoned
i was so far from being required to keep my dull post in the parlour that on several occasions when i took my seat there miss murdstone frowned to me to go away
i was so far from being warned off from peggottys society that provided i was not in mr murdstones i was never sought out or inquired for
at first i was in daily dread of his taking my education in hand again or of miss murdstones devoting herself to it but i soon began to think that such fears were groundless and that all i had to anticipate was neglect
i do not conceive that this discovery gave me much pain then
i was still giddy with the shock of my mothers death and in a kind of stunned state as to all tributary things
i can recollect indeed to have speculated at odd times on the possibility of my not being taught any more or cared for any more and growing up to be a shabby moody man lounging an idle life away about the village as well as on the feasibility of my getting rid of this picture by going away somewhere like the hero in a story to seek my fortune but these were transient visions daydreams i sat looking at sometimes as if they were faintly painted or written on the wall of my room and which as they melted away left the wall blank again
peggotty i said in a thoughtful whisper one evening when i was warming my hands at the kitchen fire mr
murdstone likes me less than he used to
he never liked me much peggotty but he would rather not even see me now if he can help it perhaps its his sorrow said peggotty stroking my hair
i am sure peggotty i am sorry too
if i believed it was his sorrow i should not think of it at all
but its not that oh no its not that how do you know its not that said peggotty after a silence
oh his sorrow is another and quite a different thing
he is sorry at this moment sitting by the fireside with miss murdstone but if i was to go in peggotty he would be something besides what would he be said peggotty
angry i answered with an involuntary imitation of his dark frown
if he was only sorry he wouldnt look at me as he does
i am only sorry and it makes me feel kinder peggotty said nothing for a little while and i warmed my hands as silent as she
davy she said at length
yes peggotty i have tried my dear all ways i could think ofall the ways there are and all the ways there aint in shortto get a suitable service here in blunderstone but theres no such a thing my love and what do you mean to do peggotty says i wistfully
do you mean to go and seek your fortune i expect i shall be forced to go to yarmouth replied peggotty and live there you might have gone farther off i said brightening a little and been as bad as lost
i shall see you sometimes my dear old peggotty there
you wont be quite at the other end of the world will you contrary ways please god cried peggotty with great animation
as long as you are here my pet i shall come over every week of my life to see you
one day every week of my life i felt a great weight taken off my mind by this promise but even this was not all for peggotty went on to say im agoing davy you see to my brothers first for another fortnights visitjust till i have had time to look about me and get to be something like myself again
now i have been thinking that perhaps as they dont want you here at present you might be let to go along with me if anything short of being in a different relation to every one about me peggotty excepted could have given me a sense of pleasure at that time it would have been this project of all others
the idea of being again surrounded by those honest faces shining welcome on me of renewing the peacefulness of the sweet sunday morning when the bells were ringing the stones dropping in the water and the shadowy ships breaking through the mist of roaming up and down with little emly telling her my troubles and finding charms against them in the shells and pebbles on the beach made a calm in my heart
it was ruffled next moment to be sure by a doubt of miss murdstones giving her consent but even that was set at rest soon for she came out to take an evening grope in the storecloset while we were yet in conversation and peggotty with a boldness that amazed me broached the topic on the spot
the boy will be idle there said miss murdstone looking into a picklejar and idleness is the root of all evil
but to be sure he would be idle hereor anywhere in my opinion peggotty had an angry answer ready i could see but she swallowed it for my sake and remained silent
humph said miss murdstone still keeping her eye on the pickles it is of more importance than anything elseit is of paramount importancethat my brother should not be disturbed or made uncomfortable
i suppose i had better say yes i thanked her without making any demonstration of joy lest it should induce her to withdraw her assent
nor could i help thinking this a prudent course since she looked at me out of the picklejar with as great an access of sourness as if her black eyes had absorbed its contents
however the permission was given and was never retracted for when the month was out peggotty and i were ready to depart
mr barkis came into the house for peggottys boxes
i had never known him to pass the gardengate before but on this occasion he came into the house
and he gave me a look as he shouldered the largest box and went out which i thought had meaning in it if meaning could ever be said to find its way into mr barkiss visage
peggotty was naturally in low spirits at leaving what had been her home so many years and where the two strong attachments of her lifefor my mother and myselfhad been formed
she had been walking in the churchyard too very early and she got into the cart and sat in it with her handkerchief at her eyes
so long as she remained in this condition mr barkis gave no sign of life whatever
he sat in his usual place and attitude like a great stuffed figure
but when she began to look about her and to speak to me he nodded his head and grinned several times
i have not the least notion at whom or what he meant by it
its a beautiful day mr barkis i said as an act of politeness
it aint bad said mr barkis who generally qualified his speech and rarely committed himself
peggotty is quite comfortable now mr barkis i remarked for his satisfaction
is she though said mr barkis
after reflecting about it with a sagacious air mr barkis eyed her and said are you pretty comfortable peggotty laughed and answered in the affirmative
but really and truly you know
are you growled mr barkis sliding nearer to her on the seat and nudging her with his elbow
are you
really and truly pretty comfortable
are you
eh at each of these inquiries mr barkis shuffled nearer to her and gave her another nudge so that at last we were all crowded together in the lefthand corner of the cart and i was so squeezed that i could hardly bear it
peggotty calling his attention to my sufferings mr barkis gave me a little more room at once and got away by degrees
but i could not help observing that he seemed to think he had hit upon a wonderful expedient for expressing himself in a neat agreeable and pointed manner without the inconvenience of inventing conversation
he manifestly chuckled over it for some time
by and by he turned to peggotty again and repeating are you pretty comfortable though bore down upon us as before until the breath was nearly edged out of my body
by and by he made another descent upon us with the same inquiry and the same result
at length i got up whenever i saw him coming and standing on the footboard pretended to look at the prospect after which i did very well
he was so polite as to stop at a publichouse expressly on our account and entertain us with broiled mutton and beer
even when peggotty was in the act of drinking he was seized with one of those approaches and almost choked her
but as we drew nearer to the end of our journey he had more to do and less time for gallantry and when we got on yarmouth pavement we were all too much shaken and jolted i apprehend to have any leisure for anything else
mr peggotty and ham waited for us at the old place
they received me and peggotty in an affectionate manner and shook hands with mr barkis who with his hat on the very back of his head and a shamefaced leer upon his countenance and pervading his very legs presented but a vacant appearance i thought
they each took one of peggottys trunks and we were going away when mr barkis solemnly made a sign to me with his forefinger to come under an archway
i say growled mr barkis it was all right i looked up into his face and answered with an attempt to be very profound oh it didnt come to a end there said mr barkis nodding confidentially
it was all right again i answered oh you know who was willin said my friend
it was barkis and barkis only i nodded assent
its all right said mr barkis shaking hands im a friend of yourn
you made it all right first
its all right in his attempts to be particularly lucid mr barkis was so extremely mysterious that i might have stood looking in his face for an hour and most assuredly should have got as much information out of it as out of the face of a clock that had stopped but for peggottys calling me away
as we were going along she asked me what he had said and i told her he had said it was all right
like his impudence said peggotty but i dont mind that
davy dear what should you think if i was to think of being married whyi suppose you would like me as much then peggotty as you do now i returned after a little consideration
greatly to the astonishment of the passengers in the street as well as of her relations going on before the good soul was obliged to stop and embrace me on the spot with many protestations of her unalterable love
tell me what should you say darling she asked again when this was over and we were walking on
if you were thinking of being marriedto mr barkis peggotty yes said peggotty
i should think it would be a very good thing
for then you know peggotty you would always have the horse and cart to bring you over to see me and could come for nothing and be sure of coming the sense of the dear cried peggotty
what i have been thinking of this month back
yes my precious and i think i should be more independent altogether you see let alone my working with a better heart in my own house than i could in anybody elses now
i dont know what i might be fit for now as a servant to a stranger
and i shall be always near my prettys restingplace said peggotty musing and be able to see it when i like and when i lie down to rest i may be laid not far off from my darling girl we neither of us said anything for a little while
but i wouldnt so much as give it another thought said peggotty cheerily if my davy was anyways against itnot if i had been asked in church thirty times three times over and was wearing out the ring in my pocket look at me peggotty i replied and see if i am not really glad and dont truly wish it as indeed i did with all my heart
well my life said peggotty giving me a squeeze i have thought of it night and day every way i can and i hope the right way but ill think of it again and speak to my brother about it and in the meantime well keep it to ourselves davy you and me
barkis is a good plain creature said peggotty and if i tried to do my duty by him i think it would be my fault if i wasntif i wasnt pretty comfortable said peggotty laughing heartily
this quotation from mr barkis was so appropriate and tickled us both so much that we laughed again and again and were quite in a pleasant humour when we came within view of mr peggottys cottage
it looked just the same except that it may perhaps have shrunk a little in my eyes and mrs gummidge was waiting at the door as if she had stood there ever since
all within was the same down to the seaweed in the blue mug in my bedroom
i went into the outhouse to look about me and the very same lobsters crabs and crawfish possessed by the same desire to pinch the world in general appeared to be in the same state of conglomeration in the same old corner
but there was no little emly to be seen so i asked mr peggotty where she was
shes at school sir said mr peggotty wiping the heat consequent on the porterage of peggottys box from his forehead shell be home looking at the dutch clock in from twenty minutes to halfanhours time
we all on us feel the loss of her bless ye mrs gummidge moaned
cheer up mawther cried mr peggotty
i feel it more than anybody else said mrs gummidge im a lone lorn creetur and she used to be amost the only thing that didnt go contrary with me mrs gummidge whimpering and shaking her head applied herself to blowing the fire
mr peggotty looking round upon us while she was so engaged said in a low voice which he shaded with his hand the old un from this i rightly conjectured that no improvement had taken place since my last visit in the state of mrs gummidges spirits
now the whole place was or it should have been quite as delightful a place as ever and yet it did not impress me in the same way
i felt rather disappointed with it
perhaps it was because little emly was not at home
i knew the way by which she would come and presently found myself strolling along the path to meet her
a figure appeared in the distance before long and i soon knew it to be emly who was a little creature still in stature though she was grown
but when she drew nearer and i saw her blue eyes looking bluer and her dimpled face looking brighter and her whole self prettier and gayer a curious feeling came over me that made me pretend not to know her and pass by as if i were looking at something a long way off
i have done such a thing since in later life or i am mistaken
little emly didnt care a bit
she saw me well enough but instead of turning round and calling after me ran away laughing
this obliged me to run after her and she ran so fast that we were very near the cottage before i caught her
oh its you is it said little emly
why you knew who it was emly said i
and didnt you know who it was said emly
i was going to kiss her but she covered her cherry lips with her hands and said she wasnt a baby now and ran away laughing more than ever into the house
she seemed to delight in teasing me which was a change in her i wondered at very much
the tea table was ready and our little locker was put out in its old place but instead of coming to sit by me she went and bestowed her company upon that grumbling mrs gummidge and on mr peggottys inquiring why rumpled her hair all over her face to hide it and could do nothing but laugh
a little puss it is said mr peggotty patting her with his great hand
so sh is
so sh is cried ham
masr davy bor so sh is and he sat and chuckled at her for some time in a state of mingled admiration and delight that made his face a burning red
little emly was spoiled by them all in fact and by no one more than mr peggotty himself whom she could have coaxed into anything by only going and laying her cheek against his rough whisker
that was my opinion at least when i saw her do it and i held mr peggotty to be thoroughly in the right
but she was so affectionate and sweetnatured and had such a pleasant manner of being both sly and shy at once that she captivated me more than ever
she was tenderhearted too for when as we sat round the fire after tea an allusion was made by mr peggotty over his pipe to the loss i had sustained the tears stood in her eyes and she looked at me so kindly across the table that i felt quite thankful to her
ah said mr peggotty taking up her curls and running them over his hand like water heres another orphan you see sir
and here said mr peggotty giving ham a backhanded knock in the chest is another of em though he dont look much like it if i had you for my guardian mr peggotty said i shaking my head i dont think i should feel much like it well said masr davy bor cried ham in an ecstasy
hoorah
well said
nor more you wouldnt
hor
horhere he returned mr peggottys backhander and little emly got up and kissed mr peggotty
and hows your friend sir said mr peggotty to me
steerforth said i
thats the name cried mr peggotty turning to ham
i knowed it was something in our way you said it was rudderford observed ham laughing
well retorted mr peggotty
and ye steer with a rudder dont ye
it aint fur off
how is he sir he was very well indeed when i came away mr peggotty theres a friend said mr peggotty stretching out his pipe
theres a friend if you talk of friends
why lord love my heart alive if it aint a treat to look at him he is very handsome is he not said i my heart warming with this praise
handsome cried mr peggotty
he stands up to you likelike awhy i dont know what he dont stand up to you like
hes so bold yes
thats just his character said i
hes as brave as a lion and you cant think how frank he is mr peggotty and i do suppose now said mr peggotty looking at me through the smoke of his pipe that in the way of booklarning hed take the wind out of amost anything yes said i delighted he knows everything
he is astonishingly clever theres a friend murmured mr peggotty with a grave toss of his head
nothing seems to cost him any trouble said i
he knows a task if he only looks at it
he is the best cricketer you ever saw
he will give you almost as many men as you like at draughts and beat you easily mr peggotty gave his head another toss as much as to say of course he will he is such a speaker i pursued that he can win anybody over and i dont know what youd say if you were to hear him sing mr peggotty mr peggotty gave his head another toss as much as to say i have no doubt of it then hes such a generous fine noble fellow said i quite carried away by my favourite theme that its hardly possible to give him as much praise as he deserves
i am sure i can never feel thankful enough for the generosity with which he has protected me so much younger and lower in the school than himself i was running on very fast indeed when my eyes rested on little emlys face which was bent forward over the table listening with the deepest attention her breath held her blue eyes sparkling like jewels and the colour mantling in her cheeks
she looked so extraordinarily earnest and pretty that i stopped in a sort of wonder and they all observed her at the same time for as i stopped they laughed and looked at her
emly is like me said peggotty and would like to see him emly was confused by our all observing her and hung down her head and her face was covered with blushes
glancing up presently through her stray curls and seeing that we were all looking at her still i am sure i for one could have looked at her for hours she ran away and kept away till it was nearly bedtime
i lay down in the old little bed in the stern of the boat and the wind came moaning on across the flat as it had done before
but i could not help fancying now that it moaned of those who were gone and instead of thinking that the sea might rise in the night and float the boat away i thought of the sea that had risen since i last heard those sounds and drowned my happy home
i recollect as the wind and water began to sound fainter in my ears putting a short clause into my prayers petitioning that i might grow up to marry little emly and so dropping lovingly asleep
the days passed pretty much as they had passed before exceptit was a great exceptionthat little emly and i seldom wandered on the beach now
she had tasks to learn and needlework to do and was absent during a great part of each day
but i felt that we should not have had those old wanderings even if it had been otherwise
wild and full of childish whims as emly was she was more of a little woman than i had supposed
she seemed to have got a great distance away from me in little more than a year
she liked me but she laughed at me and tormented me and when i went to meet her stole home another way and was laughing at the door when i came back disappointed
the best times were when she sat quietly at work in the doorway and i sat on the wooden step at her feet reading to her
it seems to me at this hour that i have never seen such sunlight as on those bright april afternoons that i have never seen such a sunny little figure as i used to see sitting in the doorway of the old boat that i have never beheld such sky such water such glorified ships sailing away into golden air
on the very first evening after our arrival mr barkis appeared in an exceedingly vacant and awkward condition and with a bundle of oranges tied up in a handkerchief
as he made no allusion of any kind to this property he was supposed to have left it behind him by accident when he went away until ham running after him to restore it came back with the information that it was intended for peggotty
after that occasion he appeared every evening at exactly the same hour and always with a little bundle to which he never alluded and which he regularly put behind the door and left there
these offerings of affection were of a most various and eccentric description
among them i remember a double set of pigs trotters a huge pincushion half a bushel or so of apples a pair of jet earrings some spanish onions a box of dominoes a canary bird and cage and a leg of pickled pork
mr barkiss wooing as i remember it was altogether of a peculiar kind
he very seldom said anything but would sit by the fire in much the same attitude as he sat in his cart and stare heavily at peggotty who was opposite
one night being as i suppose inspired by love he made a dart at the bit of waxcandle she kept for her thread and put it in his waistcoatpocket and carried it off
after that his great delight was to produce it when it was wanted sticking to the lining of his pocket in a partially melted state and pocket it again when it was done with
he seemed to enjoy himself very much and not to feel at all called upon to talk
even when he took peggotty out for a walk on the flats he had no uneasiness on that head i believe contenting himself with now and then asking her if she was pretty comfortable and i remember that sometimes after he was gone peggotty would throw her apron over her face and laugh for halfanhour
indeed we were all more or less amused except that miserable mrs gummidge whose courtship would appear to have been of an exactly parallel nature she was so continually reminded by these transactions of the old one
at length when the term of my visit was nearly expired it was given out that peggotty and mr barkis were going to make a days holiday together and that little emly and i were to accompany them
i had but a broken sleep the night before in anticipation of the pleasure of a whole day with emly
we were all astir betimes in the morning and while we were yet at breakfast mr barkis appeared in the distance driving a chaisecart towards the object of his affections
peggotty was dressed as usual in her neat and quiet mourning but mr barkis bloomed in a new blue coat of which the tailor had given him such good measure that the cuffs would have rendered gloves unnecessary in the coldest weather while the collar was so high that it pushed his hair up on end on the top of his head
his bright buttons too were of the largest size
rendered complete by drab pantaloons and a buff waistcoat i thought mr barkis a phenomenon of respectability
when we were all in a bustle outside the door i found that mr peggotty was prepared with an old shoe which was to be thrown after us for luck and which he offered to mrs gummidge for that purpose
no
it had better be done by somebody else danl said mrs gummidge
im a lone lorn creetur myself and everythink that reminds me of creeturs that aint lone and lorn goes contrary with me come old gal cried mr peggotty
take and heave it no danl returned mrs gummidge whimpering and shaking her head
if i felt less i could do more
you dont feel like me danl thinks dont go contrary with you nor you with them you had better do it yourself but here peggotty who had been going about from one to another in a hurried way kissing everybody called out from the cart in which we all were by this time emly and i on two little chairs side by side that mrs gummidge must do it
so mrs gummidge did it and i am sorry to relate cast a damp upon the festive character of our departure by immediately bursting into tears and sinking subdued into the arms of ham with the declaration that she knowed she was a burden and had better be carried to the house at once
which i really thought was a sensible idea that ham might have acted on
away we went however on our holiday excursion and the first thing we did was to stop at a church where mr barkis tied the horse to some rails and went in with peggotty leaving little emly and me alone in the chaise
i took that occasion to put my arm round emlys waist and propose that as i was going away so very soon now we should determine to be very affectionate to one another and very happy all day
little emly consenting and allowing me to kiss her i became desperate informing her i recollect that i never could love another and that i was prepared to shed the blood of anybody who should aspire to her affections
how merry little emly made herself about it
with what a demure assumption of being immensely older and wiser than i the fairy little woman said i was a silly boy and then laughed so charmingly that i forgot the pain of being called by that disparaging name in the pleasure of looking at her
mr barkis and peggotty were a good while in the church but came out at last and then we drove away into the country
as we were going along mr barkis turned to me and said with a winkby the by i should hardly have thought before that he could wink what name was it as i wrote up in the cart clara peggotty i answered
what name would it be as i should write up now if there was a tilt here clara peggotty again i suggested
clara peggotty barkis he returned and burst into a roar of laughter that shook the chaise
in a word they were married and had gone into the church for no other purpose
peggotty was resolved that it should be quietly done and the clerk had given her away and there had been no witnesses of the ceremony
she was a little confused when mr barkis made this abrupt announcement of their union and could not hug me enough in token of her unimpaired affection but she soon became herself again and said she was very glad it was over
we drove to a little inn in a byroad where we were expected and where we had a very comfortable dinner and passed the day with great satisfaction
if peggotty had been married every day for the last ten years she could hardly have been more at her ease about it it made no sort of difference in her she was just the same as ever and went out for a stroll with little emly and me before tea while mr barkis philosophically smoked his pipe and enjoyed himself i suppose with the contemplation of his happiness
if so it sharpened his appetite for i distinctly call to mind that although he had eaten a good deal of pork and greens at dinner and had finished off with a fowl or two he was obliged to have cold boiled bacon for tea and disposed of a large quantity without any emotion
i have often thought since what an odd innocent outoftheway kind of wedding it must have been
we got into the chaise again soon after dark and drove cosily back looking up at the stars and talking about them
i was their chief exponent and opened mr barkiss mind to an amazing extent
i told him all i knew but he would have believed anything i might have taken it into my head to impart to him for he had a profound veneration for my abilities and informed his wife in my hearing on that very occasion that i was a young roeshusby which i think he meant prodigy
when we had exhausted the subject of the stars or rather when i had exhausted the mental faculties of mr barkis little emly and i made a cloak of an old wrapper and sat under it for the rest of the journey
ah how i loved her
what happiness i thought if we were married and were going away anywhere to live among the trees and in the fields never growing older never growing wiser children ever rambling hand in hand through sunshine and among flowery meadows laying down our heads on moss at night in a sweet sleep of purity and peace and buried by the birds when we were dead
some such picture with no real world in it bright with the light of our innocence and vague as the stars afar off was in my mind all the way
i am glad to think there were two such guileless hearts at peggottys marriage as little emlys and mine
i am glad to think the loves and graces took such airy forms in its homely procession
well we came to the old boat again in good time at night and there mr and mrs barkis bade us goodbye and drove away snugly to their own home
i felt then for the first time that i had lost peggotty
i should have gone to bed with a sore heart indeed under any other roof but that which sheltered little emlys head
mr peggotty and ham knew what was in my thoughts as well as i did and were ready with some supper and their hospitable faces to drive it away
little emly came and sat beside me on the locker for the only time in all that visit and it was altogether a wonderful close to a wonderful day
it was a night tide and soon after we went to bed mr peggotty and ham went out to fish
i felt very brave at being left alone in the solitary house the protector of emly and mrs gummidge and only wished that a lion or a serpent or any illdisposed monster would make an attack upon us that i might destroy him and cover myself with glory
but as nothing of the sort happened to be walking about on yarmouth flats that night i provided the best substitute i could by dreaming of dragons until morning
with morning came peggotty who called to me as usual under my window as if mr barkis the carrier had been from first to last a dream too
after breakfast she took me to her own home and a beautiful little home it was
of all the moveables in it i must have been impressed by a certain old bureau of some dark wood in the parlour the tilefloored kitchen was the general sittingroom with a retreating top which opened let down and became a desk within which was a large quarto edition of foxes book of martyrs
this precious volume of which i do not recollect one word i immediately discovered and immediately applied myself to and i never visited the house afterwards but i kneeled on a chair opened the casket where this gem was enshrined spread my arms over the desk and fell to devouring the book afresh
i was chiefly edified i am afraid by the pictures which were numerous and represented all kinds of dismal horrors but the martyrs and peggottys house have been inseparable in my mind ever since and are now
i took leave of mr peggotty and ham and mrs gummidge and little emly that day and passed the night at peggottys in a little room in the roof with the crocodile book on a shelf by the beds head which was to be always mine peggotty said and should always be kept for me in exactly the same state
young or old davy dear as long as i am alive and have this house over my head said peggotty you shall find it as if i expected you here directly minute
i shall keep it every day as i used to keep your old little room my darling and if you was to go to china you might think of it as being kept just the same all the time you were away i felt the truth and constancy of my dear old nurse with all my heart and thanked her as well as i could
that was not very well for she spoke to me thus with her arms round my neck in the morning and i was going home in the morning and i went home in the morning with herself and mr barkis in the cart
they left me at the gate not easily or lightly and it was a strange sight to me to see the cart go on taking peggotty away and leaving me under the old elmtrees looking at the house in which there was no face to look on mine with love or liking any more
and now i fell into a state of neglect which i cannot look back upon without compassion
i fell at once into a solitary conditionapart from all friendly notice apart from the society of all other boys of my own age apart from all companionship but my own spiritless thoughtswhich seems to cast its gloom upon this paper as i write
what would i have given to have been sent to the hardest school that ever was keptto have been taught something anyhow anywhere
no such hope dawned upon me
they disliked me and they sullenly sternly steadily overlooked me
i think mr murdstones means were straitened at about this time but it is little to the purpose
he could not bear me and in putting me from him he tried as i believe to put away the notion that i had any claim upon himand succeeded
i was not actively illused
i was not beaten or starved but the wrong that was done to me had no intervals of relenting and was done in a systematic passionless manner
day after day week after week month after month i was coldly neglected
i wonder sometimes when i think of it what they would have done if i had been taken with an illness whether i should have lain down in my lonely room and languished through it in my usual solitary way or whether anybody would have helped me out
when mr and miss murdstone were at home i took my meals with them in their absence i ate and drank by myself
at all times i lounged about the house and neighbourhood quite disregarded except that they were jealous of my making any friends thinking perhaps that if i did i might complain to someone
for this reason though mr chillip often asked me to go and see him he was a widower having some years before that lost a little small lighthaired wife whom i can just remember connecting in my own thoughts with a pale tortoiseshell cat it was but seldom that i enjoyed the happiness of passing an afternoon in his closet of a surgery reading some book that was new to me with the smell of the whole pharmacopoeia coming up my nose or pounding something in a mortar under his mild directions
for the same reason added no doubt to the old dislike of her i was seldom allowed to visit peggotty
faithful to her promise she either came to see me or met me somewhere near once every week and never emptyhanded but many and bitter were the disappointments i had in being refused permission to pay a visit to her at her house
some few times however at long intervals i was allowed to go there and then i found out that mr barkis was something of a miser or as peggotty dutifully expressed it was a little near and kept a heap of money in a box under his bed which he pretended was only full of coats and trousers
in this coffer his riches hid themselves with such a tenacious modesty that the smallest instalments could only be tempted out by artifice so that peggotty had to prepare a long and elaborate scheme a very gunpowder plot for every saturdays expenses
all this time i was so conscious of the waste of any promise i had given and of my being utterly neglected that i should have been perfectly miserable i have no doubt but for the old books
they were my only comfort and i was as true to them as they were to me and read them over and over i dont know how many times more
i now approach a period of my life which i can never lose the remembrance of while i remember anything and the recollection of which has often without my invocation come before me like a ghost and haunted happier times
i had been out one day loitering somewhere in the listless meditative manner that my way of life engendered when turning the corner of a lane near our house i came upon mr murdstone walking with a gentleman
i was confused and was going by them when the gentleman cried what
brooks no sir david copperfield i said
dont tell me
you are brooks said the gentleman
you are brooks of sheffield
thats your name at these words i observed the gentleman more attentively
his laugh coming to my remembrance too i knew him to be mr quinion whom i had gone over to lowestoft with mr murdstone to see beforeit is no matteri need not recall when
and how do you get on and where are you being educated brooks said mr quinion
he had put his hand upon my shoulder and turned me about to walk with them
i did not know what to reply and glanced dubiously at mr murdstone
he is at home at present said the latter
he is not being educated anywhere
i dont know what to do with him
he is a difficult subject that old double look was on me for a moment and then his eyes darkened with a frown as it turned in its aversion elsewhere
humph said mr quinion looking at us both i thought
fine weather silence ensued and i was considering how i could best disengage my shoulder from his hand and go away when he said i suppose you are a pretty sharp fellow still
eh brooks aye
he is sharp enough said mr murdstone impatiently
you had better let him go
he will not thank you for troubling him on this hint mr quinion released me and i made the best of my way home
looking back as i turned into the front garden i saw mr murdstone leaning against the wicket of the churchyard and mr quinion talking to him
they were both looking after me and i felt that they were speaking of me
mr quinion lay at our house that night
after breakfast the next morning i had put my chair away and was going out of the room when mr murdstone called me back
he then gravely repaired to another table where his sister sat herself at her desk
mr quinion with his hands in his pockets stood looking out of window and i stood looking at them all
david said mr murdstone to the young this is a world for action not for moping and droning in as you do added his sister
jane murdstone leave it to me if you please
i say david to the young this is a world for action and not for moping and droning in
it is especially so for a young boy of your disposition which requires a great deal of correcting and to which no greater service can be done than to force it to conform to the ways of the working world and to bend it and break it for stubbornness wont do here said his sister what it wants is to be crushed
and crushed it must be
shall be too he gave her a look half in remonstrance half in approval and went on i suppose you know david that i am not rich
at any rate you know it now
you have received some considerable education already
education is costly and even if it were not and i could afford it i am of opinion that it would not be at all advantageous to you to be kept at school
what is before you is a fight with the world and the sooner you begin it the better i think it occurred to me that i had already begun it in my poor way but it occurs to me now whether or no
you have heard the countinghouse mentioned sometimes said mr murdstone
the countinghouse sir i repeated
of murdstone and grinby in the wine trade he replied
i suppose i looked uncertain for he went on hastily you have heard the countinghouse mentioned or the business or the cellars or the wharf or something about it i think i have heard the business mentioned sir i said remembering what i vaguely knew of his and his sisters resources
but i dont know when it does not matter when he returned
mr
quinion manages that business i glanced at the latter deferentially as he stood looking out of window
mr
quinion suggests that it gives employment to some other boys and that he sees no reason why it shouldnt on the same terms give employment to you he having mr quinion observed in a low voice and half turning round no other prospect murdstone mr murdstone with an impatient even an angry gesture resumed without noticing what he had said those terms are that you will earn enough for yourself to provide for your eating and drinking and pocketmoney
your lodging which i have arranged for will be paid by me
so will your washing which will be kept down to my estimate said his sister
your clothes will be looked after for you too said mr murdstone as you will not be able yet awhile to get them for yourself
so you are now going to london david with mr quinion to begin the world on your own account in short you are provided for observed his sister and will please to do your duty though i quite understood that the purpose of this announcement was to get rid of me i have no distinct remembrance whether it pleased or frightened me
my impression is that i was in a state of confusion about it and oscillating between the two points touched neither
nor had i much time for the clearing of my thoughts as mr quinion was to go upon the morrow
behold me on the morrow in a muchworn little white hat with a black crape round it for my mother a black jacket and a pair of hard stiff corduroy trouserswhich miss murdstone considered the best armour for the legs in that fight with the world which was now to come off
behold me so attired and with my little worldly all before me in a small trunk sitting a lone lorn child as mrs gummidge might have said in the postchaise that was carrying mr quinion to the london coach at yarmouth
see how our house and church are lessening in the distance how the grave beneath the tree is blotted out by intervening objects how the spire points upwards from my old playground no more and the sky is empty
i know enough of the world now to have almost lost the capacity of being much surprised by anything but it is matter of some surprise to me even now that i can have been so easily thrown away at such an age
a child of excellent abilities and with strong powers of observation quick eager delicate and soon hurt bodily or mentally it seems wonderful to me that nobody should have made any sign in my behalf
but none was made and i became at ten years old a little labouring hind in the service of murdstone and grinby
murdstone and grinbys warehouse was at the waterside
it was down in blackfriars
modern improvements have altered the place but it was the last house at the bottom of a narrow street curving down hill to the river with some stairs at the end where people took boat
it was a crazy old house with a wharf of its own abutting on the water when the tide was in and on the mud when the tide was out and literally overrun with rats
its panelled rooms discoloured with the dirt and smoke of a hundred years i dare say its decaying floors and staircase the squeaking and scuffling of the old grey rats down in the cellars and the dirt and rottenness of the place are things not of many years ago in my mind but of the present instant
they are all before me just as they were in the evil hour when i went among them for the first time with my trembling hand in mr quinions
murdstone and grinbys trade was among a good many kinds of people but an important branch of it was the supply of wines and spirits to certain packet ships
i forget now where they chiefly went but i think there were some among them that made voyages both to the east and west indies
i know that a great many empty bottles were one of the consequences of this traffic and that certain men and boys were employed to examine them against the light and reject those that were flawed and to rinse and wash them
when the empty bottles ran short there were labels to be pasted on full ones or corks to be fitted to them or seals to be put upon the corks or finished bottles to be packed in casks
all this work was my work and of the boys employed upon it i was one
there were three or four of us counting me
my working place was established in a corner of the warehouse where mr quinion could see me when he chose to stand up on the bottom rail of his stool in the countinghouse and look at me through a window above the desk
hither on the first morning of my so auspiciously beginning life on my own account the oldest of the regular boys was summoned to show me my business
his name was mick walker and he wore a ragged apron and a paper cap
he informed me that his father was a bargeman and walked in a black velvet headdress in the lord mayors show
he also informed me that our principal associate would be another boy whom he introduced by theto meextraordinary name of mealy potatoes
i discovered however that this youth had not been christened by that name but that it had been bestowed upon him in the warehouse on account of his complexion which was pale or mealy
mealys father was a waterman who had the additional distinction of being a fireman and was engaged as such at one of the large theatres where some young relation of mealysi think his little sisterdid imps in the pantomimes
no words can express the secret agony of my soul as i sunk into this companionship compared these henceforth everyday associates with those of my happier childhoodnot to say with steerforth traddles and the rest of those boys and felt my hopes of growing up to be a learned and distinguished man crushed in my bosom
the deep remembrance of the sense i had of being utterly without hope now of the shame i felt in my position of the misery it was to my young heart to believe that day by day what i had learned and thought and delighted in and raised my fancy and my emulation up by would pass away from me little by little never to be brought back any more cannot be written
as often as mick walker went away in the course of that forenoon i mingled my tears with the water in which i was washing the bottles and sobbed as if there were a flaw in my own breast and it were in danger of bursting
the countinghouse clock was at half past twelve and there was general preparation for going to dinner when mr quinion tapped at the countinghouse window and beckoned to me to go in
i went in and found there a stoutish middleaged person in a brown surtout and black tights and shoes with no more hair upon his head which was a large one and very shining than there is upon an egg and with a very extensive face which he turned full upon me
his clothes were shabby but he had an imposing shirtcollar on
he carried a jaunty sort of a stick with a large pair of rusty tassels to it and a quizzingglass hung outside his coatfor ornament i afterwards found as he very seldom looked through it and couldnt see anything when he did
this said mr quinion in allusion to myself is he this said the stranger with a certain condescending roll in his voice and a certain indescribable air of doing something genteel which impressed me very much is master copperfield
i hope i see you well sir i said i was very well and hoped he was
i was sufficiently ill at ease heaven knows but it was not in my nature to complain much at that time of my life so i said i was very well and hoped he was
i am said the stranger thank heaven quite well
i have received a letter from mr murdstone in which he mentions that he would desire me to receive into an apartment in the rear of my house which is at present unoccupiedand is in short to be let as ain short said the stranger with a smile and in a burst of confidence as a bedroomthe young beginner whom i have now the pleasure to and the stranger waved his hand and settled his chin in his shirtcollar
this is mr micawber said mr quinion to me
ahem said the stranger that is my name mr
micawber said mr quinion is known to mr murdstone
he takes orders for us on commission when he can get any
he has been written to by mr murdstone on the subject of your lodgings and he will receive you as a lodger my address said mr micawber is windsor terrace city road
iin short said mr micawber with the same genteel air and in another burst of confidencei live there i made him a bow
under the impression said mr micawber that your peregrinations in this metropolis have not as yet been extensive and that you might have some difficulty in penetrating the arcana of the modern babylon in the direction of the city roadin short said mr micawber in another burst of confidence that you might lose yourselfi shall be happy to call this evening and install you in the knowledge of the nearest way i thanked him with all my heart for it was friendly in him to offer to take that trouble
at what hour said mr micawber shall i at about eight said mr quinion
at about eight said mr micawber
i beg to wish you good day mr quinion
i will intrude no longer so he put on his hat and went out with his cane under his arm very upright and humming a tune when he was clear of the countinghouse
mr quinion then formally engaged me to be as useful as i could in the warehouse of murdstone and grinby at a salary i think of six shillings a week
i am not clear whether it was six or seven
i am inclined to believe from my uncertainty on this head that it was six at first and seven afterwards
he paid me a week down from his own pocket i believe and i gave mealy sixpence out of it to get my trunk carried to windsor terrace that night it being too heavy for my strength small as it was
i paid sixpence more for my dinner which was a meat pie and a turn at a neighbouring pump and passed the hour which was allowed for that meal in walking about the streets
at the appointed time in the evening mr micawber reappeared
i washed my hands and face to do the greater honour to his gentility and we walked to our house as i suppose i must now call it together mr micawber impressing the name of streets and the shapes of corner houses upon me as we went along that i might find my way back easily in the morning
arrived at this house in windsor terrace which i noticed was shabby like himself but also like himself made all the show it could he presented me to mrs micawber a thin and faded lady not at all young who was sitting in the parlour the first floor was altogether unfurnished and the blinds were kept down to delude the neighbours with a baby at her breast
this baby was one of twins and i may remark here that i hardly ever in all my experience of the family saw both the twins detached from mrs micawber at the same time
one of them was always taking refreshment
there were two other children master micawber aged about four and miss micawber aged about three
these and a darkcomplexioned young woman with a habit of snorting who was servant to the family and informed me before half an hour had expired that she was a orfling and came from st lukes workhouse in the neighbourhood completed the establishment
my room was at the top of the house at the back a close chamber stencilled all over with an ornament which my young imagination represented as a blue muffin and very scantily furnished
i never thought said mrs micawber when she came up twin and all to show me the apartment and sat down to take breath before i was married when i lived with papa and mama that i should ever find it necessary to take a lodger
but mr micawber being in difficulties all considerations of private feeling must give way i said yes maam mr
micawbers difficulties are almost overwhelming just at present said mrs micawber and whether it is possible to bring him through them i dont know
when i lived at home with papa and mama i really should have hardly understood what the word meant in the sense in which i now employ it but experientia does itas papa used to say i cannot satisfy myself whether she told me that mr micawber had been an officer in the marines or whether i have imagined it
i only know that i believe to this hour that he was in the marines once upon a time without knowing why
he was a sort of town traveller for a number of miscellaneous houses now but made little or nothing of it i am afraid
if mr micawbers creditors will not give him time said mrs micawber they must take the consequences and the sooner they bring it to an issue the better
blood cannot be obtained from a stone neither can anything on account be obtained at present not to mention law expenses from mr micawber i never can quite understand whether my precocious selfdependence confused mrs micawber in reference to my age or whether she was so full of the subject that she would have talked about it to the very twins if there had been nobody else to communicate with but this was the strain in which she began and she went on accordingly all the time i knew her
poor mrs micawber
she said she had tried to exert herself and so i have no doubt she had
the centre of the street door was perfectly covered with a great brassplate on which was engraved mrs
micawbers boarding establishment for young ladies but i never found that any young lady had ever been to school there or that any young lady ever came or proposed to come or that the least preparation was ever made to receive any young lady
the only visitors i ever saw or heard of were creditors
they used to come at all hours and some of them were quite ferocious
one dirtyfaced man i think he was a bootmaker used to edge himself into the passage as early as seven oclock in the morning and call up the stairs to mr micawbercome
you aint out yet you know
pay us will you
dont hide you know thats mean
i wouldnt be mean if i was you
pay us will you
you just pay us dye hear
come receiving no answer to these taunts he would mount in his wrath to the words swindlers and robbers and these being ineffectual too would sometimes go to the extremity of crossing the street and roaring up at the windows of the second floor where he knew mr micawber was
at these times mr micawber would be transported with grief and mortification even to the length as i was once made aware by a scream from his wife of making motions at himself with a razor but within halfanhour afterwards he would polish up his shoes with extraordinary pains and go out humming a tune with a greater air of gentility than ever
mrs micawber was quite as elastic
i have known her to be thrown into fainting fits by the kings taxes at three oclock and to eat lamb chops breaded and drink warm ale paid for with two teaspoons that had gone to the pawnbrokers at four
on one occasion when an execution had just been put in coming home through some chance as early as six oclock i saw her lying of course with a twin under the grate in a swoon with her hair all torn about her face but i never knew her more cheerful than she was that very same night over a veal cutlet before the kitchen fire telling me stories about her papa and mama and the company they used to keep
in this house and with this family i passed my leisure time
my own exclusive breakfast of a penny loaf and a pennyworth of milk i provided myself
i kept another small loaf and a modicum of cheese on a particular shelf of a particular cupboard to make my supper on when i came back at night
this made a hole in the six or seven shillings i know well and i was out at the warehouse all day and had to support myself on that money all the week
from monday morning until saturday night i had no advice no counsel no encouragement no consolation no assistance no support of any kind from anyone that i can call to mind as i hope to go to heaven
i was so young and childish and so little qualifiedhow could i be otherwiseto undertake the whole charge of my own existence that often in going to murdstone and grinbys of a morning i could not resist the stale pastry put out for sale at halfprice at the pastrycooks doors and spent in that the money i should have kept for my dinner
then i went without my dinner or bought a roll or a slice of pudding
i remember two pudding shops between which i was divided according to my finances
one was in a court close to st martins churchat the back of the churchwhich is now removed altogether
the pudding at that shop was made of currants and was rather a special pudding but was dear twopennyworth not being larger than a pennyworth of more ordinary pudding
a good shop for the latter was in the strandsomewhere in that part which has been rebuilt since
it was a stout pale pudding heavy and flabby and with great flat raisins in it stuck in whole at wide distances apart
it came up hot at about my time every day and many a day did i dine off it
when i dined regularly and handsomely i had a saveloy and a penny loaf or a fourpenny plate of red beef from a cooks shop or a plate of bread and cheese and a glass of beer from a miserable old publichouse opposite our place of business called the lion or the lion and something else that i have forgotten
once i remember carrying my own bread which i had brought from home in the morning under my arm wrapped in a piece of paper like a book and going to a famous alamode beefhouse near drury lane and ordering a small plate of that delicacy to eat with it
what the waiter thought of such a strange little apparition coming in all alone i dont know but i can see him now staring at me as i ate my dinner and bringing up the other waiter to look
i gave him a halfpenny for himself and i wish he hadnt taken it
we had halfanhour i think for tea
when i had money enough i used to get halfapint of readymade coffee and a slice of bread and butter
when i had none i used to look at a venison shop in fleet street or i have strolled at such a time as far as covent garden market and stared at the pineapples
i was fond of wandering about the adelphi because it was a mysterious place with those dark arches
i see myself emerging one evening from some of these arches on a little publichouse close to the river with an open space before it where some coalheavers were dancing to look at whom i sat down upon a bench
i wonder what they thought of me
i was such a child and so little that frequently when i went into the bar of a strange publichouse for a glass of ale or porter to moisten what i had had for dinner they were afraid to give it me
i remember one hot evening i went into the bar of a publichouse and said to the landlord what is your bestyour very bestale a glass for it was a special occasion
i dont know what
it may have been my birthday
twopencehalfpenny says the landlord is the price of the genuine stunning ale then says i producing the money just draw me a glass of the genuine stunning if you please with a good head to it the landlord looked at me in return over the bar from head to foot with a strange smile on his face and instead of drawing the beer looked round the screen and said something to his wife
she came out from behind it with her work in her hand and joined him in surveying me
here we stand all three before me now
the landlord in his shirtsleeves leaning against the bar windowframe his wife looking over the little halfdoor and i in some confusion looking up at them from outside the partition
they asked me a good many questions as what my name was how old i was where i lived how i was employed and how i came there
to all of which that i might commit nobody i invented i am afraid appropriate answers
they served me with the ale though i suspect it was not the genuine stunning and the landlords wife opening the little halfdoor of the bar and bending down gave me my money back and gave me a kiss that was half admiring and half compassionate but all womanly and good i am sure
i know i do not exaggerate unconsciously and unintentionally the scantiness of my resources or the difficulties of my life
i know that if a shilling were given me by mr quinion at any time i spent it in a dinner or a tea
i know that i worked from morning until night with common men and boys a shabby child
i know that i lounged about the streets insufficiently and unsatisfactorily fed
i know that but for the mercy of god i might easily have been for any care that was taken of me a little robber or a little vagabond
yet i held some station at murdstone and grinbys too
besides that mr quinion did what a careless man so occupied and dealing with a thing so anomalous could to treat me as one upon a different footing from the rest i never said to man or boy how it was that i came to be there or gave the least indication of being sorry that i was there
that i suffered in secret and that i suffered exquisitely no one ever knew but i
how much i suffered it is as i have said already utterly beyond my power to tell
but i kept my own counsel and i did my work
i knew from the first that if i could not do my work as well as any of the rest i could not hold myself above slight and contempt
i soon became at least as expeditious and as skilful as either of the other boys
though perfectly familiar with them my conduct and manner were different enough from theirs to place a space between us
they and the men generally spoke of me as the little gent or the young suffolker a certain man named gregory who was foreman of the packers and another named tipp who was the carman and wore a red jacket used to address me sometimes as david but i think it was mostly when we were very confidential and when i had made some efforts to entertain them over our work with some results of the old readings which were fast perishing out of my remembrance
mealy potatoes uprose once and rebelled against my being so distinguished but mick walker settled him in no time
my rescue from this kind of existence i considered quite hopeless and abandoned as such altogether
i am solemnly convinced that i never for one hour was reconciled to it or was otherwise than miserably unhappy but i bore it and even to peggotty partly for the love of her and partly for shame never in any letter though many passed between us revealed the truth
mr micawbers difficulties were an addition to the distressed state of my mind
in my forlorn state i became quite attached to the family and used to walk about busy with mrs micawbers calculations of ways and means and heavy with the weight of mr micawbers debts
on a saturday night which was my grand treatpartly because it was a great thing to walk home with six or seven shillings in my pocket looking into the shops and thinking what such a sum would buy and partly because i went home earlymrs micawber would make the most heartrending confidences to me also on a sunday morning when i mixed the portion of tea or coffee i had bought overnight in a little shavingpot and sat late at my breakfast
it was nothing at all unusual for mr micawber to sob violently at the beginning of one of these saturday night conversations and sing about jacks delight being his lovely nan towards the end of it
i have known him come home to supper with a flood of tears and a declaration that nothing was now left but a jail and go to bed making a calculation of the expense of putting bowwindows to the house in case anything turned up which was his favourite expression
and mrs micawber was just the same
a curious equality of friendship originating i suppose in our respective circumstances sprung up between me and these people notwithstanding the ludicrous disparity in our years
but i never allowed myself to be prevailed upon to accept any invitation to eat and drink with them out of their stock knowing that they got on badly with the butcher and baker and had often not too much for themselves until mrs micawber took me into her entire confidence
this she did one evening as follows master copperfield said mrs micawber i make no stranger of you and therefore do not hesitate to say that mr micawbers difficulties are coming to a crisis it made me very miserable to hear it and i looked at mrs micawbers red eyes with the utmost sympathy
with the exception of the heel of a dutch cheesewhich is not adapted to the wants of a young familysaid mrs micawber there is really not a scrap of anything in the larder
i was accustomed to speak of the larder when i lived with papa and mama and i use the word almost unconsciously
what i mean to express is that there is nothing to eat in the house dear me i said in great concern
i had two or three shillings of my weeks money in my pocketfrom which i presume that it must have been on a wednesday night when we held this conversationand i hastily produced them and with heartfelt emotion begged mrs micawber to accept of them as a loan
but that lady kissing me and making me put them back in my pocket replied that she couldnt think of it
no my dear master copperfield said she far be it from my thoughts
but you have a discretion beyond your years and can render me another kind of service if you will and a service i will thankfully accept of i begged mrs micawber to name it
i have parted with the plate myself said mrs micawber
six tea two salt and a pair of sugars i have at different times borrowed money on in secret with my own hands
but the twins are a great tie and to me with my recollections of papa and mama these transactions are very painful
there are still a few trifles that we could part with
mr micawbers feelings would never allow him to dispose of them and clickettthis was the girl from the workhousebeing of a vulgar mind would take painful liberties if so much confidence was reposed in her
master copperfield if i might ask you i understood mrs micawber now and begged her to make use of me to any extent
i began to dispose of the more portable articles of property that very evening and went out on a similar expedition almost every morning before i went to murdstone and grinbys
mr micawber had a few books on a little chiffonier which he called the library and those went first
i carried them one after another to a bookstall in the city roadone part of which near our house was almost all bookstalls and bird shops thenand sold them for whatever they would bring
the keeper of this bookstall who lived in a little house behind it used to get tipsy every night and to be violently scolded by his wife every morning
more than once when i went there early i had audience of him in a turnup bedstead with a cut in his forehead or a black eye bearing witness to his excesses overnight i am afraid he was quarrelsome in his drink and he with a shaking hand endeavouring to find the needful shillings in one or other of the pockets of his clothes which lay upon the floor while his wife with a baby in her arms and her shoes down at heel never left off rating him
sometimes he had lost his money and then he would ask me to call again but his wife had always got somehad taken his i dare say while he was drunkand secretly completed the bargain on the stairs as we went down together
at the pawnbrokers shop too i began to be very well known
the principal gentleman who officiated behind the counter took a good deal of notice of me and often got me i recollect to decline a latin noun or adjective or to conjugate a latin verb in his ear while he transacted my business
after all these occasions mrs micawber made a little treat which was generally a supper and there was a peculiar relish in these meals which i well remember
at last mr micawbers difficulties came to a crisis and he was arrested early one morning and carried over to the kings bench prison in the borough
he told me as he went out of the house that the god of day had now gone down upon himand i really thought his heart was broken and mine too
but i heard afterwards that he was seen to play a lively game at skittles before noon
on the first sunday after he was taken there i was to go and see him and have dinner with him
i was to ask my way to such a place and just short of that place i should see such another place and just short of that i should see a yard which i was to cross and keep straight on until i saw a turnkey
all this i did and when at last i did see a turnkey poor little fellow that i was
and thought how when roderick random was in a debtors prison there was a man there with nothing on him but an old rug the turnkey swam before my dimmed eyes and my beating heart
mr micawber was waiting for me within the gate and we went up to his room top story but one and cried very much
he solemnly conjured me i remember to take warning by his fate and to observe that if a man had twenty pounds ayear for his income and spent nineteen pounds nineteen shillings and sixpence he would be happy but that if he spent twenty pounds one he would be miserable
after which he borrowed a shilling of me for porter gave me a written order on mrs micawber for the amount and put away his pockethandkerchief and cheered up
we sat before a little fire with two bricks put within the rusted grate one on each side to prevent its burning too many coals until another debtor who shared the room with mr micawber came in from the bakehouse with the loin of mutton which was our jointstock repast
then i was sent up to captain hopkins in the room overhead with mr micawbers compliments and i was his young friend and would captain hopkins lend me a knife and fork
captain hopkins lent me the knife and fork with his compliments to mr micawber
there was a very dirty lady in his little room and two wan girls his daughters with shock heads of hair
i thought it was better to borrow captain hopkinss knife and fork than captain hopkinss comb
the captain himself was in the last extremity of shabbiness with large whiskers and an old old brown greatcoat with no other coat below it
i saw his bed rolled up in a corner and what plates and dishes and pots he had on a shelf and i divined god knows how that though the two girls with the shock heads of hair were captain hopkinss children the dirty lady was not married to captain hopkins
my timid station on his threshold was not occupied more than a couple of minutes at most but i came down again with all this in my knowledge as surely as the knife and fork were in my hand
there was something gipsylike and agreeable in the dinner after all
i took back captain hopkinss knife and fork early in the afternoon and went home to comfort mrs micawber with an account of my visit
she fainted when she saw me return and made a little jug of egghot afterwards to console us while we talked it over
i dont know how the household furniture came to be sold for the family benefit or who sold it except that i did not
sold it was however and carried away in a van except the bed a few chairs and the kitchen table
with these possessions we encamped as it were in the two parlours of the emptied house in windsor terrace mrs micawber the children the orfling and myself and lived in those rooms night and day
i have no idea for how long though it seems to me for a long time
at last mrs micawber resolved to move into the prison where mr micawber had now secured a room to himself
so i took the key of the house to the landlord who was very glad to get it and the beds were sent over to the kings bench except mine for which a little room was hired outside the walls in the neighbourhood of that institution very much to my satisfaction since the micawbers and i had become too used to one another in our troubles to part
the orfling was likewise accommodated with an inexpensive lodging in the same neighbourhood
mine was a quiet backgarret with a sloping roof commanding a pleasant prospect of a timberyard and when i took possession of it with the reflection that mr micawbers troubles had come to a crisis at last i thought it quite a paradise
all this time i was working at murdstone and grinbys in the same common way and with the same common companions and with the same sense of unmerited degradation as at first
but i never happily for me no doubt made a single acquaintance or spoke to any of the many boys whom i saw daily in going to the warehouse in coming from it and in prowling about the streets at mealtimes
i led the same secretly unhappy life but i led it in the same lonely selfreliant manner
the only changes i am conscious of are firstly that i had grown more shabby and secondly that i was now relieved of much of the weight of mr and mrs micawbers cares for some relatives or friends had engaged to help them at their present pass and they lived more comfortably in the prison than they had lived for a long while out of it
i used to breakfast with them now in virtue of some arrangement of which i have forgotten the details
i forget too at what hour the gates were opened in the morning admitting of my going in but i know that i was often up at six oclock and that my favourite loungingplace in the interval was old london bridge where i was wont to sit in one of the stone recesses watching the people going by or to look over the balustrades at the sun shining in the water and lighting up the golden flame on the top of the monument
the orfling met me here sometimes to be told some astonishing fictions respecting the wharves and the tower of which i can say no more than that i hope i believed them myself
in the evening i used to go back to the prison and walk up and down the parade with mr micawber or play casino with mrs micawber and hear reminiscences of her papa and mama
whether mr murdstone knew where i was i am unable to say
i never told them at murdstone and grinbys
mr micawbers affairs although past their crisis were very much involved by reason of a certain deed of which i used to hear a great deal and which i suppose now to have been some former composition with his creditors though i was so far from being clear about it then that i am conscious of having confounded it with those demoniacal parchments which are held to have once upon a time obtained to a great extent in germany
at last this document appeared to be got out of the way somehow at all events it ceased to be the rockahead it had been and mrs micawber informed me that her family had decided that mr micawber should apply for his release under the insolvent debtors act which would set him free she expected in about six weeks
and then said mr micawber who was present i have no doubt i shall please heaven begin to be beforehand with the world and to live in a perfectly new manner ifin short if anything turns up by way of going in for anything that might be on the cards i call to mind that mr micawber about this time composed a petition to the house of commons praying for an alteration in the law of imprisonment for debt
i set down this remembrance here because it is an instance to myself of the manner in which i fitted my old books to my altered life and made stories for myself out of the streets and out of men and women and how some main points in the character i shall unconsciously develop i suppose in writing my life were gradually forming all this while
there was a club in the prison in which mr micawber as a gentleman was a great authority
mr micawber had stated his idea of this petition to the club and the club had strongly approved of the same
wherefore mr micawber who was a thoroughly goodnatured man and as active a creature about everything but his own affairs as ever existed and never so happy as when he was busy about something that could never be of any profit to him set to work at the petition invented it engrossed it on an immense sheet of paper spread it out on a table and appointed a time for all the club and all within the walls if they chose to come up to his room and sign it
when i heard of this approaching ceremony i was so anxious to see them all come in one after another though i knew the greater part of them already and they me that i got an hours leave of absence from murdstone and grinbys and established myself in a corner for that purpose
as many of the principal members of the club as could be got into the small room without filling it supported mr micawber in front of the petition while my old friend captain hopkins who had washed himself to do honour to so solemn an occasion stationed himself close to it to read it to all who were unacquainted with its contents
the door was then thrown open and the general population began to come in in a long file several waiting outside while one entered affixed his signature and went out
to everybody in succession captain hopkins said have you read itnowould you like to hear it read if he weakly showed the least disposition to hear it captain hopkins in a loud sonorous voice gave him every word of it
the captain would have read it twenty thousand times if twenty thousand people would have heard him one by one
i remember a certain luscious roll he gave to such phrases as the peoples representatives in parliament assembled your petitioners therefore humbly approach your honourable house his gracious majestys unfortunate subjects as if the words were something real in his mouth and delicious to taste mr micawber meanwhile listening with a little of an authors vanity and contemplating not severely the spikes on the opposite wall
as i walked to and fro daily between southwark and blackfriars and lounged about at mealtimes in obscure streets the stones of which may for anything i know be worn at this moment by my childish feet i wonder how many of these people were wanting in the crowd that used to come filing before me in review again to the echo of captain hopkinss voice
when my thoughts go back now to that slow agony of my youth i wonder how much of the histories i invented for such people hangs like a mist of fancy over wellremembered facts
when i tread the old ground i do not wonder that i seem to see and pity going on before me an innocent romantic boy making his imaginative world out of such strange experiences and sordid things
in due time mr micawbers petition was ripe for hearing and that gentleman was ordered to be discharged under the act to my great joy
his creditors were not implacable and mrs micawber informed me that even the revengeful bootmaker had declared in open court that he bore him no malice but that when money was owing to him he liked to be paid
he said he thought it was human nature
mr micawber returned to the kings bench when his case was over as some fees were to be settled and some formalities observed before he could be actually released
the club received him with transport and held an harmonic meeting that evening in his honour while mrs micawber and i had a lambs fry in private surrounded by the sleeping family
on such an occasion i will give you master copperfield said mrs micawber in a little more flip for we had been having some already the memory of my papa and mama are they dead maam i inquired after drinking the toast in a wineglass
my mama departed this life said mrs micawber before mr micawbers difficulties commenced or at least before they became pressing
my papa lived to bail mr micawber several times and then expired regretted by a numerous circle mrs micawber shook her head and dropped a pious tear upon the twin who happened to be in hand
as i could hardly hope for a more favourable opportunity of putting a question in which i had a near interest i said to mrs micawber may i ask maam what you and mr micawber intend to do now that mr micawber is out of his difficulties and at liberty
have you settled yet my family said mrs micawber who always said those two words with an air though i never could discover who came under the denomination my family are of opinion that mr micawber should quit london and exert his talents in the country
mr micawber is a man of great talent master copperfield i said i was sure of that
of great talent repeated mrs micawber
my family are of opinion that with a little interest something might be done for a man of his ability in the custom house
the influence of my family being local it is their wish that mr micawber should go down to plymouth
they think it indispensable that he should be upon the spot that he may be ready i suggested
exactly returned mrs micawber
that he may be readyin case of anything turning up and do you go too maam the events of the day in combination with the twins if not with the flip had made mrs micawber hysterical and she shed tears as she replied i never will desert mr micawber
mr micawber may have concealed his difficulties from me in the first instance but his sanguine temper may have led him to expect that he would overcome them
the pearl necklace and bracelets which i inherited from mama have been disposed of for less than half their value and the set of coral which was the wedding gift of my papa has been actually thrown away for nothing
but i never will desert mr micawber
no cried mrs micawber more affected than before i never will do it
its of no use asking me i felt quite uncomfortableas if mrs micawber supposed i had asked her to do anything of the sortand sat looking at her in alarm
mr
micawber has his faults
i do not deny that he is improvident
i do not deny that he has kept me in the dark as to his resources and his liabilities both she went on looking at the wall but i never will desert mr micawber mrs micawber having now raised her voice into a perfect scream i was so frightened that i ran off to the clubroom and disturbed mr micawber in the act of presiding at a long table and leading the chorus of gee up dobbin gee ho dobbin gee up dobbin gee up and gee hooo
with the tidings that mrs micawber was in an alarming state upon which he immediately burst into tears and came away with me with his waistcoat full of the heads and tails of shrimps of which he had been partaking
emma my angel cried mr micawber running into the room what is the matter i never will desert you micawber she exclaimed
my life said mr micawber taking her in his arms
i am perfectly aware of it he is the parent of my children
he is the father of my twins
he is the husband of my affections cried mrs micawber struggling and i neverwilldesert mr micawber mr micawber was so deeply affected by this proof of her devotion as to me i was dissolved in tears that he hung over her in a passionate manner imploring her to look up and to be calm
but the more he asked mrs micawber to look up the more she fixed her eyes on nothing and the more he asked her to compose herself the more she wouldnt
consequently mr micawber was soon so overcome that he mingled his tears with hers and mine until he begged me to do him the favour of taking a chair on the staircase while he got her into bed
i would have taken my leave for the night but he would not hear of my doing that until the strangers bell should ring
so i sat at the staircase window until he came out with another chair and joined me
how is mrs micawber now sir i said
very low said mr micawber shaking his head reaction
ah this has been a dreadful day
we stand alone noweverything is gone from us mr micawber pressed my hand and groaned and afterwards shed tears
i was greatly touched and disappointed too for i had expected that we should be quite gay on this happy and longlookedfor occasion
but mr and mrs micawber were so used to their old difficulties i think that they felt quite shipwrecked when they came to consider that they were released from them
all their elasticity was departed and i never saw them half so wretched as on this night insomuch that when the bell rang and mr micawber walked with me to the lodge and parted from me there with a blessing i felt quite afraid to leave him by himself he was so profoundly miserable
but through all the confusion and lowness of spirits in which we had been so unexpectedly to me involved i plainly discerned that mr and mrs micawber and their family were going away from london and that a parting between us was near at hand
it was in my walk home that night and in the sleepless hours which followed when i lay in bed that the thought first occurred to methough i dont know how it came into my headwhich afterwards shaped itself into a settled resolution
i had grown to be so accustomed to the micawbers and had been so intimate with them in their distresses and was so utterly friendless without them that the prospect of being thrown upon some new shift for a lodging and going once more among unknown people was like being that moment turned adrift into my present life with such a knowledge of it ready made as experience had given me
all the sensitive feelings it wounded so cruelly all the shame and misery it kept alive within my breast became more poignant as i thought of this and i determined that the life was unendurable
that there was no hope of escape from it unless the escape was my own act i knew quite well
i rarely heard from miss murdstone and never from mr murdstone but two or three parcels of made or mended clothes had come up for me consigned to mr quinion and in each there was a scrap of paper to the effect that j m trusted d c was applying himself to business and devoting himself wholly to his dutiesnot the least hint of my ever being anything else than the common drudge into which i was fast settling down
the very next day showed me while my mind was in the first agitation of what it had conceived that mrs micawber had not spoken of their going away without warrant
they took a lodging in the house where i lived for a week at the expiration of which time they were to start for plymouth
mr micawber himself came down to the countinghouse in the afternoon to tell mr quinion that he must relinquish me on the day of his departure and to give me a high character which i am sure i deserved
and mr quinion calling in tipp the carman who was a married man and had a room to let quartered me prospectively on himby our mutual consent as he had every reason to think for i said nothing though my resolution was now taken
i passed my evenings with mr and mrs micawber during the remaining term of our residence under the same roof and i think we became fonder of one another as the time went on
on the last sunday they invited me to dinner and we had a loin of pork and apple sauce and a pudding
i had bought a spotted wooden horse overnight as a parting gift to little wilkins micawberthat was the boyand a doll for little emma
i had also bestowed a shilling on the orfling who was about to be disbanded
we had a very pleasant day though we were all in a tender state about our approaching separation
i shall never master copperfield said mrs micawber revert to the period when mr micawber was in difficulties without thinking of you
your conduct has always been of the most delicate and obliging description
you have never been a lodger
you have been a friend my dear said mr micawber copperfield for so he had been accustomed to call me of late has a heart to feel for the distresses of his fellowcreatures when they are behind a cloud and a head to plan and a hand toin short a general ability to dispose of such available property as could be made away with i expressed my sense of this commendation and said i was very sorry we were going to lose one another
my dear young friend said mr micawber i am older than you a man of some experience in life andand of some experience in short in difficulties generally speaking
at present and until something turns up which i am i may say hourly expecting i have nothing to bestow but advice
still my advice is so far worth taking thatin short that i have never taken it myself and am thehere mr micawber who had been beaming and smiling all over his head and face up to the present moment checked himself and frownedthe miserable wretch you behold my dear micawber urged his wife
i say returned mr micawber quite forgetting himself and smiling again the miserable wretch you behold
my advice is never do tomorrow what you can do today
procrastination is the thief of time
collar him my poor papas maxim mrs micawber observed
my dear said mr micawber your papa was very well in his way and heaven forbid that i should disparage him
take him for all in all we neer shallin short make the acquaintance probably of anybody else possessing at his time of life the same legs for gaiters and able to read the same description of print without spectacles
but he applied that maxim to our marriage my dear and that was so far prematurely entered into in consequence that i never recovered the expense mr micawber looked aside at mrs micawber and added not that i am sorry for it
quite the contrary my love after which he was grave for a minute or so
my other piece of advice copperfield said mr micawber you know
annual income twenty pounds annual expenditure nineteen nineteen and six result happiness
annual income twenty pounds annual expenditure twenty pounds ought and six result misery
the blossom is blighted the leaf is withered the god of day goes down upon the dreary scene andand in short you are for ever floored
as i am to make his example the more impressive mr micawber drank a glass of punch with an air of great enjoyment and satisfaction and whistled the college hornpipe
i did not fail to assure him that i would store these precepts in my mind though indeed i had no need to do so for at the time they affected me visibly
next morning i met the whole family at the coach office and saw them with a desolate heart take their places outside at the back
master copperfield said mrs micawber god bless you
i never can forget all that you know and i never would if i could copperfield said mr micawber farewell
every happiness and prosperity
if in the progress of revolving years i could persuade myself that my blighted destiny had been a warning to you i should feel that i had not occupied another mans place in existence altogether in vain
in case of anything turning up of which i am rather confident i shall be extremely happy if it should be in my power to improve your prospects i think as mrs micawber sat at the back of the coach with the children and i stood in the road looking wistfully at them a mist cleared from her eyes and she saw what a little creature i really was
i think so because she beckoned to me to climb up with quite a new and motherly expression in her face and put her arm round my neck and gave me just such a kiss as she might have given to her own boy
i had barely time to get down again before the coach started and i could hardly see the family for the handkerchiefs they waved
it was gone in a minute
the orfling and i stood looking vacantly at each other in the middle of the road and then shook hands and said goodbye she going back i suppose to st lukes workhouse as i went to begin my weary day at murdstone and grinbys
but with no intention of passing many more weary days there
no
i had resolved to run awayto go by some means or other down into the country to the only relation i had in the world and tell my story to my aunt miss betsey
i have already observed that i dont know how this desperate idea came into my brain
but once there it remained there and hardened into a purpose than which i have never entertained a more determined purpose in my life
i am far from sure that i believed there was anything hopeful in it but my mind was thoroughly made up that it must be carried into execution
again and again and a hundred times again since the night when the thought had first occurred to me and banished sleep i had gone over that old story of my poor mothers about my birth which it had been one of my great delights in the old time to hear her tell and which i knew by heart
my aunt walked into that story and walked out of it a dread and awful personage but there was one little trait in her behaviour which i liked to dwell on and which gave me some faint shadow of encouragement
i could not forget how my mother had thought that she felt her touch her pretty hair with no ungentle hand and though it might have been altogether my mothers fancy and might have had no foundation whatever in fact i made a little picture out of it of my terrible aunt relenting towards the girlish beauty that i recollected so well and loved so much which softened the whole narrative
it is very possible that it had been in my mind a long time and had gradually engendered my determination
as i did not even know where miss betsey lived i wrote a long letter to peggotty and asked her incidentally if she remembered pretending that i had heard of such a lady living at a certain place i named at random and had a curiosity to know if it were the same
in the course of that letter i told peggotty that i had a particular occasion for half a guinea and that if she could lend me that sum until i could repay it i should be very much obliged to her and would tell her afterwards what i had wanted it for
peggottys answer soon arrived and was as usual full of affectionate devotion
she enclosed the half guinea i was afraid she must have had a world of trouble to get it out of mr barkiss box and told me that miss betsey lived near dover but whether at dover itself at hythe sandgate or folkestone she could not say
one of our men however informing me on my asking him about these places that they were all close together i deemed this enough for my object and resolved to set out at the end of that week
being a very honest little creature and unwilling to disgrace the memory i was going to leave behind me at murdstone and grinbys i considered myself bound to remain until saturday night and as i had been paid a weeks wages in advance when i first came there not to present myself in the countinghouse at the usual hour to receive my stipend
for this express reason i had borrowed the halfguinea that i might not be without a fund for my travellingexpenses
accordingly when the saturday night came and we were all waiting in the warehouse to be paid and tipp the carman who always took precedence went in first to draw his money i shook mick walker by the hand asked him when it came to his turn to be paid to say to mr quinion that i had gone to move my box to tipps and bidding a last good night to mealy potatoes ran away
my box was at my old lodging over the water and i had written a direction for it on the back of one of our address cards that we nailed on the casks master david to be left till called for at the coach office dover this i had in my pocket ready to put on the box after i should have got it out of the house and as i went towards my lodging i looked about me for someone who would help me to carry it to the bookingoffice
there was a longlegged young man with a very little empty donkeycart standing near the obelisk in the blackfriars road whose eye i caught as i was going by and who addressing me as sixpennorth of bad hapence hoped i should know him agin to swear toin allusion i have no doubt to my staring at him
i stopped to assure him that i had not done so in bad manners but uncertain whether he might or might not like a job
wot job said the longlegged young man
to move a box i answered
wot box said the longlegged young man
i told him mine which was down that street there and which i wanted him to take to the dover coach office for sixpence
done with you for a tanner said the longlegged young man and directly got upon his cart which was nothing but a large wooden tray on wheels and rattled away at such a rate that it was as much as i could do to keep pace with the donkey
there was a defiant manner about this young man and particularly about the way in which he chewed straw as he spoke to me that i did not much like as the bargain was made however i took him upstairs to the room i was leaving and we brought the box down and put it on his cart
now i was unwilling to put the directioncard on there lest any of my landlords family should fathom what i was doing and detain me so i said to the young man that i would be glad if he would stop for a minute when he came to the deadwall of the kings bench prison
the words were no sooner out of my mouth than he rattled away as if he my box the cart and the donkey were all equally mad and i was quite out of breath with running and calling after him when i caught him at the place appointed
being much flushed and excited i tumbled my halfguinea out of my pocket in pulling the card out
i put it in my mouth for safety and though my hands trembled a good deal had just tied the card on very much to my satisfaction when i felt myself violently chucked under the chin by the longlegged young man and saw my halfguinea fly out of my mouth into his hand
wot said the young man seizing me by my jacket collar with a frightful grin
this is a pollis case is it
youre agoing to bolt are you
come to the pollis you young warmin come to the pollis you give me my money back if you please said i very much frightened and leave me alone come to the pollis said the young man
you shall prove it yourn to the pollis give me my box and money will you i cried bursting into tears
the young man still replied come to the pollis and was dragging me against the donkey in a violent manner as if there were any affinity between that animal and a magistrate when he changed his mind jumped into the cart sat upon my box and exclaiming that he would drive to the pollis straight rattled away harder than ever
i ran after him as fast as i could but i had no breath to call out with and should not have dared to call out now if i had
i narrowly escaped being run over twenty times at least in half a mile
now i lost him now i saw him now i lost him now i was cut at with a whip now shouted at now down in the mud now up again now running into somebodys arms now running headlong at a post
at length confused by fright and heat and doubting whether half london might not by this time be turning out for my apprehension i left the young man to go where he would with my box and money and panting and crying but never stopping faced about for greenwich which i had understood was on the dover road taking very little more out of the world towards the retreat of my aunt miss betsey than i had brought into it on the night when my arrival gave her so much umbrage
for anything i know i may have had some wild idea of running all the way to dover when i gave up the pursuit of the young man with the donkeycart and started for greenwich
my scattered senses were soon collected as to that point if i had for i came to a stop in the kent road at a terrace with a piece of water before it and a great foolish image in the middle blowing a dry shell
here i sat down on a doorstep quite spent and exhausted with the efforts i had already made and with hardly breath enough to cry for the loss of my box and halfguinea
it was by this time dark i heard the clocks strike ten as i sat resting
but it was a summer night fortunately and fine weather
when i had recovered my breath and had got rid of a stifling sensation in my throat i rose up and went on
in the midst of my distress i had no notion of going back
i doubt if i should have had any though there had been a swiss snowdrift in the kent road
but my standing possessed of only threehalfpence in the world and i am sure i wonder how they came to be left in my pocket on a saturday night
troubled me none the less because i went on
i began to picture to myself as a scrap of newspaper intelligence my being found dead in a day or two under some hedge and i trudged on miserably though as fast as i could until i happened to pass a little shop where it was written up that ladies and gentlemens wardrobes were bought and that the best price was given for rags bones and kitchenstuff
the master of this shop was sitting at the door in his shirtsleeves smoking and as there were a great many coats and pairs of trousers dangling from the low ceiling and only two feeble candles burning inside to show what they were i fancied that he looked like a man of a revengeful disposition who had hung all his enemies and was enjoying himself
my late experiences with mr and mrs micawber suggested to me that here might be a means of keeping off the wolf for a little while
i went up the next bystreet took off my waistcoat rolled it neatly under my arm and came back to the shop door
if you please sir i said i am to sell this for a fair price mr dollobydolloby was the name over the shop door at leasttook the waistcoat stood his pipe on its head against the doorpost went into the shop followed by me snuffed the two candles with his fingers spread the waistcoat on the counter and looked at it there held it up against the light and looked at it there and ultimately said what do you call a price now for this here little weskit oh
you know best sir i returned modestly
i cant be buyer and seller too said mr dolloby
put a price on this here little weskit would eighteenpence bei hinted after some hesitation
mr dolloby rolled it up again and gave it me back
i should rob my family he said if i was to offer ninepence for it this was a disagreeable way of putting the business because it imposed upon me a perfect stranger the unpleasantness of asking mr dolloby to rob his family on my account
my circumstances being so very pressing however i said i would take ninepence for it if he pleased
mr dolloby not without some grumbling gave ninepence
i wished him good night and walked out of the shop the richer by that sum and the poorer by a waistcoat
but when i buttoned my jacket that was not much
indeed i foresaw pretty clearly that my jacket would go next and that i should have to make the best of my way to dover in a shirt and a pair of trousers and might deem myself lucky if i got there even in that trim
but my mind did not run so much on this as might be supposed
beyond a general impression of the distance before me and of the young man with the donkeycart having used me cruelly i think i had no very urgent sense of my difficulties when i once again set off with my ninepence in my pocket
a plan had occurred to me for passing the night which i was going to carry into execution
this was to lie behind the wall at the back of my old school in a corner where there used to be a haystack
i imagined it would be a kind of company to have the boys and the bedroom where i used to tell the stories so near me although the boys would know nothing of my being there and the bedroom would yield me no shelter
i had had a hard days work and was pretty well jaded when i came climbing out at last upon the level of blackheath
it cost me some trouble to find out salem house but i found it and i found a haystack in the corner and i lay down by it having first walked round the wall and looked up at the windows and seen that all was dark and silent within
never shall i forget the lonely sensation of first lying down without a roof above my head
sleep came upon me as it came on many other outcasts against whom housedoors were locked and housedogs barked that nightand i dreamed of lying on my old schoolbed talking to the boys in my room and found myself sitting upright with steerforths name upon my lips looking wildly at the stars that were glistening and glimmering above me
when i remembered where i was at that untimely hour a feeling stole upon me that made me get up afraid of i dont know what and walk about
but the fainter glimmering of the stars and the pale light in the sky where the day was coming reassured me and my eyes being very heavy i lay down again and sleptthough with a knowledge in my sleep that it was colduntil the warm beams of the sun and the ringing of the gettingup bell at salem house awoke me
if i could have hoped that steerforth was there i would have lurked about until he came out alone but i knew he must have left long since
traddles still remained perhaps but it was very doubtful and i had not sufficient confidence in his discretion or good luck however strong my reliance was on his good nature to wish to trust him with my situation
so i crept away from the wall as mr creakles boys were getting up and struck into the long dusty track which i had first known to be the dover road when i was one of them and when i little expected that any eyes would ever see me the wayfarer i was now upon it
what a different sunday morning from the old sunday morning at yarmouth
in due time i heard the churchbells ringing as i plodded on and i met people who were going to church and i passed a church or two where the congregation were inside and the sound of singing came out into the sunshine while the beadle sat and cooled himself in the shade of the porch or stood beneath the yewtree with his hand to his forehead glowering at me going by
but the peace and rest of the old sunday morning were on everything except me
that was the difference
i felt quite wicked in my dirt and dust with my tangled hair
but for the quiet picture i had conjured up of my mother in her youth and beauty weeping by the fire and my aunt relenting to her i hardly think i should have had the courage to go on until next day
but it always went before me and i followed
i got that sunday through threeandtwenty miles on the straight road though not very easily for i was new to that kind of toil
i see myself as evening closes in coming over the bridge at rochester footsore and tired and eating bread that i had bought for supper
one or two little houses with the notice lodgings for travellers hanging out had tempted me but i was afraid of spending the few pence i had and was even more afraid of the vicious looks of the trampers i had met or overtaken
i sought no shelter therefore but the sky and toiling into chathamwhich in that nights aspect is a mere dream of chalk and drawbridges and mastless ships in a muddy river roofed like noahs arkscrept at last upon a sort of grassgrown battery overhanging a lane where a sentry was walking to and fro
here i lay down near a cannon and happy in the society of the sentrys footsteps though he knew no more of my being above him than the boys at salem house had known of my lying by the wall slept soundly until morning
very stiff and sore of foot i was in the morning and quite dazed by the beating of drums and marching of troops which seemed to hem me in on every side when i went down towards the long narrow street
feeling that i could go but a very little way that day if i were to reserve any strength for getting to my journeys end i resolved to make the sale of my jacket its principal business
accordingly i took the jacket off that i might learn to do without it and carrying it under my arm began a tour of inspection of the various slopshops
it was a likely place to sell a jacket in for the dealers in secondhand clothes were numerous and were generally speaking on the lookout for customers at their shop doors
but as most of them had hanging up among their stock an officers coat or two epaulettes and all i was rendered timid by the costly nature of their dealings and walked about for a long time without offering my merchandise to anyone
this modesty of mine directed my attention to the marinestore shops and such shops as mr dollobys in preference to the regular dealers
at last i found one that i thought looked promising at the corner of a dirty lane ending in an enclosure full of stingingnettles against the palings of which some secondhand sailors clothes that seemed to have overflowed the shop were fluttering among some cots and rusty guns and oilskin hats and certain trays full of so many old rusty keys of so many sizes that they seemed various enough to open all the doors in the world
into this shop which was low and small and which was darkened rather than lighted by a little window overhung with clothes and was descended into by some steps i went with a palpitating heart which was not relieved when an ugly old man with the lower part of his face all covered with a stubbly grey beard rushed out of a dirty den behind it and seized me by the hair of my head
he was a dreadful old man to look at in a filthy flannel waistcoat and smelling terribly of rum
his bedstead covered with a tumbled and ragged piece of patchwork was in the den he had come from where another little window showed a prospect of more stingingnettles and a lame donkey
oh what do you want grinned this old man in a fierce monotonous whine
oh my eyes and limbs what do you want
oh my lungs and liver what do you want
oh goroo goroo i was so much dismayed by these words and particularly by the repetition of the last unknown one which was a kind of rattle in his throat that i could make no answer hereupon the old man still holding me by the hair repeated oh what do you want
oh my eyes and limbs what do you want
oh my lungs and liver what do you want
oh goroowhich he screwed out of himself with an energy that made his eyes start in his head
i wanted to know i said trembling if you would buy a jacket oh lets see the jacket cried the old man
oh my heart on fire show the jacket to us
oh my eyes and limbs bring the jacket out with that he took his trembling hands which were like the claws of a great bird out of my hair and put on a pair of spectacles not at all ornamental to his inflamed eyes
oh how much for the jacket cried the old man after examining it
ohgoroohow much for the jacket halfacrown i answered recovering myself
oh my lungs and liver cried the old man no
oh my eyes no
oh my limbs no
eighteenpence
goroo every time he uttered this ejaculation his eyes seemed to be in danger of starting out and every sentence he spoke he delivered in a sort of tune always exactly the same and more like a gust of wind which begins low mounts up high and falls again than any other comparison i can find for it
well said i glad to have closed the bargain ill take eighteenpence oh my liver cried the old man throwing the jacket on a shelf
get out of the shop
oh my lungs get out of the shop
oh my eyes and limbsgoroodont ask for money make it an exchange i never was so frightened in my life before or since but i told him humbly that i wanted money and that nothing else was of any use to me but that i would wait for it as he desired outside and had no wish to hurry him
so i went outside and sat down in the shade in a corner
and i sat there so many hours that the shade became sunlight and the sunlight became shade again and still i sat there waiting for the money
there never was such another drunken madman in that line of business i hope
that he was well known in the neighbourhood and enjoyed the reputation of having sold himself to the devil i soon understood from the visits he received from the boys who continually came skirmishing about the shop shouting that legend and calling to him to bring out his gold
you aint poor you know charley as you pretend
bring out your gold
bring out some of the gold you sold yourself to the devil for
come
its in the lining of the mattress charley
rip it open and lets have some this and many offers to lend him a knife for the purpose exasperated him to such a degree that the whole day was a succession of rushes on his part and flights on the part of the boys
sometimes in his rage he would take me for one of them and come at me mouthing as if he were going to tear me in pieces then remembering me just in time would dive into the shop and lie upon his bed as i thought from the sound of his voice yelling in a frantic way to his own windy tune the death of nelson with an oh
before every line and innumerable goroos interspersed
as if this were not bad enough for me the boys connecting me with the establishment on account of the patience and perseverance with which i sat outside halfdressed pelted me and used me very ill all day
he made many attempts to induce me to consent to an exchange at one time coming out with a fishingrod at another with a fiddle at another with a cocked hat at another with a flute
but i resisted all these overtures and sat there in desperation each time asking him with tears in my eyes for my money or my jacket
at last he began to pay me in halfpence at a time and was full two hours getting by easy stages to a shilling
oh my eyes and limbs he then cried peeping hideously out of the shop after a long pause will you go for twopence more i cant i said i shall be starved oh my lungs and liver will you go for threepence i would go for nothing if i could i said but i want the money badly oh goroo it is really impossible to express how he twisted this ejaculation out of himself as he peeped round the doorpost at me showing nothing but his crafty old head will you go for fourpence i was so faint and weary that i closed with this offer and taking the money out of his claw not without trembling went away more hungry and thirsty than i had ever been a little before sunset
but at an expense of threepence i soon refreshed myself completely and being in better spirits then limped seven miles upon my road
my bed at night was under another haystack where i rested comfortably after having washed my blistered feet in a stream and dressed them as well as i was able with some cool leaves
when i took the road again next morning i found that it lay through a succession of hopgrounds and orchards
it was sufficiently late in the year for the orchards to be ruddy with ripe apples and in a few places the hoppickers were already at work
i thought it all extremely beautiful and made up my mind to sleep among the hops that night imagining some cheerful companionship in the long perspectives of poles with the graceful leaves twining round them
the trampers were worse than ever that day and inspired me with a dread that is yet quite fresh in my mind
some of them were most ferociouslooking ruffians who stared at me as i went by and stopped perhaps and called after me to come back and speak to them and when i took to my heels stoned me
i recollect one young fellowa tinker i suppose from his wallet and brazierwho had a woman with him and who faced about and stared at me thus and then roared to me in such a tremendous voice to come back that i halted and looked round
come here when youre called said the tinker or ill rip your young body open i thought it best to go back
as i drew nearer to them trying to propitiate the tinker by my looks i observed that the woman had a black eye
where are you going said the tinker gripping the bosom of my shirt with his blackened hand
i am going to dover i said
where do you come from asked the tinker giving his hand another turn in my shirt to hold me more securely
i come from london i said
what lay are you upon asked the tinker
are you a prig nno i said
aint you by g
if you make a brag of your honesty to me said the tinker ill knock your brains out with his disengaged hand he made a menace of striking me and then looked at me from head to foot
have you got the price of a pint of beer about you said the tinker
if you have out with it afore i take it away i should certainly have produced it but that i met the womans look and saw her very slightly shake her head and form no with her lips
i am very poor i said attempting to smile and have got no money why what do you mean said the tinker looking so sternly at me that i almost feared he saw the money in my pocket
sir i stammered
what do you mean said the tinker by wearing my brothers silk handkerchief
give it over here and he had mine off my neck in a moment and tossed it to the woman
the woman burst into a fit of laughter as if she thought this a joke and tossed it back to me nodded once as slightly as before and made the word go with her lips
before i could obey however the tinker seized the handkerchief out of my hand with a roughness that threw me away like a feather and putting it loosely round his own neck turned upon the woman with an oath and knocked her down
i never shall forget seeing her fall backward on the hard road and lie there with her bonnet tumbled off and her hair all whitened in the dust nor when i looked back from a distance seeing her sitting on the pathway which was a bank by the roadside wiping the blood from her face with a corner of her shawl while he went on ahead
this adventure frightened me so that afterwards when i saw any of these people coming i turned back until i could find a hidingplace where i remained until they had gone out of sight which happened so often that i was very seriously delayed
but under this difficulty as under all the other difficulties of my journey i seemed to be sustained and led on by my fanciful picture of my mother in her youth before i came into the world
it always kept me company
it was there among the hops when i lay down to sleep it was with me on my waking in the morning it went before me all day
i have associated it ever since with the sunny street of canterbury dozing as it were in the hot light and with the sight of its old houses and gateways and the stately grey cathedral with the rooks sailing round the towers
when i came at last upon the bare wide downs near dover it relieved the solitary aspect of the scene with hope and not until i reached that first great aim of my journey and actually set foot in the town itself on the sixth day of my flight did it desert me
but then strange to say when i stood with my ragged shoes and my dusty sunburnt halfclothed figure in the place so long desired it seemed to vanish like a dream and to leave me helpless and dispirited
i inquired about my aunt among the boatmen first and received various answers
one said she lived in the south foreland light and had singed her whiskers by doing so another that she was made fast to the great buoy outside the harbour and could only be visited at halftide a third that she was locked up in maidstone jail for childstealing a fourth that she was seen to mount a broom in the last high wind and make direct for calais
the flydrivers among whom i inquired next were equally jocose and equally disrespectful and the shopkeepers not liking my appearance generally replied without hearing what i had to say that they had got nothing for me
i felt more miserable and destitute than i had done at any period of my running away
my money was all gone i had nothing left to dispose of i was hungry thirsty and worn out and seemed as distant from my end as if i had remained in london
the morning had worn away in these inquiries and i was sitting on the step of an empty shop at a street corner near the marketplace deliberating upon wandering towards those other places which had been mentioned when a flydriver coming by with his carriage dropped a horsecloth
something goodnatured in the mans face as i handed it up encouraged me to ask him if he could tell me where miss trotwood lived though i had asked the question so often that it almost died upon my lips
trotwood said he
let me see
i know the name too
old lady yes i said rather pretty stiff in the back said he making himself upright
yes i said
i should think it very likely carries a bag said hebag with a good deal of room in itis gruffish and comes down upon you sharp my heart sank within me as i acknowledged the undoubted accuracy of this description
why then i tell you what said he
if you go up there pointing with his whip towards the heights and keep right on till you come to some houses facing the sea i think youll hear of her
my opinion is she wont stand anything so heres a penny for you i accepted the gift thankfully and bought a loaf with it
dispatching this refreshment by the way i went in the direction my friend had indicated and walked on a good distance without coming to the houses he had mentioned
at length i saw some before me and approaching them went into a little shop it was what we used to call a general shop at home and inquired if they could have the goodness to tell me where miss trotwood lived
i addressed myself to a man behind the counter who was weighing some rice for a young woman but the latter taking the inquiry to herself turned round quickly
my mistress she said
what do you want with her boy i want i replied to speak to her if you please to beg of her you mean retorted the damsel
no i said indeed but suddenly remembering that in truth i came for no other purpose i held my peace in confusion and felt my face burn
my aunts handmaid as i supposed she was from what she had said put her rice in a little basket and walked out of the shop telling me that i could follow her if i wanted to know where miss trotwood lived
i needed no second permission though i was by this time in such a state of consternation and agitation that my legs shook under me
i followed the young woman and we soon came to a very neat little cottage with cheerful bowwindows in front of it a small square gravelled court or garden full of flowers carefully tended and smelling deliciously
this is miss trotwoods said the young woman
now you know and thats all i have got to say with which words she hurried into the house as if to shake off the responsibility of my appearance and left me standing at the gardengate looking disconsolately over the top of it towards the parlour window where a muslin curtain partly undrawn in the middle a large round green screen or fan fastened on to the windowsill a small table and a great chair suggested to me that my aunt might be at that moment seated in awful state
my shoes were by this time in a woeful condition
the soles had shed themselves bit by bit and the upper leathers had broken and burst until the very shape and form of shoes had departed from them
my hat which had served me for a nightcap too was so crushed and bent that no old battered handleless saucepan on a dunghill need have been ashamed to vie with it
my shirt and trousers stained with heat dew grass and the kentish soil on which i had sleptand torn besidesmight have frightened the birds from my aunts garden as i stood at the gate
my hair had known no comb or brush since i left london
my face neck and hands from unaccustomed exposure to the air and sun were burnt to a berrybrown
from head to foot i was powdered almost as white with chalk and dust as if i had come out of a limekiln
in this plight and with a strong consciousness of it i waited to introduce myself to and make my first impression on my formidable aunt
the unbroken stillness of the parlour window leading me to infer after a while that she was not there i lifted up my eyes to the window above it where i saw a florid pleasantlooking gentleman with a grey head who shut up one eye in a grotesque manner nodded his head at me several times shook it at me as often laughed and went away
i had been discomposed enough before but i was so much the more discomposed by this unexpected behaviour that i was on the point of slinking off to think how i had best proceed when there came out of the house a lady with her handkerchief tied over her cap and a pair of gardening gloves on her hands wearing a gardening pocket like a tollmans apron and carrying a great knife
i knew her immediately to be miss betsey for she came stalking out of the house exactly as my poor mother had so often described her stalking up our garden at blunderstone rookery
go away said miss betsey shaking her head and making a distant chop in the air with her knife
go along
no boys here i watched her with my heart at my lips as she marched to a corner of her garden and stooped to dig up some little root there
then without a scrap of courage but with a great deal of desperation i went softly in and stood beside her touching her with my finger
if you please maam i began
she started and looked up
if you please aunt eh exclaimed miss betsey in a tone of amazement i have never heard approached
if you please aunt i am your nephew oh lord said my aunt
and sat flat down in the gardenpath
i am david copperfield of blunderstone in suffolkwhere you came on the night when i was born and saw my dear mama
i have been very unhappy since she died
i have been slighted and taught nothing and thrown upon myself and put to work not fit for me
it made me run away to you
i was robbed at first setting out and have walked all the way and have never slept in a bed since i began the journey here my selfsupport gave way all at once and with a movement of my hands intended to show her my ragged state and call it to witness that i had suffered something i broke into a passion of crying which i suppose had been pent up within me all the week
my aunt with every sort of expression but wonder discharged from her countenance sat on the gravel staring at me until i began to cry when she got up in a great hurry collared me and took me into the parlour
her first proceeding there was to unlock a tall press bring out several bottles and pour some of the contents of each into my mouth
i think they must have been taken out at random for i am sure i tasted aniseed water anchovy sauce and salad dressing
when she had administered these restoratives as i was still quite hysterical and unable to control my sobs she put me on the sofa with a shawl under my head and the handkerchief from her own head under my feet lest i should sully the cover and then sitting herself down behind the green fan or screen i have already mentioned so that i could not see her face ejaculated at intervals mercy on us letting those exclamations off like minute guns
after a time she rang the bell
janet said my aunt when her servant came in
go upstairs give my compliments to mr dick and say i wish to speak to him janet looked a little surprised to see me lying stiffly on the sofa i was afraid to move lest it should be displeasing to my aunt but went on her errand
my aunt with her hands behind her walked up and down the room until the gentleman who had squinted at me from the upper window came in laughing
mr
dick said my aunt dont be a fool because nobody can be more discreet than you can when you choose
we all know that
so dont be a fool whatever you are the gentleman was serious immediately and looked at me i thought as if he would entreat me to say nothing about the window
mr
dick said my aunt you have heard me mention david copperfield
now dont pretend not to have a memory because you and i know better david copperfield said mr dick who did not appear to me to remember much about it
david copperfield
oh yes to be sure
david certainly well said my aunt this is his boyhis son
he would be as like his father as its possible to be if he was not so like his mother too his son said mr dick
davids son
indeed yes pursued my aunt and he has done a pretty piece of business
he has run away
ah
his sister betsey trotwood never would have run away my aunt shook her head firmly confident in the character and behaviour of the girl who never was born
oh
you think she wouldnt have run away said mr dick
bless and save the man exclaimed my aunt sharply how he talks
dont i know she wouldnt
she would have lived with her godmother and we should have been devoted to one another
where in the name of wonder should his sister betsey trotwood have run from or to nowhere said mr dick
well then returned my aunt softened by the reply how can you pretend to be woolgathering dick when you are as sharp as a surgeons lancet
now here you see young david copperfield and the question i put to you is what shall i do with him what shall you do with him said mr dick feebly scratching his head
oh
do with him yes said my aunt with a grave look and her forefinger held up
come
i want some very sound advice why if i was you said mr dick considering and looking vacantly at me i should the contemplation of me seemed to inspire him with a sudden idea and he added briskly i should wash him janet said my aunt turning round with a quiet triumph which i did not then understand mr
dick sets us all right
heat the bath although i was deeply interested in this dialogue i could not help observing my aunt mr dick and janet while it was in progress and completing a survey i had already been engaged in making of the room
my aunt was a tall hardfeatured lady but by no means illlooking
there was an inflexibility in her face in her voice in her gait and carriage amply sufficient to account for the effect she had made upon a gentle creature like my mother but her features were rather handsome than otherwise though unbending and austere
i particularly noticed that she had a very quick bright eye
her hair which was grey was arranged in two plain divisions under what i believe would be called a mobcap i mean a cap much more common then than now with sidepieces fastening under the chin
her dress was of a lavender colour and perfectly neat but scantily made as if she desired to be as little encumbered as possible
i remember that i thought it in form more like a ridinghabit with the superfluous skirt cut off than anything else
she wore at her side a gentlemans gold watch if i might judge from its size and make with an appropriate chain and seals she had some linen at her throat not unlike a shirtcollar and things at her wrists like little shirtwristbands
mr dick as i have already said was greyheaded and florid i should have said all about him in saying so had not his head been curiously bowednot by age it reminded me of one of mr creakles boys heads after a beatingand his grey eyes prominent and large with a strange kind of watery brightness in them that made me in combination with his vacant manner his submission to my aunt and his childish delight when she praised him suspect him of being a little mad though if he were mad how he came to be there puzzled me extremely
he was dressed like any other ordinary gentleman in a loose grey morning coat and waistcoat and white trousers and had his watch in his fob and his money in his pockets which he rattled as if he were very proud of it
janet was a pretty blooming girl of about nineteen or twenty and a perfect picture of neatness
though i made no further observation of her at the moment i may mention here what i did not discover until afterwards namely that she was one of a series of protegees whom my aunt had taken into her service expressly to educate in a renouncement of mankind and who had generally completed their abjuration by marrying the baker
the room was as neat as janet or my aunt
as i laid down my pen a moment since to think of it the air from the sea came blowing in again mixed with the perfume of the flowers and i saw the oldfashioned furniture brightly rubbed and polished my aunts inviolable chair and table by the round green fan in the bowwindow the druggetcovered carpet the cat the kettleholder the two canaries the old china the punchbowl full of dried roseleaves the tall press guarding all sorts of bottles and pots and wonderfully out of keeping with the rest my dusty self upon the sofa taking note of everything
janet had gone away to get the bath ready when my aunt to my great alarm became in one moment rigid with indignation and had hardly voice to cry out janet
donkeys upon which janet came running up the stairs as if the house were in flames darted out on a little piece of green in front and warned off two saddledonkeys ladyridden that had presumed to set hoof upon it while my aunt rushing out of the house seized the bridle of a third animal laden with a bestriding child turned him led him forth from those sacred precincts and boxed the ears of the unlucky urchin in attendance who had dared to profane that hallowed ground
to this hour i dont know whether my aunt had any lawful right of way over that patch of green but she had settled it in her own mind that she had and it was all the same to her
the one great outrage of her life demanding to be constantly avenged was the passage of a donkey over that immaculate spot
in whatever occupation she was engaged however interesting to her the conversation in which she was taking part a donkey turned the current of her ideas in a moment and she was upon him straight
jugs of water and wateringpots were kept in secret places ready to be discharged on the offending boys sticks were laid in ambush behind the door sallies were made at all hours and incessant war prevailed
perhaps this was an agreeable excitement to the donkeyboys or perhaps the more sagacious of the donkeys understanding how the case stood delighted with constitutional obstinacy in coming that way
i only know that there were three alarms before the bath was ready and that on the occasion of the last and most desperate of all i saw my aunt engage singlehanded with a sandyheaded lad of fifteen and bump his sandy head against her own gate before he seemed to comprehend what was the matter
these interruptions were of the more ridiculous to me because she was giving me broth out of a tablespoon at the time having firmly persuaded herself that i was actually starving and must receive nourishment at first in very small quantities and while my mouth was yet open to receive the spoon she would put it back into the basin cry janet
donkeys and go out to the assault
the bath was a great comfort
for i began to be sensible of acute pains in my limbs from lying out in the fields and was now so tired and low that i could hardly keep myself awake for five minutes together
when i had bathed they i mean my aunt and janet enrobed me in a shirt and a pair of trousers belonging to mr dick and tied me up in two or three great shawls
what sort of bundle i looked like i dont know but i felt a very hot one
feeling also very faint and drowsy i soon lay down on the sofa again and fell asleep
it might have been a dream originating in the fancy which had occupied my mind so long but i awoke with the impression that my aunt had come and bent over me and had put my hair away from my face and laid my head more comfortably and had then stood looking at me
the words pretty fellow or poor fellow seemed to be in my ears too but certainly there was nothing else when i awoke to lead me to believe that they had been uttered by my aunt who sat in the bowwindow gazing at the sea from behind the green fan which was mounted on a kind of swivel and turned any way
we dined soon after i awoke off a roast fowl and a pudding i sitting at table not unlike a trussed bird myself and moving my arms with considerable difficulty
but as my aunt had swathed me up i made no complaint of being inconvenienced
all this time i was deeply anxious to know what she was going to do with me but she took her dinner in profound silence except when she occasionally fixed her eyes on me sitting opposite and said mercy upon us which did not by any means relieve my anxiety
the cloth being drawn and some sherry put upon the table of which i had a glass my aunt sent up for mr dick again who joined us and looked as wise as he could when she requested him to attend to my story which she elicited from me gradually by a course of questions
during my recital she kept her eyes on mr dick who i thought would have gone to sleep but for that and who whensoever he lapsed into a smile was checked by a frown from my aunt
whatever possessed that poor unfortunate baby that she must go and be married again said my aunt when i had finished i cant conceive perhaps she fell in love with her second husband mr dick suggested
fell in love repeated my aunt
what do you mean
what business had she to do it perhaps mr dick simpered after thinking a little she did it for pleasure pleasure indeed replied my aunt
a mighty pleasure for the poor baby to fix her simple faith upon any dog of a fellow certain to illuse her in some way or other
what did she propose to herself i should like to know
she had had one husband
she had seen david copperfield out of the world who was always running after wax dolls from his cradle
she had got a babyoh there were a pair of babies when she gave birth to this child sitting here that friday nightand what more did she want mr dick secretly shook his head at me as if he thought there was no getting over this
she couldnt even have a baby like anybody else said my aunt
where was this childs sister betsey trotwood
not forthcoming
dont tell me mr dick seemed quite frightened
that little man of a doctor with his head on one side said my aunt jellips or whatever his name was what was he about
all he could do was to say to me like a robin redbreastas he isits a boy a boy
yah the imbecility of the whole set of em the heartiness of the ejaculation startled mr dick exceedingly and me too if i am to tell the truth
and then as if this was not enough and she had not stood sufficiently in the light of this childs sister betsey trotwood said my aunt she marries a second timegoes and marries a murdereror a man with a name like itand stands in this childs light
and the natural consequence is as anybody but a baby might have foreseen that he prowls and wanders
hes as like cain before he was grown up as he can be mr dick looked hard at me as if to identify me in this character
and then theres that woman with the pagan name said my aunt that peggotty she goes and gets married next
because she has not seen enough of the evil attending such things she goes and gets married next as the child relates
i only hope said my aunt shaking her head that her husband is one of those poker husbands who abound in the newspapers and will beat her well with one i could not bear to hear my old nurse so decried and made the subject of such a wish
i told my aunt that indeed she was mistaken
that peggotty was the best the truest the most faithful most devoted and most selfdenying friend and servant in the world who had ever loved me dearly who had ever loved my mother dearly who had held my mothers dying head upon her arm on whose face my mother had imprinted her last grateful kiss
and my remembrance of them both choking me i broke down as i was trying to say that her home was my home and that all she had was mine and that i would have gone to her for shelter but for her humble station which made me fear that i might bring some trouble on heri broke down i say as i was trying to say so and laid my face in my hands upon the table
well well said my aunt the child is right to stand by those who have stood by himjanet
donkeys i thoroughly believe that but for those unfortunate donkeys we should have come to a good understanding for my aunt had laid her hand on my shoulder and the impulse was upon me thus emboldened to embrace her and beseech her protection
but the interruption and the disorder she was thrown into by the struggle outside put an end to all softer ideas for the present and kept my aunt indignantly declaiming to mr dick about her determination to appeal for redress to the laws of her country and to bring actions for trespass against the whole donkey proprietorship of dover until teatime
after tea we sat at the windowon the lookout as i imagined from my aunts sharp expression of face for more invadersuntil dusk when janet set candles and a backgammonboard on the table and pulled down the blinds
now mr dick said my aunt with her grave look and her forefinger up as before i am going to ask you another question
look at this child davids son said mr dick with an attentive puzzled face
exactly so returned my aunt
what would you do with him now do with davids son said mr dick
ay replied my aunt with davids son oh said mr dick
yes
do withi should put him to bed janet cried my aunt with the same complacent triumph that i had remarked before
mr
dick sets us all right
if the bed is ready well take him up to it janet reporting it to be quite ready i was taken up to it kindly but in some sort like a prisoner my aunt going in front and janet bringing up the rear
the only circumstance which gave me any new hope was my aunts stopping on the stairs to inquire about a smell of fire that was prevalent there and janets replying that she had been making tinder down in the kitchen of my old shirt
but there were no other clothes in my room than the odd heap of things i wore and when i was left there with a little taper which my aunt forewarned me would burn exactly five minutes i heard them lock my door on the outside
turning these things over in my mind i deemed it possible that my aunt who could know nothing of me might suspect i had a habit of running away and took precautions on that account to have me in safe keeping
the room was a pleasant one at the top of the house overlooking the sea on which the moon was shining brilliantly
after i had said my prayers and the candle had burnt out i remember how i still sat looking at the moonlight on the water as if i could hope to read my fortune in it as in a bright book or to see my mother with her child coming from heaven along that shining path to look upon me as she had looked when i last saw her sweet face
i remember how the solemn feeling with which at length i turned my eyes away yielded to the sensation of gratitude and rest which the sight of the whitecurtained bedand how much more the lying softly down upon it nestling in the snowwhite sheetsinspired
i remember how i thought of all the solitary places under the night sky where i had slept and how i prayed that i never might be houseless any more and never might forget the houseless
i remember how i seemed to float then down the melancholy glory of that track upon the sea away into the world of dreams
on going down in the morning i found my aunt musing so profoundly over the breakfast table with her elbow on the tray that the contents of the urn had overflowed the teapot and were laying the whole tablecloth under water when my entrance put her meditations to flight
i felt sure that i had been the subject of her reflections and was more than ever anxious to know her intentions towards me
yet i dared not express my anxiety lest it should give her offence
my eyes however not being so much under control as my tongue were attracted towards my aunt very often during breakfast
i never could look at her for a few moments together but i found her looking at mein an odd thoughtful manner as if i were an immense way off instead of being on the other side of the small round table
when she had finished her breakfast my aunt very deliberately leaned back in her chair knitted her brows folded her arms and contemplated me at her leisure with such a fixedness of attention that i was quite overpowered by embarrassment
not having as yet finished my own breakfast i attempted to hide my confusion by proceeding with it but my knife tumbled over my fork my fork tripped up my knife i chipped bits of bacon a surprising height into the air instead of cutting them for my own eating and choked myself with my tea which persisted in going the wrong way instead of the right one until i gave in altogether and sat blushing under my aunts close scrutiny
hallo said my aunt after a long time
i looked up and met her sharp bright glance respectfully
i have written to him said my aunt
to to your fatherinlaw said my aunt
i have sent him a letter that ill trouble him to attend to or he and i will fall out i can tell him does he know where i am aunt i inquired alarmed
i have told him said my aunt with a nod
shall ibegiven up to him i faltered
i dont know said my aunt
we shall see oh
i cant think what i shall do i exclaimed if i have to go back to mr murdstone i dont know anything about it said my aunt shaking her head
i cant say i am sure
we shall see my spirits sank under these words and i became very downcast and heavy of heart
my aunt without appearing to take much heed of me put on a coarse apron with a bib which she took out of the press washed up the teacups with her own hands and when everything was washed and set in the tray again and the cloth folded and put on the top of the whole rang for janet to remove it
she next swept up the crumbs with a little broom putting on a pair of gloves first until there did not appear to be one microscopic speck left on the carpet next dusted and arranged the room which was dusted and arranged to a hairs breadth already
when all these tasks were performed to her satisfaction she took off the gloves and apron folded them up put them in the particular corner of the press from which they had been taken brought out her workbox to her own table in the open window and sat down with the green fan between her and the light to work
i wish youd go upstairs said my aunt as she threaded her needle and give my compliments to mr dick and ill be glad to know how he gets on with his memorial i rose with all alacrity to acquit myself of this commission
i suppose said my aunt eyeing me as narrowly as she had eyed the needle in threading it you think mr dick a short name eh i thought it was rather a short name yesterday i confessed
you are not to suppose that he hasnt got a longer name if he chose to use it said my aunt with a loftier air
bableymr richard bableythats the gentlemans true name i was going to suggest with a modest sense of my youth and the familiarity i had been already guilty of that i had better give him the full benefit of that name when my aunt went on to say but dont you call him by it whatever you do
he cant bear his name
thats a peculiarity of his
though i dont know that its much of a peculiarity either for he has been illused enough by some that bear it to have a mortal antipathy for it heaven knows
mr dick is his name here and everywhere else nowif he ever went anywhere else which he dont
so take care child you dont call him anything but mr dick i promised to obey and went upstairs with my message thinking as i went that if mr dick had been working at his memorial long at the same rate as i had seen him working at it through the open door when i came down he was probably getting on very well indeed
i found him still driving at it with a long pen and his head almost laid upon the paper
he was so intent upon it that i had ample leisure to observe the large paper kite in a corner the confusion of bundles of manuscript the number of pens and above all the quantity of ink which he seemed to have in in halfgallon jars by the dozen before he observed my being present
ha
phoebus said mr dick laying down his pen
how does the world go
ill tell you what he added in a lower tone i shouldnt wish it to be mentioned but its a here he beckoned to me and put his lips close to my earits a mad world
mad as bedlam boy said mr dick taking snuff from a round box on the table and laughing heartily
without presuming to give my opinion on this question i delivered my message
well said mr dick in answer my compliments to her and ii believe i have made a start
i think i have made a start said mr dick passing his hand among his grey hair and casting anything but a confident look at his manuscript
you have been to school yes sir i answered for a short time do you recollect the date said mr dick looking earnestly at me and taking up his pen to note it down when king charles the first had his head cut off i said i believed it happened in the year sixteen hundred and fortynine
well returned mr dick scratching his ear with his pen and looking dubiously at me
so the books say but i dont see how that can be
because if it was so long ago how could the people about him have made that mistake of putting some of the trouble out of his head after it was taken off into mine i was very much surprised by the inquiry but could give no information on this point
its very strange said mr dick with a despondent look upon his papers and with his hand among his hair again that i never can get that quite right
i never can make that perfectly clear
but no matter no matter he said cheerfully and rousing himself theres time enough
my compliments to miss trotwood i am getting on very well indeed i was going away when he directed my attention to the kite
what do you think of that for a kite he said
i answered that it was a beautiful one
i should think it must have been as much as seven feet high
i made it
well go and fly it you and i said mr dick
do you see this he showed me that it was covered with manuscript very closely and laboriously written but so plainly that as i looked along the lines i thought i saw some allusion to king charles the firsts head again in one or two places
theres plenty of string said mr dick and when it flies high it takes the facts a long way
thats my manner of diffusing em
i dont know where they may come down
its according to circumstances and the wind and so forth but i take my chance of that his face was so very mild and pleasant and had something so reverend in it though it was hale and hearty that i was not sure but that he was having a goodhumoured jest with me
so i laughed and he laughed and we parted the best friends possible
well child said my aunt when i went downstairs
and what of mr dick this morning i informed her that he sent his compliments and was getting on very well indeed
what do you think of him said my aunt
i had some shadowy idea of endeavouring to evade the question by replying that i thought him a very nice gentleman but my aunt was not to be so put off for she laid her work down in her lap and said folding her hands upon it come
your sister betsey trotwood would have told me what she thought of anyone directly
be as like your sister as you can and speak out is heis mr dicki ask because i dont know auntis he at all out of his mind then i stammered for i felt i was on dangerous ground
not a morsel said my aunt
oh indeed i observed faintly
if there is anything in the world said my aunt with great decision and force of manner that mr dick is not its that i had nothing better to offer than another timid oh indeed he has been called mad said my aunt
i have a selfish pleasure in saying he has been called mad or i should not have had the benefit of his society and advice for these last ten years and upwardsin fact ever since your sister betsey trotwood disappointed me so long as that i said
and nice people they were who had the audacity to call him mad pursued my aunt
mr
dick is a sort of distant connexion of mineit doesnt matter how i neednt enter into that
if it hadnt been for me his own brother would have shut him up for life
thats all i am afraid it was hypocritical in me but seeing that my aunt felt strongly on the subject i tried to look as if i felt strongly too
a proud fool said my aunt
because his brother was a little eccentricthough he is not half so eccentric as a good many peoplehe didnt like to have him visible about his house and sent him away to some private asylumplace though he had been left to his particular care by their deceased father who thought him almost a natural
and a wise man he must have been to think so
mad himself no doubt again as my aunt looked quite convinced i endeavoured to look quite convinced also
so i stepped in said my aunt and made him an offer
i said your brothers sanea great deal more sane than you are or ever will be it is to be hoped
let him have his little income and come and live with me
i am not afraid of him i am not proud i am ready to take care of him and shall not illtreat him as some people besides the asylumfolks have done after a good deal of squabbling said my aunt i got him and he has been here ever since
he is the most friendly and amenable creature in existence and as for advicebut nobody knows what that mans mind is except myself my aunt smoothed her dress and shook her head as if she smoothed defiance of the whole world out of the one and shook it out of the other
he had a favourite sister said my aunt a good creature and very kind to him
but she did what they all dotook a husband
and he did what they all domade her wretched
it had such an effect upon the mind of mr dick thats not madness i hope
that combined with his fear of his brother and his sense of his unkindness it threw him into a fever
that was before he came to me but the recollection of it is oppressive to him even now
did he say anything to you about king charles the first child yes aunt ah said my aunt rubbing her nose as if she were a little vexed
thats his allegorical way of expressing it
he connects his illness with great disturbance and agitation naturally and thats the figure or the simile or whatever its called which he chooses to use
and why shouldnt he if he thinks proper i said certainly aunt its not a businesslike way of speaking said my aunt nor a worldly way
i am aware of that and thats the reason why i insist upon it that there shant be a word about it in his memorial is it a memorial about his own history that he is writing aunt yes child said my aunt rubbing her nose again
he is memorializing the lord chancellor or the lord somebody or otherone of those people at all events who are paid to be memorializedabout his affairs
i suppose it will go in one of these days
he hasnt been able to draw it up yet without introducing that mode of expressing himself but it dont signify it keeps him employed in fact i found out afterwards that mr dick had been for upwards of ten years endeavouring to keep king charles the first out of the memorial but he had been constantly getting into it and was there now
i say again said my aunt nobody knows what that mans mind is except myself and hes the most amenable and friendly creature in existence
if he likes to fly a kite sometimes what of that
franklin used to fly a kite
he was a quaker or something of that sort if i am not mistaken
and a quaker flying a kite is a much more ridiculous object than anybody else if i could have supposed that my aunt had recounted these particulars for my especial behoof and as a piece of confidence in me i should have felt very much distinguished and should have augured favourably from such a mark of her good opinion
but i could hardly help observing that she had launched into them chiefly because the question was raised in her own mind and with very little reference to me though she had addressed herself to me in the absence of anybody else
at the same time i must say that the generosity of her championship of poor harmless mr dick not only inspired my young breast with some selfish hope for myself but warmed it unselfishly towards her
i believe that i began to know that there was something about my aunt notwithstanding her many eccentricities and odd humours to be honoured and trusted in
though she was just as sharp that day as on the day before and was in and out about the donkeys just as often and was thrown into a tremendous state of indignation when a young man going by ogled janet at a window which was one of the gravest misdemeanours that could be committed against my aunts dignity she seemed to me to command more of my respect if not less of my fear
the anxiety i underwent in the interval which necessarily elapsed before a reply could be received to her letter to mr murdstone was extreme but i made an endeavour to suppress it and to be as agreeable as i could in a quiet way both to my aunt and mr dick
the latter and i would have gone out to fly the great kite but that i had still no other clothes than the anything but ornamental garments with which i had been decorated on the first day and which confined me to the house except for an hour after dark when my aunt for my healths sake paraded me up and down on the cliff outside before going to bed
at length the reply from mr murdstone came and my aunt informed me to my infinite terror that he was coming to speak to her herself on the next day
on the next day still bundled up in my curious habiliments i sat counting the time flushed and heated by the conflict of sinking hopes and rising fears within me and waiting to be startled by the sight of the gloomy face whose nonarrival startled me every minute
my aunt was a little more imperious and stern than usual but i observed no other token of her preparing herself to receive the visitor so much dreaded by me
she sat at work in the window and i sat by with my thoughts running astray on all possible and impossible results of mr murdstones visit until pretty late in the afternoon
our dinner had been indefinitely postponed but it was growing so late that my aunt had ordered it to be got ready when she gave a sudden alarm of donkeys and to my consternation and amazement i beheld miss murdstone on a sidesaddle ride deliberately over the sacred piece of green and stop in front of the house looking about her
go along with you cried my aunt shaking her head and her fist at the window
you have no business there
how dare you trespass
go along
oh
you boldfaced thing my aunt was so exasperated by the coolness with which miss murdstone looked about her that i really believe she was motionless and unable for the moment to dart out according to custom
i seized the opportunity to inform her who it was and that the gentleman now coming near the offender for the way up was very steep and he had dropped behind was mr murdstone himself
i dont care who it is cried my aunt still shaking her head and gesticulating anything but welcome from the bowwindow
i wont be trespassed upon
i wont allow it
go away
janet turn him round
lead him off and i saw from behind my aunt a sort of hurried battlepiece in which the donkey stood resisting everybody with all his four legs planted different ways while janet tried to pull him round by the bridle mr murdstone tried to lead him on miss murdstone struck at janet with a parasol and several boys who had come to see the engagement shouted vigorously
but my aunt suddenly descrying among them the young malefactor who was the donkeys guardian and who was one of the most inveterate offenders against her though hardly in his teens rushed out to the scene of action pounced upon him captured him dragged him with his jacket over his head and his heels grinding the ground into the garden and calling upon janet to fetch the constables and justices that he might be taken tried and executed on the spot held him at bay there
this part of the business however did not last long for the young rascal being expert at a variety of feints and dodges of which my aunt had no conception soon went whooping away leaving some deep impressions of his nailed boots in the flowerbeds and taking his donkey in triumph with him
miss murdstone during the latter portion of the contest had dismounted and was now waiting with her brother at the bottom of the steps until my aunt should be at leisure to receive them
my aunt a little ruffled by the combat marched past them into the house with great dignity and took no notice of their presence until they were announced by janet
shall i go away aunt i asked trembling
no sir said my aunt
certainly not with which she pushed me into a corner near her and fenced me in with a chair as if it were a prison or a bar of justice
this position i continued to occupy during the whole interview and from it i now saw mr and miss murdstone enter the room
oh said my aunt i was not aware at first to whom i had the pleasure of objecting
but i dont allow anybody to ride over that turf
i make no exceptions
i dont allow anybody to do it your regulation is rather awkward to strangers said miss murdstone
is it said my aunt
mr murdstone seemed afraid of a renewal of hostilities and interposing began miss trotwood i beg your pardon observed my aunt with a keen look
you are the mr murdstone who married the widow of my late nephew david copperfield of blunderstone rookerythough why rookery i dont know i am said mr murdstone
youll excuse my saying sir returned my aunt that i think it would have been a much better and happier thing if you had left that poor child alone i so far agree with what miss trotwood has remarked observed miss murdstone bridling that i consider our lamented clara to have been in all essential respects a mere child it is a comfort to you and me maam said my aunt who are getting on in life and are not likely to be made unhappy by our personal attractions that nobody can say the same of us no doubt returned miss murdstone though i thought not with a very ready or gracious assent
and it certainly might have been as you say a better and happier thing for my brother if he had never entered into such a marriage
i have always been of that opinion i have no doubt you have said my aunt
janet ringing the bell my compliments to mr dick and beg him to come down until he came my aunt sat perfectly upright and stiff frowning at the wall
when he came my aunt performed the ceremony of introduction
mr
dick
an old and intimate friend
on whose judgement said my aunt with emphasis as an admonition to mr dick who was biting his forefinger and looking rather foolish i rely mr dick took his finger out of his mouth on this hint and stood among the group with a grave and attentive expression of face
my aunt inclined her head to mr murdstone who went on miss trotwood on the receipt of your letter i considered it an act of greater justice to myself and perhaps of more respect to you thank you said my aunt still eyeing him keenly
you neednt mind me to answer it in person however inconvenient the journey pursued mr murdstone rather than by letter
this unhappy boy who has run away from his friends and his occupation and whose appearance interposed his sister directing general attention to me in my indefinable costume is perfectly scandalous and disgraceful jane murdstone said her brother have the goodness not to interrupt me
this unhappy boy miss trotwood has been the occasion of much domestic trouble and uneasiness both during the lifetime of my late dear wife and since
he has a sullen rebellious spirit a violent temper and an untoward intractable disposition
both my sister and myself have endeavoured to correct his vices but ineffectually
and i have feltwe both have felt i may say my sister being fully in my confidencethat it is right you should receive this grave and dispassionate assurance from our lips it can hardly be necessary for me to confirm anything stated by my brother said miss murdstone but i beg to observe that of all the boys in the world i believe this is the worst boy strong said my aunt shortly
but not at all too strong for the facts returned miss murdstone
ha said my aunt
well sir i have my own opinions resumed mr murdstone whose face darkened more and more the more he and my aunt observed each other which they did very narrowly as to the best mode of bringing him up they are founded in part on my knowledge of him and in part on my knowledge of my own means and resources
i am responsible for them to myself i act upon them and i say no more about them
it is enough that i place this boy under the eye of a friend of my own in a respectable business that it does not please him that he runs away from it makes himself a common vagabond about the country and comes here in rags to appeal to you miss trotwood
i wish to set before you honourably the exact consequencesso far as they are within my knowledgeof your abetting him in this appeal but about the respectable business first said my aunt
if he had been your own boy you would have put him to it just the same i suppose if he had been my brothers own boy returned miss murdstone striking in his character i trust would have been altogether different or if the poor child his mother had been alive he would still have gone into the respectable business would he said my aunt
i believe said mr murdstone with an inclination of his head that clara would have disputed nothing which myself and my sister jane murdstone were agreed was for the best miss murdstone confirmed this with an audible murmur
humph said my aunt
unfortunate baby mr dick who had been rattling his money all this time was rattling it so loudly now that my aunt felt it necessary to check him with a look before saying the poor childs annuity died with her died with her replied mr murdstone
and there was no settlement of the little propertythe house and gardenthe whatsitsname rookery without any rooks in itupon her boy it had been left to her unconditionally by her first husband mr murdstone began when my aunt caught him up with the greatest irascibility and impatience
good lord man theres no occasion to say that
left to her unconditionally
i think i see david copperfield looking forward to any condition of any sort or kind though it stared him pointblank in the face
of course it was left to her unconditionally
but when she married againwhen she took that most disastrous step of marrying you in short said my aunt to be plaindid no one put in a word for the boy at that time my late wife loved her second husband maam said mr murdstone and trusted implicitly in him your late wife sir was a most unworldly most unhappy most unfortunate baby returned my aunt shaking her head at him
thats what she was
and now what have you got to say next merely this miss trotwood he returned
i am here to take david backto take him back unconditionally to dispose of him as i think proper and to deal with him as i think right
i am not here to make any promise or give any pledge to anybody
you may possibly have some idea miss trotwood of abetting him in his running away and in his complaints to you
your manner which i must say does not seem intended to propitiate induces me to think it possible
now i must caution you that if you abet him once you abet him for good and all if you step in between him and me now you must step in miss trotwood for ever
i cannot trifle or be trifled with
i am here for the first and last time to take him away
is he ready to go
if he is notand you tell me he is not on any pretence it is indifferent to me whatmy doors are shut against him henceforth and yours i take it for granted are open to him to this address my aunt had listened with the closest attention sitting perfectly upright with her hands folded on one knee and looking grimly on the speaker
when he had finished she turned her eyes so as to command miss murdstone without otherwise disturbing her attitude and said well maam have you got anything to remark indeed miss trotwood said miss murdstone all that i could say has been so well said by my brother and all that i know to be the fact has been so plainly stated by him that i have nothing to add except my thanks for your politeness
for your very great politeness i am sure said miss murdstone with an irony which no more affected my aunt than it discomposed the cannon i had slept by at chatham
and what does the boy say said my aunt
are you ready to go david i answered no and entreated her not to let me go
i said that neither mr nor miss murdstone had ever liked me or had ever been kind to me
that they had made my mama who always loved me dearly unhappy about me and that i knew it well and that peggotty knew it
i said that i had been more miserable than i thought anybody could believe who only knew how young i was
and i begged and prayed my aunti forget in what terms now but i remember that they affected me very much thento befriend and protect me for my fathers sake
mr
dick said my aunt what shall i do with this child mr dick considered hesitated brightened and rejoined have him measured for a suit of clothes directly mr
dick said my aunt triumphantly give me your hand for your common sense is invaluable having shaken it with great cordiality she pulled me towards her and said to mr murdstone you can go when you like ill take my chance with the boy
if hes all you say he is at least i can do as much for him then as you have done
but i dont believe a word of it miss trotwood rejoined mr murdstone shrugging his shoulders as he rose if you were a gentleman bah
stuff and nonsense said my aunt
dont talk to me how exquisitely polite exclaimed miss murdstone rising
overpowering really do you think i dont know said my aunt turning a deaf ear to the sister and continuing to address the brother and to shake her head at him with infinite expression what kind of life you must have led that poor unhappy misdirected baby
do you think i dont know what a woeful day it was for the soft little creature when you first came in her waysmirking and making great eyes at her ill be bound as if you couldnt say boh
to a goose i never heard anything so elegant said miss murdstone
do you think i cant understand you as well as if i had seen you pursued my aunt now that i do see and hear youwhich i tell you candidly is anything but a pleasure to me
oh yes bless us
who so smooth and silky as mr murdstone at first
the poor benighted innocent had never seen such a man
he was made of sweetness
he worshipped her
he doted on her boytenderly doted on him
he was to be another father to him and they were all to live together in a garden of roses werent they
ugh
get along with you do said my aunt
i never heard anything like this person in my life exclaimed miss murdstone
and when you had made sure of the poor little fool said my auntgod forgive me that i should call her so and she gone where you wont go in a hurrybecause you had not done wrong enough to her and hers you must begin to train her must you
begin to break her like a poor caged bird and wear her deluded life away in teaching her to sing your notes this is either insanity or intoxication said miss murdstone in a perfect agony at not being able to turn the current of my aunts address towards herself and my suspicion is that its intoxication miss betsey without taking the least notice of the interruption continued to address herself to mr murdstone as if there had been no such thing
mr
murdstone she said shaking her finger at him you were a tyrant to the simple baby and you broke her heart
she was a loving babyi know that i knew it years before you ever saw herand through the best part of her weakness you gave her the wounds she died of
there is the truth for your comfort however you like it
and you and your instruments may make the most of it allow me to inquire miss trotwood interposed miss murdstone whom you are pleased to call in a choice of words in which i am not experienced my brothers instruments it was clear enough as i have told you years before you ever saw herand why in the mysterious dispensations of providence you ever did see her is more than humanity can comprehendit was clear enough that the poor soft little thing would marry somebody at some time or other but i did hope it wouldnt have been as bad as it has turned out
that was the time mr murdstone when she gave birth to her boy here said my aunt to the poor child you sometimes tormented her through afterwards which is a disagreeable remembrance and makes the sight of him odious now
aye aye
you neednt wince said my aunt
i know its true without that he had stood by the door all this while observant of her with a smile upon his face though his black eyebrows were heavily contracted
i remarked now that though the smile was on his face still his colour had gone in a moment and he seemed to breathe as if he had been running
good day sir said my aunt and goodbye
good day to you too maam said my aunt turning suddenly upon his sister
let me see you ride a donkey over my green again and as sure as you have a head upon your shoulders ill knock your bonnet off and tread upon it it would require a painter and no common painter too to depict my aunts face as she delivered herself of this very unexpected sentiment and miss murdstones face as she heard it
but the manner of the speech no less than the matter was so fiery that miss murdstone without a word in answer discreetly put her arm through her brothers and walked haughtily out of the cottage my aunt remaining in the window looking after them prepared i have no doubt in case of the donkeys reappearance to carry her threat into instant execution
no attempt at defiance being made however her face gradually relaxed and became so pleasant that i was emboldened to kiss and thank her which i did with great heartiness and with both my arms clasped round her neck
i then shook hands with mr dick who shook hands with me a great many times and hailed this happy close of the proceedings with repeated bursts of laughter
youll consider yourself guardian jointly with me of this child mr dick said my aunt
i shall be delighted said mr dick to be the guardian of davids son very good returned my aunt thats settled
i have been thinking do you know mr dick that i might call him trotwood certainly certainly
call him trotwood certainly said mr dick
davids sons trotwood trotwood copperfield you mean returned my aunt
yes to be sure
yes
trotwood copperfield said mr dick a little abashed
my aunt took so kindly to the notion that some readymade clothes which were purchased for me that afternoon were marked trotwood copperfield in her own handwriting and in indelible markingink before i put them on and it was settled that all the other clothes which were ordered to be made for me a complete outfit was bespoke that afternoon should be marked in the same way
thus i began my new life in a new name and with everything new about me
now that the state of doubt was over i felt for many days like one in a dream
i never thought that i had a curious couple of guardians in my aunt and mr dick
i never thought of anything about myself distinctly
the two things clearest in my mind were that a remoteness had come upon the old blunderstone lifewhich seemed to lie in the haze of an immeasurable distance and that a curtain had for ever fallen on my life at murdstone and grinbys
no one has ever raised that curtain since
i have lifted it for a moment even in this narrative with a reluctant hand and dropped it gladly
the remembrance of that life is fraught with so much pain to me with so much mental suffering and want of hope that i have never had the courage even to examine how long i was doomed to lead it
whether it lasted for a year or more or less i do not know
i only know that it was and ceased to be and that i have written and there i leave it
mr dick and i soon became the best of friends and very often when his days work was done went out together to fly the great kite
every day of his life he had a long sitting at the memorial which never made the least progress however hard he laboured for king charles the first always strayed into it sooner or later and then it was thrown aside and another one begun
the patience and hope with which he bore these perpetual disappointments the mild perception he had that there was something wrong about king charles the first the feeble efforts he made to keep him out and the certainty with which he came in and tumbled the memorial out of all shape made a deep impression on me
what mr dick supposed would come of the memorial if it were completed where he thought it was to go or what he thought it was to do he knew no more than anybody else i believe
nor was it at all necessary that he should trouble himself with such questions for if anything were certain under the sun it was certain that the memorial never would be finished
it was quite an affecting sight i used to think to see him with the kite when it was up a great height in the air
what he had told me in his room about his belief in its disseminating the statements pasted on it which were nothing but old leaves of abortive memorials might have been a fancy with him sometimes but not when he was out looking up at the kite in the sky and feeling it pull and tug at his hand
he never looked so serene as he did then
i used to fancy as i sat by him of an evening on a green slope and saw him watch the kite high in the quiet air that it lifted his mind out of its confusion and bore it such was my boyish thought into the skies
as he wound the string in and it came lower and lower down out of the beautiful light until it fluttered to the ground and lay there like a dead thing he seemed to wake gradually out of a dream and i remember to have seen him take it up and look about him in a lost way as if they had both come down together so that i pitied him with all my heart
while i advanced in friendship and intimacy with mr dick i did not go backward in the favour of his staunch friend my aunt
she took so kindly to me that in the course of a few weeks she shortened my adopted name of trotwood into trot and even encouraged me to hope that if i went on as i had begun i might take equal rank in her affections with my sister betsey trotwood
trot said my aunt one evening when the backgammonboard was placed as usual for herself and mr dick we must not forget your education this was my only subject of anxiety and i felt quite delighted by her referring to it
should you like to go to school at canterbury said my aunt
i replied that i should like it very much as it was so near her
good said my aunt
should you like to go tomorrow being already no stranger to the general rapidity of my aunts evolutions i was not surprised by the suddenness of the proposal and said yes good said my aunt again
janet hire the grey pony and chaise tomorrow morning at ten oclock and pack up master trotwoods clothes tonight i was greatly elated by these orders but my heart smote me for my selfishness when i witnessed their effect on mr dick who was so lowspirited at the prospect of our separation and played so ill in consequence that my aunt after giving him several admonitory raps on the knuckles with her dicebox shut up the board and declined to play with him any more
but on hearing from my aunt that i should sometimes come over on a saturday and that he could sometimes come and see me on a wednesday he revived and vowed to make another kite for those occasions of proportions greatly surpassing the present one
in the morning he was downhearted again and would have sustained himself by giving me all the money he had in his possession gold and silver too if my aunt had not interposed and limited the gift to five shillings which at his earnest petition were afterwards increased to ten
we parted at the gardengate in a most affectionate manner and mr dick did not go into the house until my aunt had driven me out of sight of it
my aunt who was perfectly indifferent to public opinion drove the grey pony through dover in a masterly manner sitting high and stiff like a state coachman keeping a steady eye upon him wherever he went and making a point of not letting him have his own way in any respect
when we came into the country road she permitted him to relax a little however and looking at me down in a valley of cushion by her side asked me whether i was happy
very happy indeed thank you aunt i said
she was much gratified and both her hands being occupied patted me on the head with her whip
is it a large school aunt i asked
why i dont know said my aunt
we are going to mr wickfields first does he keep a school i asked
no trot said my aunt
he keeps an office i asked for no more information about mr wickfield as she offered none and we conversed on other subjects until we came to canterbury where as it was marketday my aunt had a great opportunity of insinuating the grey pony among carts baskets vegetables and hucksters goods
the hairbreadth turns and twists we made drew down upon us a variety of speeches from the people standing about which were not always complimentary but my aunt drove on with perfect indifference and i dare say would have taken her own way with as much coolness through an enemys country
at length we stopped before a very old house bulging out over the road a house with long low latticewindows bulging out still farther and beams with carved heads on the ends bulging out too so that i fancied the whole house was leaning forward trying to see who was passing on the narrow pavement below
it was quite spotless in its cleanliness
the oldfashioned brass knocker on the low arched door ornamented with carved garlands of fruit and flowers twinkled like a star the two stone steps descending to the door were as white as if they had been covered with fair linen and all the angles and corners and carvings and mouldings and quaint little panes of glass and quainter little windows though as old as the hills were as pure as any snow that ever fell upon the hills
when the ponychaise stopped at the door and my eyes were intent upon the house i saw a cadaverous face appear at a small window on the ground floor in a little round tower that formed one side of the house and quickly disappear
the low arched door then opened and the face came out
it was quite as cadaverous as it had looked in the window though in the grain of it there was that tinge of red which is sometimes to be observed in the skins of redhaired people
it belonged to a redhaired persona youth of fifteen as i take it now but looking much olderwhose hair was cropped as close as the closest stubble who had hardly any eyebrows and no eyelashes and eyes of a redbrown so unsheltered and unshaded that i remember wondering how he went to sleep
he was highshouldered and bony dressed in decent black with a white wisp of a neckcloth buttoned up to the throat and had a long lank skeleton hand which particularly attracted my attention as he stood at the ponys head rubbing his chin with it and looking up at us in the chaise
is mr wickfield at home uriah heep said my aunt
mr
wickfields at home maam said uriah heep if youll please to walk in therepointing with his long hand to the room he meant
we got out and leaving him to hold the pony went into a long low parlour looking towards the street from the window of which i caught a glimpse as i went in of uriah heep breathing into the ponys nostrils and immediately covering them with his hand as if he were putting some spell upon him
opposite to the tall old chimneypiece were two portraits one of a gentleman with grey hair though not by any means an old man and black eyebrows who was looking over some papers tied together with red tape the other of a lady with a very placid and sweet expression of face who was looking at me
i believe i was turning about in search of uriahs picture when a door at the farther end of the room opening a gentleman entered at sight of whom i turned to the firstmentioned portrait again to make quite sure that it had not come out of its frame
but it was stationary and as the gentleman advanced into the light i saw that he was some years older than when he had had his picture painted
miss betsey trotwood said the gentleman pray walk in
i was engaged for a moment but youll excuse my being busy
you know my motive
i have but one in life miss betsey thanked him and we went into his room which was furnished as an office with books papers tin boxes and so forth
it looked into a garden and had an iron safe let into the wall so immediately over the mantelshelf that i wondered as i sat down how the sweeps got round it when they swept the chimney
well miss trotwood said mr wickfield for i soon found that it was he and that he was a lawyer and steward of the estates of a rich gentleman of the county what wind blows you here
not an ill wind i hope no replied my aunt
i have not come for any law thats right maam said mr wickfield
you had better come for anything else his hair was quite white now though his eyebrows were still black
he had a very agreeable face and i thought was handsome
there was a certain richness in his complexion which i had been long accustomed under peggottys tuition to connect with port wine and i fancied it was in his voice too and referred his growing corpulency to the same cause
he was very cleanly dressed in a blue coat striped waistcoat and nankeen trousers and his fine frilled shirt and cambric neckcloth looked unusually soft and white reminding my strolling fancy i call to mind of the plumage on the breast of a swan
this is my nephew said my aunt
wasnt aware you had one miss trotwood said mr wickfield
my grandnephew that is to say observed my aunt
wasnt aware you had a grandnephew i give you my word said mr wickfield
i have adopted him said my aunt with a wave of her hand importing that his knowledge and his ignorance were all one to her and i have brought him here to put to a school where he may be thoroughly well taught and well treated
now tell me where that school is and what it is and all about it before i can advise you properly said mr wickfieldthe old question you know
whats your motive in this deuce take the man exclaimed my aunt
always fishing for motives when theyre on the surface
why to make the child happy and useful it must be a mixed motive i think said mr wickfield shaking his head and smiling incredulously
a mixed fiddlestick returned my aunt
you claim to have one plain motive in all you do yourself
you dont suppose i hope that you are the only plain dealer in the world ay but i have only one motive in life miss trotwood he rejoined smiling
other people have dozens scores hundreds
i have only one
theres the difference
however thats beside the question
the best school
whatever the motive you want the best my aunt nodded assent
at the best we have said mr wickfield considering your nephew couldnt board just now but he could board somewhere else i suppose suggested my aunt
mr wickfield thought i could
after a little discussion he proposed to take my aunt to the school that she might see it and judge for herself also to take her with the same object to two or three houses where he thought i could be boarded
my aunt embracing the proposal we were all three going out together when he stopped and said our little friend here might have some motive perhaps for objecting to the arrangements
i think we had better leave him behind my aunt seemed disposed to contest the point but to facilitate matters i said i would gladly remain behind if they pleased and returned into mr wickfields office where i sat down again in the chair i had first occupied to await their return
it so happened that this chair was opposite a narrow passage which ended in the little circular room where i had seen uriah heeps pale face looking out of the window
uriah having taken the pony to a neighbouring stable was at work at a desk in this room which had a brass frame on the top to hang paper upon and on which the writing he was making a copy of was then hanging
though his face was towards me i thought for some time the writing being between us that he could not see me but looking that way more attentively it made me uncomfortable to observe that every now and then his sleepless eyes would come below the writing like two red suns and stealthily stare at me for i dare say a whole minute at a time during which his pen went or pretended to go as cleverly as ever
i made several attempts to get out of their waysuch as standing on a chair to look at a map on the other side of the room and poring over the columns of a kentish newspaperbut they always attracted me back again and whenever i looked towards those two red suns i was sure to find them either just rising or just setting
at length much to my relief my aunt and mr wickfield came back after a pretty long absence
they were not so successful as i could have wished for though the advantages of the school were undeniable my aunt had not approved of any of the boardinghouses proposed for me
its very unfortunate said my aunt
i dont know what to do trot it does happen unfortunately said mr wickfield
but ill tell you what you can do miss trotwood whats that inquired my aunt
leave your nephew here for the present
hes a quiet fellow
he wont disturb me at all
its a capital house for study
as quiet as a monastery and almost as roomy
leave him here my aunt evidently liked the offer though she was delicate of accepting it
so did i
come miss trotwood said mr wickfield
this is the way out of the difficulty
its only a temporary arrangement you know
if it dont act well or dont quite accord with our mutual convenience he can easily go to the rightabout
there will be time to find some better place for him in the meanwhile
you had better determine to leave him here for the present i am very much obliged to you said my aunt and so is he i see but come
i know what you mean cried mr wickfield
you shall not be oppressed by the receipt of favours miss trotwood
you may pay for him if you like
we wont be hard about terms but you shall pay if you will on that understanding said my aunt though it doesnt lessen the real obligation i shall be very glad to leave him then come and see my little housekeeper said mr wickfield
we accordingly went up a wonderful old staircase with a balustrade so broad that we might have gone up that almost as easily and into a shady old drawingroom lighted by some three or four of the quaint windows i had looked up at from the street which had old oak seats in them that seemed to have come of the same trees as the shining oak floor and the great beams in the ceiling
it was a prettily furnished room with a piano and some lively furniture in red and green and some flowers
it seemed to be all old nooks and corners and in every nook and corner there was some queer little table or cupboard or bookcase or seat or something or other that made me think there was not such another good corner in the room until i looked at the next one and found it equal to it if not better
on everything there was the same air of retirement and cleanliness that marked the house outside
mr wickfield tapped at a door in a corner of the panelled wall and a girl of about my own age came quickly out and kissed him
on her face i saw immediately the placid and sweet expression of the lady whose picture had looked at me downstairs
it seemed to my imagination as if the portrait had grown womanly and the original remained a child
although her face was quite bright and happy there was a tranquillity about it and about hera quiet good calm spiritthat i never have forgotten that i shall never forget
this was his little housekeeper his daughter agnes mr wickfield said
when i heard how he said it and saw how he held her hand i guessed what the one motive of his life was
she had a little baskettrifle hanging at her side with keys in it and she looked as staid and as discreet a housekeeper as the old house could have
she listened to her father as he told her about me with a pleasant face and when he had concluded proposed to my aunt that we should go upstairs and see my room
we all went together she before us and a glorious old room it was with more oak beams and diamond panes and the broad balustrade going all the way up to it
i cannot call to mind where or when in my childhood i had seen a stained glass window in a church
nor do i recollect its subject
but i know that when i saw her turn round in the grave light of the old staircase and wait for us above i thought of that window and i associated something of its tranquil brightness with agnes wickfield ever afterwards
my aunt was as happy as i was in the arrangement made for me and we went down to the drawingroom again well pleased and gratified
as she would not hear of staying to dinner lest she should by any chance fail to arrive at home with the grey pony before dark and as i apprehend mr wickfield knew her too well to argue any point with her some lunch was provided for her there and agnes went back to her governess and mr wickfield to his office
so we were left to take leave of one another without any restraint
she told me that everything would be arranged for me by mr wickfield and that i should want for nothing and gave me the kindest words and the best advice
trot said my aunt in conclusion be a credit to yourself to me and mr dick and heaven be with you i was greatly overcome and could only thank her again and again and send my love to mr dick
never said my aunt be mean in anything never be false never be cruel
avoid those three vices trot and i can always be hopeful of you i promised as well as i could that i would not abuse her kindness or forget her admonition
the ponys at the door said my aunt and i am off
stay here with these words she embraced me hastily and went out of the room shutting the door after her
at first i was startled by so abrupt a departure and almost feared i had displeased her but when i looked into the street and saw how dejectedly she got into the chaise and drove away without looking up i understood her better and did not do her that injustice
by five oclock which was mr wickfields dinnerhour i had mustered up my spirits again and was ready for my knife and fork
the cloth was only laid for us two but agnes was waiting in the drawingroom before dinner went down with her father and sat opposite to him at table
i doubted whether he could have dined without her
we did not stay there after dinner but came upstairs into the drawingroom again in one snug corner of which agnes set glasses for her father and a decanter of port wine
i thought he would have missed its usual flavour if it had been put there for him by any other hands
there he sat taking his wine and taking a good deal of it for two hours while agnes played on the piano worked and talked to him and me
he was for the most part gay and cheerful with us but sometimes his eyes rested on her and he fell into a brooding state and was silent
she always observed this quickly i thought and always roused him with a question or caress
then he came out of his meditation and drank more wine
agnes made the tea and presided over it and the time passed away after it as after dinner until she went to bed when her father took her in his arms and kissed her and she being gone ordered candles in his office
then i went to bed too
but in the course of the evening i had rambled down to the door and a little way along the street that i might have another peep at the old houses and the grey cathedral and might think of my coming through that old city on my journey and of my passing the very house i lived in without knowing it
as i came back i saw uriah heep shutting up the office and feeling friendly towards everybody went in and spoke to him and at parting gave him my hand
but oh what a clammy hand his was
as ghostly to the touch as to the sight
i rubbed mine afterwards to warm it and to rub his off
it was such an uncomfortable hand that when i went to my room it was still cold and wet upon my memory
leaning out of the window and seeing one of the faces on the beamends looking at me sideways i fancied it was uriah heep got up there somehow and shut him out in a hurry
next morning after breakfast i entered on school life again
i went accompanied by mr wickfield to the scene of my future studiesa grave building in a courtyard with a learned air about it that seemed very well suited to the stray rooks and jackdaws who came down from the cathedral towers to walk with a clerkly bearing on the grassplotand was introduced to my new master doctor strong
doctor strong looked almost as rusty to my thinking as the tall iron rails and gates outside the house and almost as stiff and heavy as the great stone urns that flanked them and were set up on the top of the redbrick wall at regular distances all round the court like sublimated skittles for time to play at
he was in his library i mean doctor strong was with his clothes not particularly well brushed and his hair not particularly well combed his kneesmalls unbraced his long black gaiters unbuttoned and his shoes yawning like two caverns on the hearthrug
turning upon me a lustreless eye that reminded me of a longforgotten blind old horse who once used to crop the grass and tumble over the graves in blunderstone churchyard he said he was glad to see me and then he gave me his hand which i didnt know what to do with as it did nothing for itself
but sitting at work not far from doctor strong was a very pretty young ladywhom he called annie and who was his daughter i supposedwho got me out of my difficulty by kneeling down to put doctor strongs shoes on and button his gaiters which she did with great cheerfulness and quickness
when she had finished and we were going out to the schoolroom i was much surprised to hear mr wickfield in bidding her good morning address her as mrs
strong and i was wondering could she be doctor strongs sons wife or could she be mrs
doctor strong when doctor strong himself unconsciously enlightened me
by the by wickfield he said stopping in a passage with his hand on my shoulder you have not found any suitable provision for my wifes cousin yet no said mr wickfield
no
not yet i could wish it done as soon as it can be done wickfield said doctor strong for jack maldon is needy and idle and of those two bad things worse things sometimes come
what does doctor watts say he added looking at me and moving his head to the time of his quotation satan finds some mischief still for idle hands to do egad doctor returned mr wickfield if doctor watts knew mankind he might have written with as much truth satan finds some mischief still for busy hands to do the busy people achieve their full share of mischief in the world you may rely upon it
what have the people been about who have been the busiest in getting money and in getting power this century or two
no mischief jack maldon will never be very busy in getting either i expect said doctor strong rubbing his chin thoughtfully
perhaps not said mr wickfield and you bring me back to the question with an apology for digressing
no i have not been able to dispose of mr jack maldon yet
i believe he said this with some hesitation i penetrate your motive and it makes the thing more difficult my motive returned doctor strong is to make some suitable provision for a cousin and an old playfellow of annies yes i know said mr wickfield at home or abroad aye replied the doctor apparently wondering why he emphasized those words so much
at home or abroad your own expression you know said mr wickfield
or abroad surely the doctor answered
surely
one or other one or other
have you no choice asked mr wickfield
no returned the doctor
no with astonishment
not the least no motive said mr wickfield for meaning abroad and not at home no returned the doctor
i am bound to believe you and of course i do believe you said mr wickfield
it might have simplified my office very much if i had known it before
but i confess i entertained another impression doctor strong regarded him with a puzzled and doubting look which almost immediately subsided into a smile that gave me great encouragement for it was full of amiability and sweetness and there was a simplicity in it and indeed in his whole manner when the studious pondering frost upon it was got through very attractive and hopeful to a young scholar like me
repeating no and not the least and other short assurances to the same purport doctor strong jogged on before us at a queer uneven pace and we followed mr wickfield looking grave i observed and shaking his head to himself without knowing that i saw him
the schoolroom was a pretty large hall on the quietest side of the house confronted by the stately stare of some halfdozen of the great urns and commanding a peep of an old secluded garden belonging to the doctor where the peaches were ripening on the sunny south wall
there were two great aloes in tubs on the turf outside the windows the broad hard leaves of which plant looking as if they were made of painted tin have ever since by association been symbolical to me of silence and retirement
about fiveandtwenty boys were studiously engaged at their books when we went in but they rose to give the doctor good morning and remained standing when they saw mr wickfield and me
a new boy young gentlemen said the doctor trotwood copperfield one adams who was the headboy then stepped out of his place and welcomed me
he looked like a young clergyman in his white cravat but he was very affable and goodhumoured and he showed me my place and presented me to the masters in a gentlemanly way that would have put me at my ease if anything could
it seemed to me so long however since i had been among such boys or among any companions of my own age except mick walker and mealy potatoes that i felt as strange as ever i have done in my life
i was so conscious of having passed through scenes of which they could have no knowledge and of having acquired experiences foreign to my age appearance and condition as one of them that i half believed it was an imposture to come there as an ordinary little schoolboy
i had become in the murdstone and grinby time however short or long it may have been so unused to the sports and games of boys that i knew i was awkward and inexperienced in the commonest things belonging to them
whatever i had learnt had so slipped away from me in the sordid cares of my life from day to night that now when i was examined about what i knew i knew nothing and was put into the lowest form of the school
but troubled as i was by my want of boyish skill and of booklearning too i was made infinitely more uncomfortable by the consideration that in what i did know i was much farther removed from my companions than in what i did not
my mind ran upon what they would think if they knew of my familiar acquaintance with the kings bench prison
was there anything about me which would reveal my proceedings in connexion with the micawber familyall those pawnings and sellings and suppersin spite of myself
suppose some of the boys had seen me coming through canterbury wayworn and ragged and should find me out
what would they say who made so light of money if they could know how i had scraped my halfpence together for the purchase of my daily saveloy and beer or my slices of pudding
how would it affect them who were so innocent of london life and london streets to discover how knowing i was and was ashamed to be in some of the meanest phases of both
all this ran in my head so much on that first day at doctor strongs that i felt distrustful of my slightest look and gesture shrunk within myself whensoever i was approached by one of my new schoolfellows and hurried off the minute school was over afraid of committing myself in my response to any friendly notice or advance
but there was such an influence in mr wickfields old house that when i knocked at it with my new schoolbooks under my arm i began to feel my uneasiness softening away
as i went up to my airy old room the grave shadow of the staircase seemed to fall upon my doubts and fears and to make the past more indistinct
i sat there sturdily conning my books until dinnertime we were out of school for good at three and went down hopeful of becoming a passable sort of boy yet
agnes was in the drawingroom waiting for her father who was detained by someone in his office
she met me with her pleasant smile and asked me how i liked the school
i told her i should like it very much i hoped but i was a little strange to it at first
you have never been to school i said have you oh yes
every day ah but you mean here at your own home papa couldnt spare me to go anywhere else she answered smiling and shaking her head
his housekeeper must be in his house you know he is very fond of you i am sure i said
she nodded yes and went to the door to listen for his coming up that she might meet him on the stairs
but as he was not there she came back again
mama has been dead ever since i was born she said in her quiet way
i only know her picture downstairs
i saw you looking at it yesterday
did you think whose it was i told her yes because it was so like herself
papa says so too said agnes pleased
hark
thats papa now her bright calm face lighted up with pleasure as she went to meet him and as they came in hand in hand
he greeted me cordially and told me i should certainly be happy under doctor strong who was one of the gentlest of men
there may be some perhapsi dont know that there arewho abuse his kindness said mr wickfield
never be one of those trotwood in anything
he is the least suspicious of mankind and whether thats a merit or whether its a blemish it deserves consideration in all dealings with the doctor great or small he spoke i thought as if he were weary or dissatisfied with something but i did not pursue the question in my mind for dinner was just then announced and we went down and took the same seats as before
we had scarcely done so when uriah heep put in his red head and his lank hand at the door and said heres mr maldon begs the favour of a word sir i am but this moment quit of mr maldon said his master
yes sir returned uriah but mr maldon has come back and he begs the favour of a word as he held the door open with his hand uriah looked at me and looked at agnes and looked at the dishes and looked at the plates and looked at every object in the room i thoughtyet seemed to look at nothing he made such an appearance all the while of keeping his red eyes dutifully on his master
i beg your pardon
its only to say on reflection observed a voice behind uriah as uriahs head was pushed away and the speakers substitutedpray excuse me for this intrusionthat as it seems i have no choice in the matter the sooner i go abroad the better
my cousin annie did say when we talked of it that she liked to have her friends within reach rather than to have them banished and the old doctor doctor strong was that mr wickfield interposed gravely
doctor strong of course returned the other i call him the old doctor its all the same you know i dont know returned mr wickfield
well doctor strong said the otherdoctor strong was of the same mind i believed
but as it appears from the course you take with me he has changed his mind why theres no more to be said except that the sooner i am off the better
therefore i thought id come back and say that the sooner i am off the better
when a plunge is to be made into the water its of no use lingering on the bank there shall be as little lingering as possible in your case mr maldon you may depend upon it said mr wickfield
thankee said the other
much obliged
i dont want to look a gifthorse in the mouth which is not a gracious thing to do otherwise i dare say my cousin annie could easily arrange it in her own way
i suppose annie would only have to say to the old doctor meaning that mrs strong would only have to say to her husbanddo i follow you said mr wickfield
quite so returned the other would only have to say that she wanted such and such a thing to be so and so and it would be so and so as a matter of course and why as a matter of course mr maldon asked mr wickfield sedately eating his dinner
why because annies a charming young girl and the old doctordoctor strong i meanis not quite a charming young boy said mr jack maldon laughing
no offence to anybody mr wickfield
i only mean that i suppose some compensation is fair and reasonable in that sort of marriage compensation to the lady sir asked mr wickfield gravely
to the lady sir mr jack maldon answered laughing
but appearing to remark that mr wickfield went on with his dinner in the same sedate immovable manner and that there was no hope of making him relax a muscle of his face he added however i have said what i came to say and with another apology for this intrusion i may take myself off
of course i shall observe your directions in considering the matter as one to be arranged between you and me solely and not to be referred to up at the doctors have you dined asked mr wickfield with a motion of his hand towards the table
thankee
i am going to dine said mr maldon with my cousin annie
goodbye mr wickfield without rising looked after him thoughtfully as he went out
he was rather a shallow sort of young gentleman i thought with a handsome face a rapid utterance and a confident bold air
and this was the first i ever saw of mr jack maldon whom i had not expected to see so soon when i heard the doctor speak of him that morning
when we had dined we went upstairs again where everything went on exactly as on the previous day
agnes set the glasses and decanters in the same corner and mr wickfield sat down to drink and drank a good deal
agnes played the piano to him sat by him and worked and talked and played some games at dominoes with me
in good time she made tea and afterwards when i brought down my books looked into them and showed me what she knew of them which was no slight matter though she said it was and what was the best way to learn and understand them
i see her with her modest orderly placid manner and i hear her beautiful calm voice as i write these words
the influence for all good which she came to exercise over me at a later time begins already to descend upon my breast
i love little emly and i dont love agnesno not at all in that waybut i feel that there are goodness peace and truth wherever agnes is and that the soft light of the coloured window in the church seen long ago falls on her always and on me when i am near her and on everything around
the time having come for her withdrawal for the night and she having left us i gave mr wickfield my hand preparatory to going away myself
but he checked me and said should you like to stay with us trotwood or to go elsewhere to stay i answered quickly
you are sure if you please
if i may why its but a dull life that we lead here boy i am afraid he said
not more dull for me than agnes sir
not dull at all than agnes he repeated walking slowly to the great chimneypiece and leaning against it
than agnes he had drank wine that evening or i fancied it until his eyes were bloodshot
not that i could see them now for they were cast down and shaded by his hand but i had noticed them a little while before
now i wonder he muttered whether my agnes tires of me
when should i ever tire of her
but thats different thats quite different he was musing not speaking to me so i remained quiet
a dull old house he said and a monotonous life but i must have her near me
i must keep her near me
if the thought that i may die and leave my darling or that my darling may die and leave me comes like a spectre to distress my happiest hours and is only to be drowned in he did not supply the word but pacing slowly to the place where he had sat and mechanically going through the action of pouring wine from the empty decanter set it down and paced back again
if it is miserable to bear when she is here he said what would it be and she away
no no no
i cannot try that he leaned against the chimneypiece brooding so long that i could not decide whether to run the risk of disturbing him by going or to remain quietly where i was until he should come out of his reverie
at length he aroused himself and looked about the room until his eyes encountered mine
stay with us trotwood eh he said in his usual manner and as if he were answering something i had just said
i am glad of it
you are company to us both
it is wholesome to have you here
wholesome for me wholesome for agnes wholesome perhaps for all of us i am sure it is for me sir i said
i am so glad to be here thats a fine fellow said mr wickfield
as long as you are glad to be here you shall stay here he shook hands with me upon it and clapped me on the back and told me that when i had anything to do at night after agnes had left us or when i wished to read for my own pleasure i was free to come down to his room if he were there and if i desired it for companys sake and to sit with him
i thanked him for his consideration and as he went down soon afterwards and i was not tired went down too with a book in my hand to avail myself for halfanhour of his permission
but seeing a light in the little round office and immediately feeling myself attracted towards uriah heep who had a sort of fascination for me i went in there instead
i found uriah reading a great fat book with such demonstrative attention that his lank forefinger followed up every line as he read and made clammy tracks along the page or so i fully believed like a snail
you are working late tonight uriah says i
yes master copperfield says uriah
as i was getting on the stool opposite to talk to him more conveniently i observed that he had not such a thing as a smile about him and that he could only widen his mouth and make two hard creases down his cheeks one on each side to stand for one
i am not doing officework master copperfield said uriah
what work then i asked
i am improving my legal knowledge master copperfield said uriah
i am going through tidds practice
oh what a writer mr tidd is master copperfield my stool was such a tower of observation that as i watched him reading on again after this rapturous exclamation and following up the lines with his forefinger i observed that his nostrils which were thin and pointed with sharp dints in them had a singular and most uncomfortable way of expanding and contracting themselvesthat they seemed to twinkle instead of his eyes which hardly ever twinkled at all
i suppose you are quite a great lawyer i said after looking at him for some time
me master copperfield said uriah
oh no
im a very umble person it was no fancy of mine about his hands i observed for he frequently ground the palms against each other as if to squeeze them dry and warm besides often wiping them in a stealthy way on his pockethandkerchief
i am well aware that i am the umblest person going said uriah heep modestly let the other be where he may
my mother is likewise a very umble person
we live in a numble abode master copperfield but have much to be thankful for
my fathers former calling was umble
he was a sexton what is he now i asked
he is a partaker of glory at present master copperfield said uriah heep
but we have much to be thankful for
how much have i to be thankful for in living with mr wickfield i asked uriah if he had been with mr wickfield long
i have been with him going on four year master copperfield said uriah shutting up his book after carefully marking the place where he had left off
since a year after my fathers death
how much have i to be thankful for in that
how much have i to be thankful for in mr wickfields kind intention to give me my articles which would otherwise not lay within the umble means of mother and self then when your articled time is over youll be a regular lawyer i suppose said i
with the blessing of providence master copperfield returned uriah
perhaps youll be a partner in mr wickfields business one of these days i said to make myself agreeable and it will be wickfield and heep or heep late wickfield oh no master copperfield returned uriah shaking his head i am much too umble for that he certainly did look uncommonly like the carved face on the beam outside my window as he sat in his humility eyeing me sideways with his mouth widened and the creases in his cheeks
mr
wickfield is a most excellent man master copperfield said uriah
if you have known him long you know it i am sure much better than i can inform you i replied that i was certain he was but that i had not known him long myself though he was a friend of my aunts
oh indeed master copperfield said uriah
your aunt is a sweet lady master copperfield he had a way of writhing when he wanted to express enthusiasm which was very ugly and which diverted my attention from the compliment he had paid my relation to the snaky twistings of his throat and body
a sweet lady master copperfield said uriah heep
she has a great admiration for miss agnes master copperfield i believe i said yes boldly not that i knew anything about it heaven forgive me
i hope you have too master copperfield said uriah
but i am sure you must have everybody must have i returned
oh thank you master copperfield said uriah heep for that remark
it is so true
umble as i am i know it is so true
oh thank you master copperfield he writhed himself quite off his stool in the excitement of his feelings and being off began to make arrangements for going home
mother will be expecting me he said referring to a pale inexpressivefaced watch in his pocket and getting uneasy for though we are very umble master copperfield we are much attached to one another
if you would come and see us any afternoon and take a cup of tea at our lowly dwelling mother would be as proud of your company as i should be i said i should be glad to come
thank you master copperfield returned uriah putting his book away upon the shelfi suppose you stop here some time master copperfield i said i was going to be brought up there i believed as long as i remained at school
oh indeed exclaimed uriah
i should think you would come into the business at last master copperfield i protested that i had no views of that sort and that no such scheme was entertained in my behalf by anybody but uriah insisted on blandly replying to all my assurances oh yes master copperfield i should think you would indeed and oh indeed master copperfield i should think you would certainly over and over again
being at last ready to leave the office for the night he asked me if it would suit my convenience to have the light put out and on my answering yes instantly extinguished it
after shaking hands with mehis hand felt like a fish in the darkhe opened the door into the street a very little and crept out and shut it leaving me to grope my way back into the house which cost me some trouble and a fall over his stool
this was the proximate cause i suppose of my dreaming about him for what appeared to me to be half the night and dreaming among other things that he had launched mr peggottys house on a piratical expedition with a black flag at the masthead bearing the inscription tidds practice under which diabolical ensign he was carrying me and little emly to the spanish main to be drowned
i got a little the better of my uneasiness when i went to school next day and a good deal the better next day and so shook it off by degrees that in less than a fortnight i was quite at home and happy among my new companions
i was awkward enough in their games and backward enough in their studies but custom would improve me in the first respect i hoped and hard work in the second
accordingly i went to work very hard both in play and in earnest and gained great commendation
and in a very little while the murdstone and grinby life became so strange to me that i hardly believed in it while my present life grew so familiar that i seemed to have been leading it a long time
doctor strongs was an excellent school as different from mr creakles as good is from evil
it was very gravely and decorously ordered and on a sound system with an appeal in everything to the honour and good faith of the boys and an avowed intention to rely on their possession of those qualities unless they proved themselves unworthy of it which worked wonders
we all felt that we had a part in the management of the place and in sustaining its character and dignity
hence we soon became warmly attached to iti am sure i did for one and i never knew in all my time of any other boy being otherwiseand learnt with a good will desiring to do it credit
we had noble games out of hours and plenty of liberty but even then as i remember we were well spoken of in the town and rarely did any disgrace by our appearance or manner to the reputation of doctor strong and doctor strongs boys
some of the higher scholars boarded in the doctors house and through them i learned at second hand some particulars of the doctors historyas how he had not yet been married twelve months to the beautiful young lady i had seen in the study whom he had married for love for she had not a sixpence and had a world of poor relations so our fellows said ready to swarm the doctor out of house and home
also how the doctors cogitating manner was attributable to his being always engaged in looking out for greek roots which in my innocence and ignorance i supposed to be a botanical furor on the doctors part especially as he always looked at the ground when he walked about until i understood that they were roots of words with a view to a new dictionary which he had in contemplation
adams our headboy who had a turn for mathematics had made a calculation i was informed of the time this dictionary would take in completing on the doctors plan and at the doctors rate of going
he considered that it might be done in one thousand six hundred and fortynine years counting from the doctors last or sixtysecond birthday
but the doctor himself was the idol of the whole school and it must have been a badly composed school if he had been anything else for he was the kindest of men with a simple faith in him that might have touched the stone hearts of the very urns upon the wall
as he walked up and down that part of the courtyard which was at the side of the house with the stray rooks and jackdaws looking after him with their heads cocked slyly as if they knew how much more knowing they were in worldly affairs than he if any sort of vagabond could only get near enough to his creaking shoes to attract his attention to one sentence of a tale of distress that vagabond was made for the next two days
it was so notorious in the house that the masters and headboys took pains to cut these marauders off at angles and to get out of windows and turn them out of the courtyard before they could make the doctor aware of their presence which was sometimes happily effected within a few yards of him without his knowing anything of the matter as he jogged to and fro
outside his own domain and unprotected he was a very sheep for the shearers
he would have taken his gaiters off his legs to give away
in fact there was a story current among us i have no idea and never had on what authority but i have believed it for so many years that i feel quite certain it is true that on a frosty day one wintertime he actually did bestow his gaiters on a beggarwoman who occasioned some scandal in the neighbourhood by exhibiting a fine infant from door to door wrapped in those garments which were universally recognized being as well known in the vicinity as the cathedral
the legend added that the only person who did not identify them was the doctor himself who when they were shortly afterwards displayed at the door of a little secondhand shop of no very good repute where such things were taken in exchange for gin was more than once observed to handle them approvingly as if admiring some curious novelty in the pattern and considering them an improvement on his own
it was very pleasant to see the doctor with his pretty young wife
he had a fatherly benignant way of showing his fondness for her which seemed in itself to express a good man
i often saw them walking in the garden where the peaches were and i sometimes had a nearer observation of them in the study or the parlour
she appeared to me to take great care of the doctor and to like him very much though i never thought her vitally interested in the dictionary some cumbrous fragments of which work the doctor always carried in his pockets and in the lining of his hat and generally seemed to be expounding to her as they walked about
i saw a good deal of mrs strong both because she had taken a liking for me on the morning of my introduction to the doctor and was always afterwards kind to me and interested in me and because she was very fond of agnes and was often backwards and forwards at our house
there was a curious constraint between her and mr wickfield i thought of whom she seemed to be afraid that never wore off
when she came there of an evening she always shrunk from accepting his escort home and ran away with me instead
and sometimes as we were running gaily across the cathedral yard together expecting to meet nobody we would meet mr jack maldon who was always surprised to see us
mrs strongs mama was a lady i took great delight in
her name was mrs markleham but our boys used to call her the old soldier on account of her generalship and the skill with which she marshalled great forces of relations against the doctor
she was a little sharpeyed woman who used to wear when she was dressed one unchangeable cap ornamented with some artificial flowers and two artificial butterflies supposed to be hovering above the flowers
there was a superstition among us that this cap had come from france and could only originate in the workmanship of that ingenious nation but all i certainly know about it is that it always made its appearance of an evening wheresoever mrs markleham made her appearance that it was carried about to friendly meetings in a hindoo basket that the butterflies had the gift of trembling constantly and that they improved the shining hours at doctor strongs expense like busy bees
i observed the old soldiernot to adopt the name disrespectfullyto pretty good advantage on a night which is made memorable to me by something else i shall relate
it was the night of a little party at the doctors which was given on the occasion of mr jack maldons departure for india whither he was going as a cadet or something of that kind mr wickfield having at length arranged the business
it happened to be the doctors birthday too
we had had a holiday had made presents to him in the morning had made a speech to him through the headboy and had cheered him until we were hoarse and until he had shed tears
and now in the evening mr wickfield agnes and i went to have tea with him in his private capacity
mr jack maldon was there before us
mrs strong dressed in white with cherrycoloured ribbons was playing the piano when we went in and he was leaning over her to turn the leaves
the clear red and white of her complexion was not so blooming and flowerlike as usual i thought when she turned round but she looked very pretty wonderfully pretty
i have forgotten doctor said mrs strongs mama when we were seated to pay you the compliments of the daythough they are as you may suppose very far from being mere compliments in my case
allow me to wish you many happy returns i thank you maam replied the doctor
many many many happy returns said the old soldier
not only for your own sake but for annies and john maldons and many other peoples
it seems but yesterday to me john when you were a little creature a head shorter than master copperfield making baby love to annie behind the gooseberry bushes in the backgarden my dear mama said mrs strong never mind that now annie dont be absurd returned her mother
if you are to blush to hear of such things now you are an old married woman when are you not to blush to hear of them old exclaimed mr jack maldon
annie
come yes john returned the soldier
virtually an old married woman
although not old by yearsfor when did you ever hear me say or who has ever heard me say that a girl of twenty was old by yearsyour cousin is the wife of the doctor and as such what i have described her
it is well for you john that your cousin is the wife of the doctor
you have found in him an influential and kind friend who will be kinder yet i venture to predict if you deserve it
i have no false pride
i never hesitate to admit frankly that there are some members of our family who want a friend
you were one yourself before your cousins influence raised up one for you the doctor in the goodness of his heart waved his hand as if to make light of it and save mr jack maldon from any further reminder
but mrs markleham changed her chair for one next the doctors and putting her fan on his coatsleeve said no really my dear doctor you must excuse me if i appear to dwell on this rather because i feel so very strongly
i call it quite my monomania it is such a subject of mine
you are a blessing to us
you really are a boon you know nonsense nonsense said the doctor
no no i beg your pardon retorted the old soldier
with nobody present but our dear and confidential friend mr wickfield i cannot consent to be put down
i shall begin to assert the privileges of a motherinlaw if you go on like that and scold you
i am perfectly honest and outspoken
what i am saying is what i said when you first overpowered me with surpriseyou remember how surprised i wasby proposing for annie
not that there was anything so very much out of the way in the mere fact of the proposalit would be ridiculous to say thatbut because you having known her poor father and having known her from a baby six months old i hadnt thought of you in such a light at all or indeed as a marrying man in any waysimply that you know aye aye returned the doctor goodhumouredly
never mind but i do mind said the old soldier laying her fan upon his lips
i mind very much
i recall these things that i may be contradicted if i am wrong
well
then i spoke to annie and i told her what had happened
i said my dear heres doctor strong has positively been and made you the subject of a handsome declaration and an offer did i press it in the least
no
i said now annie tell me the truth this moment is your heart free mama she said crying i am extremely youngwhich was perfectly trueand i hardly know if i have a heart at all then my dear i said you may rely upon it its free
at all events my love said i doctor strong is in an agitated state of mind and must be answered
he cannot be kept in his present state of suspense mama said annie still crying would he be unhappy without me
if he would i honour and respect him so much that i think i will have him so it was settled
and then and not till then i said to annie annie doctor strong will not only be your husband but he will represent your late father he will represent the head of our family he will represent the wisdom and station and i may say the means of our family and will be in short a boon to it i used the word at the time and i have used it again today
if i have any merit it is consistency the daughter had sat quite silent and still during this speech with her eyes fixed on the ground her cousin standing near her and looking on the ground too
she now said very softly in a trembling voice mama i hope you have finished no my dear annie returned the old soldier i have not quite finished
since you ask me my love i reply that i have not
i complain that you really are a little unnatural towards your own family and as it is of no use complaining to you
i mean to complain to your husband
now my dear doctor do look at that silly wife of yours as the doctor turned his kind face with its smile of simplicity and gentleness towards her she drooped her head more
i noticed that mr wickfield looked at her steadily
when i happened to say to that naughty thing the other day pursued her mother shaking her head and her fan at her playfully that there was a family circumstance she might mention to youindeed i think was bound to mentionshe said that to mention it was to ask a favour and that as you were too generous and as for her to ask was always to have she wouldnt annie my dear said the doctor
that was wrong
it robbed me of a pleasure almost the very words i said to her exclaimed her mother
now really another time when i know what she would tell you but for this reason and wont i have a great mind my dear doctor to tell you myself i shall be glad if you will returned the doctor
shall i certainly well then i will said the old soldier
thats a bargain and having i suppose carried her point she tapped the doctors hand several times with her fan which she kissed first and returned triumphantly to her former station
some more company coming in among whom were the two masters and adams the talk became general and it naturally turned on mr jack maldon and his voyage and the country he was going to and his various plans and prospects
he was to leave that night after supper in a postchaise for gravesend where the ship in which he was to make the voyage lay and was to be goneunless he came home on leave or for his healthi dont know how many years
i recollect it was settled by general consent that india was quite a misrepresented country and had nothing objectionable in it but a tiger or two and a little heat in the warm part of the day
for my own part i looked on mr jack maldon as a modern sindbad and pictured him the bosom friend of all the rajahs in the east sitting under canopies smoking curly golden pipesa mile long if they could be straightened out
mrs strong was a very pretty singer as i knew who often heard her singing by herself
but whether she was afraid of singing before people or was out of voice that evening it was certain that she couldnt sing at all
she tried a duet once with her cousin maldon but could not so much as begin and afterwards when she tried to sing by herself although she began sweetly her voice died away on a sudden and left her quite distressed with her head hanging down over the keys
the good doctor said she was nervous and to relieve her proposed a round game at cards of which he knew as much as of the art of playing the trombone
but i remarked that the old soldier took him into custody directly for her partner and instructed him as the first preliminary of initiation to give her all the silver he had in his pocket
we had a merry game not made the less merry by the doctors mistakes of which he committed an innumerable quantity in spite of the watchfulness of the butterflies and to their great aggravation
mrs strong had declined to play on the ground of not feeling very well and her cousin maldon had excused himself because he had some packing to do
when he had done it however he returned and they sat together talking on the sofa
from time to time she came and looked over the doctors hand and told him what to play
she was very pale as she bent over him and i thought her finger trembled as she pointed out the cards but the doctor was quite happy in her attention and took no notice of this if it were so
at supper we were hardly so gay
everyone appeared to feel that a parting of that sort was an awkward thing and that the nearer it approached the more awkward it was
mr jack maldon tried to be very talkative but was not at his ease and made matters worse
and they were not improved as it appeared to me by the old soldier who continually recalled passages of mr jack maldons youth
the doctor however who felt i am sure that he was making everybody happy was well pleased and had no suspicion but that we were all at the utmost height of enjoyment
annie my dear said he looking at his watch and filling his glass it is past your cousin jacks time and we must not detain him since time and tideboth concerned in this casewait for no man
mr jack maldon you have a long voyage and a strange country before you but many men have had both and many men will have both to the end of time
the winds you are going to tempt have wafted thousands upon thousands to fortune and brought thousands upon thousands happily back its an affecting thing said mrs marklehamhowever its viewed its affecting to see a fine young man one has known from an infant going away to the other end of the world leaving all he knows behind and not knowing whats before him
a young man really well deserves constant support and patronage looking at the doctor who makes such sacrifices time will go fast with you mr jack maldon pursued the doctor and fast with all of us
some of us can hardly expect perhaps in the natural course of things to greet you on your return
the next best thing is to hope to do it and thats my case
i shall not weary you with good advice
you have long had a good model before you in your cousin annie
imitate her virtues as nearly as you can mrs markleham fanned herself and shook her head
farewell mr jack said the doctor standing up on which we all stood up
a prosperous voyage out a thriving career abroad and a happy return home we all drank the toast and all shook hands with mr jack maldon after which he hastily took leave of the ladies who were there and hurried to the door where he was received as he got into the chaise with a tremendous broadside of cheers discharged by our boys who had assembled on the lawn for the purpose
running in among them to swell the ranks i was very near the chaise when it rolled away and i had a lively impression made upon me in the midst of the noise and dust of having seen mr jack maldon rattle past with an agitated face and something cherrycoloured in his hand
after another broadside for the doctor and another for the doctors wife the boys dispersed and i went back into the house where i found the guests all standing in a group about the doctor discussing how mr jack maldon had gone away and how he had borne it and how he had felt it and all the rest of it
in the midst of these remarks mrs markleham cried wheres annie no annie was there and when they called to her no annie replied
but all pressing out of the room in a crowd to see what was the matter we found her lying on the hall floor
there was great alarm at first until it was found that she was in a swoon and that the swoon was yielding to the usual means of recovery when the doctor who had lifted her head upon his knee put her curls aside with his hand and said looking around poor annie
shes so faithful and tenderhearted
its the parting from her old playfellow and friendher favourite cousinthat has done this
ah
its a pity
i am very sorry when she opened her eyes and saw where she was and that we were all standing about her she arose with assistance turning her head as she did so to lay it on the doctors shoulderor to hide it i dont know which
we went into the drawingroom to leave her with the doctor and her mother but she said it seemed that she was better than she had been since morning and that she would rather be brought among us so they brought her in looking very white and weak i thought and sat her on a sofa
annie my dear said her mother doing something to her dress
see here
you have lost a bow
will anybody be so good as find a ribbon a cherrycoloured ribbon it was the one she had worn at her bosom
we all looked for it i myself looked everywhere i am certainbut nobody could find it
do you recollect where you had it last annie said her mother
i wondered how i could have thought she looked white or anything but burning red when she answered that she had had it safe a little while ago she thought but it was not worth looking for
nevertheless it was looked for again and still not found
she entreated that there might be no more searching but it was still sought for in a desultory way until she was quite well and the company took their departure
we walked very slowly home mr wickfield agnes and iagnes and i admiring the moonlight and mr wickfield scarcely raising his eyes from the ground
when we at last reached our own door agnes discovered that she had left her little reticule behind
delighted to be of any service to her i ran back to fetch it
i went into the supperroom where it had been left which was deserted and dark
but a door of communication between that and the doctors study where there was a light being open i passed on there to say what i wanted and to get a candle
the doctor was sitting in his easychair by the fireside and his young wife was on a stool at his feet
the doctor with a complacent smile was reading aloud some manuscript explanation or statement of a theory out of that interminable dictionary and she was looking up at him
but with such a face as i never saw
it was so beautiful in its form it was so ashy pale it was so fixed in its abstraction it was so full of a wild sleepwalking dreamy horror of i dont know what
the eyes were wide open and her brown hair fell in two rich clusters on her shoulders and on her white dress disordered by the want of the lost ribbon
distinctly as i recollect her look i cannot say of what it was expressive i cannot even say of what it is expressive to me now rising again before my older judgement
penitence humiliation shame pride love and trustfulnessi see them all and in them all i see that horror of i dont know what
my entrance and my saying what i wanted roused her
it disturbed the doctor too for when i went back to replace the candle i had taken from the table he was patting her head in his fatherly way and saying he was a merciless drone to let her tempt him into reading on and he would have her go to bed
but she asked him in a rapid urgent manner to let her stayto let her feel assured i heard her murmur some broken words to this effect that she was in his confidence that night
and as she turned again towards him after glancing at me as i left the room and went out at the door i saw her cross her hands upon his knee and look up at him with the same face something quieted as he resumed his reading
it made a great impression on me and i remembered it a long time afterwards as i shall have occasion to narrate when the time comes
it has not occurred to me to mention peggotty since i ran away but of course i wrote her a letter almost as soon as i was housed at dover and another and a longer letter containing all particulars fully related when my aunt took me formally under her protection
on my being settled at doctor strongs i wrote to her again detailing my happy condition and prospects
i never could have derived anything like the pleasure from spending the money mr dick had given me that i felt in sending a gold halfguinea to peggotty per post enclosed in this last letter to discharge the sum i had borrowed of her in which epistle not before i mentioned about the young man with the donkeycart
to these communications peggotty replied as promptly if not as concisely as a merchants clerk
her utmost powers of expression which were certainly not great in ink were exhausted in the attempt to write what she felt on the subject of my journey
four sides of incoherent and interjectional beginnings of sentences that had no end except blots were inadequate to afford her any relief
but the blots were more expressive to me than the best composition for they showed me that peggotty had been crying all over the paper and what could i have desired more
i made out without much difficulty that she could not take quite kindly to my aunt yet
the notice was too short after so long a prepossession the other way
we never knew a person she wrote but to think that miss betsey should seem to be so different from what she had been thought to be was a moralthat was her word
she was evidently still afraid of miss betsey for she sent her grateful duty to her but timidly and she was evidently afraid of me too and entertained the probability of my running away again soon if i might judge from the repeated hints she threw out that the coachfare to yarmouth was always to be had of her for the asking
she gave me one piece of intelligence which affected me very much namely that there had been a sale of the furniture at our old home and that mr and miss murdstone were gone away and the house was shut up to be let or sold
god knows i had no part in it while they remained there but it pained me to think of the dear old place as altogether abandoned of the weeds growing tall in the garden and the fallen leaves lying thick and wet upon the paths
i imagined how the winds of winter would howl round it how the cold rain would beat upon the windowglass how the moon would make ghosts on the walls of the empty rooms watching their solitude all night
i thought afresh of the grave in the churchyard underneath the tree and it seemed as if the house were dead too now and all connected with my father and mother were faded away
there was no other news in peggottys letters
mr barkis was an excellent husband she said though still a little near but we all had our faults and she had plenty though i am sure i dont know what they were and he sent his duty and my little bedroom was always ready for me
mr peggotty was well and ham was well and mrs gummidge was but poorly and little emly wouldnt send her love but said that peggotty might send it if she liked
all this intelligence i dutifully imparted to my aunt only reserving to myself the mention of little emly to whom i instinctively felt that she would not very tenderly incline
while i was yet new at doctor strongs she made several excursions over to canterbury to see me and always at unseasonable hours with the view i suppose of taking me by surprise
but finding me well employed and bearing a good character and hearing on all hands that i rose fast in the school she soon discontinued these visits
i saw her on a saturday every third or fourth week when i went over to dover for a treat and i saw mr dick every alternate wednesday when he arrived by stagecoach at noon to stay until next morning
on these occasions mr dick never travelled without a leathern writingdesk containing a supply of stationery and the memorial in relation to which document he had a notion that time was beginning to press now and that it really must be got out of hand
mr dick was very partial to gingerbread
to render his visits the more agreeable my aunt had instructed me to open a credit for him at a cake shop which was hampered with the stipulation that he should not be served with more than one shillingsworth in the course of any one day
this and the reference of all his little bills at the county inn where he slept to my aunt before they were paid induced me to suspect that he was only allowed to rattle his money and not to spend it
i found on further investigation that this was so or at least there was an agreement between him and my aunt that he should account to her for all his disbursements
as he had no idea of deceiving her and always desired to please her he was thus made chary of launching into expense
on this point as well as on all other possible points mr dick was convinced that my aunt was the wisest and most wonderful of women as he repeatedly told me with infinite secrecy and always in a whisper
trotwood said mr dick with an air of mystery after imparting this confidence to me one wednesday whos the man that hides near our house and frightens her frightens my aunt sir mr dick nodded
i thought nothing would have frightened her he said for shes here he whispered softly dont mention itthe wisest and most wonderful of women having said which he drew back to observe the effect which this description of her made upon me
the first time he came said mr dick waslet me seesixteen hundred and fortynine was the date of king charless execution
i think you said sixteen hundred and fortynine yes sir i dont know how it can be said mr dick sorely puzzled and shaking his head
i dont think i am as old as that was it in that year that the man appeared sir i asked
why really said mr dick i dont see how it can have been in that year trotwood
did you get that date out of history yes sir i suppose history never lies does it said mr dick with a gleam of hope
oh dear no sir i replied most decisively
i was ingenuous and young and i thought so
i cant make it out said mr dick shaking his head
theres something wrong somewhere
however it was very soon after the mistake was made of putting some of the trouble out of king charless head into my head that the man first came
i was walking out with miss trotwood after tea just at dark and there he was close to our house walking about i inquired
walking about repeated mr dick
let me see i must recollect a bit
nno no he was not walking about i asked as the shortest way to get at it what he was doing
well he wasnt there at all said mr dick until he came up behind her and whispered
then she turned round and fainted and i stood still and looked at him and he walked away but that he should have been hiding ever since in the ground or somewhere is the most extraordinary thing has he been hiding ever since i asked
to be sure he has retorted mr dick nodding his head gravely
never came out till last night
we were walking last night and he came up behind her again and i knew him again and did he frighten my aunt again all of a shiver said mr dick counterfeiting that affection and making his teeth chatter
held by the palings
cried
but trotwood come here getting me close to him that he might whisper very softly why did she give him money boy in the moonlight he was a beggar perhaps mr dick shook his head as utterly renouncing the suggestion and having replied a great many times and with great confidence no beggar no beggar no beggar sir went on to say that from his window he had afterwards and late at night seen my aunt give this person money outside the garden rails in the moonlight who then slunk awayinto the ground again as he thought probableand was seen no more while my aunt came hurriedly and secretly back into the house and had even that morning been quite different from her usual self which preyed on mr dicks mind
i had not the least belief in the outset of this story that the unknown was anything but a delusion of mr dicks and one of the line of that illfated prince who occasioned him so much difficulty but after some reflection i began to entertain the question whether an attempt or threat of an attempt might have been twice made to take poor mr dick himself from under my aunts protection and whether my aunt the strength of whose kind feeling towards him i knew from herself might have been induced to pay a price for his peace and quiet
as i was already much attached to mr dick and very solicitous for his welfare my fears favoured this supposition and for a long time his wednesday hardly ever came round without my entertaining a misgiving that he would not be on the coachbox as usual
there he always appeared however greyheaded laughing and happy and he never had anything more to tell of the man who could frighten my aunt
these wednesdays were the happiest days of mr dicks life they were far from being the least happy of mine
he soon became known to every boy in the school and though he never took an active part in any game but kiteflying was as deeply interested in all our sports as anyone among us
how often have i seen him intent upon a match at marbles or pegtop looking on with a face of unutterable interest and hardly breathing at the critical times
how often at hare and hounds have i seen him mounted on a little knoll cheering the whole field on to action and waving his hat above his grey head oblivious of king charles the martyrs head and all belonging to it
how many a summer hour have i known to be but blissful minutes to him in the cricketfield
how many winter days have i seen him standing bluenosed in the snow and east wind looking at the boys going down the long slide and clapping his worsted gloves in rapture
he was an universal favourite and his ingenuity in little things was transcendent
he could cut oranges into such devices as none of us had an idea of
he could make a boat out of anything from a skewer upwards
he could turn crampbones into chessmen fashion roman chariots from old court cards make spoked wheels out of cotton reels and birdcages of old wire
but he was greatest of all perhaps in the articles of string and straw with which we were all persuaded he could do anything that could be done by hands
mr dicks renown was not long confined to us
after a few wednesdays doctor strong himself made some inquiries of me about him and i told him all my aunt had told me which interested the doctor so much that he requested on the occasion of his next visit to be presented to him
this ceremony i performed and the doctor begging mr dick whensoever he should not find me at the coach office to come on there and rest himself until our mornings work was over it soon passed into a custom for mr dick to come on as a matter of course and if we were a little late as often happened on a wednesday to walk about the courtyard waiting for me
here he made the acquaintance of the doctors beautiful young wife paler than formerly all this time more rarely seen by me or anyone i think and not so gay but not less beautiful and so became more and more familiar by degrees until at last he would come into the school and wait
he always sat in a particular corner on a particular stool which was called dick after him here he would sit with his grey head bent forward attentively listening to whatever might be going on with a profound veneration for the learning he had never been able to acquire
this veneration mr dick extended to the doctor whom he thought the most subtle and accomplished philosopher of any age
it was long before mr dick ever spoke to him otherwise than bareheaded and even when he and the doctor had struck up quite a friendship and would walk together by the hour on that side of the courtyard which was known among us as the doctors walk mr dick would pull off his hat at intervals to show his respect for wisdom and knowledge
how it ever came about that the doctor began to read out scraps of the famous dictionary in these walks i never knew perhaps he felt it all the same at first as reading to himself
however it passed into a custom too and mr dick listening with a face shining with pride and pleasure in his heart of hearts believed the dictionary to be the most delightful book in the world
as i think of them going up and down before those schoolroom windowsthe doctor reading with his complacent smile an occasional flourish of the manuscript or grave motion of his head and mr dick listening enchained by interest with his poor wits calmly wandering god knows where upon the wings of hard wordsi think of it as one of the pleasantest things in a quiet way that i have ever seen
i feel as if they might go walking to and fro for ever and the world might somehow be the better for itas if a thousand things it makes a noise about were not one half so good for it or me
agnes was one of mr dicks friends very soon and in often coming to the house he made acquaintance with uriah
the friendship between himself and me increased continually and it was maintained on this odd footing that while mr dick came professedly to look after me as my guardian he always consulted me in any little matter of doubt that arose and invariably guided himself by my advice not only having a high respect for my native sagacity but considering that i inherited a good deal from my aunt
one thursday morning when i was about to walk with mr dick from the hotel to the coach office before going back to school for we had an hours school before breakfast i met uriah in the street who reminded me of the promise i had made to take tea with himself and his mother adding with a writhe but i didnt expect you to keep it master copperfield were so very umble i really had not yet been able to make up my mind whether i liked uriah or detested him and i was very doubtful about it still as i stood looking him in the face in the street
but i felt it quite an affront to be supposed proud and said i only wanted to be asked
oh if thats all master copperfield said uriah and it really isnt our umbleness that prevents you will you come this evening
but if it is our umbleness i hope you wont mind owning to it master copperfield for we are well aware of our condition i said i would mention it to mr wickfield and if he approved as i had no doubt he would i would come with pleasure
so at six oclock that evening which was one of the early office evenings i announced myself as ready to uriah
mother will be proud indeed he said as we walked away together
or she would be proud if it wasnt sinful master copperfield yet you didnt mind supposing i was proud this morning i returned
oh dear no master copperfield returned uriah
oh believe me no
such a thought never came into my head
i shouldnt have deemed it at all proud if you had thought us too umble for you
because we are so very umble have you been studying much law lately i asked to change the subject
oh master copperfield he said with an air of selfdenial my reading is hardly to be called study
i have passed an hour or two in the evening sometimes with mr tidd rather hard i suppose said i
he is hard to me sometimes returned uriah
but i dont know what he might be to a gifted person after beating a little tune on his chin as he walked on with the two forefingers of his skeleton right hand he added there are expressions you see master copperfieldlatin words and termsin mr tidd that are trying to a reader of my umble attainments would you like to be taught latin i said briskly
i will teach it you with pleasure as i learn it oh thank you master copperfield he answered shaking his head
i am sure its very kind of you to make the offer but i am much too umble to accept it what nonsense uriah oh indeed you must excuse me master copperfield
i am greatly obliged and i should like it of all things i assure you but i am far too umble
there are people enough to tread upon me in my lowly state without my doing outrage to their feelings by possessing learning
learning aint for me
a person like myself had better not aspire
if he is to get on in life he must get on umbly master copperfield i never saw his mouth so wide or the creases in his cheeks so deep as when he delivered himself of these sentiments shaking his head all the time and writhing modestly
i think you are wrong uriah i said
i dare say there are several things that i could teach you if you would like to learn them oh i dont doubt that master copperfield he answered not in the least
but not being umble yourself you dont judge well perhaps for them that are
i wont provoke my betters with knowledge thank you
im much too umble
here is my umble dwelling master copperfield we entered a low oldfashioned room walked straight into from the street and found there mrs heep who was the dead image of uriah only short
she received me with the utmost humility and apologized to me for giving her son a kiss observing that lowly as they were they had their natural affections which they hoped would give no offence to anyone
it was a perfectly decent room half parlour and half kitchen but not at all a snug room
the teathings were set upon the table and the kettle was boiling on the hob
there was a chest of drawers with an escritoire top for uriah to read or write at of an evening there was uriahs blue bag lying down and vomiting papers there was a company of uriahs books commanded by mr tidd there was a corner cupboard and there were the usual articles of furniture
i dont remember that any individual object had a bare pinched spare look but i do remember that the whole place had
it was perhaps a part of mrs heeps humility that she still wore weeds
notwithstanding the lapse of time that had occurred since mr heeps decease she still wore weeds
i think there was some compromise in the cap but otherwise she was as weedy as in the early days of her mourning
this is a day to be remembered my uriah i am sure said mrs heep making the tea when master copperfield pays us a visit i said youd think so mother said uriah
if i could have wished father to remain among us for any reason said mrs heep it would have been that he might have known his company this afternoon i felt embarrassed by these compliments but i was sensible too of being entertained as an honoured guest and i thought mrs heep an agreeable woman
my uriah said mrs heep has looked forward to this sir a long while
he had his fears that our umbleness stood in the way and i joined in them myself
umble we are umble we have been umble we shall ever be said mrs heep
i am sure you have no occasion to be so maam i said unless you like thank you sir retorted mrs heep
we know our station and are thankful in it i found that mrs heep gradually got nearer to me and that uriah gradually got opposite to me and that they respectfully plied me with the choicest of the eatables on the table
there was nothing particularly choice there to be sure but i took the will for the deed and felt that they were very attentive
presently they began to talk about aunts and then i told them about mine and about fathers and mothers and then i told them about mine and then mrs heep began to talk about fathersinlaw and then i began to tell her about minebut stopped because my aunt had advised me to observe a silence on that subject
a tender young cork however would have had no more chance against a pair of corkscrews or a tender young tooth against a pair of dentists or a little shuttlecock against two battledores than i had against uriah and mrs heep
they did just what they liked with me and wormed things out of me that i had no desire to tell with a certainty i blush to think of the more especially as in my juvenile frankness i took some credit to myself for being so confidential and felt that i was quite the patron of my two respectful entertainers
they were very fond of one another that was certain
i take it that had its effect upon me as a touch of nature but the skill with which the one followed up whatever the other said was a touch of art which i was still less proof against
when there was nothing more to be got out of me about myself for on the murdstone and grinby life and on my journey i was dumb they began about mr wickfield and agnes
uriah threw the ball to mrs heep mrs heep caught it and threw it back to uriah uriah kept it up a little while then sent it back to mrs heep and so they went on tossing it about until i had no idea who had got it and was quite bewildered
the ball itself was always changing too
now it was mr wickfield now agnes now the excellence of mr wickfield now my admiration of agnes now the extent of mr wickfields business and resources now our domestic life after dinner now the wine that mr wickfield took the reason why he took it and the pity that it was he took so much now one thing now another then everything at once and all the time without appearing to speak very often or to do anything but sometimes encourage them a little for fear they should be overcome by their humility and the honour of my company i found myself perpetually letting out something or other that i had no business to let out and seeing the effect of it in the twinkling of uriahs dinted nostrils
i had begun to be a little uncomfortable and to wish myself well out of the visit when a figure coming down the street passed the doorit stood open to air the room which was warm the weather being close for the time of yearcame back again looked in and walked in exclaiming loudly copperfield
is it possible it was mr micawber
it was mr micawber with his eyeglass and his walkingstick and his shirtcollar and his genteel air and the condescending roll in his voice all complete
my dear copperfield said mr micawber putting out his hand this is indeed a meeting which is calculated to impress the mind with a sense of the instability and uncertainty of all humanin short it is a most extraordinary meeting
walking along the street reflecting upon the probability of something turning up of which i am at present rather sanguine i find a young but valued friend turn up who is connected with the most eventful period of my life i may say with the turningpoint of my existence
copperfield my dear fellow how do you do i cannot sayi really cannot saythat i was glad to see mr micawber there but i was glad to see him too and shook hands with him heartily inquiring how mrs micawber was
thank you said mr micawber waving his hand as of old and settling his chin in his shirtcollar
she is tolerably convalescent
the twins no longer derive their sustenance from natures fountsin short said mr micawber in one of his bursts of confidence they are weanedand mrs micawber is at present my travelling companion
she will be rejoiced copperfield to renew her acquaintance with one who has proved himself in all respects a worthy minister at the sacred altar of friendship i said i should be delighted to see her
you are very good said mr micawber
mr micawber then smiled settled his chin again and looked about him
i have discovered my friend copperfield said mr micawber genteelly and without addressing himself particularly to anyone not in solitude but partaking of a social meal in company with a widow lady and one who is apparently her offspringin short said mr micawber in another of his bursts of confidence her son
i shall esteem it an honour to be presented i could do no less under these circumstances than make mr micawber known to uriah heep and his mother which i accordingly did
as they abased themselves before him mr micawber took a seat and waved his hand in his most courtly manner
any friend of my friend copperfields said mr micawber has a personal claim upon myself we are too umble sir said mrs heep my son and me to be the friends of master copperfield
he has been so good as take his tea with us and we are thankful to him for his company also to you sir for your notice maam returned mr micawber with a bow you are very obliging and what are you doing copperfield
still in the wine trade i was excessively anxious to get mr micawber away and replied with my hat in my hand and a very red face i have no doubt that i was a pupil at doctor strongs
a pupil said mr micawber raising his eyebrows
i am extremely happy to hear it
although a mind like my friend copperfieldsto uriah and mrs heepdoes not require that cultivation which without his knowledge of men and things it would require still it is a rich soil teeming with latent vegetationin short said mr micawber smiling in another burst of confidence it is an intellect capable of getting up the classics to any extent uriah with his long hands slowly twining over one another made a ghastly writhe from the waist upwards to express his concurrence in this estimation of me
shall we go and see mrs micawber sir i said to get mr micawber away
if you will do her that favour copperfield replied mr micawber rising
i have no scruple in saying in the presence of our friends here that i am a man who has for some years contended against the pressure of pecuniary difficulties i knew he was certain to say something of this kind he always would be so boastful about his difficulties
sometimes i have risen superior to my difficulties
sometimes my difficulties havein short have floored me
there have been times when i have administered a succession of facers to them there have been times when they have been too many for me and i have given in and said to mrs micawber in the words of cato plato thou reasonest well
its all up now
i can show fight no more but at no time of my life said mr micawber have i enjoyed a higher degree of satisfaction than in pouring my griefs if i may describe difficulties chiefly arising out of warrants of attorney and promissory notes at two and four months by that word into the bosom of my friend copperfield mr micawber closed this handsome tribute by saying mr
heep
good evening
mrs heep
your servant and then walking out with me in his most fashionable manner making a good deal of noise on the pavement with his shoes and humming a tune as we went
it was a little inn where mr micawber put up and he occupied a little room in it partitioned off from the commercial room and strongly flavoured with tobaccosmoke
i think it was over the kitchen because a warm greasy smell appeared to come up through the chinks in the floor and there was a flabby perspiration on the walls
i know it was near the bar on account of the smell of spirits and jingling of glasses
here recumbent on a small sofa underneath a picture of a racehorse with her head close to the fire and her feet pushing the mustard off the dumbwaiter at the other end of the room was mrs micawber to whom mr micawber entered first saying my dear allow me to introduce to you a pupil of doctor strongs i noticed by the by that although mr micawber was just as much confused as ever about my age and standing he always remembered as a genteel thing that i was a pupil of doctor strongs
mrs micawber was amazed but very glad to see me
i was very glad to see her too and after an affectionate greeting on both sides sat down on the small sofa near her
my dear said mr micawber if you will mention to copperfield what our present position is which i have no doubt he will like to know i will go and look at the paper the while and see whether anything turns up among the advertisements i thought you were at plymouth maam i said to mrs micawber as he went out
my dear master copperfield she replied we went to plymouth to be on the spot i hinted
just so said mrs micawber
to be on the spot
but the truth is talent is not wanted in the custom house
the local influence of my family was quite unavailing to obtain any employment in that department for a man of mr micawbers abilities
they would rather not have a man of mr micawbers abilities
he would only show the deficiency of the others
apart from which said mrs micawber i will not disguise from you my dear master copperfield that when that branch of my family which is settled in plymouth became aware that mr micawber was accompanied by myself and by little wilkins and his sister and by the twins they did not receive him with that ardour which he might have expected being so newly released from captivity
in fact said mrs micawber lowering her voicethis is between ourselvesour reception was cool dear me i said
yes said mrs micawber
it is truly painful to contemplate mankind in such an aspect master copperfield but our reception was decidedly cool
there is no doubt about it
in fact that branch of my family which is settled in plymouth became quite personal to mr micawber before we had been there a week i said and thought that they ought to be ashamed of themselves
still so it was continued mrs micawber
under such circumstances what could a man of mr micawbers spirit do
but one obvious course was left
to borrow of that branch of my family the money to return to london and to return at any sacrifice then you all came back again maam i said
we all came back again replied mrs micawber
since then i have consulted other branches of my family on the course which it is most expedient for mr micawber to takefor i maintain that he must take some course master copperfield said mrs micawber argumentatively
it is clear that a family of six not including a domestic cannot live upon air certainly maam said i
the opinion of those other branches of my family pursued mrs micawber is that mr micawber should immediately turn his attention to coals to what maam to coals said mrs micawber
to the coal trade
mr micawber was induced to think on inquiry that there might be an opening for a man of his talent in the medway coal trade
then as mr micawber very properly said the first step to be taken clearly was to come and see the medway
which we came and saw
i say we master copperfield for i never will said mrs micawber with emotion i never will desert mr micawber i murmured my admiration and approbation
we came repeated mrs micawber and saw the medway
my opinion of the coal trade on that river is that it may require talent but that it certainly requires capital
talent mr micawber has capital mr micawber has not
we saw i think the greater part of the medway and that is my individual conclusion
being so near here mr micawber was of opinion that it would be rash not to come on and see the cathedral
firstly on account of its being so well worth seeing and our never having seen it and secondly on account of the great probability of something turning up in a cathedral town
we have been here said mrs micawber three days
nothing has as yet turned up and it may not surprise you my dear master copperfield so much as it would a stranger to know that we are at present waiting for a remittance from london to discharge our pecuniary obligations at this hotel
until the arrival of that remittance said mrs micawber with much feeling i am cut off from my home i allude to lodgings in pentonville from my boy and girl and from my twins i felt the utmost sympathy for mr and mrs micawber in this anxious extremity and said as much to mr micawber who now returned adding that i only wished i had money enough to lend them the amount they needed
mr micawbers answer expressed the disturbance of his mind
he said shaking hands with me copperfield you are a true friend but when the worst comes to the worst no man is without a friend who is possessed of shaving materials at this dreadful hint mrs micawber threw her arms round mr micawbers neck and entreated him to be calm
he wept but so far recovered almost immediately as to ring the bell for the waiter and bespeak a hot kidney pudding and a plate of shrimps for breakfast in the morning
when i took my leave of them they both pressed me so much to come and dine before they went away that i could not refuse
but as i knew i could not come next day when i should have a good deal to prepare in the evening mr micawber arranged that he would call at doctor strongs in the course of the morning having a presentiment that the remittance would arrive by that post and propose the day after if it would suit me better
accordingly i was called out of school next forenoon and found mr micawber in the parlour who had called to say that the dinner would take place as proposed
when i asked him if the remittance had come he pressed my hand and departed
as i was looking out of window that same evening it surprised me and made me rather uneasy to see mr micawber and uriah heep walk past arm in arm uriah humbly sensible of the honour that was done him and mr micawber taking a bland delight in extending his patronage to uriah
but i was still more surprised when i went to the little hotel next day at the appointed dinnerhour which was four oclock to find from what mr micawber said that he had gone home with uriah and had drunk brandyandwater at mrs heeps
and ill tell you what my dear copperfield said mr micawber your friend heep is a young fellow who might be attorneygeneral
if i had known that young man at the period when my difficulties came to a crisis all i can say is that i believe my creditors would have been a great deal better managed than they were i hardly understood how this could have been seeing that mr micawber had paid them nothing at all as it was but i did not like to ask
neither did i like to say that i hoped he had not been too communicative to uriah or to inquire if they had talked much about me
i was afraid of hurting mr micawbers feelings or at all events mrs micawbers she being very sensitive but i was uncomfortable about it too and often thought about it afterwards
we had a beautiful little dinner
quite an elegant dish of fish the kidneyend of a loin of veal roasted fried sausagemeat a partridge and a pudding
there was wine and there was strong ale and after dinner mrs micawber made us a bowl of hot punch with her own hands
mr micawber was uncommonly convivial
i never saw him such good company
he made his face shine with the punch so that it looked as if it had been varnished all over
he got cheerfully sentimental about the town and proposed success to it observing that mrs micawber and himself had been made extremely snug and comfortable there and that he never should forget the agreeable hours they had passed in canterbury
he proposed me afterwards and he and mrs micawber and i took a review of our past acquaintance in the course of which we sold the property all over again
then i proposed mrs micawber or at least said modestly if youll allow me mrs micawber i shall now have the pleasure of drinking your health maam on which mr micawber delivered an eulogium on mrs micawbers character and said she had ever been his guide philosopher and friend and that he would recommend me when i came to a marrying time of life to marry such another woman if such another woman could be found
as the punch disappeared mr micawber became still more friendly and convivial
mrs micawbers spirits becoming elevated too we sang auld lang syne
when we came to heres a hand my trusty frere we all joined hands round the table and when we declared we would take a right gude willie waught and hadnt the least idea what it meant we were really affected
in a word i never saw anybody so thoroughly jovial as mr micawber was down to the very last moment of the evening when i took a hearty farewell of himself and his amiable wife
consequently i was not prepared at seven oclock next morning to receive the following communication dated half past nine in the evening a quarter of an hour after i had left him my dear young friend the die is castall is over
hiding the ravages of care with a sickly mask of mirth i have not informed you this evening that there is no hope of the remittance
under these circumstances alike humiliating to endure humiliating to contemplate and humiliating to relate i have discharged the pecuniary liability contracted at this establishment by giving a note of hand made payable fourteen days after date at my residence pentonville london
when it becomes due it will not be taken up
the result is destruction
the bolt is impending and the tree must fall
let the wretched man who now addresses you my dear copperfield be a beacon to you through life
he writes with that intention and in that hope
if he could think himself of so much use one gleam of day might by possibility penetrate into the cheerless dungeon of his remaining existencethough his longevity is at present to say the least of it extremely problematical
this is the last communication my dear copperfield you will ever receive from the beggared outcast wilkins micawber i was so shocked by the contents of this heartrending letter that i ran off directly towards the little hotel with the intention of taking it on my way to doctor strongs and trying to soothe mr micawber with a word of comfort
but halfway there i met the london coach with mr and mrs micawber up behind mr micawber the very picture of tranquil enjoyment smiling at mrs micawbers conversation eating walnuts out of a paper bag with a bottle sticking out of his breast pocket
as they did not see me i thought it best all things considered not to see them
so with a great weight taken off my mind i turned into a bystreet that was the nearest way to school and felt upon the whole relieved that they were gone though i still liked them very much nevertheless
my schooldays
the silent gliding on of my existencethe unseen unfelt progress of my lifefrom childhood up to youth
let me think as i look back upon that flowing water now a dry channel overgrown with leaves whether there are any marks along its course by which i can remember how it ran
a moment and i occupy my place in the cathedral where we all went together every sunday morning assembling first at school for that purpose
the earthy smell the sunless air the sensation of the world being shut out the resounding of the organ through the black and white arched galleries and aisles are wings that take me back and hold me hovering above those days in a halfsleeping and halfwaking dream
i am not the last boy in the school
i have risen in a few months over several heads
but the first boy seems to me a mighty creature dwelling afar off whose giddy height is unattainable
agnes says no but i say yes and tell her that she little thinks what stores of knowledge have been mastered by the wonderful being at whose place she thinks i even i weak aspirant may arrive in time
he is not my private friend and public patron as steerforth was but i hold him in a reverential respect
i chiefly wonder what hell be when he leaves doctor strongs and what mankind will do to maintain any place against him
but who is this that breaks upon me
this is miss shepherd whom i love
miss shepherd is a boarder at the misses nettingalls establishment
i adore miss shepherd
she is a little girl in a spencer with a round face and curly flaxen hair
the misses nettingalls young ladies come to the cathedral too
i cannot look upon my book for i must look upon miss shepherd
when the choristers chaunt i hear miss shepherd
in the service i mentally insert miss shepherds namei put her in among the royal family
at home in my own room i am sometimes moved to cry out oh miss shepherd in a transport of love
for some time i am doubtful of miss shepherds feelings but at length fate being propitious we meet at the dancingschool
i have miss shepherd for my partner
i touch miss shepherds glove and feel a thrill go up the right arm of my jacket and come out at my hair
i say nothing to miss shepherd but we understand each other
miss shepherd and myself live but to be united
why do i secretly give miss shepherd twelve brazil nuts for a present i wonder
they are not expressive of affection they are difficult to pack into a parcel of any regular shape they are hard to crack even in room doors and they are oily when cracked yet i feel that they are appropriate to miss shepherd
soft seedy biscuits also i bestow upon miss shepherd and oranges innumerable
once i kiss miss shepherd in the cloakroom
ecstasy
what are my agony and indignation next day when i hear a flying rumour that the misses nettingall have stood miss shepherd in the stocks for turning in her toes
miss shepherd being the one pervading theme and vision of my life how do i ever come to break with her
i cant conceive
and yet a coolness grows between miss shepherd and myself
whispers reach me of miss shepherd having said she wished i wouldnt stare so and having avowed a preference for master jonesfor jones
a boy of no merit whatever
the gulf between me and miss shepherd widens
at last one day i meet the misses nettingalls establishment out walking
miss shepherd makes a face as she goes by and laughs to her companion
all is over
the devotion of a lifeit seems a life it is all the sameis at an end miss shepherd comes out of the morning service and the royal family know her no more
i am higher in the school and no one breaks my peace
i am not at all polite now to the misses nettingalls young ladies and shouldnt dote on any of them if they were twice as many and twenty times as beautiful
i think the dancingschool a tiresome affair and wonder why the girls cant dance by themselves and leave us alone
i am growing great in latin verses and neglect the laces of my boots
doctor strong refers to me in public as a promising young scholar
mr dick is wild with joy and my aunt remits me a guinea by the next post
the shade of a young butcher rises like the apparition of an armed head in macbeth
who is this young butcher
he is the terror of the youth of canterbury
there is a vague belief abroad that the beef suet with which he anoints his hair gives him unnatural strength and that he is a match for a man
he is a broadfaced bullnecked young butcher with rough red cheeks an illconditioned mind and an injurious tongue
his main use of this tongue is to disparage doctor strongs young gentlemen
he says publicly that if they want anything hell give it em
he names individuals among them myself included whom he could undertake to settle with one hand and the other tied behind him
he waylays the smaller boys to punch their unprotected heads and calls challenges after me in the open streets
for these sufficient reasons i resolve to fight the butcher
it is a summer evening down in a green hollow at the corner of a wall
i meet the butcher by appointment
i am attended by a select body of our boys the butcher by two other butchers a young publican and a sweep
the preliminaries are adjusted and the butcher and myself stand face to face
in a moment the butcher lights ten thousand candles out of my left eyebrow
in another moment i dont know where the wall is or where i am or where anybody is
i hardly know which is myself and which the butcher we are always in such a tangle and tussle knocking about upon the trodden grass
sometimes i see the butcher bloody but confident sometimes i see nothing and sit gasping on my seconds knee sometimes i go in at the butcher madly and cut my knuckles open against his face without appearing to discompose him at all
at last i awake very queer about the head as from a giddy sleep and see the butcher walking off congratulated by the two other butchers and the sweep and publican and putting on his coat as he goes from which i augur justly that the victory is his
i am taken home in a sad plight and i have beefsteaks put to my eyes and am rubbed with vinegar and brandy and find a great puffy place bursting out on my upper lip which swells immoderately
for three or four days i remain at home a very illlooking subject with a green shade over my eyes and i should be very dull but that agnes is a sister to me and condoles with me and reads to me and makes the time light and happy
agnes has my confidence completely always i tell her all about the butcher and the wrongs he has heaped upon me she thinks i couldnt have done otherwise than fight the butcher while she shrinks and trembles at my having fought him
time has stolen on unobserved for adams is not the headboy in the days that are come now nor has he been this many and many a day
adams has left the school so long that when he comes back on a visit to doctor strong there are not many there besides myself who know him
adams is going to be called to the bar almost directly and is to be an advocate and to wear a wig
i am surprised to find him a meeker man than i had thought and less imposing in appearance
he has not staggered the world yet either for it goes on as well as i can make out pretty much the same as if he had never joined it
a blank through which the warriors of poetry and history march on in stately hosts that seem to have no endand what comes next
i am the headboy now
i look down on the line of boys below me with a condescending interest in such of them as bring to my mind the boy i was myself when i first came there
that little fellow seems to be no part of me i remember him as something left behind upon the road of lifeas something i have passed rather than have actually beenand almost think of him as of someone else
and the little girl i saw on that first day at mr wickfields where is she
gone also
in her stead the perfect likeness of the picture a child likeness no more moves about the house and agnesmy sweet sister as i call her in my thoughts my counsellor and friend the better angel of the lives of all who come within her calm good selfdenying influenceis quite a woman
what other changes have come upon me besides the changes in my growth and looks and in the knowledge i have garnered all this while
i wear a gold watch and chain a ring upon my little finger and a longtailed coat and i use a great deal of bears greasewhich taken in conjunction with the ring looks bad
am i in love again
i am
i worship the eldest miss larkins
the eldest miss larkins is not a little girl
she is a tall dark blackeyed fine figure of a woman
the eldest miss larkins is not a chicken for the youngest miss larkins is not that and the eldest must be three or four years older
perhaps the eldest miss larkins may be about thirty
my passion for her is beyond all bounds
the eldest miss larkins knows officers
it is an awful thing to bear
i see them speaking to her in the street
i see them cross the way to meet her when her bonnet she has a bright taste in bonnets is seen coming down the pavement accompanied by her sisters bonnet
she laughs and talks and seems to like it
i spend a good deal of my own spare time in walking up and down to meet her
if i can bow to her once in the day i know her to bow to knowing mr larkins i am happier
i deserve a bow now and then
the raging agonies i suffer on the night of the race ball where i know the eldest miss larkins will be dancing with the military ought to have some compensation if there be evenhanded justice in the world
my passion takes away my appetite and makes me wear my newest silk neckerchief continually
i have no relief but in putting on my best clothes and having my boots cleaned over and over again
i seem then to be worthier of the eldest miss larkins
everything that belongs to her or is connected with her is precious to me
mr larkins a gruff old gentleman with a double chin and one of his eyes immovable in his head is fraught with interest to me
when i cant meet his daughter i go where i am likely to meet him
to say how do you do mr larkins
are the young ladies and all the family quite well seems so pointed that i blush
i think continually about my age
say i am seventeen and say that seventeen is young for the eldest miss larkins what of that
besides i shall be oneandtwenty in no time almost
i regularly take walks outside mr larkinss house in the evening though it cuts me to the heart to see the officers go in or to hear them up in the drawingroom where the eldest miss larkins plays the harp
i even walk on two or three occasions in a sickly spoony manner round and round the house after the family are gone to bed wondering which is the eldest miss larkinss chamber and pitching i dare say now on mr larkinss instead wishing that a fire would burst out that the assembled crowd would stand appalled that i dashing through them with a ladder might rear it against her window save her in my arms go back for something she had left behind and perish in the flames
for i am generally disinterested in my love and think i could be content to make a figure before miss larkins and expire
generally but not always
sometimes brighter visions rise before me
when i dress the occupation of two hours for a great ball given at the larkinss the anticipation of three weeks i indulge my fancy with pleasing images
i picture myself taking courage to make a declaration to miss larkins
i picture miss larkins sinking her head upon my shoulder and saying oh mr copperfield can i believe my ears i picture mr larkins waiting on me next morning and saying my dear copperfield my daughter has told me all
youth is no objection
here are twenty thousand pounds
be happy i picture my aunt relenting and blessing us and mr dick and doctor strong being present at the marriage ceremony
i am a sensible fellow i believei believe on looking back i meanand modest i am sure but all this goes on notwithstanding
i repair to the enchanted house where there are lights chattering music flowers officers i am sorry to see and the eldest miss larkins a blaze of beauty
she is dressed in blue with blue flowers in her hairforgetmenotsas if she had any need to wear forgetmenots
it is the first really grownup party that i have ever been invited to and i am a little uncomfortable for i appear not to belong to anybody and nobody appears to have anything to say to me except mr larkins who asks me how my schoolfellows are which he neednt do as i have not come there to be insulted
but after i have stood in the doorway for some time and feasted my eyes upon the goddess of my heart she approaches meshe the eldest miss larkinsand asks me pleasantly if i dance
i stammer with a bow with you miss larkins with no one else inquires miss larkins
i should have no pleasure in dancing with anyone else miss larkins laughs and blushes or i think she blushes and says next time but one i shall be very glad the time arrives
it is a waltz i think miss larkins doubtfully observes when i present myself
do you waltz
if not captain bailey but i do waltz pretty well too as it happens and i take miss larkins out
i take her sternly from the side of captain bailey
he is wretched i have no doubt but he is nothing to me
i have been wretched too
i waltz with the eldest miss larkins
i dont know where among whom or how long
i only know that i swim about in space with a blue angel in a state of blissful delirium until i find myself alone with her in a little room resting on a sofa
she admires a flower pink camellia japonica price halfacrown in my buttonhole
i give it her and say i ask an inestimable price for it miss larkins indeed
what is that returns miss larkins
a flower of yours that i may treasure it as a miser does gold youre a bold boy says miss larkins
there she gives it me not displeased and i put it to my lips and then into my breast
miss larkins laughing draws her hand through my arm and says now take me back to captain bailey i am lost in the recollection of this delicious interview and the waltz when she comes to me again with a plain elderly gentleman who has been playing whist all night upon her arm and says oh
here is my bold friend
mr chestle wants to know you mr copperfield i feel at once that he is a friend of the family and am much gratified
i admire your taste sir says mr chestle
it does you credit
i suppose you dont take much interest in hops but i am a pretty large grower myself and if you ever like to come over to our neighbourhoodneighbourhood of ashfordand take a run about our placewe shall be glad for you to stop as long as you like i thank mr chestle warmly and shake hands
i think i am in a happy dream
i waltz with the eldest miss larkins once again
she says i waltz so well
i go home in a state of unspeakable bliss and waltz in imagination all night long with my arm round the blue waist of my dear divinity
for some days afterwards i am lost in rapturous reflections but i neither see her in the street nor when i call
i am imperfectly consoled for this disappointment by the sacred pledge the perished flower
trotwood says agnes one day after dinner
who do you think is going to be married tomorrow
someone you admire not you i suppose agnes not me raising her cheerful face from the music she is copying
do you hear him papathe eldest miss larkins toto captain bailey i have just enough power to ask
no to no captain
to mr chestle a hopgrower i am terribly dejected for about a week or two
i take off my ring i wear my worst clothes i use no bears grease and i frequently lament over the late miss larkinss faded flower
being by that time rather tired of this kind of life and having received new provocation from the butcher i throw the flower away go out with the butcher and gloriously defeat him
this and the resumption of my ring as well as of the bears grease in moderation are the last marks i can discern now in my progress to seventeen
i am doubtful whether i was at heart glad or sorry when my schooldays drew to an end and the time came for my leaving doctor strongs
i had been very happy there i had a great attachment for the doctor and i was eminent and distinguished in that little world
for these reasons i was sorry to go but for other reasons unsubstantial enough i was glad
misty ideas of being a young man at my own disposal of the importance attaching to a young man at his own disposal of the wonderful things to be seen and done by that magnificent animal and the wonderful effects he could not fail to make upon society lured me away
so powerful were these visionary considerations in my boyish mind that i seem according to my present way of thinking to have left school without natural regret
the separation has not made the impression on me that other separations have
i try in vain to recall how i felt about it and what its circumstances were but it is not momentous in my recollection
i suppose the opening prospect confused me
i know that my juvenile experiences went for little or nothing then and that life was more like a great fairy story which i was just about to begin to read than anything else
my aunt and i had held many grave deliberations on the calling to which i should be devoted
for a year or more i had endeavoured to find a satisfactory answer to her oftenrepeated question what i would like to be but i had no particular liking that i could discover for anything
if i could have been inspired with a knowledge of the science of navigation taken the command of a fastsailing expedition and gone round the world on a triumphant voyage of discovery i think i might have considered myself completely suited
but in the absence of any such miraculous provision my desire was to apply myself to some pursuit that would not lie too heavily upon her purse and to do my duty in it whatever it might be
mr dick had regularly assisted at our councils with a meditative and sage demeanour
he never made a suggestion but once and on that occasion i dont know what put it in his head he suddenly proposed that i should be a brazier
my aunt received this proposal so very ungraciously that he never ventured on a second but ever afterwards confined himself to looking watchfully at her for her suggestions and rattling his money
trot i tell you what my dear said my aunt one morning in the christmas season when i left school as this knotty point is still unsettled and as we must not make a mistake in our decision if we can help it i think we had better take a little breathingtime
in the meanwhile you must try to look at it from a new point of view and not as a schoolboy i will aunt it has occurred to me pursued my aunt that a little change and a glimpse of life out of doors may be useful in helping you to know your own mind and form a cooler judgement
suppose you were to go down into the old part of the country again for instance and see thatthat outoftheway woman with the savagest of names said my aunt rubbing her nose for she could never thoroughly forgive peggotty for being so called
of all things in the world aunt i should like it best well said my aunt thats lucky for i should like it too
but its natural and rational that you should like it
and i am very well persuaded that whatever you do trot will always be natural and rational i hope so aunt your sister betsey trotwood said my aunt would have been as natural and rational a girl as ever breathed
youll be worthy of her wont you i hope i shall be worthy of you aunt
that will be enough for me its a mercy that poor dear baby of a mother of yours didnt live said my aunt looking at me approvingly or shed have been so vain of her boy by this time that her soft little head would have been completely turned if there was anything of it left to turn my aunt always excused any weakness of her own in my behalf by transferring it in this way to my poor mother
bless me trotwood how you do remind me of her pleasantly i hope aunt said i
hes as like her dick said my aunt emphatically hes as like her as she was that afternoon before she began to fretbless my heart hes as like her as he can look at me out of his two eyes is he indeed said mr dick
and hes like david too said my aunt decisively
he is very like david said mr dick
but what i want you to be trot resumed my aunt i dont mean physically but morally you are very well physicallyis a firm fellow
a fine firm fellow with a will of your own
with resolution said my aunt shaking her cap at me and clenching her hand
with determination
with character trotwith strength of character that is not to be influenced except on good reason by anybody or by anything
thats what i want you to be
thats what your father and mother might both have been heaven knows and been the better for it i intimated that i hoped i should be what she described
that you may begin in a small way to have a reliance upon yourself and to act for yourself said my aunt i shall send you upon your trip alone
i did think once of mr dicks going with you but on second thoughts i shall keep him to take care of me mr dick for a moment looked a little disappointed until the honour and dignity of having to take care of the most wonderful woman in the world restored the sunshine to his face
besides said my aunt theres the memorial oh certainly said mr dick in a hurry i intend trotwood to get that done immediatelyit really must be done immediately
and then it will go in you knowand then said mr dick after checking himself and pausing a long time therell be a pretty kettle of fish in pursuance of my aunts kind scheme i was shortly afterwards fitted out with a handsome purse of money and a portmanteau and tenderly dismissed upon my expedition
at parting my aunt gave me some good advice and a good many kisses and said that as her object was that i should look about me and should think a little she would recommend me to stay a few days in london if i liked it either on my way down into suffolk or in coming back
in a word i was at liberty to do what i would for three weeks or a month and no other conditions were imposed upon my freedom than the beforementioned thinking and looking about me and a pledge to write three times a week and faithfully report myself
i went to canterbury first that i might take leave of agnes and mr wickfield my old room in whose house i had not yet relinquished and also of the good doctor
agnes was very glad to see me and told me that the house had not been like itself since i had left it
i am sure i am not like myself when i am away said i
i seem to want my right hand when i miss you
though thats not saying much for theres no head in my right hand and no heart
everyone who knows you consults with you and is guided by you agnes everyone who knows me spoils me i believe she answered smiling
no
its because you are like no one else
you are so good and so sweettempered
you have such a gentle nature and you are always right you talk said agnes breaking into a pleasant laugh as she sat at work as if i were the late miss larkins come
its not fair to abuse my confidence i answered reddening at the recollection of my blue enslaver
but i shall confide in you just the same agnes
i can never grow out of that
whenever i fall into trouble or fall in love i shall always tell you if youll let meeven when i come to fall in love in earnest why you have always been in earnest said agnes laughing again
oh
that was as a child or a schoolboy said i laughing in my turn not without being a little shamefaced
times are altering now and i suppose i shall be in a terrible state of earnestness one day or other
my wonder is that you are not in earnest yourself by this time agnes agnes laughed again and shook her head
oh i know you are not said i because if you had been you would have told me
or at leastfor i saw a faint blush in her face you would have let me find it out for myself
but there is no one that i know of who deserves to love you agnes
someone of a nobler character and more worthy altogether than anyone i have ever seen here must rise up before i give my consent
in the time to come i shall have a wary eye on all admirers and shall exact a great deal from the successful one i assure you we had gone on so far in a mixture of confidential jest and earnest that had long grown naturally out of our familiar relations begun as mere children
but agnes now suddenly lifting up her eyes to mine and speaking in a different manner said trotwood there is something that i want to ask you and that i may not have another opportunity of asking for a long time perhapssomething i would ask i think of no one else
have you observed any gradual alteration in papa i had observed it and had often wondered whether she had too
i must have shown as much now in my face for her eyes were in a moment cast down and i saw tears in them
tell me what it is she said in a low voice
i thinkshall i be quite plain agnes liking him so much yes she said
i think he does himself no good by the habit that has increased upon him since i first came here
he is often very nervousor i fancy so it is not fancy said agnes shaking her head
his hand trembles his speech is not plain and his eyes look wild
i have remarked that at those times and when he is least like himself he is most certain to be wanted on some business by uriah said agnes
yes and the sense of being unfit for it or of not having understood it or of having shown his condition in spite of himself seems to make him so uneasy that next day he is worse and next day worse and so he becomes jaded and haggard
do not be alarmed by what i say agnes but in this state i saw him only the other evening lay down his head upon his desk and shed tears like a child her hand passed softly before my lips while i was yet speaking and in a moment she had met her father at the door of the room and was hanging on his shoulder
the expression of her face as they both looked towards me i felt to be very touching
there was such deep fondness for him and gratitude to him for all his love and care in her beautiful look and there was such a fervent appeal to me to deal tenderly by him even in my inmost thoughts and to let no harsh construction find any place against him she was at once so proud of him and devoted to him yet so compassionate and sorry and so reliant upon me to be so too that nothing she could have said would have expressed more to me or moved me more
we were to drink tea at the doctors
we went there at the usual hour and round the study fireside found the doctor and his young wife and her mother
the doctor who made as much of my going away as if i were going to china received me as an honoured guest and called for a log of wood to be thrown on the fire that he might see the face of his old pupil reddening in the blaze
i shall not see many more new faces in trotwoods stead wickfield said the doctor warming his hands i am getting lazy and want ease
i shall relinquish all my young people in another six months and lead a quieter life you have said so any time these ten years doctor mr wickfield answered
but now i mean to do it returned the doctor
my first master will succeed mei am in earnest at lastso youll soon have to arrange our contracts and to bind us firmly to them like a couple of knaves and to take care said mr wickfield that youre not imposed on eh
as you certainly would be in any contract you should make for yourself
well
i am ready
there are worse tasks than that in my calling i shall have nothing to think of then said the doctor with a smile but my dictionary and this other contractbargainannie as mr wickfield glanced towards her sitting at the tea table by agnes she seemed to me to avoid his look with such unwonted hesitation and timidity that his attention became fixed upon her as if something were suggested to his thoughts
there is a post come in from india i observe he said after a short silence
by the by
and letters from mr jack maldon said the doctor
indeed poor dear jack said mrs markleham shaking her head
that trying climatelike living they tell me on a sandheap underneath a burningglass
he looked strong but he wasnt
my dear doctor it was his spirit not his constitution that he ventured on so boldly
annie my dear i am sure you must perfectly recollect that your cousin never was strongnot what can be called robust you know said mrs markleham with emphasis and looking round upon us generally from the time when my daughter and himself were children together and walking about arminarm the livelong day annie thus addressed made no reply
do i gather from what you say maam that mr maldon is ill asked mr wickfield
ill replied the old soldier
my dear sir hes all sorts of things except well said mr wickfield
except well indeed said the old soldier
he has had dreadful strokes of the sun no doubt and jungle fevers and agues and every kind of thing you can mention
as to his liver said the old soldier resignedly that of course he gave up altogether when he first went out does he say all this asked mr wickfield
say
my dear sir returned mrs markleham shaking her head and her fan you little know my poor jack maldon when you ask that question
say
not he
you might drag him at the heels of four wild horses first mama said mrs strong
annie my dear returned her mother once for all i must really beg that you will not interfere with me unless it is to confirm what i say
you know as well as i do that your cousin maldon would be dragged at the heels of any number of wild horseswhy should i confine myself to four
i wont confine myself to foureight sixteen twoandthirty rather than say anything calculated to overturn the doctors plans wickfields plans said the doctor stroking his face and looking penitently at his adviser
that is to say our joint plans for him
i said myself abroad or at home and i said added mr wickfield gravely abroad
i was the means of sending him abroad
its my responsibility oh
responsibility said the old soldier
everything was done for the best my dear mr wickfield everything was done for the kindest and best we know
but if the dear fellow cant live there he cant live there
and if he cant live there hell die there sooner than hell overturn the doctors plans
i know him said the old soldier fanning herself in a sort of calm prophetic agony and i know hell die there sooner than hell overturn the doctors plans well well maam said the doctor cheerfully i am not bigoted to my plans and i can overturn them myself
i can substitute some other plans
if mr jack maldon comes home on account of ill health he must not be allowed to go back and we must endeavour to make some more suitable and fortunate provision for him in this country mrs markleham was so overcome by this generous speechwhich i need not say she had not at all expected or led up tothat she could only tell the doctor it was like himself and go several times through that operation of kissing the sticks of her fan and then tapping his hand with it
after which she gently chid her daughter annie for not being more demonstrative when such kindnesses were showered for her sake on her old playfellow and entertained us with some particulars concerning other deserving members of her family whom it was desirable to set on their deserving legs
all this time her daughter annie never once spoke or lifted up her eyes
all this time mr wickfield had his glance upon her as she sat by his own daughters side
it appeared to me that he never thought of being observed by anyone but was so intent upon her and upon his own thoughts in connexion with her as to be quite absorbed
he now asked what mr jack maldon had actually written in reference to himself and to whom he had written
why here said mrs markleham taking a letter from the chimneypiece above the doctors head the dear fellow says to the doctor himselfwhere is it
ohi am sorry to inform you that my health is suffering severely and that i fear i may be reduced to the necessity of returning home for a time as the only hope of restoration thats pretty plain poor fellow
his only hope of restoration
but annies letter is plainer still
annie show me that letter again not now mama she pleaded in a low tone
my dear you absolutely are on some subjects one of the most ridiculous persons in the world returned her mother and perhaps the most unnatural to the claims of your own family
we never should have heard of the letter at all i believe unless i had asked for it myself
do you call that confidence my love towards doctor strong
i am surprised
you ought to know better the letter was reluctantly produced and as i handed it to the old lady i saw how the unwilling hand from which i took it trembled
now let us see said mrs markleham putting her glass to her eye where the passage is
the remembrance of old times my dearest annieand so forthits not there
the amiable old proctorwhos he
dear me annie how illegibly your cousin maldon writes and how stupid i am
doctor of course
ah
amiable indeed here she left off to kiss her fan again and shake it at the doctor who was looking at us in a state of placid satisfaction
now i have found it
you may not be surprised to hear annieno to be sure knowing that he never was really strong what did i say just nowthat i have undergone so much in this distant place as to have decided to leave it at all hazards on sick leave if i can on total resignation if that is not to be obtained
what i have endured and do endure here is insupportable and but for the promptitude of that best of creatures said mrs markleham telegraphing the doctor as before and refolding the letter it would be insupportable to me to think of mr wickfield said not one word though the old lady looked to him as if for his commentary on this intelligence but sat severely silent with his eyes fixed on the ground
long after the subject was dismissed and other topics occupied us he remained so seldom raising his eyes unless to rest them for a moment with a thoughtful frown upon the doctor or his wife or both
the doctor was very fond of music
agnes sang with great sweetness and expression and so did mrs strong
they sang together and played duets together and we had quite a little concert
but i remarked two things first that though annie soon recovered her composure and was quite herself there was a blank between her and mr wickfield which separated them wholly from each other secondly that mr wickfield seemed to dislike the intimacy between her and agnes and to watch it with uneasiness
and now i must confess the recollection of what i had seen on that night when mr maldon went away first began to return upon me with a meaning it had never had and to trouble me
the innocent beauty of her face was not as innocent to me as it had been i mistrusted the natural grace and charm of her manner and when i looked at agnes by her side and thought how good and true agnes was suspicions arose within me that it was an illassorted friendship
she was so happy in it herself however and the other was so happy too that they made the evening fly away as if it were but an hour
it closed in an incident which i well remember
they were taking leave of each other and agnes was going to embrace her and kiss her when mr wickfield stepped between them as if by accident and drew agnes quickly away
then i saw as though all the intervening time had been cancelled and i were still standing in the doorway on the night of the departure the expression of that night in the face of mrs strong as it confronted his
i cannot say what an impression this made upon me or how impossible i found it when i thought of her afterwards to separate her from this look and remember her face in its innocent loveliness again
it haunted me when i got home
i seemed to have left the doctors roof with a dark cloud lowering on it
the reverence that i had for his grey head was mingled with commiseration for his faith in those who were treacherous to him and with resentment against those who injured him
the impending shadow of a great affliction and a great disgrace that had no distinct form in it yet fell like a stain upon the quiet place where i had worked and played as a boy and did it a cruel wrong
i had no pleasure in thinking any more of the grave old broadleaved aloetrees which remained shut up in themselves a hundred years together and of the trim smooth grassplot and the stone urns and the doctors walk and the congenial sound of the cathedral bell hovering above them all
it was as if the tranquil sanctuary of my boyhood had been sacked before my face and its peace and honour given to the winds
but morning brought with it my parting from the old house which agnes had filled with her influence and that occupied my mind sufficiently
i should be there again soon no doubt i might sleep againperhaps oftenin my old room but the days of my inhabiting there were gone and the old time was past
i was heavier at heart when i packed up such of my books and clothes as still remained there to be sent to dover than i cared to show to uriah heep who was so officious to help me that i uncharitably thought him mighty glad that i was going
i got away from agnes and her father somehow with an indifferent show of being very manly and took my seat upon the box of the london coach
i was so softened and forgiving going through the town that i had half a mind to nod to my old enemy the butcher and throw him five shillings to drink
but he looked such a very obdurate butcher as he stood scraping the great block in the shop and moreover his appearance was so little improved by the loss of a front tooth which i had knocked out that i thought it best to make no advances
the main object on my mind i remember when we got fairly on the road was to appear as old as possible to the coachman and to speak extremely gruff
the latter point i achieved at great personal inconvenience but i stuck to it because i felt it was a grownup sort of thing
you are going through sir said the coachman
yes william i said condescendingly i knew him i am going to london
i shall go down into suffolk afterwards shooting sir said the coachman
he knew as well as i did that it was just as likely at that time of year i was going down there whaling but i felt complimented too
i dont know i said pretending to be undecided whether i shall take a shot or not birds is got wery shy im told said william
so i understand said i
is suffolk your county sir asked william
yes i said with some importance
suffolks my county im told the dumplings is uncommon fine down there said william
i was not aware of it myself but i felt it necessary to uphold the institutions of my county and to evince a familiarity with them so i shook my head as much as to say i believe you and the punches said william
theres cattle
a suffolk punch when hes a good un is worth his weight in gold
did you ever breed any suffolk punches yourself sir nno i said not exactly heres a genlmn behind me ill pound it said william as has bred em by wholesale the gentleman spoken of was a gentleman with a very unpromising squint and a prominent chin who had a tall white hat on with a narrow flat brim and whose closefitting drab trousers seemed to button all the way up outside his legs from his boots to his hips
his chin was cocked over the coachmans shoulder so near to me that his breath quite tickled the back of my head and as i looked at him he leered at the leaders with the eye with which he didnt squint in a very knowing manner
aint you asked william
aint i what said the gentleman behind
bred them suffolk punches by wholesale i should think so said the gentleman
there aint no sort of orse that i aint bred and no sort of dorg
orses and dorgs is some mens fancy
theyre wittles and drink to melodging wife and childrenreading writing and arithmeticsnuff tobacker and sleep that aint a sort of man to see sitting behind a coachbox is it though said william in my ear as he handled the reins
i construed this remark into an indication of a wish that he should have my place so i blushingly offered to resign it
well if you dont mind sir said william i think it would be more correct i have always considered this as the first fall i had in life
when i booked my place at the coach office i had had box seat written against the entry and had given the bookkeeper halfacrown
i was got up in a special greatcoat and shawl expressly to do honour to that distinguished eminence had glorified myself upon it a good deal and had felt that i was a credit to the coach
and here in the very first stage i was supplanted by a shabby man with a squint who had no other merit than smelling like a liverystables and being able to walk across me more like a fly than a human being while the horses were at a canter
a distrust of myself which has often beset me in life on small occasions when it would have been better away was assuredly not stopped in its growth by this little incident outside the canterbury coach
it was in vain to take refuge in gruffness of speech
i spoke from the pit of my stomach for the rest of the journey but i felt completely extinguished and dreadfully young
it was curious and interesting nevertheless to be sitting up there behind four horses well educated well dressed and with plenty of money in my pocket and to look out for the places where i had slept on my weary journey
i had abundant occupation for my thoughts in every conspicuous landmark on the road
when i looked down at the trampers whom we passed and saw that wellremembered style of face turned up i felt as if the tinkers blackened hand were in the bosom of my shirt again
when we clattered through the narrow street of chatham and i caught a glimpse in passing of the lane where the old monster lived who had bought my jacket i stretched my neck eagerly to look for the place where i had sat in the sun and in the shade waiting for my money
when we came at last within a stage of london and passed the veritable salem house where mr creakle had laid about him with a heavy hand i would have given all i had for lawful permission to get down and thrash him and let all the boys out like so many caged sparrows
we went to the golden cross at charing cross then a mouldy sort of establishment in a close neighbourhood
a waiter showed me into the coffeeroom and a chambermaid introduced me to my small bedchamber which smelt like a hackneycoach and was shut up like a family vault
i was still painfully conscious of my youth for nobody stood in any awe of me at all the chambermaid being utterly indifferent to my opinions on any subject and the waiter being familiar with me and offering advice to my inexperience
well now said the waiter in a tone of confidence what would you like for dinner
young gentlemen likes poultry in general have a fowl i told him as majestically as i could that i wasnt in the humour for a fowl
aint you said the waiter
young gentlemen is generally tired of beef and mutton have a weal cutlet i assented to this proposal in default of being able to suggest anything else
do you care for taters said the waiter with an insinuating smile and his head on one side
young gentlemen generally has been overdosed with taters i commanded him in my deepest voice to order a veal cutlet and potatoes and all things fitting and to inquire at the bar if there were any letters for trotwood copperfield esquirewhich i knew there were not and couldnt be but thought it manly to appear to expect
he soon came back to say that there were none at which i was much surprised and began to lay the cloth for my dinner in a box by the fire
while he was so engaged he asked me what i would take with it and on my replying half a pint of sherry thought it a favourable opportunity i am afraid to extract that measure of wine from the stale leavings at the bottoms of several small decanters
i am of this opinion because while i was reading the newspaper i observed him behind a low wooden partition which was his private apartment very busy pouring out of a number of those vessels into one like a chemist and druggist making up a prescription
when the wine came too i thought it flat and it certainly had more english crumbs in it than were to be expected in a foreign wine in anything like a pure state but i was bashful enough to drink it and say nothing
being then in a pleasant frame of mind from which i infer that poisoning is not always disagreeable in some stages of the process i resolved to go to the play
it was covent garden theatre that i chose and there from the back of a centre box i saw julius caesar and the new pantomime
to have all those noble romans alive before me and walking in and out for my entertainment instead of being the stern taskmasters they had been at school was a most novel and delightful effect
but the mingled reality and mystery of the whole show the influence upon me of the poetry the lights the music the company the smooth stupendous changes of glittering and brilliant scenery were so dazzling and opened up such illimitable regions of delight that when i came out into the rainy street at twelve oclock at night i felt as if i had come from the clouds where i had been leading a romantic life for ages to a bawling splashing linklighted umbrellastruggling hackneycoachjostling pattenclinking muddy miserable world
i had emerged by another door and stood in the street for a little while as if i really were a stranger upon earth but the unceremonious pushing and hustling that i received soon recalled me to myself and put me in the road back to the hotel whither i went revolving the glorious vision all the way and where after some porter and oysters i sat revolving it still at past one oclock with my eyes on the coffeeroom fire
i was so filled with the play and with the pastfor it was in a manner like a shining transparency through which i saw my earlier life moving alongthat i dont know when the figure of a handsome wellformed young man dressed with a tasteful easy negligence which i have reason to remember very well became a real presence to me
but i recollect being conscious of his company without having noticed his coming inand my still sitting musing over the coffeeroom fire
at last i rose to go to bed much to the relief of the sleepy waiter who had got the fidgets in his legs and was twisting them and hitting them and putting them through all kinds of contortions in his small pantry
in going towards the door i passed the person who had come in and saw him plainly
i turned directly came back and looked again
he did not know me but i knew him in a moment
at another time i might have wanted the confidence or the decision to speak to him and might have put it off until next day and might have lost him
but in the then condition of my mind where the play was still running high his former protection of me appeared so deserving of my gratitude and my old love for him overflowed my breast so freshly and spontaneously that i went up to him at once with a fastbeating heart and said steerforth
wont you speak to me he looked at mejust as he used to look sometimesbut i saw no recognition in his face
you dont remember me i am afraid said i
my god he suddenly exclaimed
its little copperfield i grasped him by both hands and could not let them go
but for very shame and the fear that it might displease him i could have held him round the neck and cried
i never never never was so glad
my dear steerforth i am so overjoyed to see you and i am rejoiced to see you too he said shaking my hands heartily
why copperfield old boy dont be overpowered and yet he was glad too i thought to see how the delight i had in meeting him affected me
i brushed away the tears that my utmost resolution had not been able to keep back and i made a clumsy laugh of it and we sat down together side by side
why how do you come to be here said steerforth clapping me on the shoulder
i came here by the canterbury coach today
i have been adopted by an aunt down in that part of the country and have just finished my education there
how do you come to be here steerforth well i am what they call an oxford man he returned that is to say i get bored to death down there periodicallyand i am on my way now to my mothers
youre a devilish amiablelooking fellow copperfield
just what you used to be now i look at you
not altered in the least i knew you immediately i said but you are more easily remembered he laughed as he ran his hand through the clustering curls of his hair and said gaily yes i am on an expedition of duty
my mother lives a little way out of town and the roads being in a beastly condition and our house tedious enough i remained here tonight instead of going on
i have not been in town halfadozen hours and those i have been dozing and grumbling away at the play i have been at the play too said i
at covent garden
what a delightful and magnificent entertainment steerforth steerforth laughed heartily
my dear young davy he said clapping me on the shoulder again you are a very daisy
the daisy of the field at sunrise is not fresher than you are
i have been at covent garden too and there never was a more miserable business
holloa you sir this was addressed to the waiter who had been very attentive to our recognition at a distance and now came forward deferentially
where have you put my friend mr copperfield said steerforth
beg your pardon sir where does he sleep
whats his number
you know what i mean said steerforth
well sir said the waiter with an apologetic air
mr
copperfield is at present in fortyfour sir and what the devil do you mean retorted steerforth by putting mr copperfield into a little loft over a stable why you see we wasnt aware sir returned the waiter still apologetically as mr copperfield was anyways particular
we can give mr copperfield seventytwo sir if it would be preferred
next you sir of course it would be preferred said steerforth
and do it at once the waiter immediately withdrew to make the exchange
steerforth very much amused at my having been put into fortyfour laughed again and clapped me on the shoulder again and invited me to breakfast with him next morning at ten oclockan invitation i was only too proud and happy to accept
it being now pretty late we took our candles and went upstairs where we parted with friendly heartiness at his door and where i found my new room a great improvement on my old one it not being at all musty and having an immense fourpost bedstead in it which was quite a little landed estate
here among pillows enough for six i soon fell asleep in a blissful condition and dreamed of ancient rome steerforth and friendship until the early morning coaches rumbling out of the archway underneath made me dream of thunder and the gods
when the chambermaid tapped at my door at eight oclock and informed me that my shavingwater was outside i felt severely the having no occasion for it and blushed in my bed
the suspicion that she laughed too when she said it preyed upon my mind all the time i was dressing and gave me i was conscious a sneaking and guilty air when i passed her on the staircase as i was going down to breakfast
i was so sensitively aware indeed of being younger than i could have wished that for some time i could not make up my mind to pass her at all under the ignoble circumstances of the case but hearing her there with a broom stood peeping out of window at king charles on horseback surrounded by a maze of hackneycoaches and looking anything but regal in a drizzling rain and a darkbrown fog until i was admonished by the waiter that the gentleman was waiting for me
it was not in the coffeeroom that i found steerforth expecting me but in a snug private apartment redcurtained and turkeycarpeted where the fire burnt bright and a fine hot breakfast was set forth on a table covered with a clean cloth and a cheerful miniature of the room the fire the breakfast steerforth and all was shining in the little round mirror over the sideboard
i was rather bashful at first steerforth being so selfpossessed and elegant and superior to me in all respects age included but his easy patronage soon put that to rights and made me quite at home
i could not enough admire the change he had wrought in the golden cross or compare the dull forlorn state i had held yesterday with this mornings comfort and this mornings entertainment
as to the waiters familiarity it was quenched as if it had never been
he attended on us as i may say in sackcloth and ashes
now copperfield said steerforth when we were alone i should like to hear what you are doing and where you are going and all about you
i feel as if you were my property glowing with pleasure to find that he had still this interest in me i told him how my aunt had proposed the little expedition that i had before me and whither it tended
as you are in no hurry then said steerforth come home with me to highgate and stay a day or two
you will be pleased with my mothershe is a little vain and prosy about me but that you can forgive herand she will be pleased with you i should like to be as sure of that as you are kind enough to say you are i answered smiling
oh said steerforth everyone who likes me has a claim on her that is sure to be acknowledged then i think i shall be a favourite said i
good said steerforth
come and prove it
we will go and see the lions for an hour or twoits something to have a fresh fellow like you to show them to copperfieldand then well journey out to highgate by the coach i could hardly believe but that i was in a dream and that i should wake presently in number fortyfour to the solitary box in the coffeeroom and the familiar waiter again
after i had written to my aunt and told her of my fortunate meeting with my admired old schoolfellow and my acceptance of his invitation we went out in a hackneychariot and saw a panorama and some other sights and took a walk through the museum where i could not help observing how much steerforth knew on an infinite variety of subjects and of how little account he seemed to make his knowledge
youll take a high degree at college steerforth said i if you have not done so already and they will have good reason to be proud of you i take a degree cried steerforth
not i
my dear daisywill you mind my calling you daisy not at all said i
thats a good fellow
my dear daisy said steerforth laughing
i have not the least desire or intention to distinguish myself in that way
i have done quite sufficient for my purpose
i find that i am heavy company enough for myself as i am but the fame i was beginning
you romantic daisy said steerforth laughing still more heartily why should i trouble myself that a parcel of heavyheaded fellows may gape and hold up their hands
let them do it at some other man
theres fame for him and hes welcome to it i was abashed at having made so great a mistake and was glad to change the subject
fortunately it was not difficult to do for steerforth could always pass from one subject to another with a carelessness and lightness that were his own
lunch succeeded to our sightseeing and the short winter day wore away so fast that it was dusk when the stagecoach stopped with us at an old brick house at highgate on the summit of the hill
an elderly lady though not very far advanced in years with a proud carriage and a handsome face was in the doorway as we alighted and greeting steerforth as my dearest james folded him in her arms
to this lady he presented me as his mother and she gave me a stately welcome
it was a genteel oldfashioned house very quiet and orderly
from the windows of my room i saw all london lying in the distance like a great vapour with here and there some lights twinkling through it
i had only time in dressing to glance at the solid furniture the framed pieces of work done i supposed by steerforths mother when she was a girl and some pictures in crayons of ladies with powdered hair and bodices coming and going on the walls as the newlykindled fire crackled and sputtered when i was called to dinner
there was a second lady in the diningroom of a slight short figure dark and not agreeable to look at but with some appearance of good looks too who attracted my attention perhaps because i had not expected to see her perhaps because i found myself sitting opposite to her perhaps because of something really remarkable in her
she had black hair and eager black eyes and was thin and had a scar upon her lip
it was an old scari should rather call it seam for it was not discoloured and had healed years agowhich had once cut through her mouth downward towards the chin but was now barely visible across the table except above and on her upper lip the shape of which it had altered
i concluded in my own mind that she was about thirty years of age and that she wished to be married
she was a little dilapidatedlike a housewith having been so long to let yet had as i have said an appearance of good looks
her thinness seemed to be the effect of some wasting fire within her which found a vent in her gaunt eyes
she was introduced as miss dartle and both steerforth and his mother called her rosa
i found that she lived there and had been for a long time mrs steerforths companion
it appeared to me that she never said anything she wanted to say outright but hinted it and made a great deal more of it by this practice
for example when mrs steerforth observed more in jest than earnest that she feared her son led but a wild life at college miss dartle put in thus oh really
you know how ignorant i am and that i only ask for information but isnt it always so
i thought that kind of life was on all hands understood to beeh it is education for a very grave profession if you mean that rosa mrs steerforth answered with some coldness
oh
yes
thats very true returned miss dartle
but isnt it thoughi want to be put right if i am wrongisnt it really really what said mrs steerforth
oh
you mean its not returned miss dartle
well im very glad to hear it
now i know what to do
thats the advantage of asking
i shall never allow people to talk before me about wastefulness and profligacy and so forth in connexion with that life any more and you will be right said mrs steerforth
my sons tutor is a conscientious gentleman and if i had not implicit reliance on my son i should have reliance on him should you said miss dartle
dear me
conscientious is he
really conscientious now yes i am convinced of it said mrs steerforth
how very nice exclaimed miss dartle
what a comfort
really conscientious
then hes notbut of course he cant be if hes really conscientious
well i shall be quite happy in my opinion of him from this time
you cant think how it elevates him in my opinion to know for certain that hes really conscientious her own views of every question and her correction of everything that was said to which she was opposed miss dartle insinuated in the same way sometimes i could not conceal from myself with great power though in contradiction even of steerforth
an instance happened before dinner was done
mrs steerforth speaking to me about my intention of going down into suffolk i said at hazard how glad i should be if steerforth would only go there with me and explaining to him that i was going to see my old nurse and mr peggottys family i reminded him of the boatman whom he had seen at school
oh
that bluff fellow said steerforth
he had a son with him hadnt he no
that was his nephew i replied whom he adopted though as a son
he has a very pretty little niece too whom he adopted as a daughter
in short his houseor rather his boat for he lives in one on dry landis full of people who are objects of his generosity and kindness
you would be delighted to see that household should i said steerforth
well i think i should
i must see what can be done
it would be worth a journey not to mention the pleasure of a journey with you daisy to see that sort of people together and to make one of em my heart leaped with a new hope of pleasure
but it was in reference to the tone in which he had spoken of that sort of people that miss dartle whose sparkling eyes had been watchful of us now broke in again
oh but really
do tell me
are they though she said
are they what
and are who what said steerforth
that sort of peopleare they really animals and clods and beings of another order
i want to know so much why theres a pretty wide separation between them and us said steerforth with indifference
they are not to be expected to be as sensitive as we are
their delicacy is not to be shocked or hurt easily
they are wonderfully virtuous i dare saysome people contend for that at least and i am sure i dont want to contradict thembut they have not very fine natures and they may be thankful that like their coarse rough skins they are not easily wounded really said miss dartle
well i dont know now when i have been better pleased than to hear that
its so consoling
its such a delight to know that when they suffer they dont feel
sometimes i have been quite uneasy for that sort of people but now i shall just dismiss the idea of them altogether
live and learn
i had my doubts i confess but now theyre cleared up
i didnt know and now i do know and that shows the advantage of askingdont it i believed that steerforth had said what he had in jest or to draw miss dartle out and i expected him to say as much when she was gone and we two were sitting before the fire
but he merely asked me what i thought of her
she is very clever is she not i asked
clever
she brings everything to a grindstone said steerforth and sharpens it as she has sharpened her own face and figure these years past
she has worn herself away by constant sharpening
she is all edge what a remarkable scar that is upon her lip i said
steerforths face fell and he paused a moment
why the fact is he returned i did that by an unfortunate accident no
i was a young boy and she exasperated me and i threw a hammer at her
a promising young angel i must have been i was deeply sorry to have touched on such a painful theme but that was useless now
she has borne the mark ever since as you see said steerforth and shell bear it to her grave if she ever rests in onethough i can hardly believe she will ever rest anywhere
she was the motherless child of a sort of cousin of my fathers
he died one day
my mother who was then a widow brought her here to be company to her
she has a couple of thousand pounds of her own and saves the interest of it every year to add to the principal
theres the history of miss rosa dartle for you and i have no doubt she loves you like a brother said i
humph retorted steerforth looking at the fire
some brothers are not loved over much and some lovebut help yourself copperfield
well drink the daisies of the field in compliment to you and the lilies of the valley that toil not neither do they spin in compliment to methe more shame for me a moody smile that had overspread his features cleared off as he said this merrily and he was his own frank winning self again
i could not help glancing at the scar with a painful interest when we went in to tea
it was not long before i observed that it was the most susceptible part of her face and that when she turned pale that mark altered first and became a dull leadcoloured streak lengthening out to its full extent like a mark in invisible ink brought to the fire
there was a little altercation between her and steerforth about a cast of the dice at backgammonwhen i thought her for one moment in a storm of rage and then i saw it start forth like the old writing on the wall
it was no matter of wonder to me to find mrs steerforth devoted to her son
she seemed to be able to speak or think about nothing else
she showed me his picture as an infant in a locket with some of his babyhair in it she showed me his picture as he had been when i first knew him and she wore at her breast his picture as he was now
all the letters he had ever written to her she kept in a cabinet near her own chair by the fire and she would have read me some of them and i should have been very glad to hear them too if he had not interposed and coaxed her out of the design
it was at mr creakles my son tells me that you first became acquainted said mrs steerforth as she and i were talking at one table while they played backgammon at another
indeed i recollect his speaking at that time of a pupil younger than himself who had taken his fancy there but your name as you may suppose has not lived in my memory he was very generous and noble to me in those days i assure you maam said i and i stood in need of such a friend
i should have been quite crushed without him he is always generous and noble said mrs steerforth proudly
i subscribed to this with all my heart god knows
she knew i did for the stateliness of her manner already abated towards me except when she spoke in praise of him and then her air was always lofty
it was not a fit school generally for my son said she far from it but there were particular circumstances to be considered at the time of more importance even than that selection
my sons high spirit made it desirable that he should be placed with some man who felt its superiority and would be content to bow himself before it and we found such a man there i knew that knowing the fellow
and yet i did not despise him the more for it but thought it a redeeming quality in him if he could be allowed any grace for not resisting one so irresistible as steerforth
my sons great capacity was tempted on there by a feeling of voluntary emulation and conscious pride the fond lady went on to say
he would have risen against all constraint but he found himself the monarch of the place and he haughtily determined to be worthy of his station
it was like himself i echoed with all my heart and soul that it was like himself
so my son took of his own will and on no compulsion to the course in which he can always when it is his pleasure outstrip every competitor she pursued
my son informs me mr copperfield that you were quite devoted to him and that when you met yesterday you made yourself known to him with tears of joy
i should be an affected woman if i made any pretence of being surprised by my sons inspiring such emotions but i cannot be indifferent to anyone who is so sensible of his merit and i am very glad to see you here and can assure you that he feels an unusual friendship for you and that you may rely on his protection miss dartle played backgammon as eagerly as she did everything else
if i had seen her first at the board i should have fancied that her figure had got thin and her eyes had got large over that pursuit and no other in the world
but i am very much mistaken if she missed a word of this or lost a look of mine as i received it with the utmost pleasure and honoured by mrs steerforths confidence felt older than i had done since i left canterbury
when the evening was pretty far spent and a tray of glasses and decanters came in steerforth promised over the fire that he would seriously think of going down into the country with me
there was no hurry he said a week hence would do and his mother hospitably said the same
while we were talking he more than once called me daisy which brought miss dartle out again
but really mr copperfield she asked is it a nickname
and why does he give it you
is itehbecause he thinks you young and innocent
i am so stupid in these things i coloured in replying that i believed it was
oh said miss dartle
now i am glad to know that
i ask for information and i am glad to know it
he thinks you young and innocent and so you are his friend
well thats quite delightful she went to bed soon after this and mrs steerforth retired too
steerforth and i after lingering for halfanhour over the fire talking about traddles and all the rest of them at old salem house went upstairs together
steerforths room was next to mine and i went in to look at it
it was a picture of comfort full of easychairs cushions and footstools worked by his mothers hand and with no sort of thing omitted that could help to render it complete
finally her handsome features looked down on her darling from a portrait on the wall as if it were even something to her that her likeness should watch him while he slept
i found the fire burning clear enough in my room by this time and the curtains drawn before the windows and round the bed giving it a very snug appearance
i sat down in a great chair upon the hearth to meditate on my happiness and had enjoyed the contemplation of it for some time when i found a likeness of miss dartle looking eagerly at me from above the chimneypiece
it was a startling likeness and necessarily had a startling look
the painter hadnt made the scar but i made it and there it was coming and going now confined to the upper lip as i had seen it at dinner and now showing the whole extent of the wound inflicted by the hammer as i had seen it when she was passionate
i wondered peevishly why they couldnt put her anywhere else instead of quartering her on me
to get rid of her i undressed quickly extinguished my light and went to bed
but as i fell asleep i could not forget that she was still there looking is it really though
i want to know and when i awoke in the night i found that i was uneasily asking all sorts of people in my dreams whether it really was or notwithout knowing what i meant
there was a servant in that house a man who i understood was usually with steerforth and had come into his service at the university who was in appearance a pattern of respectability
i believe there never existed in his station a more respectablelooking man
he was taciturn softfooted very quiet in his manner deferential observant always at hand when wanted and never near when not wanted but his great claim to consideration was his respectability
he had not a pliant face he had rather a stiff neck rather a tight smooth head with short hair clinging to it at the sides a soft way of speaking with a peculiar habit of whispering the letter s so distinctly that he seemed to use it oftener than any other man but every peculiarity that he had he made respectable
if his nose had been upsidedown he would have made that respectable
he surrounded himself with an atmosphere of respectability and walked secure in it
it would have been next to impossible to suspect him of anything wrong he was so thoroughly respectable
nobody could have thought of putting him in a livery he was so highly respectable
to have imposed any derogatory work upon him would have been to inflict a wanton insult on the feelings of a most respectable man
and of this i noticedthe womenservants in the household were so intuitively conscious that they always did such work themselves and generally while he read the paper by the pantry fire
such a selfcontained man i never saw
but in that quality as in every other he possessed he only seemed to be the more respectable
even the fact that no one knew his christian name seemed to form a part of his respectability
nothing could be objected against his surname littimer by which he was known
peter might have been hanged or tom transported but littimer was perfectly respectable
it was occasioned i suppose by the reverend nature of respectability in the abstract but i felt particularly young in this mans presence
how old he was himself i could not guessand that again went to his credit on the same score for in the calmness of respectability he might have numbered fifty years as well as thirty
littimer was in my room in the morning before i was up to bring me that reproachful shavingwater and to put out my clothes
when i undrew the curtains and looked out of bed i saw him in an equable temperature of respectability unaffected by the east wind of january and not even breathing frostily standing my boots right and left in the first dancing position and blowing specks of dust off my coat as he laid it down like a baby
i gave him good morning and asked him what oclock it was
he took out of his pocket the most respectable huntingwatch i ever saw and preventing the spring with his thumb from opening far looked in at the face as if he were consulting an oracular oyster shut it up again and said if i pleased it was half past eight
mr
steerforth will be glad to hear how you have rested sir thank you said i very well indeed
is mr steerforth quite well thank you sir mr steerforth is tolerably well another of his characteristicsno use of superlatives
a cool calm medium always
is there anything more i can have the honour of doing for you sir
the warningbell will ring at nine the family take breakfast at half past nine nothing i thank you i thank you sir if you please and with that and with a little inclination of his head when he passed the bedside as an apology for correcting me he went out shutting the door as delicately as if i had just fallen into a sweet sleep on which my life depended
every morning we held exactly this conversation never any more and never any less and yet invariably however far i might have been lifted out of myself overnight and advanced towards maturer years by steerforths companionship or mrs steerforths confidence or miss dartles conversation in the presence of this most respectable man i became as our smaller poets sing a boy again
he got horses for us and steerforth who knew everything gave me lessons in riding
he provided foils for us and steerforth gave me lessons in fencinggloves and i began of the same master to improve in boxing
it gave me no manner of concern that steerforth should find me a novice in these sciences but i never could bear to show my want of skill before the respectable littimer
i had no reason to believe that littimer understood such arts himself he never led me to suppose anything of the kind by so much as the vibration of one of his respectable eyelashes yet whenever he was by while we were practising i felt myself the greenest and most inexperienced of mortals
i am particular about this man because he made a particular effect on me at that time and because of what took place thereafter
the week passed away in a most delightful manner
it passed rapidly as may be supposed to one entranced as i was and yet it gave me so many occasions for knowing steerforth better and admiring him more in a thousand respects that at its close i seemed to have been with him for a much longer time
a dashing way he had of treating me like a plaything was more agreeable to me than any behaviour he could have adopted
it reminded me of our old acquaintance it seemed the natural sequel of it it showed me that he was unchanged it relieved me of any uneasiness i might have felt in comparing my merits with his and measuring my claims upon his friendship by any equal standard above all it was a familiar unrestrained affectionate demeanour that he used towards no one else
as he had treated me at school differently from all the rest i joyfully believed that he treated me in life unlike any other friend he had
i believed that i was nearer to his heart than any other friend and my own heart warmed with attachment to him
he made up his mind to go with me into the country and the day arrived for our departure
he had been doubtful at first whether to take littimer or not but decided to leave him at home
the respectable creature satisfied with his lot whatever it was arranged our portmanteaux on the little carriage that was to take us into london as if they were intended to defy the shocks of ages and received my modestly proffered donation with perfect tranquillity
we bade adieu to mrs steerforth and miss dartle with many thanks on my part and much kindness on the devoted mothers
the last thing i saw was littimers unruffled eye fraught as i fancied with the silent conviction that i was very young indeed
what i felt in returning so auspiciously to the old familiar places i shall not endeavour to describe
we went down by the mail
i was so concerned i recollect even for the honour of yarmouth that when steerforth said as we drove through its dark streets to the inn that as well as he could make out it was a good queer outoftheway kind of hole i was highly pleased
we went to bed on our arrival i observed a pair of dirty shoes and gaiters in connexion with my old friend the dolphin as we passed that door and breakfasted late in the morning
steerforth who was in great spirits had been strolling about the beach before i was up and had made acquaintance he said with half the boatmen in the place
moreover he had seen in the distance what he was sure must be the identical house of mr peggotty with smoke coming out of the chimney and had had a great mind he told me to walk in and swear he was myself grown out of knowledge
when do you propose to introduce me there daisy he said
i am at your disposal
make your own arrangements why i was thinking that this evening would be a good time steerforth when they are all sitting round the fire
i should like you to see it when its snug its such a curious place so be it returned steerforth
this evening i shall not give them any notice that we are here you know said i delighted
we must take them by surprise oh of course
its no fun said steerforth unless we take them by surprise
let us see the natives in their aboriginal condition though they are that sort of people that you mentioned i returned
aha
what
you recollect my skirmishes with rosa do you he exclaimed with a quick look
confound the girl i am half afraid of her
shes like a goblin to me
but never mind her
now what are you going to do
you are going to see your nurse i suppose why yes i said i must see peggotty first of all well replied steerforth looking at his watch
suppose i deliver you up to be cried over for a couple of hours
is that long enough i answered laughing that i thought we might get through it in that time but that he must come also for he would find that his renown had preceded him and that he was almost as great a personage as i was
ill come anywhere you like said steerforth or do anything you like
tell me where to come to and in two hours ill produce myself in any state you please sentimental or comical i gave him minute directions for finding the residence of mr barkis carrier to blunderstone and elsewhere and on this understanding went out alone
there was a sharp bracing air the ground was dry the sea was crisp and clear the sun was diffusing abundance of light if not much warmth and everything was fresh and lively
i was so fresh and lively myself in the pleasure of being there that i could have stopped the people in the streets and shaken hands with them
the streets looked small of course
the streets that we have only seen as children always do i believe when we go back to them
but i had forgotten nothing in them and found nothing changed until i came to mr omers shop
omer and joram was now written up where omer used to be but the inscription draper tailor haberdasher funeral furnisher c remained as it was
my footsteps seemed to tend so naturally to the shop door after i had read these words from over the way that i went across the road and looked in
there was a pretty woman at the back of the shop dancing a little child in her arms while another little fellow clung to her apron
i had no difficulty in recognizing either minnie or minnies children
the glass door of the parlour was not open but in the workshop across the yard i could faintly hear the old tune playing as if it had never left off
is mr omer at home said i entering
i should like to see him for a moment if he is oh yes sir he is at home said minnie the weather dont suit his asthma out of doors
joe call your grandfather the little fellow who was holding her apron gave such a lusty shout that the sound of it made him bashful and he buried his face in her skirts to her great admiration
i heard a heavy puffing and blowing coming towards us and soon mr omer shorterwinded than of yore but not much olderlooking stood before me
servant sir said mr omer
what can i do for you sir you can shake hands with me mr omer if you please said i putting out my own
you were very goodnatured to me once when i am afraid i didnt show that i thought so was i though returned the old man
im glad to hear it but i dont remember when
are you sure it was me quite i think my memory has got as short as my breath said mr omer looking at me and shaking his head for i dont remember you dont you remember your coming to the coach to meet me and my having breakfast here and our riding out to blunderstone together you and i and mrs joram and mr joram toowho wasnt her husband then why lord bless my soul exclaimed mr omer after being thrown by his surprise into a fit of coughing you dont say so
minnie my dear you recollect
dear me yes the party was a lady i think my mother i rejoined
tobesure said mr omer touching my waistcoat with his forefinger and there was a little child too
there was two parties
the little party was laid along with the other party
over at blunderstone it was of course
dear me
and how have you been since very well i thanked him as i hoped he had been too
oh
nothing to grumble at you know said mr omer
i find my breath gets short but it seldom gets longer as a man gets older
i take it as it comes and make the most of it
thats the best way aint it mr omer coughed again in consequence of laughing and was assisted out of his fit by his daughter who now stood close beside us dancing her smallest child on the counter
dear me said mr omer
yes to be sure
two parties
why in that very ride if youll believe me the day was named for my minnie to marry joram
do name it sir says joram
yes do father says minnie
and now hes come into the business
and look here
the youngest minnie laughed and stroked her banded hair upon her temples as her father put one of his fat fingers into the hand of the child she was dancing on the counter
two parties of course said mr omer nodding his head retrospectively
exactly so
and jorams at work at this minute on a grey one with silver nails not this measurementthe measurement of the dancing child upon the counterby a good two incheswill you take something i thanked him but declined
let me see said mr omer
barkiss the carriers wifepeggottys the boatmans sistershe had something to do with your family
she was in service there sure my answering in the affirmative gave him great satisfaction
i believe my breath will get long next my memorys getting so much so said mr omer
well sir weve got a young relation of hers here under articles to us that has as elegant a taste in the dressmaking businessi assure you i dont believe theres a duchess in england can touch her not little emly said i involuntarily
emlys her name said mr omer and shes little too
but if youll believe me she has such a face of her own that half the women in this town are mad against her nonsense father cried minnie
my dear said mr omer i dont say its the case with you winking at me but i say that half the women in yarmouthah
and in five mile roundare mad against that girl then she should have kept to her own station in life father said minnie and not have given them any hold to talk about her and then they couldnt have done it couldnt have done it my dear retorted mr omer
couldnt have done it
is that your knowledge of life
what is there that any woman couldnt do that she shouldnt doespecially on the subject of another womans good looks i really thought it was all over with mr omer after he had uttered this libellous pleasantry
he coughed to that extent and his breath eluded all his attempts to recover it with that obstinacy that i fully expected to see his head go down behind the counter and his little black breeches with the rusty little bunches of ribbons at the knees come quivering up in a last ineffectual struggle
at length however he got better though he still panted hard and was so exhausted that he was obliged to sit on the stool of the shopdesk
you see he said wiping his head and breathing with difficulty she hasnt taken much to any companions here she hasnt taken kindly to any particular acquaintances and friends not to mention sweethearts
in consequence an illnatured story got about that emly wanted to be a lady
now my opinion is that it came into circulation principally on account of her sometimes saying at the school that if she was a lady she would like to do soandso for her uncledont you seeand buy him suchandsuch fine things i assure you mr omer she has said so to me i returned eagerly when we were both children mr omer nodded his head and rubbed his chin
just so
then out of a very little she could dress herself you see better than most others could out of a deal and that made things unpleasant
moreover she was rather what might be called waywardill go so far as to say what i should call wayward myself said mr omer didnt know her own mind quitea little spoiledand couldnt at first exactly bind herself down
no more than that was ever said against her minnie no father said mrs joram
thats the worst i believe so when she got a situation said mr omer to keep a fractious old lady company they didnt very well agree and she didnt stop
at last she came here apprenticed for three years
nearly two of em are over and she has been as good a girl as ever was
worth any six
minnie is she worth any six now yes father replied minnie
never say i detracted from her very good said mr omer
thats right
and so young gentleman he added after a few moments further rubbing of his chin that you may not consider me longwinded as well as shortbreathed i believe thats all about it as they had spoken in a subdued tone while speaking of emly i had no doubt that she was near
on my asking now if that were not so mr omer nodded yes and nodded towards the door of the parlour
my hurried inquiry if i might peep in was answered with a free permission and looking through the glass i saw her sitting at her work
i saw her a most beautiful little creature with the cloudless blue eyes that had looked into my childish heart turned laughingly upon another child of minnies who was playing near her with enough of wilfulness in her bright face to justify what i had heard with much of the old capricious coyness lurking in it but with nothing in her pretty looks i am sure but what was meant for goodness and for happiness and what was on a good and happy course
the tune across the yard that seemed as if it never had left offalas
it was the tune that never does leave offwas beating softly all the while
wouldnt you like to step in said mr omer and speak to her
walk in and speak to her sir
make yourself at home i was too bashful to do so theni was afraid of confusing her and i was no less afraid of confusing myselfbut i informed myself of the hour at which she left of an evening in order that our visit might be timed accordingly and taking leave of mr omer and his pretty daughter and her little children went away to my dear old peggottys
here she was in the tiled kitchen cooking dinner
the moment i knocked at the door she opened it and asked me what i pleased to want
i looked at her with a smile but she gave me no smile in return
i had never ceased to write to her but it must have been seven years since we had met
is mr barkis at home maam i said feigning to speak roughly to her
hes at home sir returned peggotty but hes bad abed with the rheumatics dont he go over to blunderstone now i asked
when hes well he do she answered
do you ever go there mrs barkis she looked at me more attentively and i noticed a quick movement of her hands towards each other
because i want to ask a question about a house there that they call thewhat is itthe rookery said i
she took a step backward and put out her hands in an undecided frightened way as if to keep me off
peggotty i cried to her
she cried my darling boy and we both burst into tears and were locked in one anothers arms
what extravagances she committed what laughing and crying over me what pride she showed what joy what sorrow that she whose pride and joy i might have been could never hold me in a fond embrace i have not the heart to tell
i was troubled with no misgiving that it was young in me to respond to her emotions
i had never laughed and cried in all my life i dare saynot even to hermore freely than i did that morning
barkis will be so glad said peggotty wiping her eyes with her apron that itll do him more good than pints of liniment
may i go and tell him you are here
will you come up and see him my dear of course i would
but peggotty could not get out of the room as easily as she meant to for as often as she got to the door and looked round at me she came back again to have another laugh and another cry upon my shoulder
at last to make the matter easier i went upstairs with her and having waited outside for a minute while she said a word of preparation to mr barkis presented myself before that invalid
he received me with absolute enthusiasm
he was too rheumatic to be shaken hands with but he begged me to shake the tassel on the top of his nightcap which i did most cordially
when i sat down by the side of the bed he said that it did him a world of good to feel as if he was driving me on the blunderstone road again
as he lay in bed face upward and so covered with that exception that he seemed to be nothing but a facelike a conventional cherubimhe looked the queerest object i ever beheld
what name was it as i wrote up in the cart sir said mr barkis with a slow rheumatic smile
ah
mr barkis we had some grave talks about that matter hadnt we i was willin a long time sir said mr barkis
a long time said i
and i dont regret it said mr barkis
do you remember what you told me once about her making all the apple parsties and doing all the cooking yes very well i returned
it was as true said mr barkis as turnips is
it was as true said mr barkis nodding his nightcap which was his only means of emphasis as taxes is
and nothings truer than them mr barkis turned his eyes upon me as if for my assent to this result of his reflections in bed and i gave it
nothings truer than them repeated mr barkis a man as poor as i am finds that out in his mind when hes laid up
im a very poor man sir i am sorry to hear it mr barkis a very poor man indeed i am said mr barkis
here his right hand came slowly and feebly from under the bedclothes and with a purposeless uncertain grasp took hold of a stick which was loosely tied to the side of the bed
after some poking about with this instrument in the course of which his face assumed a variety of distracted expressions mr barkis poked it against a box an end of which had been visible to me all the time
then his face became composed
old clothes said mr barkis
oh said i
i wish it was money sir said mr barkis
i wish it was indeed said i
but it aint said mr barkis opening both his eyes as wide as he possibly could
i expressed myself quite sure of that and mr barkis turning his eyes more gently to his wife said shes the usefullest and best of women c p barkis
all the praise that anyone can give to c p barkis she deserves and more
my dear youll get a dinner today for company something good to eat and drink will you i should have protested against this unnecessary demonstration in my honour but that i saw peggotty on the opposite side of the bed extremely anxious i should not
so i held my peace
i have got a trifle of money somewhere about me my dear said mr barkis but im a little tired
if you and mr david will leave me for a short nap ill try and find it when i wake we left the room in compliance with this request
when we got outside the door peggotty informed me that mr barkis being now a little nearer than he used to be always resorted to this same device before producing a single coin from his store and that he endured unheardof agonies in crawling out of bed alone and taking it from that unlucky box
in effect we presently heard him uttering suppressed groans of the most dismal nature as this magpie proceeding racked him in every joint but while peggottys eyes were full of compassion for him she said his generous impulse would do him good and it was better not to check it
so he groaned on until he had got into bed again suffering i have no doubt a martyrdom and then called us in pretending to have just woke up from a refreshing sleep and to produce a guinea from under his pillow
his satisfaction in which happy imposition on us and in having preserved the impenetrable secret of the box appeared to be a sufficient compensation to him for all his tortures
i prepared peggotty for steerforths arrival and it was not long before he came
i am persuaded she knew no difference between his having been a personal benefactor of hers and a kind friend to me and that she would have received him with the utmost gratitude and devotion in any case
but his easy spirited good humour his genial manner his handsome looks his natural gift of adapting himself to whomsoever he pleased and making direct when he cared to do it to the main point of interest in anybodys heart bound her to him wholly in five minutes
his manner to me alone would have won her
but through all these causes combined i sincerely believe she had a kind of adoration for him before he left the house that night
he stayed there with me to dinnerif i were to say willingly i should not half express how readily and gaily
he went into mr barkiss room like light and air brightening and refreshing it as if he were healthy weather
there was no noise no effort no consciousness in anything he did but in everything an indescribable lightness a seeming impossibility of doing anything else or doing anything better which was so graceful so natural and agreeable that it overcomes me even now in the remembrance
we made merry in the little parlour where the book of martyrs unthumbed since my time was laid out upon the desk as of old and where i now turned over its terrific pictures remembering the old sensations they had awakened but not feeling them
when peggotty spoke of what she called my room and of its being ready for me at night and of her hoping i would occupy it before i could so much as look at steerforth hesitating he was possessed of the whole case
of course he said
youll sleep here while we stay and i shall sleep at the hotel but to bring you so far i returned and to separate seems bad companionship steerforth why in the name of heaven where do you naturally belong he said
what is seems compared to that it was settled at once
he maintained all his delightful qualities to the last until we started forth at eight oclock for mr peggottys boat
indeed they were more and more brightly exhibited as the hours went on for i thought even then and i have no doubt now that the consciousness of success in his determination to please inspired him with a new delicacy of perception and made it subtle as it was more easy to him
if anyone had told me then that all this was a brilliant game played for the excitement of the moment for the employment of high spirits in the thoughtless love of superiority in a mere wasteful careless course of winning what was worthless to him and next minute thrown awayi say if anyone had told me such a lie that night i wonder in what manner of receiving it my indignation would have found a vent
probably only in an increase had that been possible of the romantic feelings of fidelity and friendship with which i walked beside him over the dark wintry sands towards the old boat the wind sighing around us even more mournfully than it had sighed and moaned upon the night when i first darkened mr peggottys door
this is a wild kind of place steerforth is it not dismal enough in the dark he said and the sea roars as if it were hungry for us
is that the boat where i see a light yonder thats the boat said i
and its the same i saw this morning he returned
i came straight to it by instinct i suppose we said no more as we approached the light but made softly for the door
i laid my hand upon the latch and whispering steerforth to keep close to me went in
a murmur of voices had been audible on the outside and at the moment of our entrance a clapping of hands which latter noise i was surprised to see proceeded from the generally disconsolate mrs gummidge
but mrs gummidge was not the only person there who was unusually excited
mr peggotty his face lighted up with uncommon satisfaction and laughing with all his might held his rough arms wide open as if for little emly to run into them ham with a mixed expression in his face of admiration exultation and a lumbering sort of bashfulness that sat upon him very well held little emly by the hand as if he were presenting her to mr peggotty little emly herself blushing and shy but delighted with mr peggottys delight as her joyous eyes expressed was stopped by our entrance for she saw us first in the very act of springing from ham to nestle in mr peggottys embrace
in the first glimpse we had of them all and at the moment of our passing from the dark cold night into the warm light room this was the way in which they were all employed mrs gummidge in the background clapping her hands like a madwoman
the little picture was so instantaneously dissolved by our going in that one might have doubted whether it had ever been
i was in the midst of the astonished family face to face with mr peggotty and holding out my hand to him when ham shouted masr davy
its masr davy in a moment we were all shaking hands with one another and asking one another how we did and telling one another how glad we were to meet and all talking at once
mr peggotty was so proud and overjoyed to see us that he did not know what to say or do but kept over and over again shaking hands with me and then with steerforth and then with me and then ruffling his shaggy hair all over his head and laughing with such glee and triumph that it was a treat to see him
why that you two gentlmengentlmen growedshould come to this here roof tonight of all nights in my life said mr peggotty is such a thing as never happened afore i do rightly believe
emly my darling come here
come here my little witch
theres masr davys friend my dear
theres the gentlman as youve heerd on emly
he comes to see you along with masr davy on the brightest night of your uncles life as ever was or will be gorm the tother one and horroar for it after delivering this speech all in a breath and with extraordinary animation and pleasure mr peggotty put one of his large hands rapturously on each side of his nieces face and kissing it a dozen times laid it with a gentle pride and love upon his broad chest and patted it as if his hand had been a ladys
then he let her go and as she ran into the little chamber where i used to sleep looked round upon us quite hot and out of breath with his uncommon satisfaction
if you two gentlmengentlmen growed now and such gentlmen said mr peggotty
so th are so th are cried ham
well said
so th are
masr davy borgentlmen growedso th are if you two gentlmen gentlmen growed said mr peggotty dont excuse me for being in a state of mind when you understand matters ill arks your pardon
emly my dearshe knows im a going to tell here his delight broke out again and has made off
would you be so good as look arter her mawther for a minute mrs gummidge nodded and disappeared
if this aint said mr peggotty sitting down among us by the fire the brightest night o my life im a shellfishbiled tooand more i cant say
this here little emly sir in a low voice to steerforth her as you see a blushing here just now steerforth only nodded but with such a pleased expression of interest and of participation in mr peggottys feelings that the latter answered him as if he had spoken
to be sure said mr peggotty
thats her and so she is
thankee sir ham nodded to me several times as if he would have said so too
this here little emly of ours said mr peggotty has been in our house what i suppose im a ignorant man but thats my belief no one but a little brighteyed creetur can be in a house
she aint my child i never had one but i couldnt love her more
you understand
i couldnt do it i quite understand said steerforth
i know you do sir returned mr peggotty and thankee again
masr davy he can remember what she was you may judge for your own self what she is but neither of you cant fully know what she has been is and will be to my loving art
i am rough sir said mr peggotty i am as rough as a sea porkypine but no one unless mayhap it is a woman can know i think what our little emly is to me
and betwixt ourselves sinking his voice lower yet that womans name aint missis gummidge neither though she has a world of merits mr peggotty ruffled his hair again with both hands as a further preparation for what he was going to say and went on with a hand upon each of his knees there was a certain person as had knowd our emly from the time when her father was drownded as had seen her constant when a babby when a young gal when a woman
not much of a person to look at he warnt said mr peggotty something o my own buildrougha good deal o the souwester in himwery saltbut on the whole a honest sort of a chap with his art in the right place i thought i had never seen ham grin to anything like the extent to which he sat grinning at us now
what does this here blessed tarpaulin go and do said mr peggotty with his face one high noon of enjoyment but he loses that there art of his to our little emly
he follers her about he makes hisself a sort o servant to her he loses in a great measure his relish for his wittles and in the longrun he makes it clear to me wots amiss
now i could wish myself you see that our little emly was in a fair way of being married
i could wish to see her at all ewents under articles to a honest man as had a right to defend her
i dont know how long i may live or how soon i may die but i know that if i was capsized any night in a gale of wind in yarmouth roads here and was to see the townlights shining for the last time over the rollers as i couldnt make no head against i could go down quieter for thinking theres a man ashore there irontrue to my little emly god bless her and no wrong can touch my emly while so be as that man lives mr peggotty in simple earnestness waved his right arm as if he were waving it at the townlights for the last time and then exchanging a nod with ham whose eye he caught proceeded as before
well
i counsels him to speak to emly
hes big enough but hes bashfuller than a little un and he dont like
so i speak
what
him says emly
him that ive knowd so intimate so many years and like so much
oh uncle
i never can have him
hes such a good fellow i gives her a kiss and i says no more to her than my dear youre right to speak out youre to choose for yourself youre as free as a little bird then i aways to him and i says i wish it could have been so but it cant
but you can both be as you was and wot i say to you is be as you was with her like a man he says to me ashaking of my hand i will he says
and he washonourable and manfulfor two year going on and we was just the same at home here as afore mr peggottys face which had varied in its expression with the various stages of his narrative now resumed all its former triumphant delight as he laid a hand upon my knee and a hand upon steerforths previously wetting them both for the greater emphasis of the action and divided the following speech between us all of a sudden one eveningas it might be tonightcomes little emly from her work and him with her
there aint so much in that youll say
no because he takes care on her like a brother arter dark and indeed afore dark and at all times
but this tarpaulin chap he takes hold of her hand and he cries out to me joyful look here
this is to be my little wife and she says half bold and half shy and half a laughing and half a crying yes uncle
if you pleaseif i please cried mr peggotty rolling his head in an ecstasy at the idea lord as if i should do anythink elseif you please i am steadier now and i have thought better of it and ill be as good a little wife as i can to him for hes a dear good fellow then missis gummidge she claps her hands like a play and you come in
theer
the murders out said mr peggottyyou come in
it took place this here present hour and heres the man thatll marry her the minute shes out of her time ham staggered as well he might under the blow mr peggotty dealt him in his unbounded joy as a mark of confidence and friendship but feeling called upon to say something to us he said with much faltering and great difficulty she warnt no higher than you was masr davywhen you first comewhen i thought what shed grow up to be
i see her grown upgentlmenlike a flower
id lay down my life for hermasr davyoh
most content and cheerful
shes more to megentlmenthanshes all to me that ever i can want and more than ever ithan ever i could say
ii love her true
there aint a gentlman in all the landnor yet sailing upon all the seathat can love his lady more than i love her though theres many a common manwould say betterwhat he meant i thought it affecting to see such a sturdy fellow as ham was now trembling in the strength of what he felt for the pretty little creature who had won his heart
i thought the simple confidence reposed in us by mr peggotty and by himself was in itself affecting
i was affected by the story altogether
how far my emotions were influenced by the recollections of my childhood i dont know
whether i had come there with any lingering fancy that i was still to love little emly i dont know
i know that i was filled with pleasure by all this but at first with an indescribably sensitive pleasure that a very little would have changed to pain
therefore if it had depended upon me to touch the prevailing chord among them with any skill i should have made a poor hand of it
but it depended upon steerforth and he did it with such address that in a few minutes we were all as easy and as happy as it was possible to be
mr
peggotty he said you are a thoroughly good fellow and deserve to be as happy as you are tonight
my hand upon it
ham i give you joy my boy
my hand upon that too
daisy stir the fire and make it a brisk one
and mr peggotty unless you can induce your gentle niece to come back for whom i vacate this seat in the corner i shall go
any gap at your fireside on such a nightsuch a gap least of alli wouldnt make for the wealth of the indies so mr peggotty went into my old room to fetch little emly
at first little emly didnt like to come and then ham went
presently they brought her to the fireside very much confused and very shybut she soon became more assured when she found how gently and respectfully steerforth spoke to her how skilfully he avoided anything that would embarrass her how he talked to mr peggotty of boats and ships and tides and fish how he referred to me about the time when he had seen mr peggotty at salem house how delighted he was with the boat and all belonging to it how lightly and easily he carried on until he brought us by degrees into a charmed circle and we were all talking away without any reserve
emly indeed said little all the evening but she looked and listened and her face got animated and she was charming
steerforth told a story of a dismal shipwreck which arose out of his talk with mr peggotty as if he saw it all before himand little emlys eyes were fastened on him all the time as if she saw it too
he told us a merry adventure of his own as a relief to that with as much gaiety as if the narrative were as fresh to him as it was to usand little emly laughed until the boat rang with the musical sounds and we all laughed steerforth too in irresistible sympathy with what was so pleasant and lighthearted
he got mr peggotty to sing or rather to roar when the stormy winds do blow do blow do blow and he sang a sailors song himself so pathetically and beautifully that i could have almost fancied that the real wind creeping sorrowfully round the house and murmuring low through our unbroken silence was there to listen
as to mrs gummidge he roused that victim of despondency with a success never attained by anyone else so mr peggotty informed me since the decease of the old one
he left her so little leisure for being miserable that she said next day she thought she must have been bewitched
but he set up no monopoly of the general attention or the conversation
when little emly grew more courageous and talked but still bashfully across the fire to me of our old wanderings upon the beach to pick up shells and pebbles and when i asked her if she recollected how i used to be devoted to her and when we both laughed and reddened casting these looks back on the pleasant old times so unreal to look at now he was silent and attentive and observed us thoughtfully
she sat at this time and all the evening on the old locker in her old little corner by the fireham beside her where i used to sit
i could not satisfy myself whether it was in her own little tormenting way or in a maidenly reserve before us that she kept quite close to the wall and away from him but i observed that she did so all the evening
as i remember it was almost midnight when we took our leave
we had had some biscuit and dried fish for supper and steerforth had produced from his pocket a full flask of hollands which we men i may say we men now without a blush had emptied
we parted merrily and as they all stood crowded round the door to light us as far as they could upon our road i saw the sweet blue eyes of little emly peeping after us from behind ham and heard her soft voice calling to us to be careful how we went
a most engaging little beauty said steerforth taking my arm
well
its a quaint place and they are quaint company and its quite a new sensation to mix with them how fortunate we are too i returned to have arrived to witness their happiness in that intended marriage
i never saw people so happy
how delightful to see it and to be made the sharers in their honest joy as we have been thats rather a chuckleheaded fellow for the girl isnt he said steerforth
he had been so hearty with him and with them all that i felt a shock in this unexpected and cold reply
but turning quickly upon him and seeing a laugh in his eyes i answered much relieved ah steerforth
its well for you to joke about the poor
you may skirmish with miss dartle or try to hide your sympathies in jest from me but i know better
when i see how perfectly you understand them how exquisitely you can enter into happiness like this plain fishermans or humour a love like my old nurses i know that there is not a joy or sorrow not an emotion of such people that can be indifferent to you
and i admire and love you for it steerforth twenty times the more he stopped and looking in my face said daisy i believe you are in earnest and are good
i wish we all were next moment he was gaily singing mr peggottys song as we walked at a round pace back to yarmouth
steerforth and i stayed for more than a fortnight in that part of the country
we were very much together i need not say but occasionally we were asunder for some hours at a time
he was a good sailor and i was but an indifferent one and when he went out boating with mr peggotty which was a favourite amusement of his i generally remained ashore
my occupation of peggottys spareroom put a constraint upon me from which he was free for knowing how assiduously she attended on mr barkis all day i did not like to remain out late at night whereas steerforth lying at the inn had nothing to consult but his own humour
thus it came about that i heard of his making little treats for the fishermen at mr peggottys house of call the willing mind after i was in bed and of his being afloat wrapped in fishermens clothes whole moonlight nights and coming back when the morning tide was at flood
by this time however i knew that his restless nature and bold spirits delighted to find a vent in rough toil and hard weather as in any other means of excitement that presented itself freshly to him so none of his proceedings surprised me
another cause of our being sometimes apart was that i had naturally an interest in going over to blunderstone and revisiting the old familiar scenes of my childhood while steerforth after being there once had naturally no great interest in going there again
hence on three or four days that i can at once recall we went our several ways after an early breakfast and met again at a late dinner
i had no idea how he employed his time in the interval beyond a general knowledge that he was very popular in the place and had twenty means of actively diverting himself where another man might not have found one
for my own part my occupation in my solitary pilgrimages was to recall every yard of the old road as i went along it and to haunt the old spots of which i never tired
i haunted them as my memory had often done and lingered among them as my younger thoughts had lingered when i was far away
the grave beneath the tree where both my parents layon which i had looked out when it was my fathers only with such curious feelings of compassion and by which i had stood so desolate when it was opened to receive my pretty mother and her babythe grave which peggottys own faithful care had ever since kept neat and made a garden of i walked near by the hour
it lay a little off the churchyard path in a quiet corner not so far removed but i could read the names upon the stone as i walked to and fro startled by the sound of the churchbell when it struck the hour for it was like a departed voice to me
my reflections at these times were always associated with the figure i was to make in life and the distinguished things i was to do
my echoing footsteps went to no other tune but were as constant to that as if i had come home to build my castles in the air at a living mothers side
there were great changes in my old home
the ragged nests so long deserted by the rooks were gone and the trees were lopped and topped out of their remembered shapes
the garden had run wild and half the windows of the house were shut up
it was occupied but only by a poor lunatic gentleman and the people who took care of him
he was always sitting at my little window looking out into the churchyard and i wondered whether his rambling thoughts ever went upon any of the fancies that used to occupy mine on the rosy mornings when i peeped out of that same little window in my nightclothes and saw the sheep quietly feeding in the light of the rising sun
our old neighbours mr and mrs grayper were gone to south america and the rain had made its way through the roof of their empty house and stained the outer walls
mr chillip was married again to a tall rawboned highnosed wife and they had a weazen little baby with a heavy head that it couldnt hold up and two weak staring eyes with which it seemed to be always wondering why it had ever been born
it was with a singular jumble of sadness and pleasure that i used to linger about my native place until the reddening winter sun admonished me that it was time to start on my returning walk
but when the place was left behind and especially when steerforth and i were happily seated over our dinner by a blazing fire it was delicious to think of having been there
so it was though in a softened degree when i went to my neat room at night and turning over the leaves of the crocodilebook which was always there upon a little table remembered with a grateful heart how blest i was in having such a friend as steerforth such a friend as peggotty and such a substitute for what i had lost as my excellent and generous aunt
my nearest way to yarmouth in coming back from these long walks was by a ferry
it landed me on the flat between the town and the sea which i could make straight across and so save myself a considerable circuit by the high road
mr peggottys house being on that wasteplace and not a hundred yards out of my track i always looked in as i went by
steerforth was pretty sure to be there expecting me and we went on together through the frosty air and gathering fog towards the twinkling lights of the town
one dark evening when i was later than usualfor i had that day been making my parting visit to blunderstone as we were now about to return homei found him alone in mr peggottys house sitting thoughtfully before the fire
he was so intent upon his own reflections that he was quite unconscious of my approach
this indeed he might easily have been if he had been less absorbed for footsteps fell noiselessly on the sandy ground outside but even my entrance failed to rouse him
i was standing close to him looking at him and still with a heavy brow he was lost in his meditations
he gave such a start when i put my hand upon his shoulder that he made me start too
you come upon me he said almost angrily like a reproachful ghost i was obliged to announce myself somehow i replied
have i called you down from the stars no he answered
no up from anywhere then said i taking my seat near him
i was looking at the pictures in the fire he returned
but you are spoiling them for me said i as he stirred it quickly with a piece of burning wood striking out of it a train of redhot sparks that went careering up the little chimney and roaring out into the air
you would not have seen them he returned
i detest this mongrel time neither day nor night
how late you are
where have you been i have been taking leave of my usual walk said i
and i have been sitting here said steerforth glancing round the room thinking that all the people we found so glad on the night of our coming down mightto judge from the present wasted air of the placebe dispersed or dead or come to i dont know what harm
david i wish to god i had had a judicious father these last twenty years my dear steerforth what is the matter i wish with all my soul i had been better guided he exclaimed
i wish with all my soul i could guide myself better there was a passionate dejection in his manner that quite amazed me
he was more unlike himself than i could have supposed possible
it would be better to be this poor peggotty or his lout of a nephew he said getting up and leaning moodily against the chimneypiece with his face towards the fire than to be myself twenty times richer and twenty times wiser and be the torment to myself that i have been in this devils bark of a boat within the last halfhour i was so confounded by the alteration in him that at first i could only observe him in silence as he stood leaning his head upon his hand and looking gloomily down at the fire
at length i begged him with all the earnestness i felt to tell me what had occurred to cross him so unusually and to let me sympathize with him if i could not hope to advise him
before i had well concluded he began to laughfretfully at first but soon with returning gaiety
tut its nothing daisy
nothing he replied
i told you at the inn in london i am heavy company for myself sometimes
i have been a nightmare to myself just nowmust have had one i think
at odd dull times nursery tales come up into the memory unrecognized for what they are
i believe i have been confounding myself with the bad boy who didnt care and became food for lionsa grander kind of going to the dogs i suppose
what old women call the horrors have been creeping over me from head to foot
i have been afraid of myself you are afraid of nothing else i think said i
perhaps not and yet may have enough to be afraid of too he answered
well
so it goes by
i am not about to be hipped again david but i tell you my good fellow once more that it would have been well for me and for more than me if i had had a steadfast and judicious father his face was always full of expression but i never saw it express such a dark kind of earnestness as when he said these words with his glance bent on the fire
so much for that he said making as if he tossed something light into the air with his hand
why being gone i am a man again like macbeth
and now for dinner
if i have not macbethlike broken up the feast with most admired disorder daisy but where are they all i wonder said i
god knows said steerforth
after strolling to the ferry looking for you i strolled in here and found the place deserted
that set me thinking and you found me thinking the advent of mrs gummidge with a basket explained how the house had happened to be empty
she had hurried out to buy something that was needed against mr peggottys return with the tide and had left the door open in the meanwhile lest ham and little emly with whom it was an early night should come home while she was gone
steerforth after very much improving mrs gummidges spirits by a cheerful salutation and a jocose embrace took my arm and hurried me away
he had improved his own spirits no less than mrs gummidges for they were again at their usual flow and he was full of vivacious conversation as we went along
and so he said gaily we abandon this buccaneer life tomorrow do we so we agreed i returned
and our places by the coach are taken you know ay
theres no help for it i suppose said steerforth
i have almost forgotten that there is anything to do in the world but to go out tossing on the sea here
i wish there was not as long as the novelty should last said i laughing
like enough he returned though theres a sarcastic meaning in that observation for an amiable piece of innocence like my young friend
well
i dare say i am a capricious fellow david
i know i am but while the iron is hot i can strike it vigorously too
i could pass a reasonably good examination already as a pilot in these waters i think mr
peggotty says you are a wonder i returned
a nautical phenomenon eh laughed steerforth
indeed he does and you know how truly i know how ardent you are in any pursuit you follow and how easily you can master it
and that amazes me most in you steerforththat you should be contented with such fitful uses of your powers contented he answered merrily
i am never contented except with your freshness my gentle daisy
as to fitfulness i have never learnt the art of binding myself to any of the wheels on which the ixions of these days are turning round and round
i missed it somehow in a bad apprenticeship and now dont care about ityou know i have bought a boat down here what an extraordinary fellow you are steerforth i exclaimed stoppingfor this was the first i had heard of it
when you may never care to come near the place again i dont know that he returned
i have taken a fancy to the place
at all events walking me briskly on i have bought a boat that was for salea clipper mr peggotty says and so she isand mr peggotty will be master of her in my absence now i understand you steerforth said i exultingly
you pretend to have bought it for yourself but you have really done so to confer a benefit on him
i might have known as much at first knowing you
my dear kind steerforth how can i tell you what i think of your generosity tush he answered turning red
the less said the better didnt i know cried i didnt i say that there was not a joy or sorrow or any emotion of such honest hearts that was indifferent to you aye aye he answered you told me all that
there let it rest
we have said enough afraid of offending him by pursuing the subject when he made so light of it i only pursued it in my thoughts as we went on at even a quicker pace than before
she must be newly rigged said steerforth and i shall leave littimer behind to see it done that i may know she is quite complete
did i tell you littimer had come down no oh yes
came down this morning with a letter from my mother as our looks met i observed that he was pale even to his lips though he looked very steadily at me
i feared that some difference between him and his mother might have led to his being in the frame of mind in which i had found him at the solitary fireside
i hinted so
oh no he said shaking his head and giving a slight laugh
nothing of the sort
yes
he is come down that man of mine the same as ever said i
the same as ever said steerforth
distant and quiet as the north pole
he shall see to the boat being fresh named
shes the stormy petrel now
what does mr peggotty care for stormy petrels
ill have her christened again by what name i asked
the little emly as he had continued to look steadily at me i took it as a reminder that he objected to being extolled for his consideration
i could not help showing in my face how much it pleased me but i said little and he resumed his usual smile and seemed relieved
but see here he said looking before us where the original little emly comes
and that fellow with her eh
upon my soul hes a true knight
he never leaves her ham was a boatbuilder in these days having improved a natural ingenuity in that handicraft until he had become a skilled workman
he was in his workingdress and looked rugged enough but manly withal and a very fit protector for the blooming little creature at his side
indeed there was a frankness in his face an honesty and an undisguised show of his pride in her and his love for her which were to me the best of good looks
i thought as they came towards us that they were well matched even in that particular
she withdrew her hand timidly from his arm as we stopped to speak to them and blushed as she gave it to steerforth and to me
when they passed on after we had exchanged a few words she did not like to replace that hand but still appearing timid and constrained walked by herself
i thought all this very pretty and engaging and steerforth seemed to think so too as we looked after them fading away in the light of a young moon
suddenly there passed usevidently following thema young woman whose approach we had not observed but whose face i saw as she went by and thought i had a faint remembrance of
she was lightly dressed looked bold and haggard and flaunting and poor but seemed for the time to have given all that to the wind which was blowing and to have nothing in her mind but going after them
as the dark distant level absorbing their figures into itself left but itself visible between us and the sea and clouds her figure disappeared in like manner still no nearer to them than before
that is a black shadow to be following the girl said steerforth standing still what does it mean he spoke in a low voice that sounded almost strange to me
she must have it in her mind to beg of them i think said i
a beggar would be no novelty said steerforth but it is a strange thing that the beggar should take that shape tonight why i asked
for no better reason truly than because i was thinking he said after a pause of something like it when it came by
where the devil did it come from i wonder from the shadow of this wall i think said i as we emerged upon a road on which a wall abutted
its gone he returned looking over his shoulder
and all ill go with it
now for our dinner but he looked again over his shoulder towards the sealine glimmering afar off and yet again
and he wondered about it in some broken expressions several times in the short remainder of our walk and only seemed to forget it when the light of fire and candle shone upon us seated warm and merry at table
littimer was there and had his usual effect upon me
when i said to him that i hoped mrs steerforth and miss dartle were well he answered respectfully and of course respectably that they were tolerably well he thanked me and had sent their compliments
this was all and yet he seemed to me to say as plainly as a man could say you are very young sir you are exceedingly young we had almost finished dinner when taking a step or two towards the table from the corner where he kept watch upon us or rather upon me as i felt he said to his master i beg your pardon sir
miss mowcher is down here who cried steerforth much astonished
miss mowcher sir why what on earth does she do here said steerforth
it appears to be her native part of the country sir
she informs me that she makes one of her professional visits here every year sir
i met her in the street this afternoon and she wished to know if she might have the honour of waiting on you after dinner sir do you know the giantess in question daisy inquired steerforth
i was obliged to confessi felt ashamed even of being at this disadvantage before littimerthat miss mowcher and i were wholly unacquainted
then you shall know her said steerforth for she is one of the seven wonders of the world
when miss mowcher comes show her in i felt some curiosity and excitement about this lady especially as steerforth burst into a fit of laughing when i referred to her and positively refused to answer any question of which i made her the subject
i remained therefore in a state of considerable expectation until the cloth had been removed some half an hour and we were sitting over our decanter of wine before the fire when the door opened and littimer with his habitual serenity quite undisturbed announced miss mowcher i looked at the doorway and saw nothing
i was still looking at the doorway thinking that miss mowcher was a long while making her appearance when to my infinite astonishment there came waddling round a sofa which stood between me and it a pursy dwarf of about forty or fortyfive with a very large head and face a pair of roguish grey eyes and such extremely little arms that to enable herself to lay a finger archly against her snub nose as she ogled steerforth she was obliged to meet the finger halfway and lay her nose against it
her chin which was what is called a double chin was so fat that it entirely swallowed up the strings of her bonnet bow and all
throat she had none waist she had none legs she had none worth mentioning for though she was more than fullsized down to where her waist would have been if she had had any and though she terminated as human beings generally do in a pair of feet she was so short that she stood at a commonsized chair as at a table resting a bag she carried on the seat
this ladydressed in an offhand easy style bringing her nose and her forefinger together with the difficulty i have described standing with her head necessarily on one side and with one of her sharp eyes shut up making an uncommonly knowing faceafter ogling steerforth for a few moments broke into a torrent of words
what
my flower she pleasantly began shaking her large head at him
youre there are you
oh you naughty boy fie for shame what do you do so far away from home
up to mischief ill be bound
oh youre a downy fellow steerforth so you are and im another aint i
ha ha ha
youd have betted a hundred pound to five now that you wouldnt have seen me here wouldnt you
bless you man alive im everywhere
im here and there and where not like the conjurers halfcrown in the ladys handkercher
talking of handkerchersand talking of ladieswhat a comfort you are to your blessed mother aint you my dear boy over one of my shoulders and i dont say which miss mowcher untied her bonnet at this passage of her discourse threw back the strings and sat down panting on a footstool in front of the firemaking a kind of arbour of the dining table which spread its mahogany shelter above her head
oh my stars and whatstheirnames she went on clapping a hand on each of her little knees and glancing shrewdly at me im of too full a habit thats the fact steerforth
after a flight of stairs it gives me as much trouble to draw every breath i want as if it was a bucket of water
if you saw me looking out of an upper window youd think i was a fine woman wouldnt you i should think that wherever i saw you replied steerforth
go along you dog do cried the little creature making a whisk at him with the handkerchief with which she was wiping her face and dont be impudent
but i give you my word and honour i was at lady mitherss last weektheres a woman
how she wearsand mithers himself came into the room where i was waiting for hertheres a man
how he wears
and his wig too for hes had it these ten yearsand he went on at that rate in the complimentary line that i began to think i should be obliged to ring the bell
ha
ha
ha
hes a pleasant wretch but he wants principle what were you doing for lady mithers asked steerforth
thats tellings my blessed infant she retorted tapping her nose again screwing up her face and twinkling her eyes like an imp of supernatural intelligence
never you mind
youd like to know whether i stop her hair from falling off or dye it or touch up her complexion or improve her eyebrows wouldnt you
and so you shall my darlingwhen i tell you
do you know what my great grandfathers name was no said steerforth
it was walker my sweet pet replied miss mowcher and he came of a long line of walkers that i inherit all the hookey estates from i never beheld anything approaching to miss mowchers wink except miss mowchers selfpossession
she had a wonderful way too when listening to what was said to her or when waiting for an answer to what she had said herself of pausing with her head cunningly on one side and one eye turned up like a magpies
altogether i was lost in amazement and sat staring at her quite oblivious i am afraid of the laws of politeness
she had by this time drawn the chair to her side and was busily engaged in producing from the bag plunging in her short arm to the shoulder at every dive a number of small bottles sponges combs brushes bits of flannel little pairs of curlingirons and other instruments which she tumbled in a heap upon the chair
from this employment she suddenly desisted and said to steerforth much to my confusion whos your friend mr
copperfield said steerforth he wants to know you well then he shall
i thought he looked as if he did returned miss mowcher waddling up to me bag in hand and laughing on me as she came
face like a peach standing on tiptoe to pinch my cheek as i sat
quite tempting
im very fond of peaches
happy to make your acquaintance mr copperfield im sure i said that i congratulated myself on having the honour to make hers and that the happiness was mutual
oh my goodness how polite we are exclaimed miss mowcher making a preposterous attempt to cover her large face with her morsel of a hand
what a world of gammon and spinnage it is though aint it this was addressed confidentially to both of us as the morsel of a hand came away from the face and buried itself arm and all in the bag again
what do you mean miss mowcher said steerforth
ha
ha
ha
what a refreshing set of humbugs we are to be sure aint we my sweet child replied that morsel of a woman feeling in the bag with her head on one side and her eye in the air
look here taking something out
scraps of the russian princes nails
prince alphabet turned topsyturvy i call him for his names got all the letters in it higgledypiggledy the russian prince is a client of yours is he said steerforth
i believe you my pet replied miss mowcher
i keep his nails in order for him
twice a week
fingers and toes he pays well i hope said steerforth
pays as he speaks my dear childthrough the nose replied miss mowcher
none of your close shavers the prince aint
youd say so if you saw his moustachios
red by nature black by art by your art of course said steerforth
miss mowcher winked assent
forced to send for me
couldnt help it
the climate affected his dye it did very well in russia but it was no go here
you never saw such a rusty prince in all your born days as he was
like old iron is that why you called him a humbug just now inquired steerforth
oh youre a broth of a boy aint you returned miss mowcher shaking her head violently
i said what a set of humbugs we were in general and i showed you the scraps of the princes nails to prove it
the princes nails do more for me in private families of the genteel sort than all my talents put together
i always carry em about
theyre the best introduction
if miss mowcher cuts the princes nails she must be all right
i give em away to the young ladies
they put em in albums i believe
ha
ha
ha
upon my life the whole social system as the men call it when they make speeches in parliament is a system of princes nails said this least of women trying to fold her short arms and nodding her large head
steerforth laughed heartily and i laughed too
miss mowcher continuing all the time to shake her head which was very much on one side and to look into the air with one eye and to wink with the other
well well she said smiting her small knees and rising this is not business
come steerforth lets explore the polar regions and have it over she then selected two or three of the little instruments and a little bottle and asked to my surprise if the table would bear
on steerforths replying in the affirmative she pushed a chair against it and begging the assistance of my hand mounted up pretty nimbly to the top as if it were a stage
if either of you saw my ankles she said when she was safely elevated say so and ill go home and destroy myself i did not said steerforth
i did not said i
well then cried miss mowcher ill consent to live
now ducky ducky ducky come to mrs
bond and be killed this was an invocation to steerforth to place himself under her hands who accordingly sat himself down with his back to the table and his laughing face towards me and submitted his head to her inspection evidently for no other purpose than our entertainment
to see miss mowcher standing over him looking at his rich profusion of brown hair through a large round magnifying glass which she took out of her pocket was a most amazing spectacle
youre a pretty fellow said miss mowcher after a brief inspection
youd be as bald as a friar on the top of your head in twelve months but for me
just half a minute my young friend and well give you a polishing that shall keep your curls on for the next ten years with this she tilted some of the contents of the little bottle on to one of the little bits of flannel and again imparting some of the virtues of that preparation to one of the little brushes began rubbing and scraping away with both on the crown of steerforths head in the busiest manner i ever witnessed talking all the time
theres charley pyegrave the dukes son she said
you know charley peeping round into his face
a little said steerforth
what a man he is
theres a whisker
as to charleys legs if they were only a pair which they aint theyd defy competition
would you believe he tried to do without mein the lifeguards too mad said steerforth
it looks like it
however mad or sane he tried returned miss mowcher
what does he do but lo and behold you he goes into a perfumers shop and wants to buy a bottle of the madagascar liquid charley does said steerforth
charley does
but they havent got any of the madagascar liquid what is it
something to drink asked steerforth
to drink returned miss mowcher stopping to slap his cheek
to doctor his own moustachios with you know
there was a woman in the shopelderly femalequite a griffinwho had never even heard of it by name
begging pardon sir said the griffin to charley its notnotnot rouge is it rouge said charley to the griffin
what the unmentionable to ears polite do you think i want with rouge no offence sir said the griffin we have it asked for by so many names i thought it might be now that my child continued miss mowcher rubbing all the time as busily as ever is another instance of the refreshing humbug i was speaking of
i do something in that way myselfperhaps a good dealperhaps a littlesharps the word my dear boynever mind in what way do you mean
in the rouge way said steerforth
put this and that together my tender pupil returned the wary mowcher touching her nose work it by the rule of secrets in all trades and the product will give you the desired result
i say i do a little in that way myself
one dowager she calls it lipsalve
another she calls it gloves
another she calls it tuckeredging
another she calls it a fan
i call it whatever they call it
i supply it for em but we keep up the trick so to one another and make believe with such a face that theyd as soon think of laying it on before a whole drawingroom as before me
and when i wait upon em theyll say to me sometimeswith it onthick and no mistakehow am i looking mowcher
am i pale ha
ha
ha
ha
isnt that refreshing my young friend i never did in my days behold anything like mowcher as she stood upon the dining table intensely enjoying this refreshment rubbing busily at steerforths head and winking at me over it
ah she said
such things are not much in demand hereabouts
that sets me off again
i havent seen a pretty woman since ive been here jemmy no said steerforth
not the ghost of one replied miss mowcher
we could show her the substance of one i think said steerforth addressing his eyes to mine
eh daisy yes indeed said i
aha cried the little creature glancing sharply at my face and then peeping round at steerforths
umph the first exclamation sounded like a question put to both of us and the second like a question put to steerforth only
she seemed to have found no answer to either but continued to rub with her head on one side and her eye turned up as if she were looking for an answer in the air and were confident of its appearing presently
a sister of yours mr copperfield she cried after a pause and still keeping the same lookout
aye aye no said steerforth before i could reply
nothing of the sort
on the contrary mr copperfield usedor i am much mistakento have a great admiration for her why hasnt he now returned miss mowcher
is he fickle
oh for shame
did he sip every flower and change every hour until polly his passion requitedis her name polly the elfin suddenness with which she pounced upon me with this question and a searching look quite disconcerted me for a moment
no miss mowcher i replied
her name is emily aha she cried exactly as before
umph
what a rattle i am
mr copperfield aint i volatile her tone and look implied something that was not agreeable to me in connexion with the subject
so i said in a graver manner than any of us had yet assumed she is as virtuous as she is pretty
she is engaged to be married to a most worthy and deserving man in her own station of life
i esteem her for her good sense as much as i admire her for her good looks well said cried steerforth
hear hear hear
now ill quench the curiosity of this little fatima my dear daisy by leaving her nothing to guess at
she is at present apprenticed miss mowcher or articled or whatever it may be to omer and joram haberdashers milliners and so forth in this town
do you observe
omer and joram
the promise of which my friend has spoken is made and entered into with her cousin christian name ham surname peggotty occupation boatbuilder also of this town
she lives with a relative christian name unknown surname peggotty occupation seafaring also of this town
she is the prettiest and most engaging little fairy in the world
i admire heras my friend doesexceedingly
if it were not that i might appear to disparage her intended which i know my friend would not like i would add that to me she seems to be throwing herself away that i am sure she might do better and that i swear she was born to be a lady miss mowcher listened to these words which were very slowly and distinctly spoken with her head on one side and her eye in the air as if she were still looking for that answer
when he ceased she became brisk again in an instant and rattled away with surprising volubility
oh
and thats all about it is it she exclaimed trimming his whiskers with a little restless pair of scissors that went glancing round his head in all directions
very well very well
quite a long story
ought to end and they lived happy ever afterwards oughtnt it
ah
whats that game at forfeits
i love my love with an e because shes enticing i hate her with an e because shes engaged
i took her to the sign of the exquisite and treated her with an elopement her names emily and she lives in the east
ha
ha
ha
mr copperfield aint i volatile merely looking at me with extravagant slyness and not waiting for any reply she continued without drawing breath there
if ever any scapegrace was trimmed and touched up to perfection you are steerforth
if i understand any noddle in the world i understand yours
do you hear me when i tell you that my darling
i understand yours peeping down into his face
now you may mizzle jemmy as we say at court and if mr copperfield will take the chair ill operate on him what do you say daisy inquired steerforth laughing and resigning his seat
will you be improved thank you miss mowcher not this evening dont say no returned the little woman looking at me with the aspect of a connoisseur a little bit more eyebrow thank you i returned some other time have it carried half a quarter of an inch towards the temple said miss mowcher
we can do it in a fortnight no i thank you
not at present go in for a tip she urged
no
lets get the scaffolding up then for a pair of whiskers
come i could not help blushing as i declined for i felt we were on my weak point now
but miss mowcher finding that i was not at present disposed for any decoration within the range of her art and that i was for the time being proof against the blandishments of the small bottle which she held up before one eye to enforce her persuasions said we would make a beginning on an early day and requested the aid of my hand to descend from her elevated station
thus assisted she skipped down with much agility and began to tie her double chin into her bonnet
the fee said steerforth is five bob replied miss mowcher and dirt cheap my chicken
aint i volatile mr copperfield i replied politely not at all but i thought she was rather so when she tossed up his two halfcrowns like a goblin pieman caught them dropped them in her pocket and gave it a loud slap
thats the till observed miss mowcher standing at the chair again and replacing in the bag a miscellaneous collection of little objects she had emptied out of it
have i got all my traps
it seems so
it wont do to be like long ned beadwood when they took him to church to marry him to somebody as he says and left the bride behind
ha
ha
ha
a wicked rascal ned but droll
now i know im going to break your hearts but i am forced to leave you
you must call up all your fortitude and try to bear it
goodbye mr copperfield
take care of yourself jockey of norfolk
how i have been rattling on
its all the fault of you two wretches
i forgive you
bob sworeas the englishman said for good night when he first learnt french and thought it so like english
bob swore my ducks with the bag slung over her arm and rattling as she waddled away she waddled to the door where she stopped to inquire if she should leave us a lock of her hair
aint i volatile she added as a commentary on this offer and with her finger on her nose departed
steerforth laughed to that degree that it was impossible for me to help laughing too though i am not sure i should have done so but for this inducement
when we had had our laugh quite out which was after some time he told me that miss mowcher had quite an extensive connexion and made herself useful to a variety of people in a variety of ways
some people trifled with her as a mere oddity he said but she was as shrewdly and sharply observant as anyone he knew and as longheaded as she was shortarmed
he told me that what she had said of being here and there and everywhere was true enough for she made little darts into the provinces and seemed to pick up customers everywhere and to know everybody
i asked him what her disposition was whether it was at all mischievous and if her sympathies were generally on the right side of things but not succeeding in attracting his attention to these questions after two or three attempts i forbore or forgot to repeat them
he told me instead with much rapidity a good deal about her skill and her profits and about her being a scientific cupper if i should ever have occasion for her service in that capacity
she was the principal theme of our conversation during the evening and when we parted for the night steerforth called after me over the banisters bob swore as i went downstairs
i was surprised when i came to mr barkiss house to find ham walking up and down in front of it and still more surprised to learn from him that little emly was inside
i naturally inquired why he was not there too instead of pacing the streets by himself
why you see masr davy he rejoined in a hesitating manner emly shes talking to some un in here i should have thought said i smiling that that was a reason for your being in here too ham well masr davy in a general way so t would be he returned but lookee here masr davy lowering his voice and speaking very gravely
its a young woman sira young woman that emly knowed once and doent ought to know no more when i heard these words a light began to fall upon the figure i had seen following them some hours ago
its a poor wurem masr davy said ham as is trod under foot by all the town
up street and down street
the mowld o the churchyard dont hold any that the folk shrink away from more did i see her tonight ham on the sand after we met you keeping us in sight said ham
its like you did masr davy
not that i knowd then she was theer sir but along of her creeping soon arterwards under emlys little winder when she see the light come and whispering emly emly for christs sake have a womans heart towards me
i was once like you those was solemn words masr davy fur to hear they were indeed ham
what did emly do says emly martha is it you
oh martha can it be youfor they had sat at work together many a day at mr omers i recollect her now cried i recalling one of the two girls i had seen when i first went there
i recollect her quite well martha endell said ham
two or three year older than emly but was at the school with her i never heard her name said i
i didnt mean to interrupt you for the matter o that masr davy replied ham alls told amost in them words emly emly for christs sake have a womans heart towards me
i was once like you she wanted to speak to emly
emly couldnt speak to her theer for her loving uncle was come home and he wouldntno masr davy said ham with great earnestness he couldnt kindnaturd tenderhearted as he is see them two together side by side for all the treasures thats wrecked in the sea i felt how true this was
i knew it on the instant quite as well as ham
so emly writes in pencil on a bit of paper he pursued and gives it to her out o winder to bring here
show that she says to my aunt mrs barkis and shell set you down by her fire for the love of me till uncle is gone out and i can come by and by she tells me what i tell you masr davy and asks me to bring her
what can i do
she doent ought to know any such but i cant deny her when the tears is on her face he put his hand into the breast of his shaggy jacket and took out with great care a pretty little purse
and if i could deny her when the tears was on her face masr davy said ham tenderly adjusting it on the rough palm of his hand how could i deny her when she give me this to carry for herknowing what she brought it for
such a toy as it is said ham thoughtfully looking on it
with such a little money in it emly my dear i shook him warmly by the hand when he had put it away againfor that was more satisfactory to me than saying anythingand we walked up and down for a minute or two in silence
the door opened then and peggotty appeared beckoning to ham to come in
i would have kept away but she came after me entreating me to come in too
even then i would have avoided the room where they all were but for its being the neattiled kitchen i have mentioned more than once
the door opening immediately into it i found myself among them before i considered whither i was going
the girlthe same i had seen upon the sandswas near the fire
she was sitting on the ground with her head and one arm lying on a chair
i fancied from the disposition of her figure that emly had but newly risen from the chair and that the forlorn head might perhaps have been lying on her lap
i saw but little of the girls face over which her hair fell loose and scattered as if she had been disordering it with her own hands but i saw that she was young and of a fair complexion
peggotty had been crying
so had little emly
not a word was spoken when we first went in and the dutch clock by the dresser seemed in the silence to tick twice as loud as usual
emly spoke first
martha wants she said to ham to go to london why to london returned ham
he stood between them looking on the prostrate girl with a mixture of compassion for her and of jealousy of her holding any companionship with her whom he loved so well which i have always remembered distinctly
they both spoke as if she were ill in a soft suppressed tone that was plainly heard although it hardly rose above a whisper
better there than here said a third voice aloudmarthas though she did not move
no one knows me there
everybody knows me here what will she do there inquired ham
she lifted up her head and looked darkly round at him for a moment then laid it down again and curved her right arm about her neck as a woman in a fever or in an agony of pain from a shot might twist herself
she will try to do well said little emly
you dont know what she has said to us
does hedo theyaunt peggotty shook her head compassionately
ill try said martha if youll help me away
i never can do worse than i have done here
i may do better
oh with a dreadful shiver take me out of these streets where the whole town knows me from a child as emly held out her hand to ham i saw him put in it a little canvas bag
she took it as if she thought it were her purse and made a step or two forward but finding her mistake came back to where he had retired near me and showed it to him
its all yourn emly i could hear him say
i havent nowt in all the wureld that aint yourn my dear
it aint of no delight to me except for you the tears rose freshly in her eyes but she turned away and went to martha
what she gave her i dont know
i saw her stooping over her and putting money in her bosom
she whispered something as she asked was that enough
more than enough the other said and took her hand and kissed it
then martha arose and gathering her shawl about her covering her face with it and weeping aloud went slowly to the door
she stopped a moment before going out as if she would have uttered something or turned back but no word passed her lips
making the same low dreary wretched moaning in her shawl she went away
as the door closed little emly looked at us three in a hurried manner and then hid her face in her hands and fell to sobbing
doent emly said ham tapping her gently on the shoulder
doent my dear
you doent ought to cry so pretty oh ham she exclaimed still weeping pitifully i am not so good a girl as i ought to be
i know i have not the thankful heart sometimes i ought to have yes yes you have im sure said ham
no
no
no cried little emly sobbing and shaking her head
i am not as good a girl as i ought to be
not near
not near and still she cried as if her heart would break
i try your love too much
i know i do she sobbed
im often cross to you and changeable with you when i ought to be far different
you are never so to me
why am i ever so to you when i should think of nothing but how to be grateful and to make you happy you always make me so said ham my dear
i am happy in the sight of you
i am happy all day long in the thoughts of you ah
thats not enough she cried
that is because you are good not because i am
oh my dear it might have been a better fortune for you if you had been fond of someone elseof someone steadier and much worthier than me who was all bound up in you and never vain and changeable like me poor little tenderheart said ham in a low voice
martha has overset her altogether please aunt sobbed emly come here and let me lay my head upon you
oh i am very miserable tonight aunt
oh i am not as good a girl as i ought to be
i am not i know peggotty had hastened to the chair before the fire
emly with her arms around her neck kneeled by her looking up most earnestly into her face
oh pray aunt try to help me
ham dear try to help me
mr david for the sake of old times do please try to help me
i want to be a better girl than i am
i want to feel a hundred times more thankful than i do
i want to feel more what a blessed thing it is to be the wife of a good man and to lead a peaceful life
oh me oh me
oh my heart my heart she dropped her face on my old nurses breast and ceasing this supplication which in its agony and grief was half a womans half a childs as all her manner was being in that more natural and better suited to her beauty as i thought than any other manner could have been wept silently while my old nurse hushed her like an infant
she got calmer by degrees and then we soothed her now talking encouragingly and now jesting a little with her until she began to raise her head and speak to us
so we got on until she was able to smile and then to laugh and then to sit up half ashamed while peggotty recalled her stray ringlets dried her eyes and made her neat again lest her uncle should wonder when she got home why his darling had been crying
i saw her do that night what i had never seen her do before
i saw her innocently kiss her chosen husband on the cheek and creep close to his bluff form as if it were her best support
when they went away together in the waning moonlight and i looked after them comparing their departure in my mind with marthas i saw that she held his arm with both her hands and still kept close to him
when i awoke in the morning i thought very much of little emly and her emotion last night after martha had left
i felt as if i had come into the knowledge of those domestic weaknesses and tendernesses in a sacred confidence and that to disclose them even to steerforth would be wrong
i had no gentler feeling towards anyone than towards the pretty creature who had been my playmate and whom i have always been persuaded and shall always be persuaded to my dying day i then devotedly loved
the repetition to any earseven to steerforthsof what she had been unable to repress when her heart lay open to me by an accident i felt would be a rough deed unworthy of myself unworthy of the light of our pure childhood which i always saw encircling her head
i made a resolution therefore to keep it in my own breast and there it gave her image a new grace
while we were at breakfast a letter was delivered to me from my aunt
as it contained matter on which i thought steerforth could advise me as well as anyone and on which i knew i should be delighted to consult him i resolved to make it a subject of discussion on our journey home
for the present we had enough to do in taking leave of all our friends
mr barkis was far from being the last among them in his regret at our departure and i believe would even have opened the box again and sacrificed another guinea if it would have kept us eightandforty hours in yarmouth
peggotty and all her family were full of grief at our going
the whole house of omer and joram turned out to bid us goodbye and there were so many seafaring volunteers in attendance on steerforth when our portmanteaux went to the coach that if we had had the baggage of a regiment with us we should hardly have wanted porters to carry it
in a word we departed to the regret and admiration of all concerned and left a great many people very sorry behind us
do you stay long here littimer said i as he stood waiting to see the coach start
no sir he replied probably not very long sir he can hardly say just now observed steerforth carelessly
he knows what he has to do and hell do it that i am sure he will said i littimer touched his hat in acknowledgement of my good opinion and i felt about eight years old
he touched it once more wishing us a good journey and we left him standing on the pavement as respectable a mystery as any pyramid in egypt
for some little time we held no conversation steerforth being unusually silent and i being sufficiently engaged in wondering within myself when i should see the old places again and what new changes might happen to me or them in the meanwhile
at length steerforth becoming gay and talkative in a moment as he could become anything he liked at any moment pulled me by the arm find a voice david
what about that letter you were speaking of at breakfast oh said i taking it out of my pocket
its from my aunt and what does she say requiring consideration why she reminds me steerforth said i that i came out on this expedition to look about me and to think a little which of course you have done indeed i cant say i have particularly
to tell you the truth i am afraid i have forgotten it well
look about you now and make up for your negligence said steerforth
look to the right and youll see a flat country with a good deal of marsh in it look to the left and youll see the same
look to the front and youll find no difference look to the rear and there it is still i laughed and replied that i saw no suitable profession in the whole prospect which was perhaps to be attributed to its flatness
what says our aunt on the subject inquired steerforth glancing at the letter in my hand
does she suggest anything why yes said i
she asks me here if i think i should like to be a proctor
what do you think of it well i dont know replied steerforth coolly
you may as well do that as anything else i suppose i could not help laughing again at his balancing all callings and professions so equally and i told him so
what is a proctor steerforth said i
why he is a sort of monkish attorney replied steerforth
he is to some faded courts held in doctors commonsa lazy old nook near st pauls churchyardwhat solicitors are to the courts of law and equity
he is a functionary whose existence in the natural course of things would have terminated about two hundred years ago
i can tell you best what he is by telling you what doctors commons is
its a little outoftheway place where they administer what is called ecclesiastical law and play all kinds of tricks with obsolete old monsters of acts of parliament which threefourths of the world know nothing about and the other fourth supposes to have been dug up in a fossil state in the days of the edwards
its a place that has an ancient monopoly in suits about peoples wills and peoples marriages and disputes among ships and boats nonsense steerforth i exclaimed
you dont mean to say that there is any affinity between nautical matters and ecclesiastical matters i dont indeed my dear boy he returned but i mean to say that they are managed and decided by the same set of people down in that same doctors commons
you shall go there one day and find them blundering through half the nautical terms in youngs dictionary apropos of the nancy having run down the sarah jane or mr peggotty and the yarmouth boatmen having put off in a gale of wind with an anchor and cable to the nelson indiaman in distress and you shall go there another day and find them deep in the evidence pro and con respecting a clergyman who has misbehaved himself and you shall find the judge in the nautical case the advocate in the clergymans case or contrariwise
they are like actors now a mans a judge and now he is not a judge now hes one thing now hes another now hes something else change and change about but its always a very pleasant profitable little affair of private theatricals presented to an uncommonly select audience but advocates and proctors are not one and the same said i a little puzzled
are they no returned steerforth the advocates are civiliansmen who have taken a doctors degree at collegewhich is the first reason of my knowing anything about it
the proctors employ the advocates
both get very comfortable fees and altogether they make a mighty snug little party
on the whole i would recommend you to take to doctors commons kindly david
they plume themselves on their gentility there i can tell you if thats any satisfaction i made allowance for steerforths light way of treating the subject and considering it with reference to the staid air of gravity and antiquity which i associated with that lazy old nook near st pauls churchyard did not feel indisposed towards my aunts suggestion which she left to my free decision making no scruple of telling me that it had occurred to her on her lately visiting her own proctor in doctors commons for the purpose of settling her will in my favour
thats a laudable proceeding on the part of our aunt at all events said steerforth when i mentioned it and one deserving of all encouragement
daisy my advice is that you take kindly to doctors commons i quite made up my mind to do so
i then told steerforth that my aunt was in town awaiting me as i found from her letter and that she had taken lodgings for a week at a kind of private hotel at lincolns inn fields where there was a stone staircase and a convenient door in the roof my aunt being firmly persuaded that every house in london was going to be burnt down every night
we achieved the rest of our journey pleasantly sometimes recurring to doctors commons and anticipating the distant days when i should be a proctor there which steerforth pictured in a variety of humorous and whimsical lights that made us both merry
when we came to our journeys end he went home engaging to call upon me next day but one and i drove to lincolns inn fields where i found my aunt up and waiting supper
if i had been round the world since we parted we could hardly have been better pleased to meet again
my aunt cried outright as she embraced me and said pretending to laugh that if my poor mother had been alive that silly little creature would have shed tears she had no doubt
so you have left mr dick behind aunt said i
i am sorry for that
ah janet how do you do as janet curtsied hoping i was well i observed my aunts visage lengthen very much
i am sorry for it too said my aunt rubbing her nose
i have had no peace of mind trot since i have been here before i could ask why she told me
i am convinced said my aunt laying her hand with melancholy firmness on the table that dicks character is not a character to keep the donkeys off
i am confident he wants strength of purpose
i ought to have left janet at home instead and then my mind might perhaps have been at ease
if ever there was a donkey trespassing on my green said my aunt with emphasis there was one this afternoon at four oclock
a cold feeling came over me from head to foot and i know it was a donkey i tried to comfort her on this point but she rejected consolation
it was a donkey said my aunt and it was the one with the stumpy tail which that murdering sister of a woman rode when she came to my house this had been ever since the only name my aunt knew for miss murdstone
if there is any donkey in dover whose audacity it is harder to me to bear than anothers that said my aunt striking the table is the animal janet ventured to suggest that my aunt might be disturbing herself unnecessarily and that she believed the donkey in question was then engaged in the sandandgravel line of business and was not available for purposes of trespass
but my aunt wouldnt hear of it
supper was comfortably served and hot though my aunts rooms were very high upwhether that she might have more stone stairs for her money or might be nearer to the door in the roof i dont knowand consisted of a roast fowl a steak and some vegetables to all of which i did ample justice and which were all excellent
but my aunt had her own ideas concerning london provision and ate but little
i suppose this unfortunate fowl was born and brought up in a cellar said my aunt and never took the air except on a hackney coachstand
i hope the steak may be beef but i dont believe it
nothings genuine in the place in my opinion but the dirt dont you think the fowl may have come out of the country aunt i hinted
certainly not returned my aunt
it would be no pleasure to a london tradesman to sell anything which was what he pretended it was i did not venture to controvert this opinion but i made a good supper which it greatly satisfied her to see me do
when the table was cleared janet assisted her to arrange her hair to put on her nightcap which was of a smarter construction than usual in case of fire my aunt said and to fold her gown back over her knees these being her usual preparations for warming herself before going to bed
i then made her according to certain established regulations from which no deviation however slight could ever be permitted a glass of hot wine and water and a slice of toast cut into long thin strips
with these accompaniments we were left alone to finish the evening my aunt sitting opposite to me drinking her wine and water soaking her strips of toast in it one by one before eating them and looking benignantly on me from among the borders of her nightcap
well trot she began what do you think of the proctor plan
or have you not begun to think about it yet i have thought a good deal about it my dear aunt and i have talked a good deal about it with steerforth
i like it very much indeed
i like it exceedingly come said my aunt
thats cheering i have only one difficulty aunt say what it is trot she returned
why i want to ask aunt as this seems from what i understand to be a limited profession whether my entrance into it would not be very expensive it will cost returned my aunt to article you just a thousand pounds now my dear aunt said i drawing my chair nearer i am uneasy in my mind about that
its a large sum of money
you have expended a great deal on my education and have always been as liberal to me in all things as it was possible to be
you have been the soul of generosity
surely there are some ways in which i might begin life with hardly any outlay and yet begin with a good hope of getting on by resolution and exertion
are you sure that it would not be better to try that course
are you certain that you can afford to part with so much money and that it is right that it should be so expended
i only ask you my second mother to consider
are you certain my aunt finished eating the piece of toast on which she was then engaged looking me full in the face all the while and then setting her glass on the chimneypiece and folding her hands upon her folded skirts replied as follows trot my child if i have any object in life it is to provide for your being a good a sensible and a happy man
i am bent upon itso is dick
i should like some people that i know to hear dicks conversation on the subject
its sagacity is wonderful
but no one knows the resources of that mans intellect except myself she stopped for a moment to take my hand between hers and went on its in vain trot to recall the past unless it works some influence upon the present
perhaps i might have been better friends with your poor father
perhaps i might have been better friends with that poor child your mother even after your sister betsey trotwood disappointed me
when you came to me a little runaway boy all dusty and wayworn perhaps i thought so
from that time until now trot you have ever been a credit to me and a pride and a pleasure
i have no other claim upon my means at leasthere to my surprise she hesitated and was confusedno i have no other claim upon my meansand you are my adopted child
only be a loving child to me in my age and bear with my whims and fancies and you will do more for an old woman whose prime of life was not so happy or conciliating as it might have been than ever that old woman did for you it was the first time i had heard my aunt refer to her past history
there was a magnanimity in her quiet way of doing so and of dismissing it which would have exalted her in my respect and affection if anything could
all is agreed and understood between us now trot said my aunt and we need talk of this no more
give me a kiss and well go to the commons after breakfast tomorrow we had a long chat by the fire before we went to bed
i slept in a room on the same floor with my aunts and was a little disturbed in the course of the night by her knocking at my door as often as she was agitated by a distant sound of hackneycoaches or marketcarts and inquiring if i heard the engines but towards morning she slept better and suffered me to do so too
at about midday we set out for the office of messrs spenlow and jorkins in doctors commons
my aunt who had this other general opinion in reference to london that every man she saw was a pickpocket gave me her purse to carry for her which had ten guineas in it and some silver
we made a pause at the toy shop in fleet street to see the giants of saint dunstans strike upon the bellswe had timed our going so as to catch them at it at twelve oclockand then went on towards ludgate hill and st pauls churchyard
we were crossing to the former place when i found that my aunt greatly accelerated her speed and looked frightened
i observed at the same time that a lowering illdressed man who had stopped and stared at us in passing a little before was coming so close after us as to brush against her
trot
my dear trot cried my aunt in a terrified whisper and pressing my arm
i dont know what i am to do dont be alarmed said i
theres nothing to be afraid of
step into a shop and ill soon get rid of this fellow no no child she returned
dont speak to him for the world
i entreat i order you good heaven aunt said i
he is nothing but a sturdy beggar you dont know what he is replied my aunt
you dont know who he is
you dont know what you say we had stopped in an empty doorway while this was passing and he had stopped too
dont look at him said my aunt as i turned my head indignantly but get me a coach my dear and wait for me in st pauls churchyard wait for you i replied
yes rejoined my aunt
i must go alone
i must go with him with him aunt
this man i am in my senses she replied and i tell you i must
get me a coach however much astonished i might be i was sensible that i had no right to refuse compliance with such a peremptory command
i hurried away a few paces and called a hackneychariot which was passing empty
almost before i could let down the steps my aunt sprang in i dont know how and the man followed
she waved her hand to me to go away so earnestly that all confounded as i was i turned from them at once
in doing so i heard her say to the coachman drive anywhere
drive straight on and presently the chariot passed me going up the hill
what mr dick had told me and what i had supposed to be a delusion of his now came into my mind
i could not doubt that this person was the person of whom he had made such mysterious mention though what the nature of his hold upon my aunt could possibly be i was quite unable to imagine
after half an hours cooling in the churchyard i saw the chariot coming back
the driver stopped beside me and my aunt was sitting in it alone
she had not yet sufficiently recovered from her agitation to be quite prepared for the visit we had to make
she desired me to get into the chariot and to tell the coachman to drive slowly up and down a little while
she said no more except my dear child never ask me what it was and dont refer to it until she had perfectly regained her composure when she told me she was quite herself now and we might get out
on her giving me her purse to pay the driver i found that all the guineas were gone and only the loose silver remained
doctors commons was approached by a little low archway
before we had taken many paces down the street beyond it the noise of the city seemed to melt as if by magic into a softened distance
a few dull courts and narrow ways brought us to the skylighted offices of spenlow and jorkins in the vestibule of which temple accessible to pilgrims without the ceremony of knocking three or four clerks were at work as copyists
one of these a little dry man sitting by himself who wore a stiff brown wig that looked as if it were made of gingerbread rose to receive my aunt and show us into mr spenlows room
mr
spenlows in court maam said the dry man its an arches day but its close by and ill send for him directly as we were left to look about us while mr spenlow was fetched i availed myself of the opportunity
the furniture of the room was oldfashioned and dusty and the green baize on the top of the writingtable had lost all its colour and was as withered and pale as an old pauper
there were a great many bundles of papers on it some endorsed as allegations and some to my surprise as libels and some as being in the consistory court and some in the arches court and some in the prerogative court and some in the admiralty court and some in the delegates court giving me occasion to wonder much how many courts there might be in the gross and how long it would take to understand them all
besides these there were sundry immense manuscript books of evidence taken on affidavit strongly bound and tied together in massive sets a set to each cause as if every cause were a history in ten or twenty volumes
all this looked tolerably expensive i thought and gave me an agreeable notion of a proctors business
i was casting my eyes with increasing complacency over these and many similar objects when hasty footsteps were heard in the room outside and mr spenlow in a black gown trimmed with white fur came hurrying in taking off his hat as he came
he was a little lighthaired gentleman with undeniable boots and the stiffest of white cravats and shirtcollars
he was buttoned up mighty trim and tight and must have taken a great deal of pains with his whiskers which were accurately curled
his gold watchchain was so massive that a fancy came across me that he ought to have a sinewy golden arm to draw it out with like those which are put up over the goldbeaters shops
he was got up with such care and was so stiff that he could hardly bend himself being obliged when he glanced at some papers on his desk after sitting down in his chair to move his whole body from the bottom of his spine like punch
i had previously been presented by my aunt and had been courteously received
he now said and so mr copperfield you think of entering into our profession
i casually mentioned to miss trotwood when i had the pleasure of an interview with her the other daywith another inclination of his bodypunch againthat there was a vacancy here
miss trotwood was good enough to mention that she had a nephew who was her peculiar care and for whom she was seeking to provide genteelly in life
that nephew i believe i have now the pleasure ofpunch again
i bowed my acknowledgements and said my aunt had mentioned to me that there was that opening and that i believed i should like it very much
that i was strongly inclined to like it and had taken immediately to the proposal
that i could not absolutely pledge myself to like it until i knew something more about it
that although it was little else than a matter of form i presumed i should have an opportunity of trying how i liked it before i bound myself to it irrevocably
oh surely
surely said mr spenlow
we always in this house propose a monthan initiatory month
i should be happy myself to propose two monthsthreean indefinite period in factbut i have a partner
mr jorkins and the premium sir i returned is a thousand pounds and the premium stamp included is a thousand pounds said mr spenlow
as i have mentioned to miss trotwood i am actuated by no mercenary considerations few men are less so i believe but mr jorkins has his opinions on these subjects and i am bound to respect mr jorkinss opinions
mr jorkins thinks a thousand pounds too little in short i suppose sir said i still desiring to spare my aunt that it is not the custom here if an articled clerk were particularly useful and made himself a perfect master of his professioni could not help blushing this looked so like praising myselfi suppose it is not the custom in the later years of his time to allow him any mr spenlow by a great effort just lifted his head far enough out of his cravat to shake it and answered anticipating the word salary no
i will not say what consideration i might give to that point myself mr copperfield if i were unfettered
mr jorkins is immovable i was quite dismayed by the idea of this terrible jorkins
but i found out afterwards that he was a mild man of a heavy temperament whose place in the business was to keep himself in the background and be constantly exhibited by name as the most obdurate and ruthless of men
if a clerk wanted his salary raised mr jorkins wouldnt listen to such a proposition
if a client were slow to settle his bill of costs mr jorkins was resolved to have it paid and however painful these things might be and always were to the feelings of mr spenlow mr jorkins would have his bond
the heart and hand of the good angel spenlow would have been always open but for the restraining demon jorkins
as i have grown older i think i have had experience of some other houses doing business on the principle of spenlow and jorkins
it was settled that i should begin my months probation as soon as i pleased and that my aunt need neither remain in town nor return at its expiration as the articles of agreement of which i was to be the subject could easily be sent to her at home for her signature
when we had got so far mr spenlow offered to take me into court then and there and show me what sort of place it was
as i was willing enough to know we went out with this object leaving my aunt behind who would trust herself she said in no such place and who i think regarded all courts of law as a sort of powdermills that might blow up at any time
mr spenlow conducted me through a paved courtyard formed of grave brick houses which i inferred from the doctors names upon the doors to be the official abidingplaces of the learned advocates of whom steerforth had told me and into a large dull room not unlike a chapel to my thinking on the left hand
the upper part of this room was fenced off from the rest and there on the two sides of a raised platform of the horseshoe form sitting on easy oldfashioned diningroom chairs were sundry gentlemen in red gowns and grey wigs whom i found to be the doctors aforesaid
blinking over a little desk like a pulpitdesk in the curve of the horseshoe was an old gentleman whom if i had seen him in an aviary i should certainly have taken for an owl but who i learned was the presiding judge
in the space within the horseshoe lower than these that is to say on about the level of the floor were sundry other gentlemen of mr spenlows rank and dressed like him in black gowns with white fur upon them sitting at a long green table
their cravats were in general stiff i thought and their looks haughty but in this last respect i presently conceived i had done them an injustice for when two or three of them had to rise and answer a question of the presiding dignitary i never saw anything more sheepish
the public represented by a boy with a comforter and a shabbygenteel man secretly eating crumbs out of his coat pockets was warming itself at a stove in the centre of the court
the languid stillness of the place was only broken by the chirping of this fire and by the voice of one of the doctors who was wandering slowly through a perfect library of evidence and stopping to put up from time to time at little roadside inns of argument on the journey
altogether i have never on any occasion made one at such a cosey dosey oldfashioned timeforgotten sleepyheaded little familyparty in all my life and i felt it would be quite a soothing opiate to belong to it in any characterexcept perhaps as a suitor
very well satisfied with the dreamy nature of this retreat i informed mr spenlow that i had seen enough for that time and we rejoined my aunt in company with whom i presently departed from the commons feeling very young when i went out of spenlow and jorkinss on account of the clerks poking one another with their pens to point me out
we arrived at lincolns inn fields without any new adventures except encountering an unlucky donkey in a costermongers cart who suggested painful associations to my aunt
we had another long talk about my plans when we were safely housed and as i knew she was anxious to get home and between fire food and pickpockets could never be considered at her ease for halfanhour in london i urged her not to be uncomfortable on my account but to leave me to take care of myself
i have not been here a week tomorrow without considering that too my dear she returned
there is a furnished little set of chambers to be let in the adelphi trot which ought to suit you to a marvel with this brief introduction she produced from her pocket an advertisement carefully cut out of a newspaper setting forth that in buckingham street in the adelphi there was to be let furnished with a view of the river a singularly desirable and compact set of chambers forming a genteel residence for a young gentleman a member of one of the inns of court or otherwise with immediate possession
terms moderate and could be taken for a month only if required
why this is the very thing aunt said i flushed with the possible dignity of living in chambers
then come replied my aunt immediately resuming the bonnet she had a minute before laid aside
well go and look at em away we went
the advertisement directed us to apply to mrs crupp on the premises and we rung the area bell which we supposed to communicate with mrs crupp
it was not until we had rung three or four times that we could prevail on mrs crupp to communicate with us but at last she appeared being a stout lady with a flounce of flannel petticoat below a nankeen gown
let us see these chambers of yours if you please maam said my aunt
for this gentleman said mrs crupp feeling in her pocket for her keys
yes for my nephew said my aunt
and a sweet set they is for sich said mrs crupp
so we went upstairs
they were on the top of the housea great point with my aunt being near the fireescapeand consisted of a little halfblind entry where you could see hardly anything a little stoneblind pantry where you could see nothing at all a sittingroom and a bedroom
the furniture was rather faded but quite good enough for me and sure enough the river was outside the windows
as i was delighted with the place my aunt and mrs crupp withdrew into the pantry to discuss the terms while i remained on the sittingroom sofa hardly daring to think it possible that i could be destined to live in such a noble residence
after a single combat of some duration they returned and i saw to my joy both in mrs crupps countenance and in my aunts that the deed was done
is it the last occupants furniture inquired my aunt
yes it is maam said mrs crupp
whats become of him asked my aunt
mrs crupp was taken with a troublesome cough in the midst of which she articulated with much difficulty
he was took ill here maam andugh
ugh
ugh
dear meand he died hey
what did he die of asked my aunt
well maam he died of drink said mrs crupp in confidence
and smoke smoke
you dont mean chimneys said my aunt
no maam returned mrs crupp
cigars and pipes thats not catching trot at any rate remarked my aunt turning to me
no indeed said i
in short my aunt seeing how enraptured i was with the premises took them for a month with leave to remain for twelve months when that time was out
mrs crupp was to find linen and to cook every other necessary was already provided and mrs crupp expressly intimated that she should always yearn towards me as a son
i was to take possession the day after tomorrow and mrs crupp said thank heaven she had now found summun she could care for
on our way back my aunt informed me how she confidently trusted that the life i was now to lead would make me firm and selfreliant which was all i wanted
she repeated this several times next day in the intervals of our arranging for the transmission of my clothes and books from mr wickfields relative to which and to all my late holiday i wrote a long letter to agnes of which my aunt took charge as she was to leave on the succeeding day
not to lengthen these particulars i need only add that she made a handsome provision for all my possible wants during my month of trial that steerforth to my great disappointment and hers too did not make his appearance before she went away that i saw her safely seated in the dover coach exulting in the coming discomfiture of the vagrant donkeys with janet at her side and that when the coach was gone i turned my face to the adelphi pondering on the old days when i used to roam about its subterranean arches and on the happy changes which had brought me to the surface
it was a wonderfully fine thing to have that lofty castle to myself and to feel when i shut my outer door like robinson crusoe when he had got into his fortification and pulled his ladder up after him
it was a wonderfully fine thing to walk about town with the key of my house in my pocket and to know that i could ask any fellow to come home and make quite sure of its being inconvenient to nobody if it were not so to me
it was a wonderfully fine thing to let myself in and out and to come and go without a word to anyone and to ring mrs crupp up gasping from the depths of the earth when i wanted herand when she was disposed to come
all this i say was wonderfully fine but i must say too that there were times when it was very dreary
it was fine in the morning particularly in the fine mornings
it looked a very fresh free life by daylight still fresher and more free by sunlight
but as the day declined the life seemed to go down too
i dont know how it was it seldom looked well by candlelight
i wanted somebody to talk to then
i missed agnes
i found a tremendous blank in the place of that smiling repository of my confidence
mrs crupp appeared to be a long way off
i thought about my predecessor who had died of drink and smoke and i could have wished he had been so good as to live and not bother me with his decease
after two days and nights i felt as if i had lived there for a year and yet i was not an hour older but was quite as much tormented by my own youthfulness as ever
steerforth not yet appearing which induced me to apprehend that he must be ill i left the commons early on the third day and walked out to highgate
mrs steerforth was very glad to see me and said that he had gone away with one of his oxford friends to see another who lived near st albans but that she expected him to return tomorrow
i was so fond of him that i felt quite jealous of his oxford friends
as she pressed me to stay to dinner i remained and i believe we talked about nothing but him all day
i told her how much the people liked him at yarmouth and what a delightful companion he had been
miss dartle was full of hints and mysterious questions but took a great interest in all our proceedings there and said was it really though and so forth so often that she got everything out of me she wanted to know
her appearance was exactly what i have described it when i first saw her but the society of the two ladies was so agreeable and came so natural to me that i felt myself falling a little in love with her
i could not help thinking several times in the course of the evening and particularly when i walked home at night what delightful company she would be in buckingham street
i was taking my coffee and roll in the morning before going to the commonsand i may observe in this place that it is surprising how much coffee mrs crupp used and how weak it was consideringwhen steerforth himself walked in to my unbounded joy
my dear steerforth cried i i began to think i should never see you again i was carried off by force of arms said steerforth the very next morning after i got home
why daisy what a rare old bachelor you are here i showed him over the establishment not omitting the pantry with no little pride and he commended it highly
i tell you what old boy he added i shall make quite a townhouse of this place unless you give me notice to quit this was a delightful hearing
i told him if he waited for that he would have to wait till doomsday
but you shall have some breakfast said i with my hand on the bellrope and mrs crupp shall make you some fresh coffee and ill toast you some bacon in a bachelors dutchoven that i have got here no no said steerforth
dont ring
i cant
i am going to breakfast with one of these fellows who is at the piazza hotel in covent garden but youll come back to dinner said i
i cant upon my life
theres nothing i should like better but i must remain with these two fellows
we are all three off together tomorrow morning then bring them here to dinner i returned
do you think they would come oh
they would come fast enough said steerforth but we should inconvenience you
you had better come and dine with us somewhere i would not by any means consent to this for it occurred to me that i really ought to have a little housewarming and that there never could be a better opportunity
i had a new pride in my rooms after his approval of them and burned with a desire to develop their utmost resources
i therefore made him promise positively in the names of his two friends and we appointed six oclock as the dinnerhour
when he was gone i rang for mrs crupp and acquainted her with my desperate design
mrs crupp said in the first place of course it was well known she couldnt be expected to wait but she knew a handy young man who she thought could be prevailed upon to do it and whose terms would be five shillings and what i pleased
i said certainly we would have him
next mrs crupp said it was clear she couldnt be in two places at once which i felt to be reasonable and that a young gal stationed in the pantry with a bedroom candle there never to desist from washing plates would be indispensable
i said what would be the expense of this young female
and mrs crupp said she supposed eighteenpence would neither make me nor break me
i said i supposed not and that was settled
then mrs crupp said now about the dinner
it was a remarkable instance of want of forethought on the part of the ironmonger who had made mrs crupps kitchen fireplace that it was capable of cooking nothing but chops and mashed potatoes
as to a fishkittle mrs crupp said well
would i only come and look at the range
she couldnt say fairer than that
would i come and look at it
as i should not have been much the wiser if i had looked at it i declined and said never mind fish but mrs crupp said dont say that oysters was in why not them
so that was settled
mrs crupp then said what she would recommend would be this
a pair of hot roast fowlsfrom the pastrycooks a dish of stewed beef with vegetablesfrom the pastrycooks two little corner things as a raised pie and a dish of kidneysfrom the pastrycooks a tart and if i liked a shape of jellyfrom the pastrycooks
this mrs crupp said would leave her at full liberty to concentrate her mind on the potatoes and to serve up the cheese and celery as she could wish to see it done
i acted on mrs crupps opinion and gave the order at the pastrycooks myself
walking along the strand afterwards and observing a hard mottled substance in the window of a ham and beef shop which resembled marble but was labelled mock turtle i went in and bought a slab of it which i have since seen reason to believe would have sufficed for fifteen people
this preparation mrs crupp after some difficulty consented to warm up and it shrunk so much in a liquid state that we found it what steerforth called rather a tight fit for four
these preparations happily completed i bought a little dessert in covent garden market and gave a rather extensive order at a retail winemerchants in that vicinity
when i came home in the afternoon and saw the bottles drawn up in a square on the pantry floor they looked so numerous though there were two missing which made mrs crupp very uncomfortable that i was absolutely frightened at them
one of steerforths friends was named grainger and the other markham
they were both very gay and lively fellows grainger something older than steerforth markham youthfullooking and i should say not more than twenty
i observed that the latter always spoke of himself indefinitely as a man and seldom or never in the first person singular
a man might get on very well here mr copperfield said markhammeaning himself
its not a bad situation said i and the rooms are really commodious i hope you have both brought appetites with you said steerforth
upon my honour returned markham town seems to sharpen a mans appetite
a man is hungry all day long
a man is perpetually eating being a little embarrassed at first and feeling much too young to preside i made steerforth take the head of the table when dinner was announced and seated myself opposite to him
everything was very good we did not spare the wine and he exerted himself so brilliantly to make the thing pass off well that there was no pause in our festivity
i was not quite such good company during dinner as i could have wished to be for my chair was opposite the door and my attention was distracted by observing that the handy young man went out of the room very often and that his shadow always presented itself immediately afterwards on the wall of the entry with a bottle at its mouth
the young gal likewise occasioned me some uneasiness not so much by neglecting to wash the plates as by breaking them
for being of an inquisitive disposition and unable to confine herself as her positive instructions were to the pantry she was constantly peering in at us and constantly imagining herself detected in which belief she several times retired upon the plates with which she had carefully paved the floor and did a great deal of destruction
these however were small drawbacks and easily forgotten when the cloth was cleared and the dessert put on the table at which period of the entertainment the handy young man was discovered to be speechless
giving him private directions to seek the society of mrs crupp and to remove the young gal to the basement also i abandoned myself to enjoyment
i began by being singularly cheerful and lighthearted all sorts of halfforgotten things to talk about came rushing into my mind and made me hold forth in a most unwonted manner
i laughed heartily at my own jokes and everybody elses called steerforth to order for not passing the wine made several engagements to go to oxford announced that i meant to have a dinnerparty exactly like that once a week until further notice and madly took so much snuff out of graingers box that i was obliged to go into the pantry and have a private fit of sneezing ten minutes long
i went on by passing the wine faster and faster yet and continually starting up with a corkscrew to open more wine long before any was needed
i proposed steerforths health
i said he was my dearest friend the protector of my boyhood and the companion of my prime
i said i was delighted to propose his health
i said i owed him more obligations than i could ever repay and held him in a higher admiration than i could ever express
i finished by saying ill give you steerforth
god bless him
hurrah we gave him three times three and another and a good one to finish with
i broke my glass in going round the table to shake hands with him and i said in two words steerforthyouretheguidingstarofmyexistence i went on by finding suddenly that somebody was in the middle of a song
markham was the singer and he sang when the heart of a man is depressed with care
he said when he had sung it he would give us woman i took objection to that and i couldnt allow it
i said it was not a respectful way of proposing the toast and i would never permit that toast to be drunk in my house otherwise than as the ladies i was very high with him mainly i think because i saw steerforth and grainger laughing at meor at himor at both of us
he said a man was not to be dictated to
i said a man was
he said a man was not to be insulted then
i said he was right therenever under my roof where the lares were sacred and the laws of hospitality paramount
he said it was no derogation from a mans dignity to confess that i was a devilish good fellow
i instantly proposed his health
somebody was smoking
we were all smoking
i was smoking and trying to suppress a rising tendency to shudder
steerforth had made a speech about me in the course of which i had been affected almost to tears
i returned thanks and hoped the present company would dine with me tomorrow and the day aftereach day at five oclock that we might enjoy the pleasures of conversation and society through a long evening
i felt called upon to propose an individual
i would give them my aunt
miss betsey trotwood the best of her sex
somebody was leaning out of my bedroom window refreshing his forehead against the cool stone of the parapet and feeling the air upon his face
it was myself
i was addressing myself as copperfield and saying why did you try to smoke
you might have known you couldnt do it now somebody was unsteadily contemplating his features in the lookingglass
that was i too
i was very pale in the lookingglass my eyes had a vacant appearance and my haironly my hair nothing elselooked drunk
somebody said to me let us go to the theatre copperfield there was no bedroom before me but again the jingling table covered with glasses the lamp grainger on my right hand markham on my left and steerforth oppositeall sitting in a mist and a long way off
the theatre
to be sure
the very thing
come along
but they must excuse me if i saw everybody out first and turned the lamp offin case of fire
owing to some confusion in the dark the door was gone
i was feeling for it in the windowcurtains when steerforth laughing took me by the arm and led me out
we went downstairs one behind another
near the bottom somebody fell and rolled down
somebody else said it was copperfield
i was angry at that false report until finding myself on my back in the passage i began to think there might be some foundation for it
a very foggy night with great rings round the lamps in the streets
there was an indistinct talk of its being wet
i considered it frosty
steerforth dusted me under a lamppost and put my hat into shape which somebody produced from somewhere in a most extraordinary manner for i hadnt had it on before
steerforth then said you are all right copperfield are you not and i told him neverberrer a man sitting in a pigeonholeplace looked out of the fog and took money from somebody inquiring if i was one of the gentlemen paid for and appearing rather doubtful as i remember in the glimpse i had of him whether to take the money for me or not
shortly afterwards we were very high up in a very hot theatre looking down into a large pit that seemed to me to smoke the people with whom it was crammed were so indistinct
there was a great stage too looking very clean and smooth after the streets and there were people upon it talking about something or other but not at all intelligibly
there was an abundance of bright lights and there was music and there were ladies down in the boxes and i dont know what more
the whole building looked to me as if it were learning to swim it conducted itself in such an unaccountable manner when i tried to steady it
on somebodys motion we resolved to go downstairs to the dressboxes where the ladies were
a gentleman lounging full dressed on a sofa with an operaglass in his hand passed before my view and also my own figure at full length in a glass
then i was being ushered into one of these boxes and found myself saying something as i sat down and people about me crying silence to somebody and ladies casting indignant glances at me andwhat
yesagnes sitting on the seat before me in the same box with a lady and gentleman beside her whom i didnt know
i see her face now better than i did then i dare say with its indelible look of regret and wonder turned upon me
agnes i said thickly lorblessmer
agnes hush
pray she answered i could not conceive why
you disturb the company
look at the stage i tried on her injunction to fix it and to hear something of what was going on there but quite in vain
i looked at her again by and by and saw her shrink into her corner and put her gloved hand to her forehead
agnes i said
imafraidyourenorwell yes yes
do not mind me trotwood she returned
listen
are you going away soon amigoarawaysoo i repeated
yes i had a stupid intention of replying that i was going to wait to hand her downstairs
i suppose i expressed it somehow for after she had looked at me attentively for a little while she appeared to understand and replied in a low tone i know you will do as i ask you if i tell you i am very earnest in it
go away now trotwood for my sake and ask your friends to take you home she had so far improved me for the time that though i was angry with her i felt ashamed and with a short goori which i intended for good night got up and went away
they followed and i stepped at once out of the boxdoor into my bedroom where only steerforth was with me helping me to undress and where i was by turns telling him that agnes was my sister and adjuring him to bring the corkscrew that i might open another bottle of wine
how somebody lying in my bed lay saying and doing all this over again at cross purposes in a feverish dream all nightthe bed a rocking sea that was never still
how as that somebody slowly settled down into myself did i begin to parch and feel as if my outer covering of skin were a hard board my tongue the bottom of an empty kettle furred with long service and burning up over a slow fire the palms of my hands hot plates of metal which no ice could cool
but the agony of mind the remorse and shame i felt when i became conscious next day
my horror of having committed a thousand offences i had forgotten and which nothing could ever expiatemy recollection of that indelible look which agnes had given methe torturing impossibility of communicating with her not knowing beast that i was how she came to be in london or where she stayedmy disgust of the very sight of the room where the revel had been heldmy racking headthe smell of smoke the sight of glasses the impossibility of going out or even getting up
oh what a day it was
oh what an evening when i sat down by my fire to a basin of mutton broth dimpled all over with fat and thought i was going the way of my predecessor and should succeed to his dismal story as well as to his chambers and had half a mind to rush express to dover and reveal all
what an evening when mrs crupp coming in to take away the brothbasin produced one kidney on a cheeseplate as the entire remains of yesterdays feast and i was really inclined to fall upon her nankeen breast and say in heartfelt penitence oh mrs crupp mrs crupp never mind the broken meats
i am very miserableonly that i doubted even at that pass if mrs crupp were quite the sort of woman to confide in
i was going out at my door on the morning after that deplorable day of headache sickness and repentance with an odd confusion in my mind relative to the date of my dinnerparty as if a body of titans had taken an enormous lever and pushed the day before yesterday some months back when i saw a ticketporter coming upstairs with a letter in his hand
he was taking his time about his errand then but when he saw me on the top of the staircase looking at him over the banisters he swung into a trot and came up panting as if he had run himself into a state of exhaustion
t
copperfield esquire said the ticketporter touching his hat with his little cane
i could scarcely lay claim to the name i was so disturbed by the conviction that the letter came from agnes
however i told him i was t copperfield esquire and he believed it and gave me the letter which he said required an answer
i shut him out on the landing to wait for the answer and went into my chambers again in such a nervous state that i was fain to lay the letter down on my breakfast table and familiarize myself with the outside of it a little before i could resolve to break the seal
i found when i did open it that it was a very kind note containing no reference to my condition at the theatre
all it said was my dear trotwood
i am staying at the house of papas agent mr waterbrook in ely place holborn
will you come and see me today at any time you like to appoint
ever yours affectionately agnes it took me such a long time to write an answer at all to my satisfaction that i dont know what the ticketporter can have thought unless he thought i was learning to write
i must have written halfadozen answers at least
i began one how can i ever hope my dear agnes to efface from your remembrance the disgusting impressionthere i didnt like it and then i tore it up
i began another shakespeare has observed my dear agnes how strange it is that a man should put an enemy into his mouththat reminded me of markham and it got no farther
i even tried poetry
i began one note in a sixsyllable line oh do not rememberbut that associated itself with the fifth of november and became an absurdity
after many attempts i wrote my dear agnes
your letter is like you and what could i say of it that would be higher praise than that
i will come at four oclock
affectionately and sorrowfully tc with this missive which i was in twenty minds at once about recalling as soon as it was out of my hands the ticketporter at last departed
if the day were half as tremendous to any other professional gentleman in doctors commons as it was to me i sincerely believe he made some expiation for his share in that rotten old ecclesiastical cheese
although i left the office at half past three and was prowling about the place of appointment within a few minutes afterwards the appointed time was exceeded by a full quarter of an hour according to the clock of st andrews holborn before i could muster up sufficient desperation to pull the private bellhandle let into the lefthand doorpost of mr waterbrooks house
the professional business of mr waterbrooks establishment was done on the groundfloor and the genteel business of which there was a good deal in the upper part of the building
i was shown into a pretty but rather close drawingroom and there sat agnes netting a purse
she looked so quiet and good and reminded me so strongly of my airy fresh school days at canterbury and the sodden smoky stupid wretch i had been the other night that nobody being by i yielded to my selfreproach and shame andin short made a fool of myself
i cannot deny that i shed tears
to this hour i am undecided whether it was upon the whole the wisest thing i could have done or the most ridiculous
if it had been anyone but you agnes said i turning away my head i should not have minded it half so much
but that it should have been you who saw me
i almost wish i had been dead first she put her handits touch was like no other handupon my arm for a moment and i felt so befriended and comforted that i could not help moving it to my lips and gratefully kissing it
sit down said agnes cheerfully
dont be unhappy trotwood
if you cannot confidently trust me whom will you trust ah agnes i returned
you are my good angel she smiled rather sadly i thought and shook her head
yes agnes my good angel
always my good angel if i were indeed trotwood she returned there is one thing that i should set my heart on very much i looked at her inquiringly but already with a foreknowledge of her meaning
on warning you said agnes with a steady glance against your bad angel my dear agnes i began if you mean steerforth i do trotwood she returned
then agnes you wrong him very much
he my bad angel or anyones
he anything but a guide a support and a friend to me
my dear agnes
now is it not unjust and unlike you to judge him from what you saw of me the other night i do not judge him from what i saw of you the other night she quietly replied
from what then from many thingstrifles in themselves but they do not seem to me to be so when they are put together
i judge him partly from your account of him trotwood and your character and the influence he has over you there was always something in her modest voice that seemed to touch a chord within me answering to that sound alone
it was always earnest but when it was very earnest as it was now there was a thrill in it that quite subdued me
i sat looking at her as she cast her eyes down on her work i sat seeming still to listen to her and steerforth in spite of all my attachment to him darkened in that tone
it is very bold in me said agnes looking up again who have lived in such seclusion and can know so little of the world to give you my advice so confidently or even to have this strong opinion
but i know in what it is engendered trotwoodin how true a remembrance of our having grown up together and in how true an interest in all relating to you
it is that which makes me bold
i am certain that what i say is right
i am quite sure it is
i feel as if it were someone else speaking to you and not i when i caution you that you have made a dangerous friend again i looked at her again i listened to her after she was silent and again his image though it was still fixed in my heart darkened
i am not so unreasonable as to expect said agnes resuming her usual tone after a little while that you will or that you can at once change any sentiment that has become a conviction to you least of all a sentiment that is rooted in your trusting disposition
you ought not hastily to do that
i only ask you trotwood if you ever think of mei mean with a quiet smile for i was going to interrupt her and she knew why as often as you think of meto think of what i have said
do you forgive me for all this i will forgive you agnes i replied when you come to do steerforth justice and to like him as well as i do not until then said agnes
i saw a passing shadow on her face when i made this mention of him but she returned my smile and we were again as unreserved in our mutual confidence as of old
and when agnes said i will you forgive me the other night when i recall it said agnes
she would have dismissed the subject so but i was too full of it to allow that and insisted on telling her how it happened that i had disgraced myself and what chain of accidental circumstances had had the theatre for its final link
it was a great relief to me to do this and to enlarge on the obligation that i owed to steerforth for his care of me when i was unable to take care of myself
you must not forget said agnes calmly changing the conversation as soon as i had concluded that you are always to tell me not only when you fall into trouble but when you fall in love
who has succeeded to miss larkins trotwood no one agnes someone trotwood said agnes laughing and holding up her finger
no agnes upon my word
there is a lady certainly at mrs steerforths house who is very clever and whom i like to talk tomiss dartlebut i dont adore her agnes laughed again at her own penetration and told me that if i were faithful to her in my confidence she thought she should keep a little register of my violent attachments with the date duration and termination of each like the table of the reigns of the kings and queens in the history of england
then she asked me if i had seen uriah
uriah heep said i
no
is he in london he comes to the office downstairs every day returned agnes
he was in london a week before me
i am afraid on disagreeable business trotwood on some business that makes you uneasy agnes i see said i
what can that be agnes laid aside her work and replied folding her hands upon one another and looking pensively at me out of those beautiful soft eyes of hers i believe he is going to enter into partnership with papa what
uriah
that mean fawning fellow worm himself into such promotion i cried indignantly
have you made no remonstrance about it agnes
consider what a connexion it is likely to be
you must speak out
you must not allow your father to take such a mad step
you must prevent it agnes while theres time still looking at me agnes shook her head while i was speaking with a faint smile at my warmth and then replied you remember our last conversation about papa
it was not long after thatnot more than two or three dayswhen he gave me the first intimation of what i tell you
it was sad to see him struggling between his desire to represent it to me as a matter of choice on his part and his inability to conceal that it was forced upon him
i felt very sorry forced upon him agnes
who forces it upon him uriah she replied after a moments hesitation has made himself indispensable to papa
he is subtle and watchful
he has mastered papas weaknesses fostered them and taken advantage of them untilto say all that i mean in a word trotwooduntil papa is afraid of him there was more that she might have said more that she knew or that she suspected i clearly saw
i could not give her pain by asking what it was for i knew that she withheld it from me to spare her father
it had long been going on to this i was sensible yes i could not but feel on the least reflection that it had been going on to this for a long time
i remained silent
his ascendancy over papa said agnes is very great
he professes humility and gratitudewith truth perhaps i hope sobut his position is really one of power and i fear he makes a hard use of his power i said he was a hound which at the moment was a great satisfaction to me
at the time i speak of as the time when papa spoke to me pursued agnes he had told papa that he was going away that he was very sorry and unwilling to leave but that he had better prospects
papa was very much depressed then and more bowed down by care than ever you or i have seen him but he seemed relieved by this expedient of the partnership though at the same time he seemed hurt by it and ashamed of it and how did you receive it agnes i did trotwood she replied what i hope was right
feeling sure that it was necessary for papas peace that the sacrifice should be made i entreated him to make it
i said it would lighten the load of his lifei hope it willand that it would give me increased opportunities of being his companion
oh trotwood cried agnes putting her hands before her face as her tears started on it i almost feel as if i had been papas enemy instead of his loving child
for i know how he has altered in his devotion to me
i know how he has narrowed the circle of his sympathies and duties in the concentration of his whole mind upon me
i know what a multitude of things he has shut out for my sake and how his anxious thoughts of me have shadowed his life and weakened his strength and energy by turning them always upon one idea
if i could ever set this right
if i could ever work out his restoration as i have so innocently been the cause of his decline i had never before seen agnes cry
i had seen tears in her eyes when i had brought new honours home from school and i had seen them there when we last spoke about her father and i had seen her turn her gentle head aside when we took leave of one another but i had never seen her grieve like this
it made me so sorry that i could only say in a foolish helpless manner pray agnes dont
dont my dear sister but agnes was too superior to me in character and purpose as i know well now whatever i might know or not know then to be long in need of my entreaties
the beautiful calm manner which makes her so different in my remembrance from everybody else came back again as if a cloud had passed from a serene sky
we are not likely to remain alone much longer said agnes and while i have an opportunity let me earnestly entreat you trotwood to be friendly to uriah
dont repel him
dont resent as i think you have a general disposition to do what may be uncongenial to you in him
he may not deserve it for we know no certain ill of him
in any case think first of papa and me agnes had no time to say more for the room door opened and mrs waterbrook who was a large ladyor who wore a large dress i dont exactly know which for i dont know which was dress and which was ladycame sailing in
i had a dim recollection of having seen her at the theatre as if i had seen her in a pale magic lantern but she appeared to remember me perfectly and still to suspect me of being in a state of intoxication
finding by degrees however that i was sober and i hope that i was a modest young gentleman mrs waterbrook softened towards me considerably and inquired firstly if i went much into the parks and secondly if i went much into society
on my replying to both these questions in the negative it occurred to me that i fell again in her good opinion but she concealed the fact gracefully and invited me to dinner next day
i accepted the invitation and took my leave making a call on uriah in the office as i went out and leaving a card for him in his absence
when i went to dinner next day and on the street door being opened plunged into a vapourbath of haunch of mutton i divined that i was not the only guest for i immediately identified the ticketporter in disguise assisting the family servant and waiting at the foot of the stairs to carry up my name
he looked to the best of his ability when he asked me for it confidentially as if he had never seen me before but well did i know him and well did he know me
conscience made cowards of us both
i found mr waterbrook to be a middleaged gentleman with a short throat and a good deal of shirtcollar who only wanted a black nose to be the portrait of a pugdog
he told me he was happy to have the honour of making my acquaintance and when i had paid my homage to mrs waterbrook presented me with much ceremony to a very awful lady in a black velvet dress and a great black velvet hat whom i remember as looking like a near relation of hamletssay his aunt
mrs henry spiker was this ladys name and her husband was there too so cold a man that his head instead of being grey seemed to be sprinkled with hoarfrost
immense deference was shown to the henry spikers male and female which agnes told me was on account of mr henry spiker being solicitor to something or to somebody i forget what or which remotely connected with the treasury
i found uriah heep among the company in a suit of black and in deep humility
he told me when i shook hands with him that he was proud to be noticed by me and that he really felt obliged to me for my condescension
i could have wished he had been less obliged to me for he hovered about me in his gratitude all the rest of the evening and whenever i said a word to agnes was sure with his shadowless eyes and cadaverous face to be looking gauntly down upon us from behind
there were other guestsall iced for the occasion as it struck me like the wine
but there was one who attracted my attention before he came in on account of my hearing him announced as mr traddles
my mind flew back to salem house and could it be tommy i thought who used to draw the skeletons
i looked for mr traddles with unusual interest
he was a sober steadylooking young man of retiring manners with a comic head of hair and eyes that were rather wide open and he got into an obscure corner so soon that i had some difficulty in making him out
at length i had a good view of him and either my vision deceived me or it was the old unfortunate tommy
i made my way to mr waterbrook and said that i believed i had the pleasure of seeing an old schoolfellow there
indeed said mr waterbrook surprised
you are too young to have been at school with mr henry spiker oh i dont mean him i returned
i mean the gentleman named traddles oh
aye aye
indeed said my host with much diminished interest
possibly if its really the same person said i glancing towards him it was at a place called salem house where we were together and he was an excellent fellow oh yes
traddles is a good fellow returned my host nodding his head with an air of toleration
traddles is quite a good fellow its a curious coincidence said i
it is really returned my host quite a coincidence that traddles should be here at all as traddles was only invited this morning when the place at table intended to be occupied by mrs henry spikers brother became vacant in consequence of his indisposition
a very gentlemanly man mrs henry spikers brother mr copperfield i murmured an assent which was full of feeling considering that i knew nothing at all about him and i inquired what mr traddles was by profession
traddles returned mr waterbrook is a young man reading for the bar
yes
he is quite a good fellownobodys enemy but his own is he his own enemy said i sorry to hear this
well returned mr waterbrook pursing up his mouth and playing with his watchchain in a comfortable prosperous sort of way
i should say he was one of those men who stand in their own light
yes i should say he would never for example be worth five hundred pound
traddles was recommended to me by a professional friend
oh yes
yes
he has a kind of talent for drawing briefs and stating a case in writing plainly
i am able to throw something in traddless way in the course of the year somethingfor himconsiderable
oh yes
yes i was much impressed by the extremely comfortable and satisfied manner in which mr waterbrook delivered himself of this little word yes every now and then
there was wonderful expression in it
it completely conveyed the idea of a man who had been born not to say with a silver spoon but with a scalingladder and had gone on mounting all the heights of life one after another until now he looked from the top of the fortifications with the eye of a philosopher and a patron on the people down in the trenches
my reflections on this theme were still in progress when dinner was announced
mr waterbrook went down with hamlets aunt
mr henry spiker took mrs waterbrook
agnes whom i should have liked to take myself was given to a simpering fellow with weak legs
uriah traddles and i as the junior part of the company went down last how we could
i was not so vexed at losing agnes as i might have been since it gave me an opportunity of making myself known to traddles on the stairs who greeted me with great fervour while uriah writhed with such obtrusive satisfaction and selfabasement that i could gladly have pitched him over the banisters
traddles and i were separated at table being billeted in two remote corners he in the glare of a red velvet lady i in the gloom of hamlets aunt
the dinner was very long and the conversation was about the aristocracyand blood
mrs waterbrook repeatedly told us that if she had a weakness it was blood
it occurred to me several times that we should have got on better if we had not been quite so genteel
we were so exceedingly genteel that our scope was very limited
a mr and mrs gulpidge were of the party who had something to do at secondhand at least mr gulpidge had with the law business of the bank and what with the bank and what with the treasury we were as exclusive as the court circular
to mend the matter hamlets aunt had the family failing of indulging in soliloquy and held forth in a desultory manner by herself on every topic that was introduced
these were few enough to be sure but as we always fell back upon blood she had as wide a field for abstract speculation as her nephew himself
we might have been a party of ogres the conversation assumed such a sanguine complexion
i confess i am of mrs waterbrooks opinion said mr waterbrook with his wineglass at his eye
other things are all very well in their way but give me blood oh
there is nothing observed hamlets aunt so satisfactory to one
there is nothing that is so much ones beauideal ofof all that sort of thing speaking generally
there are some low minds not many i am happy to believe but there are some that would prefer to do what i should call bow down before idols
positively idols
before service intellect and so on
but these are intangible points
blood is not so
we see blood in a nose and we know it
we meet with it in a chin and we say there it is
thats blood it is an actual matter of fact
we point it out
it admits of no doubt the simpering fellow with the weak legs who had taken agnes down stated the question more decisively yet i thought
oh you know deuce take it said this gentleman looking round the board with an imbecile smile we cant forego blood you know
we must have blood you know
some young fellows you know may be a little behind their station perhaps in point of education and behaviour and may go a little wrong you know and get themselves and other people into a variety of fixesand all thatbut deuce take it its delightful to reflect that theyve got blood in em
myself id rather at any time be knocked down by a man who had got blood in him than id be picked up by a man who hadnt this sentiment as compressing the general question into a nutshell gave the utmost satisfaction and brought the gentleman into great notice until the ladies retired
after that i observed that mr gulpidge and mr henry spiker who had hitherto been very distant entered into a defensive alliance against us the common enemy and exchanged a mysterious dialogue across the table for our defeat and overthrow
that affair of the first bond for four thousand five hundred pounds has not taken the course that was expected spiker said mr gulpidge
do you mean the d of as said mr spiker
the c of bs said mr gulpidge
mr spiker raised his eyebrows and looked much concerned
when the question was referred to lordi neednt name him said mr gulpidge checking himself i understand said mr spiker n mr gulpidge darkly noddedwas referred to him his answer was money or no release lord bless my soul cried mr spiker
money or no release repeated mr gulpidge firmly
the next in reversionyou understand me k said mr spiker with an ominous look
k then positively refused to sign
he was attended at newmarket for that purpose and he pointblank refused to do it mr spiker was so interested that he became quite stony
so the matter rests at this hour said mr gulpidge throwing himself back in his chair
our friend waterbrook will excuse me if i forbear to explain myself generally on account of the magnitude of the interests involved mr waterbrook was only too happy as it appeared to me to have such interests and such names even hinted at across his table
he assumed an expression of gloomy intelligence though i am persuaded he knew no more about the discussion than i did and highly approved of the discretion that had been observed
mr spiker after the receipt of such a confidence naturally desired to favour his friend with a confidence of his own therefore the foregoing dialogue was succeeded by another in which it was mr gulpidges turn to be surprised and that by another in which the surprise came round to mr spikers turn again and so on turn and turn about
all this time we the outsiders remained oppressed by the tremendous interests involved in the conversation and our host regarded us with pride as the victims of a salutary awe and astonishment
i was very glad indeed to get upstairs to agnes and to talk with her in a corner and to introduce traddles to her who was shy but agreeable and the same goodnatured creature still
as he was obliged to leave early on account of going away next morning for a month i had not nearly so much conversation with him as i could have wished but we exchanged addresses and promised ourselves the pleasure of another meeting when he should come back to town
he was greatly interested to hear that i knew steerforth and spoke of him with such warmth that i made him tell agnes what he thought of him
but agnes only looked at me the while and very slightly shook her head when only i observed her
as she was not among people with whom i believed she could be very much at home i was almost glad to hear that she was going away within a few days though i was sorry at the prospect of parting from her again so soon
this caused me to remain until all the company were gone
conversing with her and hearing her sing was such a delightful reminder to me of my happy life in the grave old house she had made so beautiful that i could have remained there half the night but having no excuse for staying any longer when the lights of mr waterbrooks society were all snuffed out i took my leave very much against my inclination
i felt then more than ever that she was my better angel and if i thought of her sweet face and placid smile as though they had shone on me from some removed being like an angel i hope i thought no harm
i have said that the company were all gone but i ought to have excepted uriah whom i dont include in that denomination and who had never ceased to hover near us
he was close behind me when i went downstairs
he was close beside me when i walked away from the house slowly fitting his long skeleton fingers into the still longer fingers of a great guy fawkes pair of gloves
it was in no disposition for uriahs company but in remembrance of the entreaty agnes had made to me that i asked him if he would come home to my rooms and have some coffee
oh really master copperfield he rejoinedi beg your pardon mister copperfield but the other comes so natural i dont like that you should put a constraint upon yourself to ask a numble person like me to your ouse there is no constraint in the case said i
will you come i should like to very much replied uriah with a writhe
well then come along said i i could not help being rather short with him but he appeared not to mind it
we went the nearest way without conversing much upon the road and he was so humble in respect of those scarecrow gloves that he was still putting them on and seemed to have made no advance in that labour when we got to my place
i led him up the dark stairs to prevent his knocking his head against anything and really his damp cold hand felt so like a frog in mine that i was tempted to drop it and run away
agnes and hospitality prevailed however and i conducted him to my fireside
when i lighted my candles he fell into meek transports with the room that was revealed to him and when i heated the coffee in an unassuming blocktin vessel in which mrs crupp delighted to prepare it chiefly i believe because it was not intended for the purpose being a shavingpot and because there was a patent invention of great price mouldering away in the pantry he professed so much emotion that i could joyfully have scalded him
oh really master copperfieldi mean mister copperfield said uriah to see you waiting upon me is what i never could have expected
but one way and another so many things happen to me which i never could have expected i am sure in my umble station that it seems to rain blessings on my ed
you have heard something i dessay of a change in my expectations master copperfieldi should say mister copperfield as he sat on my sofa with his long knees drawn up under his coffeecup his hat and gloves upon the ground close to him his spoon going softly round and round his shadowless red eyes which looked as if they had scorched their lashes off turned towards me without looking at me the disagreeable dints i have formerly described in his nostrils coming and going with his breath and a snaky undulation pervading his frame from his chin to his boots i decided in my own mind that i disliked him intensely
it made me very uncomfortable to have him for a guest for i was young then and unused to disguise what i so strongly felt
you have heard something i dessay of a change in my expectations master copperfieldi should say mister copperfield observed uriah
yes said i something ah
i thought miss agnes would know of it he quietly returned
im glad to find miss agnes knows of it
oh thank you mastermister copperfield i could have thrown my bootjack at him it lay ready on the rug for having entrapped me into the disclosure of anything concerning agnes however immaterial
but i only drank my coffee
what a prophet you have shown yourself mister copperfield pursued uriah
dear me what a prophet you have proved yourself to be
dont you remember saying to me once that perhaps i should be a partner in mr wickfields business and perhaps it might be wickfield and heep
you may not recollect it but when a person is umble master copperfield a person treasures such things up i recollect talking about it said i though i certainly did not think it very likely then oh
who would have thought it likely mister copperfield returned uriah enthusiastically
i am sure i didnt myself
i recollect saying with my own lips that i was much too umble
so i considered myself really and truly he sat with that carved grin on his face looking at the fire as i looked at him
but the umblest persons master copperfield he presently resumed may be the instruments of good
i am glad to think i have been the instrument of good to mr wickfield and that i may be more so
oh what a worthy man he is mister copperfield but how imprudent he has been i am sorry to hear it said i i could not help adding rather pointedly on all accounts decidedly so mister copperfield replied uriah
on all accounts
miss agness above all
you dont remember your own eloquent expressions master copperfield but i remember how you said one day that everybody must admire her and how i thanked you for it
you have forgot that i have no doubt master copperfield no said i drily
oh how glad i am you have not exclaimed uriah
to think that you should be the first to kindle the sparks of ambition in my umble breast and that youve not forgot it
ohwould you excuse me asking for a cup more coffee something in the emphasis he laid upon the kindling of those sparks and something in the glance he directed at me as he said it had made me start as if i had seen him illuminated by a blaze of light
recalled by his request preferred in quite another tone of voice i did the honours of the shavingpot but i did them with an unsteadiness of hand a sudden sense of being no match for him and a perplexed suspicious anxiety as to what he might be going to say next which i felt could not escape his observation
he said nothing at all
he stirred his coffee round and round he sipped it he felt his chin softly with his grisly hand he looked at the fire he looked about the room he gasped rather than smiled at me he writhed and undulated about in his deferential servility he stirred and sipped again but he left the renewal of the conversation to me
so mr wickfield said i at last who is worth five hundred of youor me for my life i think i could not have helped dividing that part of the sentence with an awkward jerk has been imprudent has he mr heep oh very imprudent indeed master copperfield returned uriah sighing modestly
oh very much so
but i wish youd call me uriah if you please
its like old times well
uriah said i bolting it out with some difficulty
thank you he returned with fervour
thank you master copperfield
its like the blowing of old breezes or the ringing of old bellses to hear you say uriah
i beg your pardon
was i making any observation about mr wickfield i suggested
oh
yes truly said uriah
ah
great imprudence master copperfield
its a topic that i wouldnt touch upon to any soul but you
even to you i can only touch upon it and no more
if anyone else had been in my place during the last few years by this time he would have had mr wickfield oh what a worthy man he is master copperfield too
under his thumb
underhis thumb said uriah very slowly as he stretched out his cruellooking hand above my table and pressed his own thumb upon it until it shook and shook the room
if i had been obliged to look at him with him splay foot on mr wickfields head i think i could scarcely have hated him more
oh dear yes master copperfield he proceeded in a soft voice most remarkably contrasting with the action of his thumb which did not diminish its hard pressure in the least degree theres no doubt of it
there would have been loss disgrace i dont know what at all
mr wickfield knows it
i am the umble instrument of umbly serving him and he puts me on an eminence i hardly could have hoped to reach
how thankful should i be with his face turned towards me as he finished but without looking at me he took his crooked thumb off the spot where he had planted it and slowly and thoughtfully scraped his lank jaw with it as if he were shaving himself
i recollect well how indignantly my heart beat as i saw his crafty face with the appropriately red light of the fire upon it preparing for something else
master copperfield he beganbut am i keeping you up you are not keeping me up
i generally go to bed late thank you master copperfield
i have risen from my umble station since first you used to address me it is true but i am umble still
i hope i never shall be otherwise than umble
you will not think the worse of my umbleness if i make a little confidence to you master copperfield
will you oh no said i with an effort
thank you he took out his pockethandkerchief and began wiping the palms of his hands
miss agnes master copperfield well uriah oh how pleasant to be called uriah spontaneously he cried and gave himself a jerk like a convulsive fish
you thought her looking very beautiful tonight master copperfield i thought her looking as she always does superior in all respects to everyone around her i returned
oh thank you
its so true he cried
oh thank you very much for that not at all i said loftily
there is no reason why you should thank me why that master copperfield said uriah is in fact the confidence that i am going to take the liberty of reposing
umble as i am he wiped his hands harder and looked at them and at the fire by turns umble as my mother is and lowly as our poor but honest roof has ever been the image of miss agnes i dont mind trusting you with my secret master copperfield for i have always overflowed towards you since the first moment i had the pleasure of beholding you in a ponyshay has been in my breast for years
oh master copperfield with what a pure affection do i love the ground my agnes walks on i believe i had a delirious idea of seizing the redhot poker out of the fire and running him through with it
it went from me with a shock like a ball fired from a rifle but the image of agnes outraged by so much as a thought of this redheaded animals remained in my mind when i looked at him sitting all awry as if his mean soul griped his body and made me giddy
he seemed to swell and grow before my eyes the room seemed full of the echoes of his voice and the strange feeling to which perhaps no one is quite a stranger that all this had occurred before at some indefinite time and that i knew what he was going to say next took possession of me
a timely observation of the sense of power that there was in his face did more to bring back to my remembrance the entreaty of agnes in its full force than any effort i could have made
i asked him with a better appearance of composure than i could have thought possible a minute before whether he had made his feelings known to agnes
oh no master copperfield he returned oh dear no
not to anyone but you
you see i am only just emerging from my lowly station
i rest a good deal of hope on her observing how useful i am to her father for i trust to be very useful to him indeed master copperfield and how i smooth the way for him and keep him straight
shes so much attached to her father master copperfield oh what a lovely thing it is in a daughter
that i think she may come on his account to be kind to me i fathomed the depth of the rascals whole scheme and understood why he laid it bare
if youll have the goodness to keep my secret master copperfield he pursued and not in general to go against me i shall take it as a particular favour
you wouldnt wish to make unpleasantness
i know what a friendly heart youve got but having only known me on my umble footing on my umblest i should say for i am very umble still you might unbeknown go against me rather with my agnes
i call her mine you see master copperfield
theres a song that says id crowns resign to call her mine i hope to do it one of these days dear agnes
so much too loving and too good for anyone that i could think of was it possible that she was reserved to be the wife of such a wretch as this
theres no hurry at present you know master copperfield uriah proceeded in his slimy way as i sat gazing at him with this thought in my mind
my agnes is very young still and mother and me will have to work our way upwards and make a good many new arrangements before it would be quite convenient
so i shall have time gradually to make her familiar with my hopes as opportunities offer
oh im so much obliged to you for this confidence
oh its such a relief you cant think to know that you understand our situation and are certain as you wouldnt wish to make unpleasantness in the family not to go against me he took the hand which i dared not withhold and having given it a damp squeeze referred to his palefaced watch
dear me he said its past one
the moments slip away so in the confidence of old times master copperfield that its almost half past one i answered that i had thought it was later
not that i had really thought so but because my conversational powers were effectually scattered
dear me he said considering
the ouse that i am stopping ata sort of a private hotel and boarding ouse master copperfield near the new river edwill have gone to bed these two hours i am sorry i returned that there is only one bed here and that i oh dont think of mentioning beds master copperfield he rejoined ecstatically drawing up one leg
but would you have any objections to my laying down before the fire if it comes to that i said pray take my bed and ill lie down before the fire his repudiation of this offer was almost shrill enough in the excess of its surprise and humility to have penetrated to the ears of mrs crupp then sleeping i suppose in a distant chamber situated at about the level of lowwater mark soothed in her slumbers by the ticking of an incorrigible clock to which she always referred me when we had any little difference on the score of punctuality and which was never less than threequarters of an hour too slow and had always been put right in the morning by the best authorities
as no arguments i could urge in my bewildered condition had the least effect upon his modesty in inducing him to accept my bedroom i was obliged to make the best arrangements i could for his repose before the fire
the mattress of the sofa which was a great deal too short for his lank figure the sofa pillows a blanket the tablecover a clean breakfastcloth and a greatcoat made him a bed and covering for which he was more than thankful
having lent him a nightcap which he put on at once and in which he made such an awful figure that i have never worn one since i left him to his rest
i never shall forget that night
i never shall forget how i turned and tumbled how i wearied myself with thinking about agnes and this creature how i considered what could i do and what ought i to do how i could come to no other conclusion than that the best course for her peace was to do nothing and to keep to myself what i had heard
if i went to sleep for a few moments the image of agnes with her tender eyes and of her father looking fondly on her as i had so often seen him look arose before me with appealing faces and filled me with vague terrors
when i awoke the recollection that uriah was lying in the next room sat heavy on me like a waking nightmare and oppressed me with a leaden dread as if i had had some meaner quality of devil for a lodger
the poker got into my dozing thoughts besides and wouldnt come out
i thought between sleeping and waking that it was still red hot and i had snatched it out of the fire and run him through the body
i was so haunted at last by the idea though i knew there was nothing in it that i stole into the next room to look at him
there i saw him lying on his back with his legs extending to i dont know where gurglings taking place in his throat stoppages in his nose and his mouth open like a postoffice
he was so much worse in reality than in my distempered fancy that afterwards i was attracted to him in very repulsion and could not help wandering in and out every halfhour or so and taking another look at him
still the long long night seemed heavy and hopeless as ever and no promise of day was in the murky sky
when i saw him going downstairs early in the morning for thank heaven
he would not stay to breakfast it appeared to me as if the night was going away in his person
when i went out to the commons i charged mrs crupp with particular directions to leave the windows open that my sittingroom might be aired and purged of his presence
i saw no more of uriah heep until the day when agnes left town
i was at the coach office to take leave of her and see her go and there was he returning to canterbury by the same conveyance
it was some small satisfaction to me to observe his spare shortwaisted highshouldered mulberrycoloured greatcoat perched up in company with an umbrella like a small tent on the edge of the back seat on the roof while agnes was of course inside but what i underwent in my efforts to be friendly with him while agnes looked on perhaps deserved that little recompense
at the coach window as at the dinnerparty he hovered about us without a moments intermission like a great vulture gorging himself on every syllable that i said to agnes or agnes said to me
in the state of trouble into which his disclosure by my fire had thrown me i had thought very much of the words agnes had used in reference to the partnership
i did what i hope was right
feeling sure that it was necessary for papas peace that the sacrifice should be made i entreated him to make it a miserable foreboding that she would yield to and sustain herself by the same feeling in reference to any sacrifice for his sake had oppressed me ever since
i knew how she loved him
i knew what the devotion of her nature was
i knew from her own lips that she regarded herself as the innocent cause of his errors and as owing him a great debt she ardently desired to pay
i had no consolation in seeing how different she was from this detestable rufus with the mulberrycoloured greatcoat for i felt that in the very difference between them in the selfdenial of her pure soul and the sordid baseness of his the greatest danger lay
all this doubtless he knew thoroughly and had in his cunning considered well
yet i was so certain that the prospect of such a sacrifice afar off must destroy the happiness of agnes and i was so sure from her manner of its being unseen by her then and having cast no shadow on her yet that i could as soon have injured her as given her any warning of what impended
thus it was that we parted without explanation she waving her hand and smiling farewell from the coach window her evil genius writhing on the roof as if he had her in his clutches and triumphed
i could not get over this farewell glimpse of them for a long time
when agnes wrote to tell me of her safe arrival i was as miserable as when i saw her going away
whenever i fell into a thoughtful state this subject was sure to present itself and all my uneasiness was sure to be redoubled
hardly a night passed without my dreaming of it
it became a part of my life and as inseparable from my life as my own head
i had ample leisure to refine upon my uneasiness for steerforth was at oxford as he wrote to me and when i was not at the commons i was very much alone
i believe i had at this time some lurking distrust of steerforth
i wrote to him most affectionately in reply to his but i think i was glad upon the whole that he could not come to london just then
i suspect the truth to be that the influence of agnes was upon me undisturbed by the sight of him and that it was the more powerful with me because she had so large a share in my thoughts and interest
in the meantime days and weeks slipped away
i was articled to spenlow and jorkins
i had ninety pounds a year exclusive of my houserent and sundry collateral matters from my aunt
my rooms were engaged for twelve months certain and though i still found them dreary of an evening and the evenings long i could settle down into a state of equable low spirits and resign myself to coffee which i seem on looking back to have taken by the gallon at about this period of my existence
at about this time too i made three discoveries first that mrs crupp was a martyr to a curious disorder called the spazzums which was generally accompanied with inflammation of the nose and required to be constantly treated with peppermint secondly that something peculiar in the temperature of my pantry made the brandybottles burst thirdly that i was alone in the world and much given to record that circumstance in fragments of english versification
on the day when i was articled no festivity took place beyond my having sandwiches and sherry into the office for the clerks and going alone to the theatre at night
i went to see the stranger as a doctors commons sort of play and was so dreadfully cut up that i hardly knew myself in my own glass when i got home
mr spenlow remarked on this occasion when we concluded our business that he should have been happy to have seen me at his house at norwood to celebrate our becoming connected but for his domestic arrangements being in some disorder on account of the expected return of his daughter from finishing her education at paris
but he intimated that when she came home he should hope to have the pleasure of entertaining me
i knew that he was a widower with one daughter and expressed my acknowledgements
mr spenlow was as good as his word
in a week or two he referred to this engagement and said that if i would do him the favour to come down next saturday and stay till monday he would be extremely happy
of course i said i would do him the favour and he was to drive me down in his phaeton and to bring me back
when the day arrived my very carpetbag was an object of veneration to the stipendiary clerks to whom the house at norwood was a sacred mystery
one of them informed me that he had heard that mr spenlow ate entirely off plate and china and another hinted at champagne being constantly on draught after the usual custom of tablebeer
the old clerk with the wig whose name was mr tiffey had been down on business several times in the course of his career and had on each occasion penetrated to the breakfastparlour
he described it as an apartment of the most sumptuous nature and said that he had drunk brown east india sherry there of a quality so precious as to make a man wink
we had an adjourned cause in the consistory that dayabout excommunicating a baker who had been objecting in a vestry to a pavingrateand as the evidence was just twice the length of robinson crusoe according to a calculation i made it was rather late in the day before we finished
however we got him excommunicated for six weeks and sentenced in no end of costs and then the bakers proctor and the judge and the advocates on both sides who were all nearly related went out of town together and mr spenlow and i drove away in the phaeton
the phaeton was a very handsome affair the horses arched their necks and lifted up their legs as if they knew they belonged to doctors commons
there was a good deal of competition in the commons on all points of display and it turned out some very choice equipages then though i always have considered and always shall consider that in my time the great article of competition there was starch which i think was worn among the proctors to as great an extent as it is in the nature of man to bear
we were very pleasant going down and mr spenlow gave me some hints in reference to my profession
he said it was the genteelest profession in the world and must on no account be confounded with the profession of a solicitor being quite another sort of thing infinitely more exclusive less mechanical and more profitable
we took things much more easily in the commons than they could be taken anywhere else he observed and that set us as a privileged class apart
he said it was impossible to conceal the disagreeable fact that we were chiefly employed by solicitors but he gave me to understand that they were an inferior race of men universally looked down upon by all proctors of any pretensions
i asked mr spenlow what he considered the best sort of professional business
he replied that a good case of a disputed will where there was a neat little estate of thirty or forty thousand pounds was perhaps the best of all
in such a case he said not only were there very pretty pickings in the way of arguments at every stage of the proceedings and mountains upon mountains of evidence on interrogatory and counterinterrogatory to say nothing of an appeal lying first to the delegates and then to the lords but the costs being pretty sure to come out of the estate at last both sides went at it in a lively and spirited manner and expense was no consideration
then he launched into a general eulogium on the commons
what was to be particularly admired he said in the commons was its compactness
it was the most conveniently organized place in the world
it was the complete idea of snugness
it lay in a nutshell
for example you brought a divorce case or a restitution case into the consistory
very good
you tried it in the consistory
you made a quiet little round game of it among a family group and you played it out at leisure
suppose you were not satisfied with the consistory what did you do then
why you went into the arches
what was the arches
the same court in the same room with the same bar and the same practitioners but another judge for there the consistory judge could plead any courtday as an advocate
well you played your round game out again
still you were not satisfied
very good
what did you do then
why you went to the delegates
who were the delegates
why the ecclesiastical delegates were the advocates without any business who had looked on at the round game when it was playing in both courts and had seen the cards shuffled and cut and played and had talked to all the players about it and now came fresh as judges to settle the matter to the satisfaction of everybody
discontented people might talk of corruption in the commons closeness in the commons and the necessity of reforming the commons said mr spenlow solemnly in conclusion but when the price of wheat per bushel had been highest the commons had been busiest and a man might lay his hand upon his heart and say this to the whole worldtouch the commons and down comes the country i listened to all this with attention and though i must say i had my doubts whether the country was quite as much obliged to the commons as mr spenlow made out i respectfully deferred to his opinion
that about the price of wheat per bushel i modestly felt was too much for my strength and quite settled the question
i have never to this hour got the better of that bushel of wheat
it has reappeared to annihilate me all through my life in connexion with all kinds of subjects
i dont know now exactly what it has to do with me or what right it has to crush me on an infinite variety of occasions but whenever i see my old friend the bushel brought in by the head and shoulders as he always is i observe i give up a subject for lost
this is a digression
i was not the man to touch the commons and bring down the country
i submissively expressed by my silence my acquiescence in all i had heard from my superior in years and knowledge and we talked about the stranger and the drama and the pairs of horses until we came to mr spenlows gate
there was a lovely garden to mr spenlows house and though that was not the best time of the year for seeing a garden it was so beautifully kept that i was quite enchanted
there was a charming lawn there were clusters of trees and there were perspective walks that i could just distinguish in the dark arched over with trelliswork on which shrubs and flowers grew in the growing season
here miss spenlow walks by herself i thought
dear me we went into the house which was cheerfully lighted up and into a hall where there were all sorts of hats caps greatcoats plaids gloves whips and walkingsticks
where is miss dora said mr spenlow to the servant
dora i thought
what a beautiful name we turned into a room near at hand i think it was the identical breakfastroom made memorable by the brown east indian sherry and i heard a voice say mr
copperfield my daughter dora and my daughter doras confidential friend it was no doubt mr spenlows voice but i didnt know it and i didnt care whose it was
all was over in a moment
i had fulfilled my destiny
i was a captive and a slave
i loved dora spenlow to distraction
she was more than human to me
she was a fairy a sylph i dont know what she wasanything that no one ever saw and everything that everybody ever wanted
i was swallowed up in an abyss of love in an instant
there was no pausing on the brink no looking down or looking back i was gone headlong before i had sense to say a word to her
i observed a wellremembered voice when i had bowed and murmured something have seen mr copperfield before the speaker was not dora
no the confidential friend miss murdstone
i dont think i was much astonished
to the best of my judgement no capacity of astonishment was left in me
there was nothing worth mentioning in the material world but dora spenlow to be astonished about
i said how do you do miss murdstone
i hope you are well she answered very well i said how is mr murdstone she replied my brother is robust i am obliged to you mr spenlow who i suppose had been surprised to see us recognize each other then put in his word
i am glad to find he said copperfield that you and miss murdstone are already acquainted mr
copperfield and myself said miss murdstone with severe composure are connexions
we were once slightly acquainted
it was in his childish days
circumstances have separated us since
i should not have known him i replied that i should have known her anywhere
which was true enough
miss murdstone has had the goodness said mr spenlow to me to accept the officeif i may so describe itof my daughter doras confidential friend
my daughter dora having unhappily no mother miss murdstone is obliging enough to become her companion and protector a passing thought occurred to me that miss murdstone like the pocket instrument called a lifepreserver was not so much designed for purposes of protection as of assault
but as i had none but passing thoughts for any subject save dora i glanced at her directly afterwards and was thinking that i saw in her prettily pettish manner that she was not very much inclined to be particularly confidential to her companion and protector when a bell rang which mr spenlow said was the first dinnerbell and so carried me off to dress
the idea of dressing ones self or doing anything in the way of action in that state of love was a little too ridiculous
i could only sit down before my fire biting the key of my carpetbag and think of the captivating girlish brighteyed lovely dora
what a form she had what a face she had what a graceful variable enchanting manner
the bell rang again so soon that i made a mere scramble of my dressing instead of the careful operation i could have wished under the circumstances and went downstairs
there was some company
dora was talking to an old gentleman with a grey head
grey as he wasand a greatgrandfather into the bargain for he said soi was madly jealous of him
what a state of mind i was in
i was jealous of everybody
i couldnt bear the idea of anybody knowing mr spenlow better than i did
it was torturing to me to hear them talk of occurrences in which i had had no share
when a most amiable person with a highly polished bald head asked me across the dinner table if that were the first occasion of my seeing the grounds i could have done anything to him that was savage and revengeful
i dont remember who was there except dora
i have not the least idea what we had for dinner besides dora
my impression is that i dined off dora entirely and sent away halfadozen plates untouched
i sat next to her
i talked to her
she had the most delightful little voice the gayest little laugh the pleasantest and most fascinating little ways that ever led a lost youth into hopeless slavery
she was rather diminutive altogether
so much the more precious i thought
when she went out of the room with miss murdstone no other ladies were of the party i fell into a reverie only disturbed by the cruel apprehension that miss murdstone would disparage me to her
the amiable creature with the polished head told me a long story which i think was about gardening
i think i heard him say my gardener several times
i seemed to pay the deepest attention to him but i was wandering in a garden of eden all the while with dora
my apprehensions of being disparaged to the object of my engrossing affection were revived when we went into the drawingroom by the grim and distant aspect of miss murdstone
but i was relieved of them in an unexpected manner
david copperfield said miss murdstone beckoning me aside into a window
a word i confronted miss murdstone alone
david copperfield said miss murdstone i need not enlarge upon family circumstances
they are not a tempting subject far from it maam i returned
far from it assented miss murdstone
i do not wish to revive the memory of past differences or of past outrages
i have received outrages from a persona female i am sorry to say for the credit of my sexwho is not to be mentioned without scorn and disgust and therefore i would rather not mention her i felt very fiery on my aunts account but i said it would certainly be better if miss murdstone pleased not to mention her
i could not hear her disrespectfully mentioned i added without expressing my opinion in a decided tone
miss murdstone shut her eyes and disdainfully inclined her head then slowly opening her eyes resumed david copperfield i shall not attempt to disguise the fact that i formed an unfavourable opinion of you in your childhood
it may have been a mistaken one or you may have ceased to justify it
that is not in question between us now
i belong to a family remarkable i believe for some firmness and i am not the creature of circumstance or change
i may have my opinion of you
you may have your opinion of me i inclined my head in my turn
but it is not necessary said miss murdstone that these opinions should come into collision here
under existing circumstances it is as well on all accounts that they should not
as the chances of life have brought us together again and may bring us together on other occasions i would say let us meet here as distant acquaintances
family circumstances are a sufficient reason for our only meeting on that footing and it is quite unnecessary that either of us should make the other the subject of remark
do you approve of this miss murdstone i returned i think you and mr murdstone used me very cruelly and treated my mother with great unkindness
i shall always think so as long as i live
but i quite agree in what you propose miss murdstone shut her eyes again and bent her head
then just touching the back of my hand with the tips of her cold stiff fingers she walked away arranging the little fetters on her wrists and round her neck which seemed to be the same set in exactly the same state as when i had seen her last
these reminded me in reference to miss murdstones nature of the fetters over a jail door suggesting on the outside to all beholders what was to be expected within
all i know of the rest of the evening is that i heard the empress of my heart sing enchanted ballads in the french language generally to the effect that whatever was the matter we ought always to dance ta ra la ta ra la
accompanying herself on a glorified instrument resembling a guitar
that i was lost in blissful delirium
that i refused refreshment
that my soul recoiled from punch particularly
that when miss murdstone took her into custody and led her away she smiled and gave me her delicious hand
that i caught a view of myself in a mirror looking perfectly imbecile and idiotic
that i retired to bed in a most maudlin state of mind and got up in a crisis of feeble infatuation
it was a fine morning and early and i thought i would go and take a stroll down one of those wirearched walks and indulge my passion by dwelling on her image
on my way through the hall i encountered her little dog who was called jipshort for gipsy
i approached him tenderly for i loved even him but he showed his whole set of teeth got under a chair expressly to snarl and wouldnt hear of the least familiarity
the garden was cool and solitary
i walked about wondering what my feelings of happiness would be if i could ever become engaged to this dear wonder
as to marriage and fortune and all that i believe i was almost as innocently undesigning then as when i loved little emly
to be allowed to call her dora to write to her to dote upon and worship her to have reason to think that when she was with other people she was yet mindful of me seemed to me the summit of human ambitioni am sure it was the summit of mine
there is no doubt whatever that i was a lackadaisical young spooney but there was a purity of heart in all this that prevents my having quite a contemptuous recollection of it let me laugh as i may
i had not been walking long when i turned a corner and met her
i tingle again from head to foot as my recollection turns that corner and my pen shakes in my hand
youareout early miss spenlow said i
its so stupid at home she replied and miss murdstone is so absurd
she talks such nonsense about its being necessary for the day to be aired before i come out
aired she laughed here in the most melodious manner
on a sunday morning when i dont practise i must do something
so i told papa last night i must come out
besides its the brightest time of the whole day
dont you think so i hazarded a bold flight and said not without stammering that it was very bright to me then though it had been very dark to me a minute before
do you mean a compliment said dora or that the weather has really changed i stammered worse than before in replying that i meant no compliment but the plain truth though i was not aware of any change having taken place in the weather
it was in the state of my own feelings i added bashfully to clench the explanation
i never saw such curlshow could i for there never were such curlsas those she shook out to hide her blushes
as to the straw hat and blue ribbons which was on the top of the curls if i could only have hung it up in my room in buckingham street what a priceless possession it would have been
you have just come home from paris said i
yes said she
have you ever been there no oh
i hope youll go soon
you would like it so much traces of deepseated anguish appeared in my countenance
that she should hope i would go that she should think it possible i could go was insupportable
i depreciated paris i depreciated france
i said i wouldnt leave england under existing circumstances for any earthly consideration
nothing should induce me
in short she was shaking the curls again when the little dog came running along the walk to our relief
he was mortally jealous of me and persisted in barking at me
she took him up in her armsoh my goodnessand caressed him but he persisted upon barking still
he wouldnt let me touch him when i tried and then she beat him
it increased my sufferings greatly to see the pats she gave him for punishment on the bridge of his blunt nose while he winked his eyes and licked her hand and still growled within himself like a little doublebass
at length he was quietwell he might be with her dimpled chin upon his headand we walked away to look at a greenhouse
you are not very intimate with miss murdstone are you said dora
my pet the two last words were to the dog
oh if they had only been to me
no i replied
not at all so she is a tiresome creature said dora pouting
i cant think what papa can have been about when he chose such a vexatious thing to be my companion
who wants a protector
i am sure i dont want a protector
jip can protect me a great deal better than miss murdstonecant you jip dear he only winked lazily when she kissed his ball of a head
papa calls her my confidential friend but i am sure she is no such thingis she jip
we are not going to confide in any such cross people jip and i
we mean to bestow our confidence where we like and to find out our own friends instead of having them found out for usdont we jip jip made a comfortable noise in answer a little like a teakettle when it sings
as for me every word was a new heap of fetters riveted above the last
it is very hard because we have not a kind mama that we are to have instead a sulky gloomy old thing like miss murdstone always following us aboutisnt it jip
never mind jip
we wont be confidential and well make ourselves as happy as we can in spite of her and well tease her and not please herwont we jip if it had lasted any longer i think i must have gone down on my knees on the gravel with the probability before me of grazing them and of being presently ejected from the premises besides
but by good fortune the greenhouse was not far off and these words brought us to it
it contained quite a show of beautiful geraniums
we loitered along in front of them and dora often stopped to admire this one or that one and i stopped to admire the same one and dora laughing held the dog up childishly to smell the flowers and if we were not all three in fairyland certainly i was
the scent of a geranium leaf at this day strikes me with a half comical half serious wonder as to what change has come over me in a moment and then i see a straw hat and blue ribbons and a quantity of curls and a little black dog being held up in two slender arms against a bank of blossoms and bright leaves
miss murdstone had been looking for us
she found us here and presented her uncongenial cheek the little wrinkles in it filled with hair powder to dora to be kissed
then she took doras arm in hers and marched us into breakfast as if it were a soldiers funeral
how many cups of tea i drank because dora made it i dont know
but i perfectly remember that i sat swilling tea until my whole nervous system if i had had any in those days must have gone by the board
by and by we went to church
miss murdstone was between dora and me in the pew but i heard her sing and the congregation vanished
a sermon was deliveredabout dora of courseand i am afraid that is all i know of the service
we had a quiet day
no company a walk a family dinner of four and an evening of looking over books and pictures miss murdstone with a homily before her and her eye upon us keeping guard vigilantly
ah
little did mr spenlow imagine when he sat opposite to me after dinner that day with his pockethandkerchief over his head how fervently i was embracing him in my fancy as his soninlaw
little did he think when i took leave of him at night that he had just given his full consent to my being engaged to dora and that i was invoking blessings on his head
we departed early in the morning for we had a salvage case coming on in the admiralty court requiring a rather accurate knowledge of the whole science of navigation in which as we couldnt be expected to know much about those matters in the commons the judge had entreated two old trinity masters for charitys sake to come and help him out
dora was at the breakfasttable to make the tea again however and i had the melancholy pleasure of taking off my hat to her in the phaeton as she stood on the doorstep with jip in her arms
what the admiralty was to me that day what nonsense i made of our case in my mind as i listened to it how i saw dora engraved upon the blade of the silver oar which they lay upon the table as the emblem of that high jurisdiction and how i felt when mr spenlow went home without me i had had an insane hope that he might take me back again as if i were a mariner myself and the ship to which i belonged had sailed away and left me on a desert island i shall make no fruitless effort to describe
if that sleepy old court could rouse itself and present in any visible form the daydreams i have had in it about dora it would reveal my truth
i dont mean the dreams that i dreamed on that day alone but day after day from week to week and term to term
i went there not to attend to what was going on but to think about dora
if ever i bestowed a thought upon the cases as they dragged their slow length before me it was only to wonder in the matrimonial cases remembering dora how it was that married people could ever be otherwise than happy and in the prerogative cases to consider if the money in question had been left to me what were the foremost steps i should immediately have taken in regard to dora
within the first week of my passion i bought four sumptuous waistcoatsnot for myself i had no pride in them for doraand took to wearing strawcoloured kid gloves in the streets and laid the foundations of all the corns i have ever had
if the boots i wore at that period could only be produced and compared with the natural size of my feet they would show what the state of my heart was in a most affecting manner
and yet wretched cripple as i made myself by this act of homage to dora i walked miles upon miles daily in the hope of seeing her
not only was i soon as well known on the norwood road as the postmen on that beat but i pervaded london likewise
i walked about the streets where the best shops for ladies were i haunted the bazaar like an unquiet spirit i fagged through the park again and again long after i was quite knocked up
sometimes at long intervals and on rare occasions i saw her
perhaps i saw her glove waved in a carriage window perhaps i met her walked with her and miss murdstone a little way and spoke to her
in the latter case i was always very miserable afterwards to think that i had said nothing to the purpose or that she had no idea of the extent of my devotion or that she cared nothing about me
i was always looking out as may be supposed for another invitation to mr spenlows house
i was always being disappointed for i got none
mrs crupp must have been a woman of penetration for when this attachment was but a few weeks old and i had not had the courage to write more explicitly even to agnes than that i had been to mr spenlows house whose family i added consists of one daughteri say mrs crupp must have been a woman of penetration for even in that early stage she found it out
she came up to me one evening when i was very low to ask she being then afflicted with the disorder i have mentioned if i could oblige her with a little tincture of cardamums mixed with rhubarb and flavoured with seven drops of the essence of cloves which was the best remedy for her complaintor if i had not such a thing by me with a little brandy which was the next best
it was not she remarked so palatable to her but it was the next best
as i had never even heard of the first remedy and always had the second in the closet i gave mrs crupp a glass of the second which that i might have no suspicion of its being devoted to any improper use she began to take in my presence
cheer up sir said mrs crupp
i cant abear to see you so sir im a mother myself i did not quite perceive the application of this fact to myself but i smiled on mrs crupp as benignly as was in my power
come sir said mrs crupp
excuse me
i know what it is sir
theres a lady in the case mrs
crupp i returned reddening
oh bless you
keep a good heart sir said mrs crupp nodding encouragement
never say die sir
if she dont smile upon you theres a many as will
you are a young gentleman to be smiled on mr copperfull and you must learn your walue sir mrs crupp always called me mr copperfull firstly no doubt because it was not my name and secondly i am inclined to think in some indistinct association with a washingday
what makes you suppose there is any young lady in the case mrs crupp said i
mr
copperfull said mrs crupp with a great deal of feeling im a mother myself for some time mrs crupp could only lay her hand upon her nankeen bosom and fortify herself against returning pain with sips of her medicine
at length she spoke again
when the present set were took for you by your dear aunt mr copperfull said mrs crupp my remark were i had now found summun i could care for
thank evin were the expression i have now found summun i can care foryou dont eat enough sir nor yet drink is that what you found your supposition on mrs crupp said i
sir said mrs crupp in a tone approaching to severity ive laundressed other young gentlemen besides yourself
a young gentleman may be overcareful of himself or he may be undercareful of himself
he may brush his hair too regular or too unregular
he may wear his boots much too large for him or much too small
that is according as the young gentleman has his original character formed
but let him go to which extreme he may sir theres a young lady in both of em mrs crupp shook her head in such a determined manner that i had not an inch of vantageground left
it was but the gentleman which died here before yourself said mrs crupp that fell in lovewith a barmaidand had his waistcoats took in directly though much swelled by drinking mrs
crupp said i i must beg you not to connect the young lady in my case with a barmaid or anything of that sort if you please mr
copperfull returned mrs crupp im a mother myself and not likely
i ask your pardon sir if i intrude
i should never wish to intrude where i were not welcome
but you are a young gentleman mr copperfull and my adwice to you is to cheer up sir to keep a good heart and to know your own walue
if you was to take to something sir said mrs crupp if you was to take to skittles now which is healthy you might find it divert your mind and do you good with these words mrs crupp affecting to be very careful of the brandywhich was all gonethanked me with a majestic curtsey and retired
as her figure disappeared into the gloom of the entry this counsel certainly presented itself to my mind in the light of a slight liberty on mrs crupps part but at the same time i was content to receive it in another point of view as a word to the wise and a warning in future to keep my secret better
it may have been in consequence of mrs crupps advice and perhaps for no better reason than because there was a certain similarity in the sound of the word skittles and traddles that it came into my head next day to go and look after traddles
the time he had mentioned was more than out and he lived in a little street near the veterinary college at camden town which was principally tenanted as one of our clerks who lived in that direction informed me by gentlemen students who bought live donkeys and made experiments on those quadrupeds in their private apartments
having obtained from this clerk a direction to the academic grove in question i set out the same afternoon to visit my old schoolfellow
i found that the street was not as desirable a one as i could have wished it to be for the sake of traddles
the inhabitants appeared to have a propensity to throw any little trifles they were not in want of into the road which not only made it rank and sloppy but untidy too on account of the cabbageleaves
the refuse was not wholly vegetable either for i myself saw a shoe a doubledup saucepan a black bonnet and an umbrella in various stages of decomposition as i was looking out for the number i wanted
the general air of the place reminded me forcibly of the days when i lived with mr and mrs micawber
an indescribable character of faded gentility that attached to the house i sought and made it unlike all the other houses in the streetthough they were all built on one monotonous pattern and looked like the early copies of a blundering boy who was learning to make houses and had not yet got out of his cramped brickandmortar pothooksreminded me still more of mr and mrs micawber
happening to arrive at the door as it was opened to the afternoon milkman i was reminded of mr and mrs micawber more forcibly yet
now said the milkman to a very youthful servant girl
has that there little bill of mine been heerd on oh master says hell attend to it immediate was the reply
because said the milkman going on as if he had received no answer and speaking as i judged from his tone rather for the edification of somebody within the house than of the youthful servantan impression which was strengthened by his manner of glaring down the passagebecause that there little bill has been running so long that i begin to believe its run away altogether and never wont be heerd of
now im not a going to stand it you know said the milkman still throwing his voice into the house and glaring down the passage
as to his dealing in the mild article of milk by the by there never was a greater anomaly
his deportment would have been fierce in a butcher or a brandymerchant
the voice of the youthful servant became faint but she seemed to me from the action of her lips again to murmur that it would be attended to immediate
i tell you what said the milkman looking hard at her for the first time and taking her by the chin are you fond of milk yes i likes it she replied
good said the milkman
then you wont have none tomorrow
dye hear
not a fragment of milk you wont have tomorrow i thought she seemed upon the whole relieved by the prospect of having any today
the milkman after shaking his head at her darkly released her chin and with anything rather than goodwill opened his can and deposited the usual quantity in the family jug
this done he went away muttering and uttered the cry of his trade next door in a vindictive shriek
does mr traddles live here i then inquired
a mysterious voice from the end of the passage replied yes upon which the youthful servant replied yes is he at home said i
again the mysterious voice replied in the affirmative and again the servant echoed it
upon this i walked in and in pursuance of the servants directions walked upstairs conscious as i passed the back parlourdoor that i was surveyed by a mysterious eye probably belonging to the mysterious voice
when i got to the top of the stairsthe house was only a story high above the ground floortraddles was on the landing to meet me
he was delighted to see me and gave me welcome with great heartiness to his little room
it was in the front of the house and extremely neat though sparely furnished
it was his only room i saw for there was a sofabedstead in it and his blackingbrushes and blacking were among his bookson the top shelf behind a dictionary
his table was covered with papers and he was hard at work in an old coat
i looked at nothing that i know of but i saw everything even to the prospect of a church upon his china inkstand as i sat downand this too was a faculty confirmed in me in the old micawber times
various ingenious arrangements he had made for the disguise of his chest of drawers and the accommodation of his boots his shavingglass and so forth particularly impressed themselves upon me as evidences of the same traddles who used to make models of elephants dens in writingpaper to put flies in and to comfort himself under ill usage with the memorable works of art i have so often mentioned
in a corner of the room was something neatly covered up with a large white cloth
i could not make out what that was
traddles said i shaking hands with him again after i had sat down i am delighted to see you i am delighted to see you copperfield he returned
i am very glad indeed to see you
it was because i was thoroughly glad to see you when we met in ely place and was sure you were thoroughly glad to see me that i gave you this address instead of my address at chambers oh
you have chambers said i
why i have the fourth of a room and a passage and the fourth of a clerk returned traddles
three others and myself unite to have a set of chambersto look businesslikeand we quarter the clerk too
halfacrown a week he costs me his old simple character and good temper and something of his old unlucky fortune also i thought smiled at me in the smile with which he made this explanation
its not because i have the least pride copperfield you understand said traddles that i dont usually give my address here
its only on account of those who come to me who might not like to come here
for myself i am fighting my way on in the world against difficulties and it would be ridiculous if i made a pretence of doing anything else you are reading for the bar mr waterbrook informed me said i
why yes said traddles rubbing his hands slowly over one another
i am reading for the bar
the fact is i have just begun to keep my terms after rather a long delay
its some time since i was articled but the payment of that hundred pounds was a great pull
a great pull said traddles with a wince as if he had had a tooth out
do you know what i cant help thinking of traddles as i sit here looking at you i asked him
no said he
that skyblue suit you used to wear lord to be sure cried traddles laughing
tight in the arms and legs you know
dear me
well
those were happy times werent they i think our schoolmaster might have made them happier without doing any harm to any of us i acknowledge i returned
perhaps he might said traddles
but dear me there was a good deal of fun going on
do you remember the nights in the bedroom
when we used to have the suppers
and when you used to tell the stories
ha ha ha
and do you remember when i got caned for crying about mr mell
old creakle
i should like to see him again too he was a brute to you traddles said i indignantly for his good humour made me feel as if i had seen him beaten but yesterday
do you think so returned traddles
really
perhaps he was rather
but its all over a long while
old creakle you were brought up by an uncle then said i
of course i was said traddles
the one i was always going to write to
and always didnt eh
ha ha ha
yes i had an uncle then
he died soon after i left school indeed yes
he was a retiredwhat do you call itdraperclothmerchantand had made me his heir
but he didnt like me when i grew up do you really mean that said i
he was so composed that i fancied he must have some other meaning
oh dear yes copperfield
i mean it replied traddles
it was an unfortunate thing but he didnt like me at all
he said i wasnt at all what he expected and so he married his housekeeper and what did you do i asked
i didnt do anything in particular said traddles
i lived with them waiting to be put out in the world until his gout unfortunately flew to his stomachand so he died and so she married a young man and so i wasnt provided for did you get nothing traddles after all oh dear yes said traddles
i got fifty pounds
i had never been brought up to any profession and at first i was at a loss what to do for myself
however i began with the assistance of the son of a professional man who had been to salem houseyawler with his nose on one side
do you recollect him no
he had not been there with me all the noses were straight in my day
it dont matter said traddles
i began by means of his assistance to copy law writings
that didnt answer very well and then i began to state cases for them and make abstracts and that sort of work
for i am a plodding kind of fellow copperfield and had learnt the way of doing such things pithily
well
that put it in my head to enter myself as a law student and that ran away with all that was left of the fifty pounds
yawler recommended me to one or two other offices howevermr waterbrooks for oneand i got a good many jobs
i was fortunate enough too to become acquainted with a person in the publishing way who was getting up an encyclopaedia and he set me to work and indeed glancing at his table i am at work for him at this minute
i am not a bad compiler copperfield said traddles preserving the same air of cheerful confidence in all he said but i have no invention at all not a particle
i suppose there never was a young man with less originality than i have as traddles seemed to expect that i should assent to this as a matter of course i nodded and he went on with the same sprightly patiencei can find no better expressionas before
so by little and little and not living high i managed to scrape up the hundred pounds at last said traddles and thank heaven thats paidthough it wasthough it certainly was said traddles wincing again as if he had had another tooth out a pull
i am living by the sort of work i have mentioned still and i hope one of these days to get connected with some newspaper which would almost be the making of my fortune
now copperfield you are so exactly what you used to be with that agreeable face and its so pleasant to see you that i shant conceal anything
therefore you must know that i am engaged engaged
oh dora
she is a curates daughter said traddles one of ten down in devonshire
yes for he saw me glance involuntarily at the prospect on the inkstand
thats the church
you come round here to the left out of this gate tracing his finger along the inkstand and exactly where i hold this pen there stands the housefacing you understand towards the church the delight with which he entered into these particulars did not fully present itself to me until afterwards for my selfish thoughts were making a groundplan of mr spenlows house and garden at the same moment
she is such a dear girl said traddles a little older than me but the dearest girl
i told you i was going out of town
i have been down there
i walked there and i walked back and i had the most delightful time
i dare say ours is likely to be a rather long engagement but our motto is wait and hope we always say that
wait and hope we always say
and she would wait copperfield till she was sixtyany age you can mentionfor me traddles rose from his chair and with a triumphant smile put his hand upon the white cloth i had observed
however he said its not that we havent made a beginning towards housekeeping
no no we have begun
we must get on by degrees but we have begun
here drawing the cloth off with great pride and care are two pieces of furniture to commence with
this flowerpot and stand she bought herself
you put that in a parlour window said traddles falling a little back from it to survey it with the greater admiration with a plant in it andand there you are
this little round table with the marble top its two feet ten in circumference i bought
you want to lay a book down you know or somebody comes to see you or your wife and wants a place to stand a cup of tea upon andand there you are again said traddles
its an admirable piece of workmanshipfirm as a rock i praised them both highly and traddles replaced the covering as carefully as he had removed it
its not a great deal towards the furnishing said traddles but its something
the tablecloths and pillowcases and articles of that kind are what discourage me most copperfield
so does the ironmongerycandleboxes and gridirons and that sort of necessariesbecause those things tell and mount up
however wait and hope and i assure you shes the dearest girl i am quite certain of it said i
in the meantime said traddles coming back to his chair and this is the end of my prosing about myself i get on as well as i can
i dont make much but i dont spend much
in general i board with the people downstairs who are very agreeable people indeed
both mr and mrs micawber have seen a good deal of life and are excellent company my dear traddles i quickly exclaimed
what are you talking about traddles looked at me as if he wondered what i was talking about
mr
and mrs micawber i repeated
why i am intimately acquainted with them an opportune double knock at the door which i knew well from old experience in windsor terrace and which nobody but mr micawber could ever have knocked at that door resolved any doubt in my mind as to their being my old friends
i begged traddles to ask his landlord to walk up
traddles accordingly did so over the banister and mr micawber not a bit changedhis tights his stick his shirtcollar and his eyeglass all the same as evercame into the room with a genteel and youthful air
i beg your pardon mr traddles said mr micawber with the old roll in his voice as he checked himself in humming a soft tune
i was not aware that there was any individual alien to this tenement in your sanctum mr micawber slightly bowed to me and pulled up his shirtcollar
how do you do mr micawber said i
sir said mr micawber you are exceedingly obliging
i am in statu quo and mrs micawber i pursued
sir said mr micawber she is also thank god in statu quo and the children mr micawber sir said mr micawber i rejoice to reply that they are likewise in the enjoyment of salubrity all this time mr micawber had not known me in the least though he had stood face to face with me
but now seeing me smile he examined my features with more attention fell back cried is it possible
have i the pleasure of again beholding copperfield and shook me by both hands with the utmost fervour
good heaven mr traddles said mr micawber to think that i should find you acquainted with the friend of my youth the companion of earlier days
my dear calling over the banisters to mrs micawber while traddles looked with reason not a little amazed at this description of me
here is a gentleman in mr traddless apartment whom he wishes to have the pleasure of presenting to you my love mr micawber immediately reappeared and shook hands with me again
and how is our good friend the doctor copperfield said mr micawber and all the circle at canterbury i have none but good accounts of them said i
i am most delighted to hear it said mr micawber
it was at canterbury where we last met
within the shadow i may figuratively say of that religious edifice immortalized by chaucer which was anciently the resort of pilgrims from the remotest corners ofin short said mr micawber in the immediate neighbourhood of the cathedral i replied that it was
mr micawber continued talking as volubly as he could but not i thought without showing by some marks of concern in his countenance that he was sensible of sounds in the next room as of mrs micawber washing her hands and hurriedly opening and shutting drawers that were uneasy in their action
you find us copperfield said mr micawber with one eye on traddles at present established on what may be designated as a small and unassuming scale but you are aware that i have in the course of my career surmounted difficulties and conquered obstacles
you are no stranger to the fact that there have been periods of my life when it has been requisite that i should pause until certain expected events should turn up when it has been necessary that i should fall back before making what i trust i shall not be accused of presumption in terminga spring
the present is one of those momentous stages in the life of man
you find me fallen back for a spring and i have every reason to believe that a vigorous leap will shortly be the result i was expressing my satisfaction when mrs micawber came in a little more slatternly than she used to be or so she seemed now to my unaccustomed eyes but still with some preparation of herself for company and with a pair of brown gloves on
my dear said mr micawber leading her towards me here is a gentleman of the name of copperfield who wishes to renew his acquaintance with you it would have been better as it turned out to have led gently up to this announcement for mrs micawber being in a delicate state of health was overcome by it and was taken so unwell that mr micawber was obliged in great trepidation to run down to the waterbutt in the backyard and draw a basinful to lave her brow with
she presently revived however and was really pleased to see me
we had halfanhours talk all together and i asked her about the twins who she said were grown great creatures and after master and miss micawber whom she described as absolute giants but they were not produced on that occasion
mr micawber was very anxious that i should stay to dinner
i should not have been averse to do so but that i imagined i detected trouble and calculation relative to the extent of the cold meat in mrs micawbers eye
i therefore pleaded another engagement and observing that mrs micawbers spirits were immediately lightened i resisted all persuasion to forego it
but i told traddles and mr and mrs micawber that before i could think of leaving they must appoint a day when they would come and dine with me
the occupations to which traddles stood pledged rendered it necessary to fix a somewhat distant one but an appointment was made for the purpose that suited us all and then i took my leave
mr micawber under pretence of showing me a nearer way than that by which i had come accompanied me to the corner of the street being anxious he explained to me to say a few words to an old friend in confidence
my dear copperfield said mr micawber i need hardly tell you that to have beneath our roof under existing circumstances a mind like that which gleamsif i may be allowed the expressionwhich gleamsin your friend traddles is an unspeakable comfort
with a washerwoman who exposes hardbake for sale in her parlourwindow dwelling next door and a bowstreet officer residing over the way you may imagine that his society is a source of consolation to myself and to mrs micawber
i am at present my dear copperfield engaged in the sale of corn upon commission
it is not an avocation of a remunerative descriptionin other words it does not payand some temporary embarrassments of a pecuniary nature have been the consequence
i am however delighted to add that i have now an immediate prospect of something turning up i am not at liberty to say in what direction which i trust will enable me to provide permanently both for myself and for your friend traddles in whom i have an unaffected interest
you may perhaps be prepared to hear that mrs micawber is in a state of health which renders it not wholly improbable that an addition may be ultimately made to those pledges of affection whichin short to the infantine group
mrs micawbers family have been so good as to express their dissatisfaction at this state of things
i have merely to observe that i am not aware that it is any business of theirs and that i repel that exhibition of feeling with scorn and with defiance mr micawber then shook hands with me again and left me
until the day arrived on which i was to entertain my newlyfound old friends i lived principally on dora and coffee
in my lovelorn condition my appetite languished and i was glad of it for i felt as though it would have been an act of perfidy towards dora to have a natural relish for my dinner
the quantity of walking exercise i took was not in this respect attended with its usual consequence as the disappointment counteracted the fresh air
i have my doubts too founded on the acute experience acquired at this period of my life whether a sound enjoyment of animal food can develop itself freely in any human subject who is always in torment from tight boots
i think the extremities require to be at peace before the stomach will conduct itself with vigour
on the occasion of this domestic little party i did not repeat my former extensive preparations
i merely provided a pair of soles a small leg of mutton and a pigeonpie
mrs crupp broke out into rebellion on my first bashful hint in reference to the cooking of the fish and joint and said with a dignified sense of injury no
no sir
you will not ask me sich a thing for you are better acquainted with me than to suppose me capable of doing what i cannot do with ampial satisfaction to my own feelings but in the end a compromise was effected and mrs crupp consented to achieve this feat on condition that i dined from home for a fortnight afterwards
and here i may remark that what i underwent from mrs crupp in consequence of the tyranny she established over me was dreadful
i never was so much afraid of anyone
we made a compromise of everything
if i hesitated she was taken with that wonderful disorder which was always lying in ambush in her system ready at the shortest notice to prey upon her vitals
if i rang the bell impatiently after halfadozen unavailing modest pulls and she appeared at lastwhich was not by any means to be relied uponshe would appear with a reproachful aspect sink breathless on a chair near the door lay her hand upon her nankeen bosom and become so ill that i was glad at any sacrifice of brandy or anything else to get rid of her
if i objected to having my bed made at five oclock in the afternoonwhich i do still think an uncomfortable arrangementone motion of her hand towards the same nankeen region of wounded sensibility was enough to make me falter an apology
in short i would have done anything in an honourable way rather than give mrs crupp offence and she was the terror of my life
i bought a secondhand dumbwaiter for this dinnerparty in preference to reengaging the handy young man against whom i had conceived a prejudice in consequence of meeting him in the strand one sunday morning in a waistcoat remarkably like one of mine which had been missing since the former occasion
the young gal was reengaged but on the stipulation that she should only bring in the dishes and then withdraw to the landingplace beyond the outer door where a habit of sniffing she had contracted would be lost upon the guests and where her retiring on the plates would be a physical impossibility
having laid in the materials for a bowl of punch to be compounded by mr micawber having provided a bottle of lavenderwater two waxcandles a paper of mixed pins and a pincushion to assist mrs micawber in her toilette at my dressingtable having also caused the fire in my bedroom to be lighted for mrs micawbers convenience and having laid the cloth with my own hands i awaited the result with composure
at the appointed time my three visitors arrived together
mr micawber with more shirtcollar than usual and a new ribbon to his eyeglass mrs micawber with her cap in a whiteybrown paper parcel traddles carrying the parcel and supporting mrs micawber on his arm
they were all delighted with my residence
when i conducted mrs micawber to my dressingtable and she saw the scale on which it was prepared for her she was in such raptures that she called mr micawber to come in and look
my dear copperfield said mr micawber this is luxurious
this is a way of life which reminds me of the period when i was myself in a state of celibacy and mrs micawber had not yet been solicited to plight her faith at the hymeneal altar he means solicited by him mr copperfield said mrs micawber archly
he cannot answer for others my dear returned mr micawber with sudden seriousness i have no desire to answer for others
i am too well aware that when in the inscrutable decrees of fate you were reserved for me it is possible you may have been reserved for one destined after a protracted struggle at length to fall a victim to pecuniary involvements of a complicated nature
i understand your allusion my love
i regret it but i can bear it micawber exclaimed mrs micawber in tears
have i deserved this
i who never have deserted you who never will desert you micawber my love said mr micawber much affected you will forgive and our old and tried friend copperfield will i am sure forgive the momentary laceration of a wounded spirit made sensitive by a recent collision with the minion of powerin other words with a ribald turncock attached to the waterworksand will pity not condemn its excesses mr micawber then embraced mrs micawber and pressed my hand leaving me to infer from this broken allusion that his domestic supply of water had been cut off that afternoon in consequence of default in the payment of the companys rates
to divert his thoughts from this melancholy subject i informed mr micawber that i relied upon him for a bowl of punch and led him to the lemons
his recent despondency not to say despair was gone in a moment
i never saw a man so thoroughly enjoy himself amid the fragrance of lemonpeel and sugar the odour of burning rum and the steam of boiling water as mr micawber did that afternoon
it was wonderful to see his face shining at us out of a thin cloud of these delicate fumes as he stirred and mixed and tasted and looked as if he were making instead of punch a fortune for his family down to the latest posterity
as to mrs micawber i dont know whether it was the effect of the cap or the lavenderwater or the pins or the fire or the waxcandles but she came out of my room comparatively speaking lovely
and the lark was never gayer than that excellent woman
i supposei never ventured to inquire but i supposethat mrs crupp after frying the soles was taken ill because we broke down at that point
the leg of mutton came up very red within and very pale without besides having a foreign substance of a gritty nature sprinkled over it as if if had had a fall into the ashes of that remarkable kitchen fireplace
but we were not in condition to judge of this fact from the appearance of the gravy forasmuch as the young gal had dropped it all upon the stairswhere it remained by the by in a long train until it was worn out
the pigeonpie was not bad but it was a delusive pie the crust being like a disappointing head phrenologically speaking full of lumps and bumps with nothing particular underneath
in short the banquet was such a failure that i should have been quite unhappyabout the failure i mean for i was always unhappy about doraif i had not been relieved by the great good humour of my company and by a bright suggestion from mr micawber
my dear friend copperfield said mr micawber accidents will occur in the bestregulated families and in families not regulated by that pervading influence which sanctifies while it enhances theai would say in short by the influence of woman in the lofty character of wife they may be expected with confidence and must be borne with philosophy
if you will allow me to take the liberty of remarking that there are few comestibles better in their way than a devil and that i believe with a little division of labour we could accomplish a good one if the young person in attendance could produce a gridiron i would put it to you that this little misfortune may be easily repaired there was a gridiron in the pantry on which my morning rasher of bacon was cooked
we had it in in a twinkling and immediately applied ourselves to carrying mr micawbers idea into effect
the division of labour to which he had referred was thistraddles cut the mutton into slices mr micawber who could do anything of this sort to perfection covered them with pepper mustard salt and cayenne i put them on the gridiron turned them with a fork and took them off under mr micawbers direction and mrs micawber heated and continually stirred some mushroom ketchup in a little saucepan
when we had slices enough done to begin upon we fellto with our sleeves still tucked up at the wrist more slices sputtering and blazing on the fire and our attention divided between the mutton on our plates and the mutton then preparing
what with the novelty of this cookery the excellence of it the bustle of it the frequent starting up to look after it the frequent sitting down to dispose of it as the crisp slices came off the gridiron hot and hot the being so busy so flushed with the fire so amused and in the midst of such a tempting noise and savour we reduced the leg of mutton to the bone
my own appetite came back miraculously
i am ashamed to record it but i really believe i forgot dora for a little while
i am satisfied that mr and mrs micawber could not have enjoyed the feast more if they had sold a bed to provide it
traddles laughed as heartily almost the whole time as he ate and worked
indeed we all did all at once and i dare say there was never a greater success
we were at the height of our enjoyment and were all busily engaged in our several departments endeavouring to bring the last batch of slices to a state of perfection that should crown the feast when i was aware of a strange presence in the room and my eyes encountered those of the staid littimer standing hat in hand before me
whats the matter i involuntarily asked
i beg your pardon sir i was directed to come in
is my master not here sir no have you not seen him sir no dont you come from him not immediately so sir did he tell you you would find him here not exactly so sir
but i should think he might be here tomorrow as he has not been here today is he coming up from oxford i beg sir he returned respectfully that you will be seated and allow me to do this with which he took the fork from my unresisting hand and bent over the gridiron as if his whole attention were concentrated on it
we should not have been much discomposed i dare say by the appearance of steerforth himself but we became in a moment the meekest of the meek before his respectable servingman
mr micawber humming a tune to show that he was quite at ease subsided into his chair with the handle of a hastily concealed fork sticking out of the bosom of his coat as if he had stabbed himself
mrs micawber put on her brown gloves and assumed a genteel languor
traddles ran his greasy hands through his hair and stood it bolt upright and stared in confusion on the tablecloth
as for me i was a mere infant at the head of my own table and hardly ventured to glance at the respectable phenomenon who had come from heaven knows where to put my establishment to rights
meanwhile he took the mutton off the gridiron and gravely handed it round
we all took some but our appreciation of it was gone and we merely made a show of eating it
as we severally pushed away our plates he noiselessly removed them and set on the cheese
he took that off too when it was done with cleared the table piled everything on the dumbwaiter gave us our wineglasses and of his own accord wheeled the dumbwaiter into the pantry
all this was done in a perfect manner and he never raised his eyes from what he was about
yet his very elbows when he had his back towards me seemed to teem with the expression of his fixed opinion that i was extremely young
can i do anything more sir i thanked him and said no but would he take no dinner himself
none i am obliged to you sir is mr steerforth coming from oxford i beg your pardon sir is mr steerforth coming from oxford i should imagine that he might be here tomorrow sir
i rather thought he might have been here today sir
the mistake is mine no doubt sir if you should see him first said i
if youll excuse me sir i dont think i shall see him first in case you do said i pray say that i am sorry he was not here today as an old schoolfellow of his was here indeed sir and he divided a bow between me and traddles with a glance at the latter
he was moving softly to the door when in a forlorn hope of saying something naturallywhich i never could to this mani said oh
littimer sir did you remain long at yarmouth that time not particularly so sir you saw the boat completed yes sir
i remained behind on purpose to see the boat completed i know he raised his eyes to mine respectfully
mr
steerforth has not seen it yet i suppose i really cant say sir
i thinkbut i really cant say sir
i wish you good night sir he comprehended everybody present in the respectful bow with which he followed these words and disappeared
my visitors seemed to breathe more freely when he was gone but my own relief was very great for besides the constraint arising from that extraordinary sense of being at a disadvantage which i always had in this mans presence my conscience had embarrassed me with whispers that i had mistrusted his master and i could not repress a vague uneasy dread that he might find it out
how was it having so little in reality to conceal that i always did feel as if this man were finding me out
mr micawber roused me from this reflection which was blended with a certain remorseful apprehension of seeing steerforth himself by bestowing many encomiums on the absent littimer as a most respectable fellow and a thoroughly admirable servant
mr micawber i may remark had taken his full share of the general bow and had received it with infinite condescension
but punch my dear copperfield said mr micawber tasting it like time and tide waits for no man
ah
it is at the present moment in high flavour
my love will you give me your opinion mrs micawber pronounced it excellent
then i will drink said mr micawber if my friend copperfield will permit me to take that social liberty to the days when my friend copperfield and myself were younger and fought our way in the world side by side
i may say of myself and copperfield in words we have sung together before now that we twa hae run about the braes and pud the gowans fine in a figurative point of viewon several occasions
i am not exactly aware said mr micawber with the old roll in his voice and the old indescribable air of saying something genteel what gowans may be but i have no doubt that copperfield and myself would frequently have taken a pull at them if it had been feasible mr micawber at the then present moment took a pull at his punch
so we all did traddles evidently lost in wondering at what distant time mr micawber and i could have been comrades in the battle of the world
ahem said mr micawber clearing his throat and warming with the punch and with the fire
my dear another glass mrs micawber said it must be very little but we couldnt allow that so it was a glassful
as we are quite confidential here mr copperfield said mrs micawber sipping her punch mr
traddles being a part of our domesticity i should much like to have your opinion on mr micawbers prospects
for corn said mrs micawber argumentatively as i have repeatedly said to mr micawber may be gentlemanly but it is not remunerative
commission to the extent of two and ninepence in a fortnight cannot however limited our ideas be considered remunerative we were all agreed upon that
then said mrs micawber who prided herself on taking a clear view of things and keeping mr micawber straight by her womans wisdom when he might otherwise go a little crooked then i ask myself this question
if corn is not to be relied upon what is
are coals to be relied upon
not at all
we have turned our attention to that experiment on the suggestion of my family and we find it fallacious mr micawber leaning back in his chair with his hands in his pockets eyed us aside and nodded his head as much as to say that the case was very clearly put
the articles of corn and coals said mrs micawber still more argumentatively being equally out of the question mr copperfield i naturally look round the world and say what is there in which a person of mr micawbers talent is likely to succeed and i exclude the doing anything on commission because commission is not a certainty
what is best suited to a person of mr micawbers peculiar temperament is i am convinced a certainty traddles and i both expressed by a feeling murmur that this great discovery was no doubt true of mr micawber and that it did him much credit
i will not conceal from you my dear mr copperfield said mrs micawber that i have long felt the brewing business to be particularly adapted to mr micawber
look at barclay and perkins
look at truman hanbury and buxton
it is on that extensive footing that mr micawber i know from my own knowledge of him is calculated to shine and the profits i am told are enormous
but if mr micawber cannot get into those firmswhich decline to answer his letters when he offers his services even in an inferior capacitywhat is the use of dwelling upon that idea
none
i may have a conviction that mr micawbers manners hem
really my dear interposed mr micawber
my love be silent said mrs micawber laying her brown glove on his hand
i may have a conviction mr copperfield that mr micawbers manners peculiarly qualify him for the banking business
i may argue within myself that if i had a deposit at a bankinghouse the manners of mr micawber as representing that bankinghouse would inspire confidence and must extend the connexion
but if the various bankinghouses refuse to avail themselves of mr micawbers abilities or receive the offer of them with contumely what is the use of dwelling upon that idea
none
as to originating a bankingbusiness i may know that there are members of my family who if they chose to place their money in mr micawbers hands might found an establishment of that description
but if they do not choose to place their money in mr micawbers handswhich they dontwhat is the use of that
again i contend that we are no farther advanced than we were before i shook my head and said not a bit traddles also shook his head and said not a bit what do i deduce from this mrs micawber went on to say still with the same air of putting a case lucidly
what is the conclusion my dear mr copperfield to which i am irresistibly brought
am i wrong in saying it is clear that we must live i answered not at all and traddles answered not at all and i found myself afterwards sagely adding alone that a person must either live or die
just so returned mrs micawber it is precisely that
and the fact is my dear mr copperfield that we can not live without something widely different from existing circumstances shortly turning up
now i am convinced myself and this i have pointed out to mr micawber several times of late that things cannot be expected to turn up of themselves
we must in a measure assist to turn them up
i may be wrong but i have formed that opinion both traddles and i applauded it highly
very well said mrs micawber
then what do i recommend
here is mr micawber with a variety of qualificationswith great talent really my love said mr micawber
pray my dear allow me to conclude
here is mr micawber with a variety of qualifications with great talenti should say with genius but that may be the partiality of a wife traddles and i both murmured no and here is mr micawber without any suitable position or employment
where does that responsibility rest
clearly on society
then i would make a fact so disgraceful known and boldly challenge society to set it right
it appears to me my dear mr copperfield said mrs micawber forcibly that what mr micawber has to do is to throw down the gauntlet to society and say in effect show me who will take that up
let the party immediately step forward i ventured to ask mrs micawber how this was to be done
by advertising said mrs micawberin all the papers
it appears to me that what mr micawber has to do in justice to himself in justice to his family and i will even go so far as to say in justice to society by which he has been hitherto overlooked is to advertise in all the papers to describe himself plainly as soandso with such and such qualifications and to put it thus now employ me on remunerative terms and address postpaid to w m post office camden town this idea of mrs micawbers my dear copperfield said mr micawber making his shirtcollar meet in front of his chin and glancing at me sideways is in fact the leap to which i alluded when i last had the pleasure of seeing you advertising is rather expensive i remarked dubiously
exactly so said mrs micawber preserving the same logical air
quite true my dear mr copperfield
i have made the identical observation to mr micawber
it is for that reason especially that i think mr micawber ought as i have already said in justice to himself in justice to his family and in justice to society to raise a certain sum of moneyon a bill mr micawber leaning back in his chair trifled with his eyeglass and cast his eyes up at the ceiling but i thought him observant of traddles too who was looking at the fire
if no member of my family said mrs micawber is possessed of sufficient natural feeling to negotiate that billi believe there is a better businessterm to express what i mean mr micawber with his eyes still cast up at the ceiling suggested discount to discount that bill said mrs micawber then my opinion is that mr micawber should go into the city should take that bill into the money market and should dispose of it for what he can get
if the individuals in the money market oblige mr micawber to sustain a great sacrifice that is between themselves and their consciences
i view it steadily as an investment
i recommend mr micawber my dear mr copperfield to do the same to regard it as an investment which is sure of return and to make up his mind to any sacrifice i felt but i am sure i dont know why that this was selfdenying and devoted in mrs micawber and i uttered a murmur to that effect
traddles who took his tone from me did likewise still looking at the fire
i will not said mrs micawber finishing her punch and gathering her scarf about her shoulders preparatory to her withdrawal to my bedroom i will not protract these remarks on the subject of mr micawbers pecuniary affairs
at your fireside my dear mr copperfield and in the presence of mr traddles who though not so old a friend is quite one of ourselves i could not refrain from making you acquainted with the course i advise mr micawber to take
i feel that the time is arrived when mr micawber should exert himself andi will addassert himself and it appears to me that these are the means
i am aware that i am merely a female and that a masculine judgement is usually considered more competent to the discussion of such questions still i must not forget that when i lived at home with my papa and mama my papa was in the habit of saying emmas form is fragile but her grasp of a subject is inferior to none that my papa was too partial i well know but that he was an observer of character in some degree my duty and my reason equally forbid me to doubt with these words and resisting our entreaties that she would grace the remaining circulation of the punch with her presence mrs micawber retired to my bedroom
and really i felt that she was a noble womanthe sort of woman who might have been a roman matron and done all manner of heroic things in times of public trouble
in the fervour of this impression i congratulated mr micawber on the treasure he possessed
so did traddles
mr micawber extended his hand to each of us in succession and then covered his face with his pockethandkerchief which i think had more snuff upon it than he was aware of
he then returned to the punch in the highest state of exhilaration
he was full of eloquence
he gave us to understand that in our children we lived again and that under the pressure of pecuniary difficulties any accession to their number was doubly welcome
he said that mrs micawber had latterly had her doubts on this point but that he had dispelled them and reassured her
as to her family they were totally unworthy of her and their sentiments were utterly indifferent to him and they mighti quote his own expressiongo to the devil
mr micawber then delivered a warm eulogy on traddles
he said traddless was a character to the steady virtues of which he mr micawber could lay no claim but which he thanked heaven he could admire
he feelingly alluded to the young lady unknown whom traddles had honoured with his affection and who had reciprocated that affection by honouring and blessing traddles with her affection
mr micawber pledged her
so did i traddles thanked us both by saying with a simplicity and honesty i had sense enough to be quite charmed with i am very much obliged to you indeed
and i do assure you shes the dearest girl mr micawber took an early opportunity after that of hinting with the utmost delicacy and ceremony at the state of my affections
nothing but the serious assurance of his friend copperfield to the contrary he observed could deprive him of the impression that his friend copperfield loved and was beloved
after feeling very hot and uncomfortable for some time and after a good deal of blushing stammering and denying i said having my glass in my hand well
i would give them d which so excited and gratified mr micawber that he ran with a glass of punch into my bedroom in order that mrs micawber might drink d who drank it with enthusiasm crying from within in a shrill voice hear hear
my dear mr copperfield i am delighted
hear and tapping at the wall by way of applause
our conversation afterwards took a more worldly turn mr micawber telling us that he found camden town inconvenient and that the first thing he contemplated doing when the advertisement should have been the cause of something satisfactory turning up was to move
he mentioned a terrace at the western end of oxford street fronting hyde park on which he had always had his eye but which he did not expect to attain immediately as it would require a large establishment
there would probably be an interval he explained in which he should content himself with the upper part of a house over some respectable place of businesssay in piccadillywhich would be a cheerful situation for mrs micawber and where by throwing out a bowwindow or carrying up the roof another story or making some little alteration of that sort they might live comfortably and reputably for a few years
whatever was reserved for him he expressly said or wherever his abode might be we might rely on thisthere would always be a room for traddles and a knife and fork for me
we acknowledged his kindness and he begged us to forgive his having launched into these practical and businesslike details and to excuse it as natural in one who was making entirely new arrangements in life
mrs micawber tapping at the wall again to know if tea were ready broke up this particular phase of our friendly conversation
she made tea for us in a most agreeable manner and whenever i went near her in handing about the teacups and breadandbutter asked me in a whisper whether d was fair or dark or whether she was short or tall or something of that kind which i think i liked
after tea we discussed a variety of topics before the fire and mrs micawber was good enough to sing us in a small thin flat voice which i remembered to have considered when i first knew her the very tablebeer of acoustics the favourite ballads of the dashing white sergeant and little tafflin
for both of these songs mrs micawber had been famous when she lived at home with her papa and mama
mr micawber told us that when he heard her sing the first one on the first occasion of his seeing her beneath the parental roof she had attracted his attention in an extraordinary degree but that when it came to little tafflin he had resolved to win that woman or perish in the attempt
it was between ten and eleven oclock when mrs micawber rose to replace her cap in the whiteybrown paper parcel and to put on her bonnet
mr micawber took the opportunity of traddles putting on his greatcoat to slip a letter into my hand with a whispered request that i would read it at my leisure
i also took the opportunity of my holding a candle over the banisters to light them down when mr micawber was going first leading mrs micawber and traddles was following with the cap to detain traddles for a moment on the top of the stairs
traddles said i mr
micawber dont mean any harm poor fellow but if i were you i wouldnt lend him anything my dear copperfield returned traddles smiling i havent got anything to lend you have got a name you know said i
oh
you call that something to lend returned traddles with a thoughtful look
certainly oh said traddles
yes to be sure
i am very much obliged to you copperfield buti am afraid i have lent him that already for the bill that is to be a certain investment i inquired
no said traddles
not for that one
this is the first i have heard of that one
i have been thinking that he will most likely propose that one on the way home
mines another i hope there will be nothing wrong about it said i
i hope not said traddles
i should think not though because he told me only the other day that it was provided for
that was mr micawbers expression provided for mr micawber looking up at this juncture to where we were standing i had only time to repeat my caution
traddles thanked me and descended
but i was much afraid when i observed the goodnatured manner in which he went down with the cap in his hand and gave mrs micawber his arm that he would be carried into the money market neck and heels
i returned to my fireside and was musing half gravely and half laughing on the character of mr micawber and the old relations between us when i heard a quick step ascending the stairs
at first i thought it was traddles coming back for something mrs micawber had left behind but as the step approached i knew it and felt my heart beat high and the blood rush to my face for it was steerforths
i was never unmindful of agnes and she never left that sanctuary in my thoughtsif i may call it sowhere i had placed her from the first
but when he entered and stood before me with his hand out the darkness that had fallen on him changed to light and i felt confounded and ashamed of having doubted one i loved so heartily
i loved her none the less i thought of her as the same benignant gentle angel in my life i reproached myself not her with having done him an injury and i would have made him any atonement if i had known what to make and how to make it
why daisy old boy dumbfoundered laughed steerforth shaking my hand heartily and throwing it gaily away
have i detected you in another feast you sybarite
these doctors commons fellows are the gayest men in town i believe and beat us sober oxford people all to nothing his bright glance went merrily round the room as he took the seat on the sofa opposite to me which mrs micawber had recently vacated and stirred the fire into a blaze
i was so surprised at first said i giving him welcome with all the cordiality i felt that i had hardly breath to greet you with steerforth well the sight of me is good for sore eyes as the scotch say replied steerforth and so is the sight of you daisy in full bloom
how are you my bacchanal i am very well said i and not at all bacchanalian tonight though i confess to another party of three all of whom i met in the street talking loud in your praise returned steerforth
whos our friend in the tights i gave him the best idea i could in a few words of mr micawber
he laughed heartily at my feeble portrait of that gentleman and said he was a man to know and he must know him
but who do you suppose our other friend is said i in my turn
heaven knows said steerforth
not a bore i hope
i thought he looked a little like one traddles i replied triumphantly
whos he asked steerforth in his careless way
dont you remember traddles
traddles in our room at salem house oh
that fellow said steerforth beating a lump of coal on the top of the fire with the poker
is he as soft as ever
and where the deuce did you pick him up i extolled traddles in reply as highly as i could for i felt that steerforth rather slighted him
steerforth dismissing the subject with a light nod and a smile and the remark that he would be glad to see the old fellow too for he had always been an odd fish inquired if i could give him anything to eat
during most of this short dialogue when he had not been speaking in a wild vivacious manner he had sat idly beating on the lump of coal with the poker
i observed that he did the same thing while i was getting out the remains of the pigeonpie and so forth
why daisy heres a supper for a king he exclaimed starting out of his silence with a burst and taking his seat at the table
i shall do it justice for i have come from yarmouth i thought you came from oxford i returned
not i said steerforth
i have been seafaringbetter employed littimer was here today to inquire for you i remarked and i understood him that you were at oxford though now i think of it he certainly did not say so littimer is a greater fool than i thought him to have been inquiring for me at all said steerforth jovially pouring out a glass of wine and drinking to me
as to understanding him you are a cleverer fellow than most of us daisy if you can do that thats true indeed said i moving my chair to the table
so you have been at yarmouth steerforth interested to know all about it
have you been there long no he returned
an escapade of a week or so and how are they all
of course little emily is not married yet not yet
going to be i believein so many weeks or months or something or other
i have not seen much of em
by the by he laid down his knife and fork which he had been using with great diligence and began feeling in his pockets i have a letter for you from whom why from your old nurse he returned taking some papers out of his breast pocket
j
steerforth esquire debtor to the willing mind thats not it
patience and well find it presently
old whatshisnames in a bad way and its about that i believe barkis do you mean yes still feeling in his pockets and looking over their contents its all over with poor barkis i am afraid
i saw a little apothecary theresurgeon or whatever he iswho brought your worship into the world
he was mighty learned about the case to me but the upshot of his opinion was that the carrier was making his last journey rather fastput your hand into the breast pocket of my greatcoat on the chair yonder and i think youll find the letter
is it there here it is said i
thats right it was from peggotty something less legible than usual and brief
it informed me of her husbands hopeless state and hinted at his being a little nearer than heretofore and consequently more difficult to manage for his own comfort
it said nothing of her weariness and watching and praised him highly
it was written with a plain unaffected homely piety that i knew to be genuine and ended with my duty to my ever darlingmeaning myself
while i deciphered it steerforth continued to eat and drink
its a bad job he said when i had done but the sun sets every day and people die every minute and we mustnt be scared by the common lot
if we failed to hold our own because that equal foot at all mens doors was heard knocking somewhere every object in this world would slip from us
no
ride on
roughshod if need be smoothshod if that will do but ride on
ride on over all obstacles and win the race and win what race said i
the race that one has started in said he
ride on i noticed i remember as he paused looking at me with his handsome head a little thrown back and his glass raised in his hand that though the freshness of the seawind was on his face and it was ruddy there were traces in it made since i last saw it as if he had applied himself to some habitual strain of the fervent energy which when roused was so passionately roused within him
i had it in my thoughts to remonstrate with him upon his desperate way of pursuing any fancy that he tooksuch as this buffeting of rough seas and braving of hard weather for examplewhen my mind glanced off to the immediate subject of our conversation again and pursued that instead
i tell you what steerforth said i if your high spirits will listen to me they are potent spirits and will do whatever you like he answered moving from the table to the fireside again
then i tell you what steerforth
i think i will go down and see my old nurse
it is not that i can do her any good or render her any real service but she is so attached to me that my visit will have as much effect on her as if i could do both
she will take it so kindly that it will be a comfort and support to her
it is no great effort to make i am sure for such a friend as she has been to me
wouldnt you go a days journey if you were in my place his face was thoughtful and he sat considering a little before he answered in a low voice well
go
you can do no harm you have just come back said i and it would be in vain to ask you to go with me quite he returned
i am for highgate tonight
i have not seen my mother this long time and it lies upon my conscience for its something to be loved as she loves her prodigal sonbah
nonsenseyou mean to go tomorrow i suppose he said holding me out at arms length with a hand on each of my shoulders
yes i think so well then dont go till next day
i wanted you to come and stay a few days with us
here i am on purpose to bid you and you fly off to yarmouth you are a nice fellow to talk of flying off steerforth who are always running wild on some unknown expedition or other he looked at me for a moment without speaking and then rejoined still holding me as before and giving me a shake come
say the next day and pass as much of tomorrow as you can with us
who knows when we may meet again else
come
say the next day
i want you to stand between rosa dartle and me and keep us asunder would you love each other too much without me yes or hate laughed steerforth no matter which
come
say the next day i said the next day and he put on his greatcoat and lighted his cigar and set off to walk home
finding him in this intention i put on my own greatcoat but did not light my own cigar having had enough of that for one while and walked with him as far as the open road a dull road then at night
he was in great spirits all the way and when we parted and i looked after him going so gallantly and airily homeward i thought of his saying ride on over all obstacles and win the race and wished for the first time that he had some worthy race to run
i was undressing in my own room when mr micawbers letter tumbled on the floor
thus reminded of it i broke the seal and read as follows
it was dated an hour and a half before dinner
i am not sure whether i have mentioned that when mr micawber was at any particularly desperate crisis he used a sort of legal phraseology which he seemed to think equivalent to winding up his affairs
sirfor i dare not say my dear copperfield it is expedient that i should inform you that the undersigned is crushed
some flickering efforts to spare you the premature knowledge of his calamitous position you may observe in him this day but hope has sunk beneath the horizon and the undersigned is crushed
the present communication is penned within the personal range i cannot call it the society of an individual in a state closely bordering on intoxication employed by a broker
that individual is in legal possession of the premises under a distress for rent
his inventory includes not only the chattels and effects of every description belonging to the undersigned as yearly tenant of this habitation but also those appertaining to mr thomas traddles lodger a member of the honourable society of the inner temple
if any drop of gloom were wanting in the overflowing cup which is now commended in the language of an immortal writer to the lips of the undersigned it would be found in the fact that a friendly acceptance granted to the undersigned by the beforementioned mr thomas traddles for the sum of l s d is over due and is not provided for
also in the fact that the living responsibilities clinging to the undersigned will in the course of nature be increased by the sum of one more helpless victim whose miserable appearance may be looked forin round numbersat the expiration of a period not exceeding six lunar months from the present date
after premising thus much it would be a work of supererogation to add that dust and ashes are for ever scattered on the head of wilkins micawber poor traddles
i knew enough of mr micawber by this time to foresee that he might be expected to recover the blow but my nights rest was sorely distressed by thoughts of traddles and of the curates daughter who was one of ten down in devonshire and who was such a dear girl and who would wait for traddles ominous praise
until she was sixty or any age that could be mentioned
i mentioned to mr spenlow in the morning that i wanted leave of absence for a short time and as i was not in the receipt of any salary and consequently was not obnoxious to the implacable jorkins there was no difficulty about it
i took that opportunity with my voice sticking in my throat and my sight failing as i uttered the words to express my hope that miss spenlow was quite well to which mr spenlow replied with no more emotion than if he had been speaking of an ordinary human being that he was much obliged to me and she was very well
we articled clerks as germs of the patrician order of proctors were treated with so much consideration that i was almost my own master at all times
as i did not care however to get to highgate before one or two oclock in the day and as we had another little excommunication case in court that morning which was called the office of the judge promoted by tipkins against bullock for his souls correction i passed an hour or two in attendance on it with mr spenlow very agreeably
it arose out of a scuffle between two churchwardens one of whom was alleged to have pushed the other against a pump the handle of which pump projecting into a schoolhouse which schoolhouse was under a gable of the churchroof made the push an ecclesiastical offence
it was an amusing case and sent me up to highgate on the box of the stagecoach thinking about the commons and what mr spenlow had said about touching the commons and bringing down the country
mrs steerforth was pleased to see me and so was rosa dartle
i was agreeably surprised to find that littimer was not there and that we were attended by a modest little parlourmaid with blue ribbons in her cap whose eye it was much more pleasant and much less disconcerting to catch by accident than the eye of that respectable man
but what i particularly observed before i had been halfanhour in the house was the close and attentive watch miss dartle kept upon me and the lurking manner in which she seemed to compare my face with steerforths and steerforths with mine and to lie in wait for something to come out between the two
so surely as i looked towards her did i see that eager visage with its gaunt black eyes and searching brow intent on mine or passing suddenly from mine to steerforths or comprehending both of us at once
in this lynxlike scrutiny she was so far from faltering when she saw i observed it that at such a time she only fixed her piercing look upon me with a more intent expression still
blameless as i was and knew that i was in reference to any wrong she could possibly suspect me of i shrunk before her strange eyes quite unable to endure their hungry lustre
all day she seemed to pervade the whole house
if i talked to steerforth in his room i heard her dress rustle in the little gallery outside
when he and i engaged in some of our old exercises on the lawn behind the house i saw her face pass from window to window like a wandering light until it fixed itself in one and watched us
when we all four went out walking in the afternoon she closed her thin hand on my arm like a spring to keep me back while steerforth and his mother went on out of hearing and then spoke to me
you have been a long time she said without coming here
is your profession really so engaging and interesting as to absorb your whole attention
i ask because i always want to be informed when i am ignorant
is it really though i replied that i liked it well enough but that i certainly could not claim so much for it
oh
i am glad to know that because i always like to be put right when i am wrong said rosa dartle
you mean it is a little dry perhaps well i replied perhaps it was a little dry oh
and thats a reason why you want relief and changeexcitement and all that said she
ah
very true
but isnt it a littleehfor him i dont mean you a quick glance of her eye towards the spot where steerforth was walking with his mother leaning on his arm showed me whom she meant but beyond that i was quite lost
and i looked so i have no doubt
dont iti dont say that it does mind i want to knowdont it rather engross him
dont it make him perhaps a little more remiss than usual in his visits to his blindlydotingeh with another quick glance at them and such a glance at me as seemed to look into my innermost thoughts
miss dartle i returned pray do not think i dont she said
oh dear me dont suppose that i think anything
i am not suspicious
i only ask a question
i dont state any opinion
i want to found an opinion on what you tell me
then its not so
well
i am very glad to know it it certainly is not the fact said i perplexed that i am accountable for steerforths having been away from home longer than usualif he has been which i really dont know at this moment unless i understand it from you
i have not seen him this long while until last night no indeed miss dartle no as she looked full at me i saw her face grow sharper and paler and the marks of the old wound lengthen out until it cut through the disfigured lip and deep into the nether lip and slanted down the face
there was something positively awful to me in this and in the brightness of her eyes as she said looking fixedly at me what is he doing i repeated the words more to myself than her being so amazed
what is he doing she said with an eagerness that seemed enough to consume her like a fire
in what is that man assisting him who never looks at me without an inscrutable falsehood in his eyes
if you are honourable and faithful i dont ask you to betray your friend
i ask you only to tell me is it anger is it hatred is it pride is it restlessness is it some wild fancy is it love what is it that is leading him miss dartle i returned how shall i tell you so that you will believe me that i know of nothing in steerforth different from what there was when i first came here
i can think of nothing
i firmly believe there is nothing
i hardly understand even what you mean as she still stood looking fixedly at me a twitching or throbbing from which i could not dissociate the idea of pain came into that cruel mark and lifted up the corner of her lip as if with scorn or with a pity that despised its object
she put her hand upon it hurriedlya hand so thin and delicate that when i had seen her hold it up before the fire to shade her face i had compared it in my thoughts to fine porcelainand saying in a quick fierce passionate way i swear you to secrecy about this said not a word more
mrs steerforth was particularly happy in her sons society and steerforth was on this occasion particularly attentive and respectful to her
it was very interesting to me to see them together not only on account of their mutual affection but because of the strong personal resemblance between them and the manner in which what was haughty or impetuous in him was softened by age and sex in her to a gracious dignity
i thought more than once that it was well no serious cause of division had ever come between them or two such naturesi ought rather to express it two such shades of the same naturemight have been harder to reconcile than the two extremest opposites in creation
the idea did not originate in my own discernment i am bound to confess but in a speech of rosa dartles
she said at dinner oh but do tell me though somebody because i have been thinking about it all day and i want to know you want to know what rosa returned mrs steerforth
pray pray rosa do not be mysterious mysterious she cried
oh
really
do you consider me so do i constantly entreat you said mrs steerforth to speak plainly in your own natural manner oh
then this is not my natural manner she rejoined
now you must really bear with me because i ask for information
we never know ourselves it has become a second nature said mrs steerforth without any displeasure but i rememberand so must you i thinkwhen your manner was different rosa when it was not so guarded and was more trustful i am sure you are right she returned and so it is that bad habits grow upon one
really
less guarded and more trustful
how can i imperceptibly have changed i wonder
well thats very odd
i must study to regain my former self i wish you would said mrs steerforth with a smile
oh
i really will you know she answered
i will learn frankness fromlet me seefrom james you cannot learn frankness rosa said mrs steerforth quicklyfor there was always some effect of sarcasm in what rosa dartle said though it was said as this was in the most unconscious manner in the worldin a better school that i am sure of she answered with uncommon fervour
if i am sure of anything of course you know i am sure of that mrs steerforth appeared to me to regret having been a little nettled for she presently said in a kind tone well my dear rosa we have not heard what it is that you want to be satisfied about that i want to be satisfied about she replied with provoking coldness
oh
it was only whether people who are like each other in their moral constitutionis that the phrase its as good a phrase as another said steerforth
thank youwhether people who are like each other in their moral constitution are in greater danger than people not so circumstanced supposing any serious cause of variance to arise between them of being divided angrily and deeply i should say yes said steerforth
should you she retorted
dear me
supposing then for instanceany unlikely thing will do for a suppositionthat you and your mother were to have a serious quarrel my dear rosa interposed mrs steerforth laughing goodnaturedly suggest some other supposition
james and i know our duty to each other better i pray heaven oh said miss dartle nodding her head thoughtfully
to be sure
that would prevent it
why of course it would
exactly
now i am glad i have been so foolish as to put the case for it is so very good to know that your duty to each other would prevent it
thank you very much one other little circumstance connected with miss dartle i must not omit for i had reason to remember it thereafter when all the irremediable past was rendered plain
during the whole of this day but especially from this period of it steerforth exerted himself with his utmost skill and that was with his utmost ease to charm this singular creature into a pleasant and pleased companion
that he should succeed was no matter of surprise to me
that she should struggle against the fascinating influence of his delightful artdelightful nature i thought it thendid not surprise me either for i knew that she was sometimes jaundiced and perverse
i saw her features and her manner slowly change i saw her look at him with growing admiration i saw her try more and more faintly but always angrily as if she condemned a weakness in herself to resist the captivating power that he possessed and finally i saw her sharp glance soften and her smile become quite gentle and i ceased to be afraid of her as i had really been all day and we all sat about the fire talking and laughing together with as little reserve as if we had been children
whether it was because we had sat there so long or because steerforth was resolved not to lose the advantage he had gained i do not know but we did not remain in the diningroom more than five minutes after her departure
she is playing her harp said steerforth softly at the drawingroom door and nobody but my mother has heard her do that i believe these three years he said it with a curious smile which was gone directly and we went into the room and found her alone
dont get up said steerforth which she had already done my dear rosa dont
be kind for once and sing us an irish song what do you care for an irish song she returned
much said steerforth
much more than for any other
here is daisy too loves music from his soul
sing us an irish song rosa
and let me sit and listen as i used to do he did not touch her or the chair from which she had risen but sat himself near the harp
she stood beside it for some little while in a curious way going through the motion of playing it with her right hand but not sounding it
at length she sat down and drew it to her with one sudden action and played and sang
i dont know what it was in her touch or voice that made that song the most unearthly i have ever heard in my life or can imagine
there was something fearful in the reality of it
it was as if it had never been written or set to music but sprung out of passion within her which found imperfect utterance in the low sounds of her voice and crouched again when all was still
i was dumb when she leaned beside the harp again playing it but not sounding it with her right hand
a minute more and this had roused me from my trancesteerforth had left his seat and gone to her and had put his arm laughingly about her and had said come rosa for the future we will love each other very much and she had struck him and had thrown him off with the fury of a wild cat and had burst out of the room
what is the matter with rosa said mrs steerforth coming in
she has been an angel mother returned steerforth for a little while and has run into the opposite extreme since by way of compensation you should be careful not to irritate her james
her temper has been soured remember and ought not to be tried rosa did not come back and no other mention was made of her until i went with steerforth into his room to say good night
then he laughed about her and asked me if i had ever seen such a fierce little piece of incomprehensibility
i expressed as much of my astonishment as was then capable of expression and asked if he could guess what it was that she had taken so much amiss so suddenly
oh heaven knows said steerforth
anything you likeor nothing
i told you she took everything herself included to a grindstone and sharpened it
she is an edgetool and requires great care in dealing with
she is always dangerous
good night good night said i my dear steerforth
i shall be gone before you wake in the morning
good night he was unwilling to let me go and stood holding me out with a hand on each of my shoulders as he had done in my own room
daisy he said with a smilefor though thats not the name your godfathers and godmothers gave you its the name i like best to call you byand i wish i wish i wish you could give it to me why so i can if i choose said i
daisy if anything should ever separate us you must think of me at my best old boy
come
let us make that bargain
think of me at my best if circumstances should ever part us you have no best to me steerforth said i and no worst
you are always equally loved and cherished in my heart so much compunction for having ever wronged him even by a shapeless thought did i feel within me that the confession of having done so was rising to my lips
but for the reluctance i had to betray the confidence of agnes but for my uncertainty how to approach the subject with no risk of doing so it would have reached them before he said god bless you daisy and good night in my doubt it did not reach them and we shook hands and we parted
i was up with the dull dawn and having dressed as quietly as i could looked into his room
he was fast asleep lying easily with his head upon his arm as i had often seen him lie at school
the time came in its season and that was very soon when i almost wondered that nothing troubled his repose as i looked at him
but he sleptlet me think of him so againas i had often seen him sleep at school and thus in this silent hour i left him
never more oh god forgive you steerforth
to touch that passive hand in love and friendship
never never more
i got down to yarmouth in the evening and went to the inn
i knew that peggottys spare roommy roomwas likely to have occupation enough in a little while if that great visitor before whose presence all the living must give place were not already in the house so i betook myself to the inn and dined there and engaged my bed
it was ten oclock when i went out
many of the shops were shut and the town was dull
when i came to omer and jorams i found the shutters up but the shop door standing open
as i could obtain a perspective view of mr omer inside smoking his pipe by the parlour door i entered and asked him how he was
why bless my life and soul said mr omer how do you find yourself
take a seatsmoke not disagreeable i hope by no means said i
i like itin somebody elses pipe what not in your own eh mr omer returned laughing
all the better sir
bad habit for a young man
take a seat
i smoke myself for the asthma mr omer had made room for me and placed a chair
he now sat down again very much out of breath gasping at his pipe as if it contained a supply of that necessary without which he must perish
i am sorry to have heard bad news of mr barkis said i mr omer looked at me with a steady countenance and shook his head
do you know how he is tonight i asked
the very question i should have put to you sir returned mr omer but on account of delicacy
its one of the drawbacks of our line of business
when a partys ill we cant ask how the party is the difficulty had not occurred to me though i had had my apprehensions too when i went in of hearing the old tune
on its being mentioned i recognized it however and said as much
yes yes you understand said mr omer nodding his head
we dursnt do it
bless you it would be a shock that the generality of parties mightnt recover to say omer and jorams compliments and how do you find yourself this morningor this afternoonas it may be mr omer and i nodded at each other and mr omer recruited his wind by the aid of his pipe
its one of the things that cut the trade off from attentions they could often wish to show said mr omer
take myself
if i have known barkis a year to move to as he went by i have known him forty years
but i cant go and say how is he i felt it was rather hard on mr omer and i told him so
im not more selfinterested i hope than another man said mr omer
look at me
my wind may fail me at any moment and it aint likely that to my own knowledge id be selfinterested under such circumstances
i say it aint likely in a man who knows his wind will go when it does go as if a pair of bellows was cut open and that man a grandfather said mr omer
i said not at all it aint that i complain of my line of business said mr omer
it aint that
some good and some bad goes no doubt to all callings
what i wish is that parties was brought up strongerminded mr omer with a very complacent and amiable face took several puffs in silence and then said resuming his first point accordingly were obleeged in ascertaining how barkis goes on to limit ourselves to emly
she knows what our real objects are and she dont have any more alarms or suspicions about us than if we was so many lambs
minnie and joram have just stepped down to the house in fact shes there after hours helping her aunt a bit to ask her how he is tonight and if you was to please to wait till they come back theyd give you full particlers
will you take something
a glass of srub and water now
i smoke on srub and water myself said mr omer taking up his glass because its considered softening to the passages by which this troublesome breath of mine gets into action
but lord bless you said mr omer huskily it aint the passages thats out of order
give me breath enough said i to my daughter minnie and ill find passages my dear he really had no breath to spare and it was very alarming to see him laugh
when he was again in a condition to be talked to i thanked him for the proffered refreshment which i declined as i had just had dinner and observing that i would wait since he was so good as to invite me until his daughter and his soninlaw came back i inquired how little emily was
well sir said mr omer removing his pipe that he might rub his chin i tell you truly i shall be glad when her marriage has taken place why so i inquired
well shes unsettled at present said mr omer
it aint that shes not as pretty as ever for shes prettieri do assure you she is prettier
it aint that she dont work as well as ever for she does
she was worth any six and she is worth any six
but somehow she wants heart
if you understand said mr omer after rubbing his chin again and smoking a little what i mean in a general way by the expression a long pull and a strong pull and a pull altogether my hearties hurrah i should say to you that that wasin a general waywhat i miss in emly mr omers face and manner went for so much that i could conscientiously nod my head as divining his meaning
my quickness of apprehension seemed to please him and he went on now i consider this is principally on account of her being in an unsettled state you see
we have talked it over a good deal her uncle and myself and her sweetheart and myself after business and i consider it is principally on account of her being unsettled
you must always recollect of emly said mr omer shaking his head gently that shes a most extraordinary affectionate little thing
the proverb says you cant make a silk purse out of a sows ear well i dont know about that
i rather think you may if you begin early in life
she has made a home out of that old boat sir that stone and marble couldnt beat i am sure she has said i
to see the clinging of that pretty little thing to her uncle said mr omer to see the way she holds on to him tighter and tighter and closer and closer every day is to see a sight
now you know theres a struggle going on when thats the case
why should it be made a longer one than is needful i listened attentively to the good old fellow and acquiesced with all my heart in what he said
therefore i mentioned to them said mr omer in a comfortable easygoing tone this
i said now dont consider emly nailed down in point of time at all
make it your own time
her services have been more valuable than was supposed her learning has been quicker than was supposed omer and joram can run their pen through what remains and shes free when you wish
if she likes to make any little arrangement afterwards in the way of doing any little thing for us at home very well
if she dont very well still
were no losers anyhow fordont you see said mr omer touching me with his pipe it aint likely that a man so short of breath as myself and a grandfather too would go and strain points with a little bit of a blueeyed blossom like her not at all i am certain said i
not at all
youre right said mr omer
well sir her cousinyou know its a cousin shes going to be married to oh yes i replied
i know him well of course you do said mr omer
well sir
her cousin being as it appears in good work and well to do thanked me in a very manly sort of manner for this conducting himself altogether i must say in a way that gives me a high opinion of him and went and took as comfortable a little house as you or i could wish to clap eyes on
that little house is now furnished right through as neat and complete as a dolls parlour and but for barkiss illness having taken this bad turn poor fellow they would have been man and wifei dare say by this time
as it is theres a postponement and emily mr omer i inquired
has she become more settled why that you know he returned rubbing his double chin again cant naturally be expected
the prospect of the change and separation and all that is as one may say close to her and far away from her both at once
barkiss death neednt put it off much but his lingering might
anyway its an uncertain state of matters you see i see said i
consequently pursued mr omer emlys still a little down and a little fluttered perhaps upon the whole shes more so than she was
every day she seems to get fonder and fonder of her uncle and more loth to part from all of us
a kind word from me brings the tears into her eyes and if you was to see her with my daughter minnies little girl youd never forget it
bless my heart alive said mr omer pondering how she loves that child having so favourable an opportunity it occurred to me to ask mr omer before our conversation should be interrupted by the return of his daughter and her husband whether he knew anything of martha
ah he rejoined shaking his head and looking very much dejected
no good
a sad story sir however you come to know it
i never thought there was harm in the girl
i wouldnt wish to mention it before my daughter minniefor shed take me up directlybut i never did
none of us ever did mr omer hearing his daughters footstep before i heard it touched me with his pipe and shut up one eye as a caution
she and her husband came in immediately afterwards
their report was that mr barkis was as bad as bad could be that he was quite unconscious and that mr chillip had mournfully said in the kitchen on going away just now that the college of physicians the college of surgeons and apothecaries hall if they were all called in together couldnt help him
he was past both colleges mr chillip said and the hall could only poison him
hearing this and learning that mr peggotty was there i determined to go to the house at once
i bade good night to mr omer and to mr and mrs joram and directed my steps thither with a solemn feeling which made mr barkis quite a new and different creature
my low tap at the door was answered by mr peggotty
he was not so much surprised to see me as i had expected
i remarked this in peggotty too when she came down and i have seen it since and i think in the expectation of that dread surprise all other changes and surprises dwindle into nothing
i shook hands with mr peggotty and passed into the kitchen while he softly closed the door
little emily was sitting by the fire with her hands before her face
ham was standing near her
we spoke in whispers listening between whiles for any sound in the room above
i had not thought of it on the occasion of my last visit but how strange it was to me now to miss mr barkis out of the kitchen
this is very kind of you masr davy said mr peggotty
its oncommon kind said ham
emly my dear cried mr peggotty
see here
heres masr davy come
what cheer up pretty
not a wured to masr davy there was a trembling upon her that i can see now
the coldness of her hand when i touched it i can feel yet
its only sign of animation was to shrink from mine and then she glided from the chair and creeping to the other side of her uncle bowed herself silently and trembling still upon his breast
its such a loving art said mr peggotty smoothing her rich hair with his great hard hand that it cant abear the sorrer of this
its natral in young folk masr davy when theyre new to these here trials and timid like my little birdits natral she clung the closer to him but neither lifted up her face nor spoke a word
its getting late my dear said mr peggotty and heres ham come fur to take you home
theer
go along with tother loving art
what emly
eh my pretty the sound of her voice had not reached me but he bent his head as if he listened to her and then said let you stay with your uncle
why you doent mean to ask me that
stay with your uncle moppet
when your husband thatll be so soon is here fur to take you home
now a person wouldnt think it fur to see this little thing alongside a roughweather chap like me said mr peggotty looking round at both of us with infinite pride but the sea aint more salt in it than she has fondness in her for her unclea foolish little emly emlys in the right in that masr davy said ham
lookee here
as emly wishes of it and as shes hurried and frightened like besides ill leave her till morning
let me stay too no no said mr peggotty
you doent oughta married man like youor whats as goodto take and hull away a days work
and you doent ought to watch and work both
that wont do
you go home and turn in
you aint afeerd of emly not being took good care on i know ham yielded to this persuasion and took his hat to go
even when he kissed herand i never saw him approach her but i felt that nature had given him the soul of a gentlemanshe seemed to cling closer to her uncle even to the avoidance of her chosen husband
i shut the door after him that it might cause no disturbance of the quiet that prevailed and when i turned back i found mr peggotty still talking to her
now im a going upstairs to tell your aunt as masr davys here and thatll cheer her up a bit he said
sit ye down by the fire the while my dear and warm those mortal cold hands
you doent need to be so fearsome and take on so much
what
youll go along with mewell
come along with mecome
if her uncle was turned out of house and home and forced to lay down in a dyke masr davy said mr peggotty with no less pride than before its my belief shed go along with him now
but therell be someone else soonsomeone else soon emly afterwards when i went upstairs as i passed the door of my little chamber which was dark i had an indistinct impression of her being within it cast down upon the floor
but whether it was really she or whether it was a confusion of the shadows in the room i dont know now
i had leisure to think before the kitchen fire of pretty little emilys dread of deathwhich added to what mr omer had told me i took to be the cause of her being so unlike herselfand i had leisure before peggotty came down even to think more leniently of the weakness of it as i sat counting the ticking of the clock and deepening my sense of the solemn hush around me
peggotty took me in her arms and blessed and thanked me over and over again for being such a comfort to her that was what she said in her distress
she then entreated me to come upstairs sobbing that mr barkis had always liked me and admired me that he had often talked of me before he fell into a stupor and that she believed in case of his coming to himself again he would brighten up at sight of me if he could brighten up at any earthly thing
the probability of his ever doing so appeared to me when i saw him to be very small
he was lying with his head and shoulders out of bed in an uncomfortable attitude half resting on the box which had cost him so much pain and trouble
i learned that when he was past creeping out of bed to open it and past assuring himself of its safety by means of the divining rod i had seen him use he had required to have it placed on the chair at the bedside where he had ever since embraced it night and day
his arm lay on it now
time and the world were slipping from beneath him but the box was there and the last words he had uttered were in an explanatory tone old clothes barkis my dear said peggotty almost cheerfully bending over him while her brother and i stood at the beds foot
heres my dear boymy dear boy master davy who brought us together barkis
that you sent messages by you know
wont you speak to master davy he was as mute and senseless as the box from which his form derived the only expression it had
hes a going out with the tide said mr peggotty to me behind his hand
my eyes were dim and so were mr peggottys but i repeated in a whisper with the tide people cant die along the coast said mr peggotty except when the tides pretty nigh out
they cant be born unless its pretty nigh innot properly born till flood
hes a going out with the tide
its ebb at halfarter three slack water half an hour
if he lives till it turns hell hold his own till past the flood and go out with the next tide we remained there watching him a long timehours
what mysterious influence my presence had upon him in that state of his senses i shall not pretend to say but when he at last began to wander feebly it is certain he was muttering about driving me to school
hes coming to himself said peggotty
mr peggotty touched me and whispered with much awe and reverence
they are both agoing out fast barkis my dear said peggotty
c
p barkis he cried faintly
no better woman anywhere look
heres master davy said peggotty
for he now opened his eyes
i was on the point of asking him if he knew me when he tried to stretch out his arm and said to me distinctly with a pleasant smile barkis is willin and it being low water he went out with the tide
it was not difficult for me on peggottys solicitation to resolve to stay where i was until after the remains of the poor carrier should have made their last journey to blunderstone
she had long ago bought out of her own savings a little piece of ground in our old churchyard near the grave of her sweet girl as she always called my mother and there they were to rest
in keeping peggotty company and doing all i could for her little enough at the utmost i was as grateful i rejoice to think as even now i could wish myself to have been
but i am afraid i had a supreme satisfaction of a personal and professional nature in taking charge of mr barkiss will and expounding its contents
i may claim the merit of having originated the suggestion that the will should be looked for in the box
after some search it was found in the box at the bottom of a horses nosebag wherein besides hay there was discovered an old gold watch with chain and seals which mr barkis had worn on his weddingday and which had never been seen before or since a silver tobaccostopper in the form of a leg an imitation lemon full of minute cups and saucers which i have some idea mr barkis must have purchased to present to me when i was a child and afterwards found himself unable to part with eightyseven guineas and a half in guineas and halfguineas two hundred and ten pounds in perfectly clean bank notes certain receipts for bank of england stock an old horseshoe a bad shilling a piece of camphor and an oystershell
from the circumstance of the latter article having been much polished and displaying prismatic colours on the inside i conclude that mr barkis had some general ideas about pearls which never resolved themselves into anything definite
for years and years mr barkis had carried this box on all his journeys every day
that it might the better escape notice he had invented a fiction that it belonged to mr
blackboy and was to be left with barkis till called for a fable he had elaborately written on the lid in characters now scarcely legible
he had hoarded all these years i found to good purpose
his property in money amounted to nearly three thousand pounds
of this he bequeathed the interest of one thousand to mr peggotty for his life on his decease the principal to be equally divided between peggotty little emily and me or the survivor or survivors of us share and share alike
all the rest he died possessed of he bequeathed to peggotty whom he left residuary legatee and sole executrix of that his last will and testament
i felt myself quite a proctor when i read this document aloud with all possible ceremony and set forth its provisions any number of times to those whom they concerned
i began to think there was more in the commons than i had supposed
i examined the will with the deepest attention pronounced it perfectly formal in all respects made a pencilmark or so in the margin and thought it rather extraordinary that i knew so much
in this abstruse pursuit in making an account for peggotty of all the property into which she had come in arranging all the affairs in an orderly manner and in being her referee and adviser on every point to our joint delight i passed the week before the funeral
i did not see little emily in that interval but they told me she was to be quietly married in a fortnight
i did not attend the funeral in character if i may venture to say so
i mean i was not dressed up in a black coat and a streamer to frighten the birds but i walked over to blunderstone early in the morning and was in the churchyard when it came attended only by peggotty and her brother
the mad gentleman looked on out of my little window mr chillips baby wagged its heavy head and rolled its goggle eyes at the clergyman over its nurses shoulder mr omer breathed short in the background no one else was there and it was very quiet
we walked about the churchyard for an hour after all was over and pulled some young leaves from the tree above my mothers grave
a dread falls on me here
a cloud is lowering on the distant town towards which i retraced my solitary steps
i fear to approach it
i cannot bear to think of what did come upon that memorable night of what must come again if i go on
it is no worse because i write of it
it would be no better if i stopped my most unwilling hand
it is done
nothing can undo it nothing can make it otherwise than as it was
my old nurse was to go to london with me next day on the business of the will
little emily was passing that day at mr omers
we were all to meet in the old boathouse that night
ham would bring emily at the usual hour
i would walk back at my leisure
the brother and sister would return as they had come and be expecting us when the day closed in at the fireside
i parted from them at the wicketgate where visionary strap had rested with roderick randoms knapsack in the days of yore and instead of going straight back walked a little distance on the road to lowestoft
then i turned and walked back towards yarmouth
i stayed to dine at a decent alehouse some mile or two from the ferry i have mentioned before and thus the day wore away and it was evening when i reached it
rain was falling heavily by that time and it was a wild night but there was a moon behind the clouds and it was not dark
i was soon within sight of mr peggottys house and of the light within it shining through the window
a little floundering across the sand which was heavy brought me to the door and i went in
it looked very comfortable indeed
mr peggotty had smoked his evening pipe and there were preparations for some supper by and by
the fire was bright the ashes were thrown up the locker was ready for little emily in her old place
in her own old place sat peggotty once more looking but for her dress as if she had never left it
she had fallen back already on the society of the workbox with st pauls upon the lid the yardmeasure in the cottage and the bit of waxcandle and there they all were just as if they had never been disturbed
mrs gummidge appeared to be fretting a little in her old corner and consequently looked quite natural too
youre first of the lot masr davy said mr peggotty with a happy face
doent keep in that coat sir if its wet thank you mr peggotty said i giving him my outer coat to hang up
its quite dry so tis said mr peggotty feeling my shoulders
as a chip
sit ye down sir
it aint o no use saying welcome to you but youre welcome kind and hearty thank you mr peggotty i am sure of that
well peggotty said i giving her a kiss
and how are you old woman ha ha laughed mr peggotty sitting down beside us and rubbing his hands in his sense of relief from recent trouble and in the genuine heartiness of his nature theres not a woman in the wureld siras i tell herthat need to feel more easy in her mind than her
she done her dooty by the departed and the departed knowd it and the departed done what was right by her as she done what was right by the departedandandand its all right mrs gummidge groaned
cheer up my pritty mawther said mr peggotty
but he shook his head aside at us evidently sensible of the tendency of the late occurrences to recall the memory of the old one
doent be down
cheer up for your own self ony a little bit and see if a good deal more doent come natral not to me danl returned mrs gummidge
nothinks natral to me but to be lone and lorn no no said mr peggotty soothing her sorrows
yes yes danl said mrs gummidge
i aint a person to live with them as has had money left
things go too contrary with me
i had better be a riddance why how should i ever spend it without you said mr peggotty with an air of serious remonstrance
what are you a talking on
doent i want you more now than ever i did i knowd i was never wanted before cried mrs gummidge with a pitiable whimper and now im told so
how could i expect to be wanted being so lone and lorn and so contrary mr peggotty seemed very much shocked at himself for having made a speech capable of this unfeeling construction but was prevented from replying by peggottys pulling his sleeve and shaking her head
after looking at mrs gummidge for some moments in sore distress of mind he glanced at the dutch clock rose snuffed the candle and put it in the window
theer said mr peggotty cheerily
theer we are missis gummidge mrs gummidge slightly groaned
lighted up accordin to custom
youre a wonderin what thats fur sir
well its fur our little emly
you see the path aint over light or cheerful arter dark and when im here at the hour as shes a comin home i puts the light in the winder
that you see said mr peggotty bending over me with great glee meets two objects
she says says emly theers home she says
and likewise says emly my uncles theer fur if i aint theer i never have no light showed youre a baby said peggotty very fond of him for it if she thought so
well returned mr peggotty standing with his legs pretty wide apart and rubbing his hands up and down them in his comfortable satisfaction as he looked alternately at us and at the fire
i doent know but i am
not you see to look at not azackly observed peggotty
no laughed mr peggotty not to look at but toto consider on you know
i doent care bless you
now i tell you
when i go a looking and looking about that theer pritty house of our emlys imim gormed said mr peggotty with sudden emphasistheer
i cant say moreif i doent feel as if the littlest things was her amost
i takes em up and i put em down and i touches of em as delicate as if they was our emly
so tis with her little bonnets and that
i couldnt see one on em rough used a purposenot fur the whole wureld
theres a babby fur you in the form of a great sea porkypine said mr peggotty relieving his earnestness with a roar of laughter
peggotty and i both laughed but not so loud
its my opinion you see said mr peggotty with a delighted face after some further rubbing of his legs as this is along of my havin played with her so much and made believe as we was turks and french and sharks and every wariety of forinnersbless you yes and lions and whales and i doent know what allwhen she warnt no higher than my knee

i know wery well that when im here o nights and where else should i live bless your arts whatever fortun i come into
and she aint here or i aint theer i shall put the candle in the winder and sit afore the fire pretending im expecting of her like im a doing now
theres a babby for you said mr peggotty with another roar in the form of a sea porkypine
why at the present minute when i see the candle sparkle up i says to myself shes a looking at it
emlys a coming theres a babby for you in the form of a sea porkypine
right for all that said mr peggotty stopping in his roar and smiting his hands together fur here she is it was only ham
the night should have turned more wet since i came in for he had a large souwester hat on slouched over his face
wheers emly said mr peggotty
ham made a motion with his head as if she were outside
mr peggotty took the light from the window trimmed it put it on the table and was busily stirring the fire when ham who had not moved said masr davy will you come out a minute and see what emly and me has got to show you we went out
as i passed him at the door i saw to my astonishment and fright that he was deadly pale
he pushed me hastily into the open air and closed the door upon us
only upon us two
ham
whats the matter masr davy oh for his broken heart how dreadfully he wept
i was paralysed by the sight of such grief
i dont know what i thought or what i dreaded
i could only look at him
ham
poor good fellow
for heavens sake tell me whats the matter my love masr davythe pride and hope of my arther that id have died for and would die for nowshes gone gone emlys run away
oh masr davy think how shes run away when i pray my good and gracious god to kill her her that is so dear above all things sooner than let her come to ruin and disgrace the face he turned up to the troubled sky the quivering of his clasped hands the agony of his figure remain associated with the lonely waste in my remembrance to this hour
it is always night there and he is the only object in the scene
youre a scholar he said hurriedly and know whats right and best
what am i to say indoors
how am i ever to break it to him masr davy i saw the door move and instinctively tried to hold the latch on the outside to gain a moments time
it was too late
mr peggotty thrust forth his face and never could i forget the change that came upon it when he saw us if i were to live five hundred years
i remember a great wail and cry and the women hanging about him and we all standing in the room i with a paper in my hand which ham had given me mr peggotty with his vest torn open his hair wild his face and lips quite white and blood trickling down his bosom it had sprung from his mouth i think looking fixedly at me
read it sir he said in a low shivering voice
slow please
i doent know as i can understand in the midst of the silence of death i read thus from a blotted letter when you who love me so much better than i ever have deserved even when my mind was innocent see this i shall be far away i shall be fur away he repeated slowly
stop
emly fur away
well when i leave my dear homemy dear homeoh my dear homein the morning the letter bore date on the previous night it will be never to come back unless he brings me back a lady
this will be found at night many hours after instead of me
oh if you knew how my heart is torn
if even you that i have wronged so much that never can forgive me could only know what i suffer
i am too wicked to write about myself
oh take comfort in thinking that i am so bad
oh for mercys sake tell uncle that i never loved him half so dear as now
oh dont remember how affectionate and kind you have all been to medont remember we were ever to be marriedbut try to think as if i died when i was little and was buried somewhere
pray heaven that i am going away from have compassion on my uncle
tell him that i never loved him half so dear
be his comfort
love some good girl that will be what i was once to uncle and be true to you and worthy of you and know no shame but me
god bless all
ill pray for all often on my knees
if he dont bring me back a lady and i dont pray for my own self ill pray for all
my parting love to uncle
my last tears and my last thanks for uncle that was all
he stood long after i had ceased to read still looking at me
at length i ventured to take his hand and to entreat him as well as i could to endeavour to get some command of himself
he replied i thankee sir i thankee without moving
ham spoke to him
mr peggotty was so far sensible of his affliction that he wrung his hand but otherwise he remained in the same state and no one dared to disturb him
slowly at last he moved his eyes from my face as if he were waking from a vision and cast them round the room
then he said in a low voice whos the man
i want to know his name ham glanced at me and suddenly i felt a shock that struck me back
theres a man suspected said mr peggotty
who is it masr davy implored ham
go out a bit and let me tell him what i must
you doent ought to hear it sir i felt the shock again
i sank down in a chair and tried to utter some reply but my tongue was fettered and my sight was weak
i want to know his name i heard said once more
for some time past ham faltered theres been a servant about here at odd times
theres been a genlmn too
both of em belonged to one another mr peggotty stood fixed as before but now looking at him
the servant pursued ham was seen along withour poor girllast night
hes been in hiding about here this week or over
he was thought to have gone but he was hiding
doent stay masr davy doent i felt peggottys arm round my neck but i could not have moved if the house had been about to fall upon me
a strange chay and hosses was outside town this morning on the norwich road amost afore the day broke ham went on
the servant went to it and come from it and went to it again
when he went to it again emly was nigh him
the tother was inside
hes the man for the lords love said mr peggotty falling back and putting out his hand as if to keep off what he dreaded
doent tell me his names steerforth masr davy exclaimed ham in a broken voice it aint no fault of yournand i am far from laying of it to youbut his name is steerforth and hes a damned villain mr peggotty uttered no cry and shed no tear and moved no more until he seemed to wake again all at once and pulled down his rough coat from its peg in a corner
bear a hand with this
im struck of a heap and cant do it he said impatiently
bear a hand and help me
well when somebody had done so
now give me that theer hat ham asked him whither he was going
im a going to seek my niece
im a going to seek my emly
im a going first to stave in that theer boat and sink it where i would have drownded him as im a living soul if i had had one thought of what was in him
as he sat afore me he said wildly holding out his clenched right hand as he sat afore me face to face strike me down dead but id have drownded him and thought it rightim a going to seek my niece where cried ham interposing himself before the door
anywhere
im a going to seek my niece through the wureld
im a going to find my poor niece in her shame and bring her back
no one stop me
i tell you im a going to seek my niece no no cried mrs gummidge coming between them in a fit of crying
no no danl not as you are now
seek her in a little while my lone lorn danl and thatll be but right
but not as you are now
sit ye down and give me your forgiveness for having ever been a worrit to you danlwhat have my contraries ever been to thisand let us speak a word about them times when she was first an orphan and when ham was too and when i was a poor widder woman and you took me in
itll soften your poor heart danl laying her head upon his shoulder and youll bear your sorrow better for you know the promise danl as you have done it unto one of the least of these you have done it unto meand that can never fail under this roof thats been our shelter for so many many year he was quite passive now and when i heard him crying the impulse that had been upon me to go down upon my knees and ask their pardon for the desolation i had caused and curse steerforth yielded to a better feeling
my overcharged heart found the same relief and i cried too
what is natural in me is natural in many other men i infer and so i am not afraid to write that i never had loved steerforth better than when the ties that bound me to him were broken
in the keen distress of the discovery of his unworthiness i thought more of all that was brilliant in him i softened more towards all that was good in him i did more justice to the qualities that might have made him a man of a noble nature and a great name than ever i had done in the height of my devotion to him
deeply as i felt my own unconscious part in his pollution of an honest home i believed that if i had been brought face to face with him i could not have uttered one reproach
i should have loved him so well stillthough he fascinated me no longeri should have held in so much tenderness the memory of my affection for him that i think i should have been as weak as a spiritwounded child in all but the entertainment of a thought that we could ever be reunited
that thought i never had
i felt as he had felt that all was at an end between us
what his remembrances of me were i have never knownthey were light enough perhaps and easily dismissedbut mine of him were as the remembrances of a cherished friend who was dead
yes steerforth long removed from the scenes of this poor history
my sorrow may bear involuntary witness against you at the judgement throne but my angry thoughts or my reproaches never will i know
the news of what had happened soon spread through the town insomuch that as i passed along the streets next morning i overheard the people speaking of it at their doors
many were hard upon her some few were hard upon him but towards her second father and her lover there was but one sentiment
among all kinds of people a respect for them in their distress prevailed which was full of gentleness and delicacy
the seafaring men kept apart when those two were seen early walking with slow steps on the beach and stood in knots talking compassionately among themselves
it was on the beach close down by the sea that i found them
it would have been easy to perceive that they had not slept all last night even if peggotty had failed to tell me of their still sitting just as i left them when it was broad day
they looked worn and i thought mr peggottys head was bowed in one night more than in all the years i had known him
but they were both as grave and steady as the sea itself then lying beneath a dark sky wavelessyet with a heavy roll upon it as if it breathed in its restand touched on the horizon with a strip of silvery light from the unseen sun
we have had a mort of talk sir said mr peggotty to me when we had all three walked a little while in silence of what we ought and doent ought to do
but we see our course now i happened to glance at ham then looking out to sea upon the distant light and a frightful thought came into my mindnot that his face was angry for it was not i recall nothing but an expression of stern determination in itthat if ever he encountered steerforth he would kill him
my dooty here sir said mr peggotty is done
im a going to seek my he stopped and went on in a firmer voice im a going to seek her
thats my dooty evermore he shook his head when i asked him where he would seek her and inquired if i were going to london tomorrow
i told him i had not gone today fearing to lose the chance of being of any service to him but that i was ready to go when he would
ill go along with you sir he rejoined if youre agreeable tomorrow we walked again for a while in silence
ham he presently resumed hell hold to his present work and go and live along with my sister
the old boat yonder will you desert the old boat mr peggotty i gently interposed
my station masr davy he returned aint there no longer and if ever a boat foundered since there was darkness on the face of the deep that ones gone down
but no sir no i doent mean as it should be deserted
fur from that we walked again for a while as before until he explained my wishes is sir as it shall look day and night winter and summer as it has always looked since she fust knowd it
if ever she should come a wandering back i wouldnt have the old place seem to cast her off you understand but seem to tempt her to draw nigher to t and to peep in maybe like a ghost out of the wind and rain through the old winder at the old seat by the fire
then maybe masr davy seein none but missis gummidge there she might take heart to creep in trembling and might come to be laid down in her old bed and rest her weary head where it was once so gay i could not speak to him in reply though i tried
every night said mr peggotty as reglar as the night comes the candle must be stood in its old pane of glass that if ever she should see it it may seem to say come back my child come back if ever theres a knock ham particler a soft knock arter dark at your aunts door doent you go nigh it
let it be hernot youthat sees my fallen child he walked a little in front of us and kept before us for some minutes
during this interval i glanced at ham again and observing the same expression on his face and his eyes still directed to the distant light i touched his arm
twice i called him by his name in the tone in which i might have tried to rouse a sleeper before he heeded me
when i at last inquired on what his thoughts were so bent he replied on whats afore me masr davy and over yon on the life before you do you mean he had pointed confusedly out to sea
ay masr davy
i doent rightly know how tis but from over yon there seemed to me to comethe end of it like looking at me as if he were waking but with the same determined face
what end i asked possessed by my former fear
i doent know he said thoughtfully i was calling to mind that the beginning of it all did take place hereand then the end come
but its gone
masr davy he added answering as i think my look you hant no call to be afeerd of me but im kiender muddled i dont fare to feel no matterswhich was as much as to say that he was not himself and quite confounded
mr peggotty stopping for us to join him we did so and said no more
the remembrance of this in connexion with my former thought however haunted me at intervals even until the inexorable end came at its appointed time
we insensibly approached the old boat and entered
mrs gummidge no longer moping in her especial corner was busy preparing breakfast
she took mr peggottys hat and placed his seat for him and spoke so comfortably and softly that i hardly knew her
danl my good man said she you must eat and drink and keep up your strength for without it youll do nowt
try thats a dear soul
an if i disturb you with my clicketten she meant her chattering tell me so danl and i wont when she had served us all she withdrew to the window where she sedulously employed herself in repairing some shirts and other clothes belonging to mr peggotty and neatly folding and packing them in an old oilskin bag such as sailors carry
meanwhile she continued talking in the same quiet manner all times and seasons you know danl said mrs gummidge i shall be allus here and everythink will look accordin to your wishes
im a poor scholar but i shall write to you odd times when youre away and send my letters to masr davy
maybe youll write to me too danl odd times and tell me how you fare to feel upon your lone lorn journies youll be a solitary woman heer im afeerd said mr peggotty
no no danl she returned i shant be that
doent you mind me
i shall have enough to do to keep a beein for you mrs gummidge meant a home again you come backto keep a beein here for any that may hap to come back danl
in the fine time i shall set outside the door as i used to do
if any should come nigh they shall see the old widder woman true to em a long way off what a change in mrs gummidge in a little time
she was another woman
she was so devoted she had such a quick perception of what it would be well to say and what it would be well to leave unsaid she was so forgetful of herself and so regardful of the sorrow about her that i held her in a sort of veneration
the work she did that day
there were many things to be brought up from the beach and stored in the outhouseas oars nets sails cordage spars lobsterpots bags of ballast and the like and though there was abundance of assistance rendered there being not a pair of working hands on all that shore but would have laboured hard for mr peggotty and been well paid in being asked to do it yet she persisted all day long in toiling under weights that she was quite unequal to and fagging to and fro on all sorts of unnecessary errands
as to deploring her misfortunes she appeared to have entirely lost the recollection of ever having had any
she preserved an equable cheerfulness in the midst of her sympathy which was not the least astonishing part of the change that had come over her
querulousness was out of the question
i did not even observe her voice to falter or a tear to escape from her eyes the whole day through until twilight when she and i and mr peggotty being alone together and he having fallen asleep in perfect exhaustion she broke into a halfsuppressed fit of sobbing and crying and taking me to the door said ever bless you masr davy be a friend to him poor dear then she immediately ran out of the house to wash her face in order that she might sit quietly beside him and be found at work there when he should awake
in short i left her when i went away at night the prop and staff of mr peggottys affliction and i could not meditate enough upon the lesson that i read in mrs gummidge and the new experience she unfolded to me
it was between nine and ten oclock when strolling in a melancholy manner through the town i stopped at mr omers door
mr omer had taken it so much to heart his daughter told me that he had been very low and poorly all day and had gone to bed without his pipe
a deceitful badhearted girl said mrs joram
there was no good in her ever dont say so i returned
you dont think so yes i do cried mrs joram angrily
no no said i mrs joram tossed her head endeavouring to be very stern and cross but she could not command her softer self and began to cry
i was young to be sure but i thought much the better of her for this sympathy and fancied it became her as a virtuous wife and mother very well indeed
what will she ever do sobbed minnie
where will she go
what will become of her
oh how could she be so cruel to herself and him i remembered the time when minnie was a young and pretty girl and i was glad she remembered it too so feelingly
my little minnie said mrs joram has only just now been got to sleep
even in her sleep she is sobbing for emly
all day long little minnie has cried for her and asked me over and over again whether emly was wicked
what can i say to her when emly tied a ribbon off her own neck round little minnies the last night she was here and laid her head down on the pillow beside her till she was fast asleep
the ribbons round my little minnies neck now
it ought not to be perhaps but what can i do
emly is very bad but they were fond of one another
and the child knows nothing mrs joram was so unhappy that her husband came out to take care of her
leaving them together i went home to peggottys more melancholy myself if possible than i had been yet
that good creaturei mean peggottyall untired by her late anxieties and sleepless nights was at her brothers where she meant to stay till morning
an old woman who had been employed about the house for some weeks past while peggotty had been unable to attend to it was the houses only other occupant besides myself
as i had no occasion for her services i sent her to bed by no means against her will and sat down before the kitchen fire a little while to think about all this
i was blending it with the deathbed of the late mr barkis and was driving out with the tide towards the distance at which ham had looked so singularly in the morning when i was recalled from my wanderings by a knock at the door
there was a knocker upon the door but it was not that which made the sound
the tap was from a hand and low down upon the door as if it were given by a child
it made me start as much as if it had been the knock of a footman to a person of distinction
i opened the door and at first looked down to my amazement on nothing but a great umbrella that appeared to be walking about of itself
but presently i discovered underneath it miss mowcher
i might not have been prepared to give the little creature a very kind reception if on her removing the umbrella which her utmost efforts were unable to shut up she had shown me the volatile expression of face which had made so great an impression on me at our first and last meeting
but her face as she turned it up to mine was so earnest and when i relieved her of the umbrella which would have been an inconvenient one for the irish giant she wrung her little hands in such an afflicted manner that i rather inclined towards her
miss mowcher said i after glancing up and down the empty street without distinctly knowing what i expected to see besides how do you come here
what is the matter she motioned to me with her short right arm to shut the umbrella for her and passing me hurriedly went into the kitchen
when i had closed the door and followed with the umbrella in my hand i found her sitting on the corner of the fenderit was a low iron one with two flat bars at top to stand plates uponin the shadow of the boiler swaying herself backwards and forwards and chafing her hands upon her knees like a person in pain
quite alarmed at being the only recipient of this untimely visit and the only spectator of this portentous behaviour i exclaimed again pray tell me miss mowcher what is the matter
are you ill my dear young soul returned miss mowcher squeezing her hands upon her heart one over the other
i am ill here i am very ill to think that it should come to this when i might have known it and perhaps prevented it if i hadnt been a thoughtless fool again her large bonnet very disproportionate to the figure went backwards and forwards in her swaying of her little body to and fro while a most gigantic bonnet rocked in unison with it upon the wall
i am surprised i began to see you so distressed and seriouswhen she interrupted me
yes its always so she said
they are all surprised these inconsiderate young people fairly and full grown to see any natural feeling in a little thing like me
they make a plaything of me use me for their amusement throw me away when they are tired and wonder that i feel more than a toy horse or a wooden soldier
yes yes thats the way
the old way it may be with others i returned but i do assure you it is not with me
perhaps i ought not to be at all surprised to see you as you are now i know so little of you
i said without consideration what i thought what can i do returned the little woman standing up and holding out her arms to show herself
see
what i am my father was and my sister is and my brother is
i have worked for sister and brother these many yearshard mr copperfieldall day
i must live
i do no harm
if there are people so unreflecting or so cruel as to make a jest of me what is left for me to do but to make a jest of myself them and everything
if i do so for the time whose fault is that
mine no
not miss mowchers i perceived
if i had shown myself a sensitive dwarf to your false friend pursued the little woman shaking her head at me with reproachful earnestness how much of his help or good will do you think i should ever have had
if little mowcher who had no hand young gentleman in the making of herself addressed herself to him or the like of him because of her misfortunes when do you suppose her small voice would have been heard
little mowcher would have as much need to live if she was the bitterest and dullest of pigmies but she couldnt do it
no
she might whistle for her bread and butter till she died of air miss mowcher sat down on the fender again and took out her handkerchief and wiped her eyes
be thankful for me if you have a kind heart as i think you have she said that while i know well what i am i can be cheerful and endure it all
i am thankful for myself at any rate that i can find my tiny way through the world without being beholden to anyone and that in return for all that is thrown at me in folly or vanity as i go along i can throw bubbles back
if i dont brood over all i want it is the better for me and not the worse for anyone
if i am a plaything for you giants be gentle with me miss mowcher replaced her handkerchief in her pocket looking at me with very intent expression all the while and pursued i saw you in the street just now
you may suppose i am not able to walk as fast as you with my short legs and short breath and i couldnt overtake you but i guessed where you came and came after you
i have been here before today but the good woman wasnt at home do you know her i demanded
i know of her and about her she replied from omer and joram
i was there at seven oclock this morning
do you remember what steerforth said to me about this unfortunate girl that time when i saw you both at the inn the great bonnet on miss mowchers head and the greater bonnet on the wall began to go backwards and forwards again when she asked this question
i remembered very well what she referred to having had it in my thoughts many times that day
i told her so
may the father of all evil confound him said the little woman holding up her forefinger between me and her sparkling eyes and ten times more confound that wicked servant but i believed it was you who had a boyish passion for her i i repeated
child child
in the name of blind illfortune cried miss mowcher wringing her hands impatiently as she went to and fro again upon the fender why did you praise her so and blush and look disturbed i could not conceal from myself that i had done this though for a reason very different from her supposition
what did i know said miss mowcher taking out her handkerchief again and giving one little stamp on the ground whenever at short intervals she applied it to her eyes with both hands at once
he was crossing you and wheedling you i saw and you were soft wax in his hands i saw
had i left the room a minute when his man told me that young innocence so he called you and you may call him old guilt all the days of your life had set his heart upon her and she was giddy and liked him but his master was resolved that no harm should come of itmore for your sake than for hersand that that was their business here
how could i but believe him
i saw steerforth soothe and please you by his praise of her
you were the first to mention her name
you owned to an old admiration of her
you were hot and cold and red and white all at once when i spoke to you of her
what could i thinkwhat did i thinkbut that you were a young libertine in everything but experience and had fallen into hands that had experience enough and could manage you having the fancy for your own good
oh
oh
oh
they were afraid of my finding out the truth exclaimed miss mowcher getting off the fender and trotting up and down the kitchen with her two short arms distressfully lifted up because i am a sharp little thingi need be to get through the world at alland they deceived me altogether and i gave the poor unfortunate girl a letter which i fully believe was the beginning of her ever speaking to littimer who was left behind on purpose i stood amazed at the revelation of all this perfidy looking at miss mowcher as she walked up and down the kitchen until she was out of breath when she sat upon the fender again and drying her face with her handkerchief shook her head for a long time without otherwise moving and without breaking silence
my country rounds she added at length brought me to norwich mr copperfield the night before last
what i happened to find there about their secret way of coming and going without youwhich was strangeled to my suspecting something wrong
i got into the coach from london last night as it came through norwich and was here this morning
oh oh oh
too late poor little mowcher turned so chilly after all her crying and fretting that she turned round on the fender putting her poor little wet feet in among the ashes to warm them and sat looking at the fire like a large doll
i sat in a chair on the other side of the hearth lost in unhappy reflections and looking at the fire too and sometimes at her
i must go she said at last rising as she spoke
its late
you dont mistrust me meeting her sharp glance which was as sharp as ever when she asked me i could not on that short challenge answer no quite frankly
come said she accepting the offer of my hand to help her over the fender and looking wistfully up into my face you know you wouldnt mistrust me if i was a fullsized woman i felt that there was much truth in this and i felt rather ashamed of myself
you are a young man she said nodding
take a word of advice even from three foot nothing
try not to associate bodily defects with mental my good friend except for a solid reason she had got over the fender now and i had got over my suspicion
i told her that i believed she had given me a faithful account of herself and that we had both been hapless instruments in designing hands
she thanked me and said i was a good fellow
now mind she exclaimed turning back on her way to the door and looking shrewdly at me with her forefinger up againi have some reason to suspect from what i have heardmy ears are always open i cant afford to spare what powers i havethat they are gone abroad
but if ever they return if ever any one of them returns while i am alive i am more likely than another going about as i do to find it out soon
whatever i know you shall know
if ever i can do anything to serve the poor betrayed girl i will do it faithfully please heaven
and littimer had better have a bloodhound at his back than little mowcher i placed implicit faith in this last statement when i marked the look with which it was accompanied
trust me no more but trust me no less than you would trust a fullsized woman said the little creature touching me appealingly on the wrist
if ever you see me again unlike what i am now and like what i was when you first saw me observe what company i am in
call to mind that i am a very helpless and defenceless little thing
think of me at home with my brother like myself and sister like myself when my days work is done
perhaps you wont then be very hard upon me or surprised if i can be distressed and serious
good night i gave miss mowcher my hand with a very different opinion of her from that which i had hitherto entertained and opened the door to let her out
it was not a trifling business to get the great umbrella up and properly balanced in her grasp but at last i successfully accomplished this and saw it go bobbing down the street through the rain without the least appearance of having anybody underneath it except when a heavier fall than usual from some overcharged waterspout sent it toppling over on one side and discovered miss mowcher struggling violently to get it right
after making one or two sallies to her relief which were rendered futile by the umbrellas hopping on again like an immense bird before i could reach it i came in went to bed and slept till morning
in the morning i was joined by mr peggotty and by my old nurse and we went at an early hour to the coach office where mrs gummidge and ham were waiting to take leave of us
masr davy ham whispered drawing me aside while mr peggotty was stowing his bag among the luggage his life is quite broke up
he doent know wheer hes going he doent knowwhats afore him hes bound upon a voyage thatll last on and off all the rest of his days take my wured for t unless he finds what hes a seeking of
i am sure youll be a friend to him masr davy trust me i will indeed said i shaking hands with ham earnestly
thankee
thankee very kind sir
one thing furder
im in good employ you know masr davy and i hant no way now of spending what i gets
moneys of no use to me no more except to live
if you can lay it out for him i shall do my work with a better art
though as to that sir and he spoke very steadily and mildly youre not to think but i shall work at all times like a man and act the best that lays in my power i told him i was well convinced of it and i hinted that i hoped the time might even come when he would cease to lead the lonely life he naturally contemplated now
no sir he said shaking his head all thats past and over with me sir
no one can never fill the place thats empty
but youll bear in mind about the money as theers at all times some laying by for him reminding him of the fact that mr peggotty derived a steady though certainly a very moderate income from the bequest of his late brotherinlaw i promised to do so
we then took leave of each other
i cannot leave him even now without remembering with a pang at once his modest fortitude and his great sorrow
as to mrs gummidge if i were to endeavour to describe how she ran down the street by the side of the coach seeing nothing but mr peggotty on the roof through the tears she tried to repress and dashing herself against the people who were coming in the opposite direction i should enter on a task of some difficulty
therefore i had better leave her sitting on a bakers doorstep out of breath with no shape at all remaining in her bonnet and one of her shoes off lying on the pavement at a considerable distance
when we got to our journeys end our first pursuit was to look about for a little lodging for peggotty where her brother could have a bed
we were so fortunate as to find one of a very clean and cheap description over a chandlers shop only two streets removed from me
when we had engaged this domicile i bought some cold meat at an eatinghouse and took my fellowtravellers home to tea a proceeding i regret to state which did not meet with mrs crupps approval but quite the contrary
i ought to observe however in explanation of that ladys state of mind that she was much offended by peggottys tucking up her widows gown before she had been ten minutes in the place and setting to work to dust my bedroom
this mrs crupp regarded in the light of a liberty and a liberty she said was a thing she never allowed
mr peggotty had made a communication to me on the way to london for which i was not unprepared
it was that he purposed first seeing mrs steerforth
as i felt bound to assist him in this and also to mediate between them with the view of sparing the mothers feelings as much as possible i wrote to her that night
i told her as mildly as i could what his wrong was and what my own share in his injury
i said he was a man in very common life but of a most gentle and upright character and that i ventured to express a hope that she would not refuse to see him in his heavy trouble
i mentioned two oclock in the afternoon as the hour of our coming and i sent the letter myself by the first coach in the morning
at the appointed time we stood at the doorthe door of that house where i had been a few days since so happy where my youthful confidence and warmth of heart had been yielded up so freely which was closed against me henceforth which was now a waste a ruin
no littimer appeared
the pleasanter face which had replaced his on the occasion of my last visit answered to our summons and went before us to the drawingroom
mrs steerforth was sitting there
rosa dartle glided as we went in from another part of the room and stood behind her chair
i saw directly in his mothers face that she knew from himself what he had done
it was very pale and bore the traces of deeper emotion than my letter alone weakened by the doubts her fondness would have raised upon it would have been likely to create
i thought her more like him than ever i had thought her and i felt rather than saw that the resemblance was not lost on my companion
she sat upright in her armchair with a stately immovable passionless air that it seemed as if nothing could disturb
she looked very steadfastly at mr peggotty when he stood before her and he looked quite as steadfastly at her
rosa dartles keen glance comprehended all of us
for some moments not a word was spoken
she motioned to mr peggotty to be seated
he said in a low voice i shouldnt feel it natral maam to sit down in this house
id sooner stand and this was succeeded by another silence which she broke thus i know with deep regret what has brought you here
what do you want of me
what do you ask me to do he put his hat under his arm and feeling in his breast for emilys letter took it out unfolded it and gave it to her
please to read that maam
thats my nieces hand she read it in the same stately and impassive wayuntouched by its contents as far as i could seeand returned it to him
unless he brings me back a lady said mr peggotty tracing out that part with his finger
i come to know maam whether he will keep his wured no she returned
why not said mr peggotty
it is impossible
he would disgrace himself
you cannot fail to know that she is far below him raise her up said mr peggotty
she is uneducated and ignorant maybe shes not maybe she is said mr peggotty
i think not maam but im no judge of them things
teach her better since you oblige me to speak more plainly which i am very unwilling to do her humble connexions would render such a thing impossible if nothing else did hark to this maam he returned slowly and quietly
you know what it is to love your child
so do i
if she was a hundred times my child i couldnt love her more
you doent know what it is to lose your child
i do
all the heaps of riches in the wureld would be nowt to me if they was mine to buy her back
but save her from this disgrace and she shall never be disgraced by us
not one of us that shes growed up among not one of us thats lived along with her and had her for their all in all these many year will ever look upon her pritty face again
well be content to let her be well be content to think of her far off as if she was underneath another sun and sky well be content to trust her to her husbandto her little children prapsand bide the time when all of us shall be alike in quality afore our god the rugged eloquence with which he spoke was not devoid of all effect
she still preserved her proud manner but there was a touch of softness in her voice as she answered i justify nothing
i make no counteraccusations
but i am sorry to repeat it is impossible
such a marriage would irretrievably blight my sons career and ruin his prospects
nothing is more certain than that it never can take place and never will
if there is any other compensation i am looking at the likeness of the face interrupted mr peggotty with a steady but a kindling eye that has looked at me in my home at my fireside in my boatwheer notsmiling and friendly when it was so treacherous that i go half wild when i think of it
if the likeness of that face dont turn to burning fire at the thought of offering money to me for my childs blight and ruin its as bad
i doent know being a ladys but what its worse she changed now in a moment
an angry flush overspread her features and she said in an intolerant manner grasping the armchair tightly with her hands what compensation can you make to me for opening such a pit between me and my son
what is your love to mine
what is your separation to ours miss dartle softly touched her and bent down her head to whisper but she would not hear a word
no rosa not a word
let the man listen to what i say
my son who has been the object of my life to whom its every thought has been devoted whom i have gratified from a child in every wish from whom i have had no separate existence since his birthto take up in a moment with a miserable girl and avoid me
to repay my confidence with systematic deception for her sake and quit me for her
to set this wretched fancy against his mothers claims upon his duty love respect gratitudeclaims that every day and hour of his life should have strengthened into ties that nothing could be proof against
is this no injury again rosa dartle tried to soothe her again ineffectually
i say rosa not a word
if he can stake his all upon the lightest object i can stake my all upon a greater purpose
let him go where he will with the means that my love has secured to him
does he think to reduce me by long absence
he knows his mother very little if he does
let him put away his whim now and he is welcome back
let him not put her away now and he never shall come near me living or dying while i can raise my hand to make a sign against it unless being rid of her for ever he comes humbly to me and begs for my forgiveness
this is my right
this is the acknowledgement i will have
this is the separation that there is between us
and is this she added looking at her visitor with the proud intolerant air with which she had begun no injury while i heard and saw the mother as she said these words i seemed to hear and see the son defying them
all that i had ever seen in him of an unyielding wilful spirit i saw in her
all the understanding that i had now of his misdirected energy became an understanding of her character too and a perception that it was in its strongest springs the same
she now observed to me aloud resuming her former restraint that it was useless to hear more or to say more and that she begged to put an end to the interview
she rose with an air of dignity to leave the room when mr peggotty signified that it was needless
doent fear me being any hindrance to you i have no more to say maam he remarked as he moved towards the door
i come heer with no hope and i take away no hope
i have done what i thowt should be done but i never looked fur any good to come of my stanning where i do
this has been too evil a house fur me and mine fur me to be in my right senses and expect it with this we departed leaving her standing by her elbowchair a picture of a noble presence and a handsome face
we had on our way out to cross a paved hall with glass sides and roof over which a vine was trained
its leaves and shoots were green then and the day being sunny a pair of glass doors leading to the garden were thrown open
rosa dartle entering this way with a noiseless step when we were close to them addressed herself to me you do well she said indeed to bring this fellow here such a concentration of rage and scorn as darkened her face and flashed in her jetblack eyes i could not have thought compressible even into that face
the scar made by the hammer was as usual in this excited state of her features strongly marked
when the throbbing i had seen before came into it as i looked at her she absolutely lifted up her hand and struck it
this is a fellow she said to champion and bring here is he not
you are a true man miss dartle i returned you are surely not so unjust as to condemn me why do you bring division between these two mad creatures she returned
dont you know that they are both mad with their own selfwill and pride is it my doing i returned
is it your doing she retorted
why do you bring this man here he is a deeplyinjured man miss dartle i replied
you may not know it i know that james steerforth she said with her hand on her bosom as if to prevent the storm that was raging there from being loud has a false corrupt heart and is a traitor
but what need i know or care about this fellow and his common niece miss dartle i returned you deepen the injury
it is sufficient already
i will only say at parting that you do him a great wrong i do him no wrong she returned
they are a depraved worthless set
i would have her whipped mr peggotty passed on without a word and went out at the door
oh shame miss dartle
shame i said indignantly
how can you bear to trample on his undeserved affliction i would trample on them all she answered
i would have his house pulled down
i would have her branded on the face dressed in rags and cast out in the streets to starve
if i had the power to sit in judgement on her i would see it done
see it done
i would do it
i detest her
if i ever could reproach her with her infamous condition i would go anywhere to do so
if i could hunt her to her grave i would
if there was any word of comfort that would be a solace to her in her dying hour and only i possessed it i wouldnt part with it for life itself the mere vehemence of her words can convey i am sensible but a weak impression of the passion by which she was possessed and which made itself articulate in her whole figure though her voice instead of being raised was lower than usual
no description i could give of her would do justice to my recollection of her or to her entire deliverance of herself to her anger
i have seen passion in many forms but i have never seen it in such a form as that
when i joined mr peggotty he was walking slowly and thoughtfully down the hill
he told me as soon as i came up with him that having now discharged his mind of what he had purposed doing in london he meant to set out on his travels that night
i asked him where he meant to go
he only answered im a going sir to seek my niece we went back to the little lodging over the chandlers shop and there i found an opportunity of repeating to peggotty what he had said to me
she informed me in return that he had said the same to her that morning
she knew no more than i did where he was going but she thought he had some project shaped out in his mind
i did not like to leave him under such circumstances and we all three dined together off a beefsteak piewhich was one of the many good things for which peggotty was famousand which was curiously flavoured on this occasion i recollect well by a miscellaneous taste of tea coffee butter bacon cheese new loaves firewood candles and walnut ketchup continually ascending from the shop
after dinner we sat for an hour or so near the window without talking much and then mr peggotty got up and brought his oilskin bag and his stout stick and laid them on the table
he accepted from his sisters stock of ready money a small sum on account of his legacy barely enough i should have thought to keep him for a month
he promised to communicate with me when anything befell him and he slung his bag about him took his hat and stick and bade us both goodbye all good attend you dear old woman he said embracing peggotty and you too masr davy shaking hands with me
im agoing to seek her fur and wide
if she should come home while im awaybut ah that aint like to beor if i should bring her back my meaning is that she and me shall live and die where no one cant reproach her
if any hurt should come to me remember that the last words i left for her was my unchanged love is with my darling child and i forgive her he said this solemnly bareheaded then putting on his hat he went down the stairs and away
we followed to the door
it was a warm dusty evening just the time when in the great main thoroughfare out of which that byway turned there was a temporary lull in the eternal tread of feet upon the pavement and a strong red sunshine
he turned alone at the corner of our shady street into a glow of light in which we lost him
rarely did that hour of the evening come rarely did i wake at night rarely did i look up at the moon or stars or watch the falling rain or hear the wind but i thought of his solitary figure toiling on poor pilgrim and recalled the words im a going to seek her fur and wide
if any hurt should come to me remember that the last words i left for her was my unchanged love is with my darling child and i forgive her all this time i had gone on loving dora harder than ever
her idea was my refuge in disappointment and distress and made some amends to me even for the loss of my friend
the more i pitied myself or pitied others the more i sought for consolation in the image of dora
the greater the accumulation of deceit and trouble in the world the brighter and the purer shone the star of dora high above the world
i dont think i had any definite idea where dora came from or in what degree she was related to a higher order of beings but i am quite sure i should have scouted the notion of her being simply human like any other young lady with indignation and contempt
if i may so express it i was steeped in dora
i was not merely over head and ears in love with her but i was saturated through and through
enough love might have been wrung out of me metaphorically speaking to drown anybody in and yet there would have remained enough within me and all over me to pervade my entire existence
the first thing i did on my own account when i came back was to take a nightwalk to norwood and like the subject of a venerable riddle of my childhood to go round and round the house without ever touching the house thinking about dora
i believe the theme of this incomprehensible conundrum was the moon
no matter what it was i the moonstruck slave of dora perambulated round and round the house and garden for two hours looking through crevices in the palings getting my chin by dint of violent exertion above the rusty nails on the top blowing kisses at the lights in the windows and romantically calling on the night at intervals to shield my dorai dont exactly know what from i suppose from fire
perhaps from mice to which she had a great objection
my love was so much in my mind and it was so natural to me to confide in peggotty when i found her again by my side of an evening with the old set of industrial implements busily making the tour of my wardrobe that i imparted to her in a sufficiently roundabout way my great secret
peggotty was strongly interested but i could not get her into my view of the case at all
she was audaciously prejudiced in my favour and quite unable to understand why i should have any misgivings or be lowspirited about it
the young lady might think herself well off she observed to have such a beau
and as to her pa she said what did the gentleman expect for gracious sake i observed however that mr spenlows proctorial gown and stiff cravat took peggotty down a little and inspired her with a greater reverence for the man who was gradually becoming more and more etherealized in my eyes every day and about whom a reflected radiance seemed to me to beam when he sat erect in court among his papers like a little lighthouse in a sea of stationery
and by the by it used to be uncommonly strange to me to consider i remember as i sat in court too how those dim old judges and doctors wouldnt have cared for dora if they had known her how they wouldnt have gone out of their senses with rapture if marriage with dora had been proposed to them how dora might have sung and played upon that glorified guitar until she led me to the verge of madness yet not have tempted one of those slowgoers an inch out of his road
i despised them to a man
frozenout old gardeners in the flowerbeds of the heart i took a personal offence against them all
the bench was nothing to me but an insensible blunderer
the bar had no more tenderness or poetry in it than the bar of a publichouse
taking the management of peggottys affairs into my own hands with no little pride i proved the will and came to a settlement with the legacy dutyoffice and took her to the bank and soon got everything into an orderly train
we varied the legal character of these proceedings by going to see some perspiring waxwork in fleet street melted i should hope these twenty years and by visiting miss linwoods exhibition which i remember as a mausoleum of needlework favourable to selfexamination and repentance and by inspecting the tower of london and going to the top of st pauls
all these wonders afforded peggotty as much pleasure as she was able to enjoy under existing circumstances except i think st pauls which from her long attachment to her workbox became a rival of the picture on the lid and was in some particulars vanquished she considered by that work of art
peggottys business which was what we used to call commonform business in the commons and very light and lucrative the commonform business was being settled i took her down to the office one morning to pay her bill
mr spenlow had stepped out old tiffey said to get a gentleman sworn for a marriage licence but as i knew he would be back directly our place lying close to the surrogates and to the vicargenerals office too i told peggotty to wait
we were a little like undertakers in the commons as regarded probate transactions generally making it a rule to look more or less cut up when we had to deal with clients in mourning
in a similar feeling of delicacy we were always blithe and lighthearted with the licence clients
therefore i hinted to peggotty that she would find mr spenlow much recovered from the shock of mr barkiss decease and indeed he came in like a bridegroom
but neither peggotty nor i had eyes for him when we saw in company with him mr murdstone
he was very little changed
his hair looked as thick and was certainly as black as ever and his glance was as little to be trusted as of old
ah copperfield said mr spenlow
you know this gentleman i believe i made my gentleman a distant bow and peggotty barely recognized him
he was at first somewhat disconcerted to meet us two together but quickly decided what to do and came up to me
i hope he said that you are doing well it can hardly be interesting to you said i
yes if you wish to know we looked at each other and he addressed himself to peggotty
and you said he
i am sorry to observe that you have lost your husband its not the first loss i have had in my life mr murdstone replied peggotty trembling from head to foot
i am glad to hope that there is nobody to blame for this onenobody to answer for it ha said he thats a comfortable reflection
you have done your duty i have not worn anybodys life away said peggotty i am thankful to think
no mr murdstone i have not worrited and frightened any sweet creetur to an early grave he eyed her gloomilyremorsefully i thoughtfor an instant and said turning his head towards me but looking at my feet instead of my face we are not likely to encounter soon againa source of satisfaction to us both no doubt for such meetings as this can never be agreeable
i do not expect that you who always rebelled against my just authority exerted for your benefit and reformation should owe me any goodwill now
there is an antipathy between us an old one i believe said i interrupting him
he smiled and shot as evil a glance at me as could come from his dark eyes
it rankled in your baby breast he said
it embittered the life of your poor mother
you are right
i hope you may do better yet i hope you may correct yourself here he ended the dialogue which had been carried on in a low voice in a corner of the outer office by passing into mr spenlows room and saying aloud in his smoothest manner gentlemen of mr spenlows profession are accustomed to family differences and know how complicated and difficult they always are with that he paid the money for his licence and receiving it neatly folded from mr spenlow together with a shake of the hand and a polite wish for his happiness and the ladys went out of the office
i might have had more difficulty in constraining myself to be silent under his words if i had had less difficulty in impressing upon peggotty who was only angry on my account good creature
that we were not in a place for recrimination and that i besought her to hold her peace
she was so unusually roused that i was glad to compound for an affectionate hug elicited by this revival in her mind of our old injuries and to make the best i could of it before mr spenlow and the clerks
mr spenlow did not appear to know what the connexion between mr murdstone and myself was which i was glad of for i could not bear to acknowledge him even in my own breast remembering what i did of the history of my poor mother
mr spenlow seemed to think if he thought anything about the matter that my aunt was the leader of the state party in our family and that there was a rebel party commanded by somebody elseso i gathered at least from what he said while we were waiting for mr tiffey to make out peggottys bill of costs
miss trotwood he remarked is very firm no doubt and not likely to give way to opposition
i have an admiration for her character and i may congratulate you copperfield on being on the right side
differences between relations are much to be deploredbut they are extremely generaland the great thing is to be on the right side meaning i take it on the side of the moneyed interest
rather a good marriage this i believe said mr spenlow
i explained that i knew nothing about it
indeed he said
speaking from the few words mr murdstone droppedas a man frequently does on these occasionsand from what miss murdstone let fall i should say it was rather a good marriage do you mean that there is money sir i asked
yes said mr spenlow i understand theres money
beauty too i am told indeed
is his new wife young just of age said mr spenlow
so lately that i should think they had been waiting for that lord deliver her said peggotty
so very emphatically and unexpectedly that we were all three discomposed until tiffey came in with the bill
old tiffey soon appeared however and handed it to mr spenlow to look over
mr spenlow settling his chin in his cravat and rubbing it softly went over the items with a deprecatory airas if it were all jorkinss doingand handed it back to tiffey with a bland sigh
yes he said
thats right
quite right
i should have been extremely happy copperfield to have limited these charges to the actual expenditure out of pocket but it is an irksome incident in my professional life that i am not at liberty to consult my own wishes
i have a partnermr jorkins as he said this with a gentle melancholy which was the next thing to making no charge at all i expressed my acknowledgements on peggottys behalf and paid tiffey in banknotes
peggotty then retired to her lodging and mr spenlow and i went into court where we had a divorcesuit coming on under an ingenious little statute repealed now i believe but in virtue of which i have seen several marriages annulled of which the merits were these
the husband whose name was thomas benjamin had taken out his marriage licence as thomas only suppressing the benjamin in case he should not find himself as comfortable as he expected
not finding himself as comfortable as he expected or being a little fatigued with his wife poor fellow he now came forward by a friend after being married a year or two and declared that his name was thomas benjamin and therefore he was not married at all
which the court confirmed to his great satisfaction
i must say that i had my doubts about the strict justice of this and was not even frightened out of them by the bushel of wheat which reconciles all anomalies
but mr spenlow argued the matter with me
he said look at the world there was good and evil in that look at the ecclesiastical law there was good and evil in that
it was all part of a system
very good
there you were
i had not the hardihood to suggest to doras father that possibly we might even improve the world a little if we got up early in the morning and took off our coats to the work but i confessed that i thought we might improve the commons
mr spenlow replied that he would particularly advise me to dismiss that idea from my mind as not being worthy of my gentlemanly character but that he would be glad to hear from me of what improvement i thought the commons susceptible
taking that part of the commons which happened to be nearest to usfor our man was unmarried by this time and we were out of court and strolling past the prerogative officei submitted that i thought the prerogative office rather a queerly managed institution
mr spenlow inquired in what respect
i replied with all due deference to his experience but with more deference i am afraid to his being doras father that perhaps it was a little nonsensical that the registry of that court containing the original wills of all persons leaving effects within the immense province of canterbury for three whole centuries should be an accidental building never designed for the purpose leased by the registrars for their own private emolument unsafe not even ascertained to be fireproof choked with the important documents it held and positively from the roof to the basement a mercenary speculation of the registrars who took great fees from the public and crammed the publics wills away anyhow and anywhere having no other object than to get rid of them cheaply
that perhaps it was a little unreasonable that these registrars in the receipt of profits amounting to eight or nine thousand pounds a year to say nothing of the profits of the deputy registrars and clerks of seats should not be obliged to spend a little of that money in finding a reasonably safe place for the important documents which all classes of people were compelled to hand over to them whether they would or no
that perhaps it was a little unjust that all the great offices in this great office should be magnificent sinecures while the unfortunate workingclerks in the cold dark room upstairs were the worst rewarded and the least considered men doing important services in london
that perhaps it was a little indecent that the principal registrar of all whose duty it was to find the public constantly resorting to this place all needful accommodation should be an enormous sinecurist in virtue of that post and might be besides a clergyman a pluralist the holder of a staff in a cathedral and what notwhile the public was put to the inconvenience of which we had a specimen every afternoon when the office was busy and which we knew to be quite monstrous
that perhaps in short this prerogative office of the diocese of canterbury was altogether such a pestilent job and such a pernicious absurdity that but for its being squeezed away in a corner of st pauls churchyard which few people knew it must have been turned completely inside out and upside down long ago
mr spenlow smiled as i became modestly warm on the subject and then argued this question with me as he had argued the other
he said what was it after all
it was a question of feeling
if the public felt that their wills were in safe keeping and took it for granted that the office was not to be made better who was the worse for it
nobody
who was the better for it
all the sinecurists
very well
then the good predominated
it might not be a perfect system nothing was perfect but what he objected to was the insertion of the wedge
under the prerogative office the country had been glorious
insert the wedge into the prerogative office and the country would cease to be glorious
he considered it the principle of a gentleman to take things as he found them and he had no doubt the prerogative office would last our time
i deferred to his opinion though i had great doubts of it myself
i find he was right however for it has not only lasted to the present moment but has done so in the teeth of a great parliamentary report made not too willingly eighteen years ago when all these objections of mine were set forth in detail and when the existing stowage for wills was described as equal to the accumulation of only two years and a half more
what they have done with them since whether they have lost many or whether they sell any now and then to the butter shops i dont know
i am glad mine is not there and i hope it may not go there yet awhile
i have set all this down in my present blissful chapter because here it comes into its natural place
mr spenlow and i falling into this conversation prolonged it and our saunter to and fro until we diverged into general topics
and so it came about in the end that mr spenlow told me this day week was doras birthday and he would be glad if i would come down and join a little picnic on the occasion
i went out of my senses immediately became a mere driveller next day on receipt of a little laceedged sheet of notepaper favoured by papa
to remind and passed the intervening period in a state of dotage
i think i committed every possible absurdity in the way of preparation for this blessed event
i turn hot when i remember the cravat i bought
my boots might be placed in any collection of instruments of torture
i provided and sent down by the norwood coach the night before a delicate little hamper amounting in itself i thought almost to a declaration
there were crackers in it with the tenderest mottoes that could be got for money
at six in the morning i was in covent garden market buying a bouquet for dora
at ten i was on horseback i hired a gallant grey for the occasion with the bouquet in my hat to keep it fresh trotting down to norwood
i suppose that when i saw dora in the garden and pretended not to see her and rode past the house pretending to be anxiously looking for it i committed two small fooleries which other young gentlemen in my circumstances might have committedbecause they came so very natural to me
but oh
when i did find the house and did dismount at the gardengate and drag those stonyhearted boots across the lawn to dora sitting on a gardenseat under a lilac tree what a spectacle she was upon that beautiful morning among the butterflies in a white chip bonnet and a dress of celestial blue
there was a young lady with hercomparatively stricken in yearsalmost twenty i should say
her name was miss mills
and dora called her julia
she was the bosom friend of dora
happy miss mills
jip was there and jip would bark at me again
when i presented my bouquet he gnashed his teeth with jealousy
well he might
if he had the least idea how i adored his mistress well he might
oh thank you mr copperfield
what dear flowers said dora
i had had an intention of saying and had been studying the best form of words for three miles that i thought them beautiful before i saw them so near her
but i couldnt manage it
she was too bewildering
to see her lay the flowers against her little dimpled chin was to lose all presence of mind and power of language in a feeble ecstasy
i wonder i didnt say kill me if you have a heart miss mills
let me die here then dora held my flowers to jip to smell
then jip growled and wouldnt smell them
then dora laughed and held them a little closer to jip to make him
then jip laid hold of a bit of geranium with his teeth and worried imaginary cats in it
then dora beat him and pouted and said my poor beautiful flowers as compassionately i thought as if jip had laid hold of me
i wished he had
youll be so glad to hear mr copperfield said dora that that cross miss murdstone is not here
she has gone to her brothers marriage and will be away at least three weeks
isnt that delightful i said i was sure it must be delightful to her and all that was delightful to her was delightful to me
miss mills with an air of superior wisdom and benevolence smiled upon us
she is the most disagreeable thing i ever saw said dora
you cant believe how illtempered and shocking she is julia yes i can my dear said julia
you can perhaps love returned dora with her hand on julias
forgive my not excepting you my dear at first i learnt from this that miss mills had had her trials in the course of a chequered existence and that to these perhaps i might refer that wise benignity of manner which i had already noticed
i found in the course of the day that this was the case miss mills having been unhappy in a misplaced affection and being understood to have retired from the world on her awful stock of experience but still to take a calm interest in the unblighted hopes and loves of youth
but now mr spenlow came out of the house and dora went to him saying look papa what beautiful flowers and miss mills smiled thoughtfully as who should say ye mayflies enjoy your brief existence in the bright morning of life and we all walked from the lawn towards the carriage which was getting ready
i shall never have such a ride again
i have never had such another
there were only those three their hamper my hamper and the guitarcase in the phaeton and of course the phaeton was open and i rode behind it and dora sat with her back to the horses looking towards me
she kept the bouquet close to her on the cushion and wouldnt allow jip to sit on that side of her at all for fear he should crush it
she often carried it in her hand often refreshed herself with its fragrance
our eyes at those times often met and my great astonishment is that i didnt go over the head of my gallant grey into the carriage
there was dust i believe
there was a good deal of dust i believe
i have a faint impression that mr spenlow remonstrated with me for riding in it but i knew of none
i was sensible of a mist of love and beauty about dora but of nothing else
he stood up sometimes and asked me what i thought of the prospect
i said it was delightful and i dare say it was but it was all dora to me
the sun shone dora and the birds sang dora
the south wind blew dora and the wild flowers in the hedges were all doras to a bud
my comfort is miss mills understood me
miss mills alone could enter into my feelings thoroughly
i dont know how long we were going and to this hour i know as little where we went
perhaps it was near guildford
perhaps some arabiannight magician opened up the place for the day and shut it up for ever when we came away
it was a green spot on a hill carpeted with soft turf
there were shady trees and heather and as far as the eye could see a rich landscape
it was a trying thing to find people here waiting for us and my jealousy even of the ladies knew no bounds
but all of my own sexespecially one impostor three or four years my elder with a red whisker on which he established an amount of presumption not to be enduredwere my mortal foes
we all unpacked our baskets and employed ourselves in getting dinner ready
red whisker pretended he could make a salad which i dont believe and obtruded himself on public notice
some of the young ladies washed the lettuces for him and sliced them under his directions
dora was among these
i felt that fate had pitted me against this man and one of us must fall
red whisker made his salad i wondered how they could eat it
nothing should have induced me to touch it
and voted himself into the charge of the winecellar which he constructed being an ingenious beast in the hollow trunk of a tree
by and by i saw him with the majority of a lobster on his plate eating his dinner at the feet of dora
i have but an indistinct idea of what happened for some time after this baleful object presented itself to my view
i was very merry i know but it was hollow merriment
i attached myself to a young creature in pink with little eyes and flirted with her desperately
she received my attentions with favour but whether on my account solely or because she had any designs on red whisker i cant say
doras health was drunk
when i drank it i affected to interrupt my conversation for that purpose and to resume it immediately afterwards
i caught doras eye as i bowed to her and i thought it looked appealing
but it looked at me over the head of red whisker and i was adamant
the young creature in pink had a mother in green and i rather think the latter separated us from motives of policy
howbeit there was a general breaking up of the party while the remnants of the dinner were being put away and i strolled off by myself among the trees in a raging and remorseful state
i was debating whether i should pretend that i was not well and flyi dont know whereupon my gallant grey when dora and miss mills met me
mr
copperfield said miss mills you are dull i begged her pardon
not at all
and dora said miss mills you are dull oh dear no
not in the least
mr
copperfield and dora said miss mills with an almost venerable air
enough of this
do not allow a trivial misunderstanding to wither the blossoms of spring which once put forth and blighted cannot be renewed
i speak said miss mills from experience of the pastthe remote irrevocable past
the gushing fountains which sparkle in the sun must not be stopped in mere caprice the oasis in the desert of sahara must not be plucked up idly i hardly knew what i did i was burning all over to that extraordinary extent but i took doras little hand and kissed itand she let me
i kissed miss millss hand and we all seemed to my thinking to go straight up to the seventh heaven
we did not come down again
we stayed up there all the evening
at first we strayed to and fro among the trees i with doras shy arm drawn through mine and heaven knows folly as it all was it would have been a happy fate to have been struck immortal with those foolish feelings and have stayed among the trees for ever
but much too soon we heard the others laughing and talking and calling wheres dora so we went back and they wanted dora to sing
red whisker would have got the guitarcase out of the carriage but dora told him nobody knew where it was but i
so red whisker was done for in a moment and i got it and i unlocked it and i took the guitar out and i sat by her and i held her handkerchief and gloves and i drank in every note of her dear voice and she sang to me who loved her and all the others might applaud as much as they liked but they had nothing to do with it
i was intoxicated with joy
i was afraid it was too happy to be real and that i should wake in buckingham street presently and hear mrs crupp clinking the teacups in getting breakfast ready
but dora sang and others sang and miss mills sangabout the slumbering echoes in the caverns of memory as if she were a hundred years oldand the evening came on and we had tea with the kettle boiling gipsyfashion and i was still as happy as ever
i was happier than ever when the party broke up and the other people defeated red whisker and all went their several ways and we went ours through the still evening and the dying light with sweet scents rising up around us
mr spenlow being a little drowsy after the champagnehonour to the soil that grew the grape to the grape that made the wine to the sun that ripened it and to the merchant who adulterated itand being fast asleep in a corner of the carriage i rode by the side and talked to dora
she admired my horse and patted himoh what a dear little hand it looked upon a horseand her shawl would not keep right and now and then i drew it round her with my arm and i even fancied that jip began to see how it was and to understand that he must make up his mind to be friends with me
that sagacious miss mills too that amiable though quite used up recluse that little patriarch of something less than twenty who had done with the world and mustnt on any account have the slumbering echoes in the caverns of memory awakened what a kind thing she did
mr
copperfield said miss mills come to this side of the carriage a momentif you can spare a moment
i want to speak to you behold me on my gallant grey bending at the side of miss mills with my hand upon the carriage door
dora is coming to stay with me
she is coming home with me the day after tomorrow
if you would like to call i am sure papa would be happy to see you what could i do but invoke a silent blessing on miss millss head and store miss millss address in the securest corner of my memory
what could i do but tell miss mills with grateful looks and fervent words how much i appreciated her good offices and what an inestimable value i set upon her friendship
then miss mills benignantly dismissed me saying go back to dora and i went and dora leaned out of the carriage to talk to me and we talked all the rest of the way and i rode my gallant grey so close to the wheel that i grazed his near fore leg against it and took the bark off as his owner told me to the tune of three pun sivinwhich i paid and thought extremely cheap for so much joy
what time miss mills sat looking at the moon murmuring versesand recalling i suppose the ancient days when she and earth had anything in common
norwood was many miles too near and we reached it many hours too soon but mr spenlow came to himself a little short of it and said you must come in copperfield and rest and i consenting we had sandwiches and wineandwater
in the light room dora blushing looked so lovely that i could not tear myself away but sat there staring in a dream until the snoring of mr spenlow inspired me with sufficient consciousness to take my leave
so we parted i riding all the way to london with the farewell touch of doras hand still light on mine recalling every incident and word ten thousand times lying down in my own bed at last as enraptured a young noodle as ever was carried out of his five wits by love
when i awoke next morning i was resolute to declare my passion to dora and know my fate
happiness or misery was now the question
there was no other question that i knew of in the world and only dora could give the answer to it
i passed three days in a luxury of wretchedness torturing myself by putting every conceivable variety of discouraging construction on all that ever had taken place between dora and me
at last arrayed for the purpose at a vast expense i went to miss millss fraught with a declaration
how many times i went up and down the street and round the squarepainfully aware of being a much better answer to the old riddle than the original onebefore i could persuade myself to go up the steps and knock is no matter now
even when at last i had knocked and was waiting at the door i had some flurried thought of asking if that were mr blackboys in imitation of poor barkis begging pardon and retreating
but i kept my ground
mr mills was not at home
i did not expect he would be
nobody wanted him
miss mills was at home
miss mills would do
i was shown into a room upstairs where miss mills and dora were
jip was there
miss mills was copying music i recollect it was a new song called affections dirge and dora was painting flowers
what were my feelings when i recognized my own flowers the identical covent garden market purchase
i cannot say that they were very like or that they particularly resembled any flowers that have ever come under my observation but i knew from the paper round them which was accurately copied what the composition was
miss mills was very glad to see me and very sorry her papa was not at home though i thought we all bore that with fortitude
miss mills was conversational for a few minutes and then laying down her pen upon affections dirge got up and left the room
i began to think i would put it off till tomorrow
i hope your poor horse was not tired when he got home at night said dora lifting up her beautiful eyes
it was a long way for him i began to think i would do it today
it was a long way for him said i for he had nothing to uphold him on the journey wasnt he fed poor thing asked dora
i began to think i would put it off till tomorrow
yeyes i said he was well taken care of
i mean he had not the unutterable happiness that i had in being so near you dora bent her head over her drawing and said after a little whilei had sat in the interval in a burning fever and with my legs in a very rigid state you didnt seem to be sensible of that happiness yourself at one time of the day i saw now that i was in for it and it must be done on the spot
you didnt care for that happiness in the least said dora slightly raising her eyebrows and shaking her head when you were sitting by miss kitt kitt i should observe was the name of the creature in pink with the little eyes
though certainly i dont know why you should said dora or why you should call it a happiness at all
but of course you dont mean what you say
and i am sure no one doubts your being at liberty to do whatever you like
jip you naughty boy come here i dont know how i did it
i did it in a moment
i intercepted jip
i had dora in my arms
i was full of eloquence
i never stopped for a word
i told her how i loved her
i told her i should die without her
i told her that i idolized and worshipped her
jip barked madly all the time
when dora hung her head and cried and trembled my eloquence increased so much the more
if she would like me to die for her she had but to say the word and i was ready
life without doras love was not a thing to have on any terms
i couldnt bear it and i wouldnt
i had loved her every minute day and night since i first saw her
i loved her at that minute to distraction
i should always love her every minute to distraction
lovers had loved before and lovers would love again but no lover had loved might could would or should ever love as i loved dora
the more i raved the more jip barked
each of us in his own way got more mad every moment
well well
dora and i were sitting on the sofa by and by quiet enough and jip was lying in her lap winking peacefully at me
it was off my mind
i was in a state of perfect rapture
dora and i were engaged
i suppose we had some notion that this was to end in marriage
we must have had some because dora stipulated that we were never to be married without her papas consent
but in our youthful ecstasy i dont think that we really looked before us or behind us or had any aspiration beyond the ignorant present
we were to keep our secret from mr spenlow but i am sure the idea never entered my head then that there was anything dishonourable in that
miss mills was more than usually pensive when dora going to find her brought her backi apprehend because there was a tendency in what had passed to awaken the slumbering echoes in the caverns of memory
but she gave us her blessing and the assurance of her lasting friendship and spoke to us generally as became a voice from the cloister
what an idle time it was
what an insubstantial happy foolish time it was
when i measured doras finger for a ring that was to be made of forgetmenots and when the jeweller to whom i took the measure found me out and laughed over his orderbook and charged me anything he liked for the pretty little toy with its blue stonesso associated in my remembrance with doras hand that yesterday when i saw such another by chance on the finger of my own daughter there was a momentary stirring in my heart like pain
when i walked about exalted with my secret and full of my own interest and felt the dignity of loving dora and of being beloved so much that if i had walked the air i could not have been more above the people not so situated who were creeping on the earth
when we had those meetings in the garden of the square and sat within the dingy summerhouse so happy that i love the london sparrows to this hour for nothing else and see the plumage of the tropics in their smoky feathers
when we had our first great quarrel within a week of our betrothal and when dora sent me back the ring enclosed in a despairing cockedhat note wherein she used the terrible expression that our love had begun in folly and ended in madness which dreadful words occasioned me to tear my hair and cry that all was over
when under cover of the night i flew to miss mills whom i saw by stealth in a back kitchen where there was a mangle and implored miss mills to interpose between us and avert insanity
when miss mills undertook the office and returned with dora exhorting us from the pulpit of her own bitter youth to mutual concession and the avoidance of the desert of sahara
when we cried and made it up and were so blest again that the back kitchen mangle and all changed to loves own temple where we arranged a plan of correspondence through miss mills always to comprehend at least one letter on each side every day
what an idle time
what an insubstantial happy foolish time
of all the times of mine that time has in his grip there is none that in one retrospect i can smile at half so much and think of half so tenderly
i wrote to agnes as soon as dora and i were engaged
i wrote her a long letter in which i tried to make her comprehend how blest i was and what a darling dora was
i entreated agnes not to regard this as a thoughtless passion which could ever yield to any other or had the least resemblance to the boyish fancies that we used to joke about
i assured her that its profundity was quite unfathomable and expressed my belief that nothing like it had ever been known
somehow as i wrote to agnes on a fine evening by my open window and the remembrance of her clear calm eyes and gentle face came stealing over me it shed such a peaceful influence upon the hurry and agitation in which i had been living lately and of which my very happiness partook in some degree that it soothed me into tears
i remember that i sat resting my head upon my hand when the letter was half done cherishing a general fancy as if agnes were one of the elements of my natural home
as if in the retirement of the house made almost sacred to me by her presence dora and i must be happier than anywhere
as if in love joy sorrow hope or disappointment in all emotions my heart turned naturally there and found its refuge and best friend
of steerforth i said nothing
i only told her there had been sad grief at yarmouth on account of emilys flight and that on me it made a double wound by reason of the circumstances attending it
i knew how quick she always was to divine the truth and that she would never be the first to breathe his name
to this letter i received an answer by return of post
as i read it i seemed to hear agnes speaking to me
it was like her cordial voice in my ears
what can i say more
while i had been away from home lately traddles had called twice or thrice
finding peggotty within and being informed by peggotty who always volunteered that information to whomsoever would receive it that she was my old nurse he had established a goodhumoured acquaintance with her and had stayed to have a little chat with her about me
so peggotty said but i am afraid the chat was all on her own side and of immoderate length as she was very difficult indeed to stop god bless her
when she had me for her theme
this reminds me not only that i expected traddles on a certain afternoon of his own appointing which was now come but that mrs crupp had resigned everything appertaining to her office the salary excepted until peggotty should cease to present herself
mrs crupp after holding divers conversations respecting peggotty in a very highpitched voice on the staircasewith some invisible familiar it would appear for corporeally speaking she was quite alone at those timesaddressed a letter to me developing her views
beginning it with that statement of universal application which fitted every occurrence of her life namely that she was a mother herself she went on to inform me that she had once seen very different days but that at all periods of her existence she had had a constitutional objection to spies intruders and informers
she named no names she said let them the cap fitted wear it but spies intruders and informers especially in widders weeds this clause was underlined she had ever accustomed herself to look down upon
if a gentleman was the victim of spies intruders and informers but still naming no names that was his own pleasure
he had a right to please himself so let him do
all that she mrs crupp stipulated for was that she should not be brought in contract with such persons
therefore she begged to be excused from any further attendance on the top set until things were as they formerly was and as they could be wished to be and further mentioned that her little book would be found upon the breakfasttable every saturday morning when she requested an immediate settlement of the same with the benevolent view of saving trouble and an illconwenience to all parties
after this mrs crupp confined herself to making pitfalls on the stairs principally with pitchers and endeavouring to delude peggotty into breaking her legs
i found it rather harassing to live in this state of siege but was too much afraid of mrs crupp to see any way out of it
my dear copperfield cried traddles punctually appearing at my door in spite of all these obstacles how do you do my dear traddles said i i am delighted to see you at last and very sorry i have not been at home before
but i have been so much engaged yes yes i know said traddles of course
yours lives in london i think what did you say sheexcuse memiss d you know said traddles colouring in his great delicacy lives in london i believe oh yes
near london mine perhaps you recollect said traddles with a serious look lives down in devonshireone of ten
consequently i am not so much engaged as youin that sense i wonder you can bear i returned to see her so seldom hah said traddles thoughtfully
it does seem a wonder
i suppose it is copperfield because there is no help for it i suppose so i replied with a smile and not without a blush
and because you have so much constancy and patience traddles dear me said traddles considering about it do i strike you in that way copperfield
really i didnt know that i had
but she is such an extraordinarily dear girl herself that its possible she may have imparted something of those virtues to me
now you mention it copperfield i shouldnt wonder at all
i assure you she is always forgetting herself and taking care of the other nine is she the eldest i inquired
oh dear no said traddles
the eldest is a beauty he saw i suppose that i could not help smiling at the simplicity of this reply and added with a smile upon his own ingenuous face not of course but that my sophypretty name copperfield i always think very pretty said i
not of course but that sophy is beautiful too in my eyes and would be one of the dearest girls that ever was in anybodys eyes i should think
but when i say the eldest is a beauty i mean she really is a he seemed to be describing clouds about himself with both hands splendid you know said traddles energetically
indeed said i
oh i assure you said traddles something very uncommon indeed
then you know being formed for society and admiration and not being able to enjoy much of it in consequence of their limited means she naturally gets a little irritable and exacting sometimes
sophy puts her in good humour is sophy the youngest i hazarded
oh dear no said traddles stroking his chin
the two youngest are only nine and ten
sophy educates em the second daughter perhaps i hazarded
no said traddles
sarahs the second
sarah has something the matter with her spine poor girl
the malady will wear out by and by the doctors say but in the meantime she has to lie down for a twelvemonth
sophy nurses her
sophys the fourth is the mother living i inquired
oh yes said traddles she is alive
she is a very superior woman indeed but the damp country is not adapted to her constitution andin fact she has lost the use of her limbs dear me said i
very sad is it not returned traddles
but in a merely domestic view it is not so bad as it might be because sophy takes her place
she is quite as much a mother to her mother as she is to the other nine i felt the greatest admiration for the virtues of this young lady and honestly with the view of doing my best to prevent the goodnature of traddles from being imposed upon to the detriment of their joint prospects in life inquired how mr micawber was
he is quite well copperfield thank you said traddles
i am not living with him at present no no
you see the truth is said traddles in a whisper he had changed his name to mortimer in consequence of his temporary embarrassments and he dont come out till after darkand then in spectacles
there was an execution put into our house for rent
mrs micawber was in such a dreadful state that i really couldnt resist giving my name to that second bill we spoke of here
you may imagine how delightful it was to my feelings copperfield to see the matter settled with it and mrs micawber recover her spirits hum said i
not that her happiness was of long duration pursued traddles for unfortunately within a week another execution came in
it broke up the establishment
i have been living in a furnished apartment since then and the mortimers have been very private indeed
i hope you wont think it selfish copperfield if i mention that the broker carried off my little round table with the marble top and sophys flowerpot and stand what a hard thing i exclaimed indignantly
it was ait was a pull said traddles with his usual wince at that expression
i dont mention it reproachfully however but with a motive
the fact is copperfield i was unable to repurchase them at the time of their seizure in the first place because the broker having an idea that i wanted them ran the price up to an extravagant extent and in the second place because ihadnt any money
now i have kept my eye since upon the brokers shop said traddles with a great enjoyment of his mystery which is up at the top of tottenham court road and at last today i find them put out for sale
i have only noticed them from over the way because if the broker saw me bless you hed ask any price for them
what has occurred to me having now the money is that perhaps you wouldnt object to ask that good nurse of yours to come with me to the shopi can show it her from round the corner of the next streetand make the best bargain for them as if they were for herself that she can the delight with which traddles propounded this plan to me and the sense he had of its uncommon artfulness are among the freshest things in my remembrance
i told him that my old nurse would be delighted to assist him and that we would all three take the field together but on one condition
that condition was that he should make a solemn resolution to grant no more loans of his name or anything else to mr micawber
my dear copperfield said traddles i have already done so because i begin to feel that i have not only been inconsiderate but that i have been positively unjust to sophy
my word being passed to myself there is no longer any apprehension but i pledge it to you too with the greatest readiness
that first unlucky obligation i have paid
i have no doubt mr micawber would have paid it if he could but he could not
one thing i ought to mention which i like very much in mr micawber copperfield
it refers to the second obligation which is not yet due
he dont tell me that it is provided for but he says it will be
now i think there is something very fair and honest about that i was unwilling to damp my good friends confidence and therefore assented
after a little further conversation we went round to the chandlers shop to enlist peggotty traddles declining to pass the evening with me both because he endured the liveliest apprehensions that his property would be bought by somebody else before he could repurchase it and because it was the evening he always devoted to writing to the dearest girl in the world
i never shall forget him peeping round the corner of the street in tottenham court road while peggotty was bargaining for the precious articles or his agitation when she came slowly towards us after vainly offering a price and was hailed by the relenting broker and went back again
the end of the negotiation was that she bought the property on tolerably easy terms and traddles was transported with pleasure
i am very much obliged to you indeed said traddles on hearing it was to be sent to where he lived that night
if i might ask one other favour i hope you would not think it absurd copperfield i said beforehand certainly not
then if you would be good enough said traddles to peggotty to get the flowerpot now i think i should like it being sophys copperfield to carry it home myself peggotty was glad to get it for him and he overwhelmed her with thanks and went his way up tottenham court road carrying the flowerpot affectionately in his arms with one of the most delighted expressions of countenance i ever saw
we then turned back towards my chambers
as the shops had charms for peggotty which i never knew them possess in the same degree for anybody else i sauntered easily along amused by her staring in at the windows and waiting for her as often as she chose
we were thus a good while in getting to the adelphi
on our way upstairs i called her attention to the sudden disappearance of mrs crupps pitfalls and also to the prints of recent footsteps
we were both very much surprised coming higher up to find my outer door standing open which i had shut and to hear voices inside
we looked at one another without knowing what to make of this and went into the sittingroom
what was my amazement to find of all people upon earth my aunt there and mr dick
my aunt sitting on a quantity of luggage with her two birds before her and her cat on her knee like a female robinson crusoe drinking tea
mr dick leaning thoughtfully on a great kite such as we had often been out together to fly with more luggage piled about him
my dear aunt cried i
why what an unexpected pleasure we cordially embraced and mr dick and i cordially shook hands and mrs crupp who was busy making tea and could not be too attentive cordially said she had knowed well as mr copperfull would have his heart in his mouth when he see his dear relations
holloa said my aunt to peggotty who quailed before her awful presence
how are you you remember my aunt peggotty said i
for the love of goodness child exclaimed my aunt dont call the woman by that south sea island name
if she married and got rid of it which was the best thing she could do why dont you give her the benefit of the change
whats your name nowp said my aunt as a compromise for the obnoxious appellation
barkis maam said peggotty with a curtsey
well
thats human said my aunt
it sounds less as if you wanted a missionary
how dye do barkis
i hope youre well encouraged by these gracious words and by my aunts extending her hand barkis came forward and took the hand and curtseyed her acknowledgements
we are older than we were i see said my aunt
we have only met each other once before you know
a nice business we made of it then
trot my dear another cup i handed it dutifully to my aunt who was in her usual inflexible state of figure and ventured a remonstrance with her on the subject of her sitting on a box
let me draw the sofa here or the easychair aunt said i
why should you be so uncomfortable thank you trot replied my aunt i prefer to sit upon my property here my aunt looked hard at mrs crupp and observed we neednt trouble you to wait maam shall i put a little more tea in the pot afore i go maam said mrs crupp
no i thank you maam replied my aunt
would you let me fetch another pat of butter maam said mrs crupp
or would you be persuaded to try a newlaid hegg
or should i brile a rasher
aint there nothing i could do for your dear aunt mr copperfull nothing maam returned my aunt
i shall do very well i thank you mrs crupp who had been incessantly smiling to express sweet temper and incessantly holding her head on one side to express a general feebleness of constitution and incessantly rubbing her hands to express a desire to be of service to all deserving objects gradually smiled herself onesided herself and rubbed herself out of the room
dick said my aunt
you know what i told you about timeservers and wealthworshippers mr dickwith rather a scared look as if he had forgotten itreturned a hasty answer in the affirmative
mrs
crupp is one of them said my aunt
barkis ill trouble you to look after the tea and let me have another cup for i dont fancy that womans pouringout i knew my aunt sufficiently well to know that she had something of importance on her mind and that there was far more matter in this arrival than a stranger might have supposed
i noticed how her eye lighted on me when she thought my attention otherwise occupied and what a curious process of hesitation appeared to be going on within her while she preserved her outward stiffness and composure
i began to reflect whether i had done anything to offend her and my conscience whispered me that i had not yet told her about dora
could it by any means be that i wondered
as i knew she would only speak in her own good time i sat down near her and spoke to the birds and played with the cat and was as easy as i could be
but i was very far from being really easy and i should still have been so even if mr dick leaning over the great kite behind my aunt had not taken every secret opportunity of shaking his head darkly at me and pointing at her
trot said my aunt at last when she had finished her tea and carefully smoothed down her dress and wiped her lipsyou neednt go barkistrot have you got to be firm and selfreliant i hope so aunt what do you think inquired miss betsey
i think so aunt then why my love said my aunt looking earnestly at me why do you think i prefer to sit upon this property of mine tonight i shook my head unable to guess
because said my aunt its all i have
because im ruined my dear if the house and every one of us had tumbled out into the river together i could hardly have received a greater shock
dick knows it said my aunt laying her hand calmly on my shoulder
i am ruined my dear trot
all i have in the world is in this room except the cottage and that i have left janet to let
barkis i want to get a bed for this gentleman tonight
to save expense perhaps you can make up something here for myself
anything will do
its only for tonight
well talk about this more tomorrow i was roused from my amazement and concern for heri am sure for herby her falling on my neck for a moment and crying that she only grieved for me
in another moment she suppressed this emotion and said with an aspect more triumphant than dejected we must meet reverses boldly and not suffer them to frighten us my dear
we must learn to act the play out
we must live misfortune down trot as soon as i could recover my presence of mind which quite deserted me in the first overpowering shock of my aunts intelligence i proposed to mr dick to come round to the chandlers shop and take possession of the bed which mr peggotty had lately vacated
the chandlers shop being in hungerford market and hungerford market being a very different place in those days there was a low wooden colonnade before the door not very unlike that before the house where the little man and woman used to live in the old weatherglass which pleased mr dick mightily
the glory of lodging over this structure would have compensated him i dare say for many inconveniences but as there were really few to bear beyond the compound of flavours i have already mentioned and perhaps the want of a little more elbowroom he was perfectly charmed with his accommodation
mrs crupp had indignantly assured him that there wasnt room to swing a cat there but as mr dick justly observed to me sitting down on the foot of the bed nursing his leg you know trotwood i dont want to swing a cat
i never do swing a cat
therefore what does that signify to me i tried to ascertain whether mr dick had any understanding of the causes of this sudden and great change in my aunts affairs
as i might have expected he had none at all
the only account he could give of it was that my aunt had said to him the day before yesterday now dick are you really and truly the philosopher i take you for that then he had said yes he hoped so
that then my aunt had said dick i am ruined that then he had said oh indeed that then my aunt had praised him highly which he was glad of
and that then they had come to me and had had bottled porter and sandwiches on the road
mr dick was so very complacent sitting on the foot of the bed nursing his leg and telling me this with his eyes wide open and a surprised smile that i am sorry to say i was provoked into explaining to him that ruin meant distress want and starvation but i was soon bitterly reproved for this harshness by seeing his face turn pale and tears course down his lengthened cheeks while he fixed upon me a look of such unutterable woe that it might have softened a far harder heart than mine
i took infinitely greater pains to cheer him up again than i had taken to depress him and i soon understood as i ought to have known at first that he had been so confident merely because of his faith in the wisest and most wonderful of women and his unbounded reliance on my intellectual resources
the latter i believe he considered a match for any kind of disaster not absolutely mortal
what can we do trotwood said mr dick
theres the memorial to be sure there is said i
but all we can do just now mr dick is to keep a cheerful countenance and not let my aunt see that we are thinking about it he assented to this in the most earnest manner and implored me if i should see him wandering an inch out of the right course to recall him by some of those superior methods which were always at my command
but i regret to state that the fright i had given him proved too much for his best attempts at concealment
all the evening his eyes wandered to my aunts face with an expression of the most dismal apprehension as if he saw her growing thin on the spot
he was conscious of this and put a constraint upon his head but his keeping that immovable and sitting rolling his eyes like a piece of machinery did not mend the matter at all
i saw him look at the loaf at supper which happened to be a small one as if nothing else stood between us and famine and when my aunt insisted on his making his customary repast i detected him in the act of pocketing fragments of his bread and cheese i have no doubt for the purpose of reviving us with those savings when we should have reached an advanced stage of attenuation
my aunt on the other hand was in a composed frame of mind which was a lesson to all of usto me i am sure
she was extremely gracious to peggotty except when i inadvertently called her by that name and strange as i knew she felt in london appeared quite at home
she was to have my bed and i was to lie in the sittingroom to keep guard over her
she made a great point of being so near the river in case of a conflagration and i suppose really did find some satisfaction in that circumstance
trot my dear said my aunt when she saw me making preparations for compounding her usual nightdraught no nothing aunt not wine my dear
ale but there is wine here aunt
and you always have it made of wine keep that in case of sickness said my aunt
we mustnt use it carelessly trot
ale for me
half a pint i thought mr dick would have fallen insensible
my aunt being resolute i went out and got the ale myself
as it was growing late peggotty and mr dick took that opportunity of repairing to the chandlers shop together
i parted from him poor fellow at the corner of the street with his great kite at his back a very monument of human misery
my aunt was walking up and down the room when i returned crimping the borders of her nightcap with her fingers
i warmed the ale and made the toast on the usual infallible principles
when it was ready for her she was ready for it with her nightcap on and the skirt of her gown turned back on her knees
my dear said my aunt after taking a spoonful of it its a great deal better than wine
not half so bilious i suppose i looked doubtful for she added tut tut child
if nothing worse than ale happens to us we are well off i should think so myself aunt i am sure said i
well then why dont you think so said my aunt
because you and i are very different people i returned
stuff and nonsense trot replied my aunt
my aunt went on with a quiet enjoyment in which there was very little affectation if any drinking the warm ale with a teaspoon and soaking her strips of toast in it
trot said she i dont care for strange faces in general but i rather like that barkis of yours do you know its better than a hundred pounds to hear you say so said i
its a most extraordinary world observed my aunt rubbing her nose how that woman ever got into it with that name is unaccountable to me
it would be much more easy to be born a jackson or something of that sort one would think perhaps she thinks so too its not her fault said i
i suppose not returned my aunt rather grudging the admission but its very aggravating
however shes barkis now
thats some comfort
barkis is uncommonly fond of you trot there is nothing she would leave undone to prove it said i
nothing i believe returned my aunt
here the poor fool has been begging and praying about handing over some of her moneybecause she has got too much of it
a simpleton my aunts tears of pleasure were positively trickling down into the warm ale
shes the most ridiculous creature that ever was born said my aunt
i knew from the first moment when i saw her with that poor dear blessed baby of a mother of yours that she was the most ridiculous of mortals
but there are good points in barkis affecting to laugh she got an opportunity of putting her hand to her eyes
having availed herself of it she resumed her toast and her discourse together
ah
mercy upon us sighed my aunt
i know all about it trot
barkis and myself had quite a gossip while you were out with dick
i know all about it
i dont know where these wretched girls expect to go to for my part
i wonder they dont knock out their brains againstagainst mantelpieces said my aunt an idea which was probably suggested to her by her contemplation of mine
poor emily said i
oh dont talk to me about poor returned my aunt
she should have thought of that before she caused so much misery
give me a kiss trot
i am sorry for your early experience as i bent forward she put her tumbler on my knee to detain me and said oh trot trot
and so you fancy yourself in love
do you fancy aunt i exclaimed as red as i could be
i adore her with my whole soul dora indeed returned my aunt
and you mean to say the little thing is very fascinating i suppose my dear aunt i replied no one can form the least idea what she is ah
and not silly said my aunt
silly aunt i seriously believe it had never once entered my head for a single moment to consider whether she was or not
i resented the idea of course but i was in a manner struck by it as a new one altogether
not lightheaded said my aunt
lightheaded aunt i could only repeat this daring speculation with the same kind of feeling with which i had repeated the preceding question
well well said my aunt
i only ask
i dont depreciate her
poor little couple
and so you think you were formed for one another and are to go through a partysuppertable kind of life like two pretty pieces of confectionery do you trot she asked me this so kindly and with such a gentle air half playful and half sorrowful that i was quite touched
we are young and inexperienced aunt i know i replied and i dare say we say and think a good deal that is rather foolish
but we love one another truly i am sure
if i thought dora could ever love anybody else or cease to love me or that i could ever love anybody else or cease to love her i dont know what i should dogo out of my mind i think ah trot said my aunt shaking her head and smiling gravely blind blind blind someone that i know trot my aunt pursued after a pause though of a very pliant disposition has an earnestness of affection in him that reminds me of poor baby
earnestness is what that somebody must look for to sustain him and improve him trot
deep downright faithful earnestness if you only knew the earnestness of dora aunt i cried
oh trot she said again blind blind and without knowing why i felt a vague unhappy loss or want of something overshadow me like a cloud
however said my aunt i dont want to put two young creatures out of conceit with themselves or to make them unhappy so though it is a girl and boy attachment and girl and boy attachments very oftenmind
i dont say alwayscome to nothing still well be serious about it and hope for a prosperous issue one of these days
theres time enough for it to come to anything this was not upon the whole very comforting to a rapturous lover but i was glad to have my aunt in my confidence and i was mindful of her being fatigued
so i thanked her ardently for this mark of her affection and for all her other kindnesses towards me and after a tender good night she took her nightcap into my bedroom
how miserable i was when i lay down
how i thought and thought about my being poor in mr spenlows eyes about my not being what i thought i was when i proposed to dora about the chivalrous necessity of telling dora what my worldly condition was and releasing her from her engagement if she thought fit about how i should contrive to live during the long term of my articles when i was earning nothing about doing something to assist my aunt and seeing no way of doing anything about coming down to have no money in my pocket and to wear a shabby coat and to be able to carry dora no little presents and to ride no gallant greys and to show myself in no agreeable light
sordid and selfish as i knew it was and as i tortured myself by knowing that it was to let my mind run on my own distress so much i was so devoted to dora that i could not help it
i knew that it was base in me not to think more of my aunt and less of myself but so far selfishness was inseparable from dora and i could not put dora on one side for any mortal creature
how exceedingly miserable i was that night
as to sleep i had dreams of poverty in all sorts of shapes but i seemed to dream without the previous ceremony of going to sleep
now i was ragged wanting to sell dora matches six bundles for a halfpenny now i was at the office in a nightgown and boots remonstrated with by mr spenlow on appearing before the clients in that airy attire now i was hungrily picking up the crumbs that fell from old tiffeys daily biscuit regularly eaten when st pauls struck one now i was hopelessly endeavouring to get a licence to marry dora having nothing but one of uriah heeps gloves to offer in exchange which the whole commons rejected and still more or less conscious of my own room i was always tossing about like a distressed ship in a sea of bedclothes
my aunt was restless too for i frequently heard her walking to and fro
two or three times in the course of the night attired in a long flannel wrapper in which she looked seven feet high she appeared like a disturbed ghost in my room and came to the side of the sofa on which i lay
on the first occasion i started up in alarm to learn that she inferred from a particular light in the sky that westminster abbey was on fire and to be consulted in reference to the probability of its igniting buckingham street in case the wind changed
lying still after that i found that she sat down near me whispering to herself poor boy and then it made me twenty times more wretched to know how unselfishly mindful she was of me and how selfishly mindful i was of myself
it was difficult to believe that a night so long to me could be short to anybody else
this consideration set me thinking and thinking of an imaginary party where people were dancing the hours away until that became a dream too and i heard the music incessantly playing one tune and saw dora incessantly dancing one dance without taking the least notice of me
the man who had been playing the harp all night was trying in vain to cover it with an ordinarysized nightcap when i awoke or i should rather say when i left off trying to go to sleep and saw the sun shining in through the window at last
there was an old roman bath in those days at the bottom of one of the streets out of the strandit may be there stillin which i have had many a cold plunge
dressing myself as quietly as i could and leaving peggotty to look after my aunt i tumbled head foremost into it and then went for a walk to hampstead
i had a hope that this brisk treatment might freshen my wits a little and i think it did them good for i soon came to the conclusion that the first step i ought to take was to try if my articles could be cancelled and the premium recovered
i got some breakfast on the heath and walked back to doctors commons along the watered roads and through a pleasant smell of summer flowers growing in gardens and carried into town on hucksters heads intent on this first effort to meet our altered circumstances
i arrived at the office so soon after all that i had half an hours loitering about the commons before old tiffey who was always first appeared with his key
then i sat down in my shady corner looking up at the sunlight on the opposite chimneypots and thinking about dora until mr spenlow came in crisp and curly
how are you copperfield said he
fine morning beautiful morning sir said i
could i say a word to you before you go into court by all means said he
come into my room i followed him into his room and he began putting on his gown and touching himself up before a little glass he had hanging inside a closet door
i am sorry to say said i that i have some rather disheartening intelligence from my aunt no said he
dear me
not paralysis i hope it has no reference to her health sir i replied
she has met with some large losses
in fact she has very little left indeed you astound me copperfield cried mr spenlow
i shook my head
indeed sir said i her affairs are so changed that i wished to ask you whether it would be possibleat a sacrifice on our part of some portion of the premium of course i put in this on the spur of the moment warned by the blank expression of his faceto cancel my articles what it cost me to make this proposal nobody knows
it was like asking as a favour to be sentenced to transportation from dora
to cancel your articles copperfield
cancel i explained with tolerable firmness that i really did not know where my means of subsistence were to come from unless i could earn them for myself
i had no fear for the future i saidand i laid great emphasis on that as if to imply that i should still be decidedly eligible for a soninlaw one of these daysbut for the present i was thrown upon my own resources
i am extremely sorry to hear this copperfield said mr spenlow
extremely sorry
it is not usual to cancel articles for any such reason
it is not a professional course of proceeding
it is not a convenient precedent at all
far from it
at the same time you are very good sir i murmured anticipating a concession
not at all
dont mention it said mr spenlow
at the same time i was going to say if it had been my lot to have my hands unfetteredif i had not a partnermr jorkins my hopes were dashed in a moment but i made another effort
do you think sir said i if i were to mention it to mr jorkins mr spenlow shook his head discouragingly
heaven forbid copperfield he replied that i should do any man an injustice still less mr jorkins
but i know my partner copperfield
mr jorkins is not a man to respond to a proposition of this peculiar nature
mr jorkins is very difficult to move from the beaten track
you know what he is i am sure i knew nothing about him except that he had originally been alone in the business and now lived by himself in a house near montagu square which was fearfully in want of painting that he came very late of a day and went away very early that he never appeared to be consulted about anything and that he had a dingy little blackhole of his own upstairs where no business was ever done and where there was a yellow old cartridgepaper pad upon his desk unsoiled by ink and reported to be twenty years of age
would you object to my mentioning it to him sir i asked
by no means said mr spenlow
but i have some experience of mr jorkins copperfield
i wish it were otherwise for i should be happy to meet your views in any respect
i cannot have the objection to your mentioning it to mr jorkins copperfield if you think it worth while availing myself of this permission which was given with a warm shake of the hand i sat thinking about dora and looking at the sunlight stealing from the chimneypots down the wall of the opposite house until mr jorkins came
i then went up to mr jorkinss room and evidently astonished mr jorkins very much by making my appearance there
come in mr copperfield said mr jorkins
come in i went in and sat down and stated my case to mr jorkins pretty much as i had stated it to mr spenlow
mr jorkins was not by any means the awful creature one might have expected but a large mild smoothfaced man of sixty who took so much snuff that there was a tradition in the commons that he lived principally on that stimulant having little room in his system for any other article of diet
you have mentioned this to mr spenlow i suppose said mr jorkins when he had heard me very restlessly to an end
i answered yes and told him that mr spenlow had introduced his name
he said i should object asked mr jorkins
i was obliged to admit that mr spenlow had considered it probable
i am sorry to say mr copperfield i cant advance your object said mr jorkins nervously
the fact isbut i have an appointment at the bank if youll have the goodness to excuse me with that he rose in a great hurry and was going out of the room when i made bold to say that i feared then there was no way of arranging the matter
no said mr jorkins stopping at the door to shake his head
oh no
i object you know which he said very rapidly and went out
you must be aware mr copperfield he added looking restlessly in at the door again if mr spenlow objects personally he does not object sir said i
oh
personally repeated mr jorkins in an impatient manner
i assure you theres an objection mr copperfield
hopeless
what you wish to be done cant be done
ii really have got an appointment at the bank with that he fairly ran away and to the best of my knowledge it was three days before he showed himself in the commons again
being very anxious to leave no stone unturned i waited until mr spenlow came in and then described what had passed giving him to understand that i was not hopeless of his being able to soften the adamantine jorkins if he would undertake the task
copperfield returned mr spenlow with a gracious smile you have not known my partner mr jorkins as long as i have
nothing is farther from my thoughts than to attribute any degree of artifice to mr jorkins
but mr jorkins has a way of stating his objections which often deceives people
no copperfield shaking his head
mr
jorkins is not to be moved believe me i was completely bewildered between mr spenlow and mr jorkins as to which of them really was the objecting partner but i saw with sufficient clearness that there was obduracy somewhere in the firm and that the recovery of my aunts thousand pounds was out of the question
in a state of despondency which i remember with anything but satisfaction for i know it still had too much reference to myself though always in connexion with dora i left the office and went homeward
i was trying to familiarize my mind with the worst and to present to myself the arrangements we should have to make for the future in their sternest aspect when a hackneychariot coming after me and stopping at my very feet occasioned me to look up
a fair hand was stretched forth to me from the window and the face i had never seen without a feeling of serenity and happiness from the moment when it first turned back on the old oak staircase with the great broad balustrade and when i associated its softened beauty with the stainedglass window in the church was smiling on me
agnes i joyfully exclaimed
oh my dear agnes of all people in the world what a pleasure to see you is it indeed she said in her cordial voice
i want to talk to you so much said i
its such a lightening of my heart only to look at you
if i had had a conjurors cap there is no one i should have wished for but you what returned agnes
well
perhaps dora first i admitted with a blush
certainly dora first i hope said agnes laughing
but you next said i
where are you going she was going to my rooms to see my aunt
the day being very fine she was glad to come out of the chariot which smelt i had my head in it all this time like a stable put under a cucumberframe
i dismissed the coachman and she took my arm and we walked on together
she was like hope embodied to me
how different i felt in one short minute having agnes at my side
my aunt had written her one of the odd abrupt notesvery little longer than a bank noteto which her epistolary efforts were usually limited
she had stated therein that she had fallen into adversity and was leaving dover for good but had quite made up her mind to it and was so well that nobody need be uncomfortable about her
agnes had come to london to see my aunt between whom and herself there had been a mutual liking these many years indeed it dated from the time of my taking up my residence in mr wickfields house
she was not alone she said
her papa was with herand uriah heep
and now they are partners said i
confound him yes said agnes
they have some business here and i took advantage of their coming to come too
you must not think my visit all friendly and disinterested trotwood fori am afraid i may be cruelly prejudicedi do not like to let papa go away alone with him does he exercise the same influence over mr wickfield still agnes agnes shook her head
there is such a change at home said she that you would scarcely know the dear old house
they live with us now they said i
mr
heep and his mother
he sleeps in your old room said agnes looking up into my face
i wish i had the ordering of his dreams said i
he wouldnt sleep there long i keep my own little room said agnes where i used to learn my lessons
how the time goes
you remember
the little panelled room that opens from the drawingroom remember agnes
when i saw you for the first time coming out at the door with your quaint little basket of keys hanging at your side it is just the same said agnes smiling
i am glad you think of it so pleasantly
we were very happy we were indeed said i
i keep that room to myself still but i cannot always desert mrs heep you know
and so said agnes quietly i feel obliged to bear her company when i might prefer to be alone
but i have no other reason to complain of her
if she tires me sometimes by her praises of her son it is only natural in a mother
he is a very good son to her i looked at agnes when she said these words without detecting in her any consciousness of uriahs design
her mild but earnest eyes met mine with their own beautiful frankness and there was no change in her gentle face
the chief evil of their presence in the house said agnes is that i cannot be as near papa as i could wishuriah heep being so much between usand cannot watch over him if that is not too bold a thing to say as closely as i would
but if any fraud or treachery is practising against him i hope that simple love and truth will be strong in the end
i hope that real love and truth are stronger in the end than any evil or misfortune in the world a certain bright smile which i never saw on any other face died away even while i thought how good it was and how familiar it had once been to me and she asked me with a quick change of expression we were drawing very near my street if i knew how the reverse in my aunts circumstances had been brought about
on my replying no she had not told me yet agnes became thoughtful and i fancied i felt her arm tremble in mine
we found my aunt alone in a state of some excitement
a difference of opinion had arisen between herself and mrs crupp on an abstract question the propriety of chambers being inhabited by the gentler sex and my aunt utterly indifferent to spasms on the part of mrs crupp had cut the dispute short by informing that lady that she smelt of my brandy and that she would trouble her to walk out
both of these expressions mrs crupp considered actionable and had expressed her intention of bringing before a british judymeaning it was supposed the bulwark of our national liberties
my aunt however having had time to cool while peggotty was out showing mr dick the soldiers at the horse guardsand being besides greatly pleased to see agnesrather plumed herself on the affair than otherwise and received us with unimpaired good humour
when agnes laid her bonnet on the table and sat down beside her i could not but think looking on her mild eyes and her radiant forehead how natural it seemed to have her there how trustfully although she was so young and inexperienced my aunt confided in her how strong she was indeed in simple love and truth
we began to talk about my aunts losses and i told them what i had tried to do that morning
which was injudicious trot said my aunt but well meant
you are a generous boyi suppose i must say young man nowand i am proud of you my dear
so far so good
now trot and agnes let us look the case of betsey trotwood in the face and see how it stands i observed agnes turn pale as she looked very attentively at my aunt
my aunt patting her cat looked very attentively at agnes
betsey trotwood said my aunt who had always kept her money matters to herself
i dont mean your sister trot my dear but myselfhad a certain property
it dont matter how much enough to live on
more for she had saved a little and added to it
betsey funded her property for some time and then by the advice of her man of business laid it out on landed security
that did very well and returned very good interest till betsey was paid off
i am talking of betsey as if she was a manofwar
well
then betsey had to look about her for a new investment
she thought she was wiser now than her man of business who was not such a good man of business by this time as he used to bei am alluding to your father agnesand she took it into her head to lay it out for herself
so she took her pigs said my aunt to a foreign market and a very bad market it turned out to be
first she lost in the mining way and then she lost in the diving wayfishing up treasure or some such tom tiddler nonsense explained my aunt rubbing her nose and then she lost in the mining way again and last of all to set the thing entirely to rights she lost in the banking way
i dont know what the bank shares were worth for a little while said my aunt cent per cent was the lowest of it i believe but the bank was at the other end of the world and tumbled into space for what i know anyhow it fell to pieces and never will and never can pay sixpence and betseys sixpences were all there and theres an end of them
least said soonest mended my aunt concluded this philosophical summary by fixing her eyes with a kind of triumph on agnes whose colour was gradually returning
dear miss trotwood is that all the history said agnes
i hope its enough child said my aunt
if there had been more money to lose it wouldnt have been all i dare say
betsey would have contrived to throw that after the rest and make another chapter i have little doubt
but there was no more money and theres no more story agnes had listened at first with suspended breath
her colour still came and went but she breathed more freely
i thought i knew why
i thought she had had some fear that her unhappy father might be in some way to blame for what had happened
my aunt took her hand in hers and laughed
is that all repeated my aunt
why yes thats all except and she lived happy ever afterwards perhaps i may add that of betsey yet one of these days
now agnes you have a wise head
so have you trot in some things though i cant compliment you always and here my aunt shook her own at me with an energy peculiar to herself
whats to be done
heres the cottage taking one time with another will produce say seventy pounds a year
i think we may safely put it down at that
wellthats all weve got said my aunt with whom it was an idiosyncrasy as it is with some horses to stop very short when she appeared to be in a fair way of going on for a long while
then said my aunt after a rest theres dick
hes good for a hundred ayear but of course that must be expended on himself
i would sooner send him away though i know i am the only person who appreciates him than have him and not spend his money on himself
how can trot and i do best upon our means
what do you say agnes i say aunt i interposed that i must do something go for a soldier do you mean returned my aunt alarmed or go to sea
i wont hear of it
you are to be a proctor
were not going to have any knockings on the head in this family if you please sir i was about to explain that i was not desirous of introducing that mode of provision into the family when agnes inquired if my rooms were held for any long term
you come to the point my dear said my aunt
they are not to be got rid of for six months at least unless they could be underlet and that i dont believe
the last man died here
five people out of six would dieof courseof that woman in nankeen with the flannel petticoat
i have a little ready money and i agree with you the best thing we can do is to live the term out here and get a bedroom hard by i thought it my duty to hint at the discomfort my aunt would sustain from living in a continual state of guerilla warfare with mrs crupp but she disposed of that objection summarily by declaring that on the first demonstration of hostilities she was prepared to astonish mrs crupp for the whole remainder of her natural life
i have been thinking trotwood said agnes diffidently that if you had time i have a good deal of time agnes
i am always disengaged after four or five oclock and i have time early in the morning
in one way and another said i conscious of reddening a little as i thought of the hours and hours i had devoted to fagging about town and to and fro upon the norwood road i have abundance of time i know you would not mind said agnes coming to me and speaking in a low voice so full of sweet and hopeful consideration that i hear it now the duties of a secretary mind my dear agnes because continued agnes doctor strong has acted on his intention of retiring and has come to live in london and he asked papa i know if he could recommend him one
dont you think he would rather have his favourite old pupil near him than anybody else dear agnes said i
what should i do without you
you are always my good angel
i told you so
i never think of you in any other light agnes answered with her pleasant laugh that one good angel meaning dora was enough and went on to remind me that the doctor had been used to occupy himself in his study early in the morning and in the eveningand that probably my leisure would suit his requirements very well
i was scarcely more delighted with the prospect of earning my own bread than with the hope of earning it under my old master in short acting on the advice of agnes i sat down and wrote a letter to the doctor stating my object and appointing to call on him next day at ten in the forenoon
this i addressed to highgatefor in that place so memorable to me he livedand went and posted myself without losing a minute
wherever agnes was some agreeable token of her noiseless presence seemed inseparable from the place
when i came back i found my aunts birds hanging just as they had hung so long in the parlour window of the cottage and my easychair imitating my aunts much easier chair in its position at the open window and even the round green fan which my aunt had brought away with her screwed on to the windowsill
i knew who had done all this by its seeming to have quietly done itself and i should have known in a moment who had arranged my neglected books in the old order of my school days even if i had supposed agnes to be miles away instead of seeing her busy with them and smiling at the disorder into which they had fallen
my aunt was quite gracious on the subject of the thames it really did look very well with the sun upon it though not like the sea before the cottage but she could not relent towards the london smoke which she said peppered everything
a complete revolution in which peggotty bore a prominent part was being effected in every corner of my rooms in regard of this pepper and i was looking on thinking how little even peggotty seemed to do with a good deal of bustle and how much agnes did without any bustle at all when a knock came at the door
i think said agnes turning pale its papa
he promised me that he would come i opened the door and admitted not only mr wickfield but uriah heep
i had not seen mr wickfield for some time
i was prepared for a great change in him after what i had heard from agnes but his appearance shocked me
it was not that he looked many years older though still dressed with the old scrupulous cleanliness or that there was an unwholesome ruddiness upon his face or that his eyes were full and bloodshot or that there was a nervous trembling in his hand the cause of which i knew and had for some years seen at work
it was not that he had lost his good looks or his old bearing of a gentlemanfor that he had notbut the thing that struck me most was that with the evidences of his native superiority still upon him he should submit himself to that crawling impersonation of meanness uriah heep
the reversal of the two natures in their relative positions uriahs of power and mr wickfields of dependence was a sight more painful to me than i can express
if i had seen an ape taking command of a man i should hardly have thought it a more degrading spectacle
he appeared to be only too conscious of it himself
when he came in he stood still and with his head bowed as if he felt it
this was only for a moment for agnes softly said to him papa
here is miss trotwoodand trotwood whom you have not seen for a long while and then he approached and constrainedly gave my aunt his hand and shook hands more cordially with me
in the moments pause i speak of i saw uriahs countenance form itself into a most illfavoured smile
agnes saw it too i think for she shrank from him
what my aunt saw or did not see i defy the science of physiognomy to have made out without her own consent
i believe there never was anybody with such an imperturbable countenance when she chose
her face might have been a deadwall on the occasion in question for any light it threw upon her thoughts until she broke silence with her usual abruptness
well wickfield said my aunt and he looked up at her for the first time
i have been telling your daughter how well i have been disposing of my money for myself because i couldnt trust it to you as you were growing rusty in business matters
we have been taking counsel together and getting on very well all things considered
agnes is worth the whole firm in my opinion if i may umbly make the remark said uriah heep with a writhe i fully agree with miss betsey trotwood and should be only too appy if miss agnes was a partner youre a partner yourself you know returned my aunt and thats about enough for you i expect
how do you find yourself sir in acknowledgement of this question addressed to him with extraordinary curtness mr heep uncomfortably clutching the blue bag he carried replied that he was pretty well he thanked my aunt and hoped she was the same
and you masteri should say mister copperfield pursued uriah
i hope i see you well
i am rejoiced to see you mister copperfield even under present circumstances i believed that for he seemed to relish them very much
present circumstances is not what your friends would wish for you mister copperfield but it isnt money makes the man itsi am really unequal with my umble powers to express what it is said uriah with a fawning jerk but it isnt money here he shook hands with me not in the common way but standing at a good distance from me and lifting my hand up and down like a pump handle that he was a little afraid of
and how do you think we are looking master copperfieldi should say mister fawned uriah
dont you find mr wickfield blooming sir
years dont tell much in our firm master copperfield except in raising up the umble namely mother and selfand in developing he added as an afterthought the beautiful namely miss agnes he jerked himself about after this compliment in such an intolerable manner that my aunt who had sat looking straight at him lost all patience
deuce take the man said my aunt sternly whats he about
dont be galvanic sir i ask your pardon miss trotwood returned uriah im aware youre nervous go along with you sir said my aunt anything but appeased
dont presume to say so
i am nothing of the sort
if youre an eel sir conduct yourself like one
if youre a man control your limbs sir
good god said my aunt with great indignation i am not going to be serpentined and corkscrewed out of my senses mr heep was rather abashed as most people might have been by this explosion which derived great additional force from the indignant manner in which my aunt afterwards moved in her chair and shook her head as if she were making snaps or bounces at him
but he said to me aside in a meek voice i am well aware master copperfield that miss trotwood though an excellent lady has a quick temper indeed i think i had the pleasure of knowing her when i was a numble clerk before you did master copperfield and its only natural i am sure that it should be made quicker by present circumstances
the wonder is that it isnt much worse
i only called to say that if there was anything we could do in present circumstances mother or self or wickfield and heepwe should be really glad
i may go so far said uriah with a sickly smile at his partner
uriah heep said mr wickfield in a monotonous forced way is active in the business trotwood
what he says i quite concur in
you know i had an old interest in you
apart from that what uriah says i quite concur in oh what a reward it is said uriah drawing up one leg at the risk of bringing down upon himself another visitation from my aunt to be so trusted in
but i hope i am able to do something to relieve him from the fatigues of business master copperfield uriah heep is a great relief to me said mr wickfield in the same dull voice
its a load off my mind trotwood to have such a partner the red fox made him say all this i knew to exhibit him to me in the light he had indicated on the night when he poisoned my rest
i saw the same illfavoured smile upon his face again and saw how he watched me
you are not going papa said agnes anxiously
will you not walk back with trotwood and me he would have looked to uriah i believe before replying if that worthy had not anticipated him
i am bespoke myself said uriah on business otherwise i should have been appy to have kept with my friends
but i leave my partner to represent the firm
miss agnes ever yours
i wish you goodday master copperfield and leave my umble respects for miss betsey trotwood with those words he retired kissing his great hand and leering at us like a mask
we sat there talking about our pleasant old canterbury days an hour or two
mr wickfield left to agnes soon became more like his former self though there was a settled depression upon him which he never shook off
for all that he brightened and had an evident pleasure in hearing us recall the little incidents of our old life many of which he remembered very well
he said it was like those times to be alone with agnes and me again and he wished to heaven they had never changed
i am sure there was an influence in the placid face of agnes and in the very touch of her hand upon his arm that did wonders for him
my aunt who was busy nearly all this while with peggotty in the inner room would not accompany us to the place where they were staying but insisted on my going and i went
we dined together
after dinner agnes sat beside him as of old and poured out his wine
he took what she gave him and no morelike a childand we all three sat together at a window as the evening gathered in
when it was almost dark he lay down on a sofa agnes pillowing his head and bending over him a little while and when she came back to the window it was not so dark but i could see tears glittering in her eyes
i pray heaven that i never may forget the dear girl in her love and truth at that time of my life for if i should i must be drawing near the end and then i would desire to remember her best
she filled my heart with such good resolutions strengthened my weakness so by her example so directedi know not how she was too modest and gentle to advise me in many wordsthe wandering ardour and unsettled purpose within me that all the little good i have done and all the harm i have forborne i solemnly believe i may refer to her
and how she spoke to me of dora sitting at the window in the dark listened to my praises of her praised again and round the little fairyfigure shed some glimpses of her own pure light that made it yet more precious and more innocent to me
oh agnes sister of my boyhood if i had known then what i knew long afterwards
there was a beggar in the street when i went down and as i turned my head towards the window thinking of her calm seraphic eyes he made me start by muttering as if he were an echo of the morning blind
blind
blind i began the next day with another dive into the roman bath and then started for highgate
i was not dispirited now
i was not afraid of the shabby coat and had no yearnings after gallant greys
my whole manner of thinking of our late misfortune was changed
what i had to do was to show my aunt that her past goodness to me had not been thrown away on an insensible ungrateful object
what i had to do was to turn the painful discipline of my younger days to account by going to work with a resolute and steady heart
what i had to do was to take my woodmans axe in my hand and clear my own way through the forest of difficulty by cutting down the trees until i came to dora
and i went on at a mighty rate as if it could be done by walking
when i found myself on the familiar highgate road pursuing such a different errand from that old one of pleasure with which it was associated it seemed as if a complete change had come on my whole life
but that did not discourage me
with the new life came new purpose new intention
great was the labour priceless the reward
dora was the reward and dora must be won
i got into such a transport that i felt quite sorry my coat was not a little shabby already
i wanted to be cutting at those trees in the forest of difficulty under circumstances that should prove my strength
i had a good mind to ask an old man in wire spectacles who was breaking stones upon the road to lend me his hammer for a little while and let me begin to beat a path to dora out of granite
i stimulated myself into such a heat and got so out of breath that i felt as if i had been earning i dont know how much
in this state i went into a cottage that i saw was to let and examined it narrowlyfor i felt it necessary to be practical
it would do for me and dora admirably with a little front garden for jip to run about in and bark at the tradespeople through the railings and a capital room upstairs for my aunt
i came out again hotter and faster than ever and dashed up to highgate at such a rate that i was there an hour too early and though i had not been should have been obliged to stroll about to cool myself before i was at all presentable
my first care after putting myself under this necessary course of preparation was to find the doctors house
it was not in that part of highgate where mrs steerforth lived but quite on the opposite side of the little town
when i had made this discovery i went back in an attraction i could not resist to a lane by mrs steerforths and looked over the corner of the garden wall
his room was shut up close
the conservatory doors were standing open and rosa dartle was walking bareheaded with a quick impetuous step up and down a gravel walk on one side of the lawn
she gave me the idea of some fierce thing that was dragging the length of its chain to and fro upon a beaten track and wearing its heart out
i came softly away from my place of observation and avoiding that part of the neighbourhood and wishing i had not gone near it strolled about until it was ten oclock
the church with the slender spire that stands on the top of the hill now was not there then to tell me the time
an old redbrick mansion used as a school was in its place and a fine old house it must have been to go to school at as i recollect it
when i approached the doctors cottagea pretty old place on which he seemed to have expended some money if i might judge from the embellishments and repairs that had the look of being just completedi saw him walking in the garden at the side gaiters and all as if he had never left off walking since the days of my pupilage
he had his old companions about him too for there were plenty of high trees in the neighbourhood and two or three rooks were on the grass looking after him as if they had been written to about him by the canterbury rooks and were observing him closely in consequence
knowing the utter hopelessness of attracting his attention from that distance i made bold to open the gate and walk after him so as to meet him when he should turn round
when he did and came towards me he looked at me thoughtfully for a few moments evidently without thinking about me at all and then his benevolent face expressed extraordinary pleasure and he took me by both hands
why my dear copperfield said the doctor you are a man
how do you do
i am delighted to see you
my dear copperfield how very much you have improved
you are quiteyesdear me i hoped he was well and mrs strong too
oh dear yes said the doctor annies quite well and shell be delighted to see you
you were always her favourite
she said so last night when i showed her your letter
andyes to be sureyou recollect mr jack maldon copperfield perfectly sir of course said the doctor
to be sure
hes pretty well too has he come home sir i inquired
from india said the doctor
yes
mr jack maldon couldnt bear the climate my dear
mrs marklehamyou have not forgotten mrs markleham forgotten the old soldier
and in that short time
mrs
markleham said the doctor was quite vexed about him poor thing so we have got him at home again and we have bought him a little patent place which agrees with him much better i knew enough of mr jack maldon to suspect from this account that it was a place where there was not much to do and which was pretty well paid
the doctor walking up and down with his hand on my shoulder and his kind face turned encouragingly to mine went on now my dear copperfield in reference to this proposal of yours
its very gratifying and agreeable to me i am sure but dont you think you could do better
you achieved distinction you know when you were with us
you are qualified for many good things
you have laid a foundation that any edifice may be raised upon and is it not a pity that you should devote the springtime of your life to such a poor pursuit as i can offer i became very glowing again and expressing myself in a rhapsodical style i am afraid urged my request strongly reminding the doctor that i had already a profession
well well said the doctor thats true
certainly your having a profession and being actually engaged in studying it makes a difference
but my good young friend whats seventy pounds a year it doubles our income doctor strong said i
dear me replied the doctor
to think of that
not that i mean to say its rigidly limited to seventy pounds ayear because i have always contemplated making any young friend i might thus employ a present too
undoubtedly said the doctor still walking me up and down with his hand on my shoulder
i have always taken an annual present into account my dear tutor said i now really without any nonsense to whom i owe more obligations already than i ever can acknowledge no no interposed the doctor
pardon me if you will take such time as i have and that is my mornings and evenings and can think it worth seventy pounds a year you will do me such a service as i cannot express dear me said the doctor innocently
to think that so little should go for so much
dear dear
and when you can do better you will
on your word now said the doctorwhich he had always made a very grave appeal to the honour of us boys
on my word sir i returned answering in our old school manner
then be it so said the doctor clapping me on the shoulder and still keeping his hand there as we still walked up and down
and i shall be twenty times happier sir said i with a littlei hope innocentflattery if my employment is to be on the dictionary the doctor stopped smilingly clapped me on the shoulder again and exclaimed with a triumph most delightful to behold as if i had penetrated to the profoundest depths of mortal sagacity my dear young friend you have hit it
it is the dictionary how could it be anything else
his pockets were as full of it as his head
it was sticking out of him in all directions
he told me that since his retirement from scholastic life he had been advancing with it wonderfully and that nothing could suit him better than the proposed arrangements for morning and evening work as it was his custom to walk about in the daytime with his considering cap on
his papers were in a little confusion in consequence of mr jack maldon having lately proffered his occasional services as an amanuensis and not being accustomed to that occupation but we should soon put right what was amiss and go on swimmingly
afterwards when we were fairly at our work i found mr jack maldons efforts more troublesome to me than i had expected as he had not confined himself to making numerous mistakes but had sketched so many soldiers and ladies heads over the doctors manuscript that i often became involved in labyrinths of obscurity
the doctor was quite happy in the prospect of our going to work together on that wonderful performance and we settled to begin next morning at seven oclock
we were to work two hours every morning and two or three hours every night except on saturdays when i was to rest
on sundays of course i was to rest also and i considered these very easy terms
our plans being thus arranged to our mutual satisfaction the doctor took me into the house to present me to mrs strong whom we found in the doctors new study dusting his booksa freedom which he never permitted anybody else to take with those sacred favourites
they had postponed their breakfast on my account and we sat down to table together
we had not been seated long when i saw an approaching arrival in mrs strongs face before i heard any sound of it
a gentleman on horseback came to the gate and leading his horse into the little court with the bridle over his arm as if he were quite at home tied him to a ring in the empty coachhouse wall and came into the breakfast parlour whip in hand
it was mr jack maldon and mr jack maldon was not at all improved by india i thought
i was in a state of ferocious virtue however as to young men who were not cutting down trees in the forest of difficulty and my impression must be received with due allowance
mr
jack said the doctor
copperfield mr jack maldon shook hands with me but not very warmly i believed and with an air of languid patronage at which i secretly took great umbrage
but his languor altogether was quite a wonderful sight except when he addressed himself to his cousin annie
have you breakfasted this morning mr jack said the doctor
i hardly ever take breakfast sir he replied with his head thrown back in an easychair
i find it bores me is there any news today inquired the doctor
nothing at all sir replied mr maldon
theres an account about the people being hungry and discontented down in the north but they are always being hungry and discontented somewhere the doctor looked grave and said as though he wished to change the subject then theres no news at all and no news they say is good news theres a long statement in the papers sir about a murder observed mr maldon
but somebody is always being murdered and i didnt read it a display of indifference to all the actions and passions of mankind was not supposed to be such a distinguished quality at that time i think as i have observed it to be considered since
i have known it very fashionable indeed
i have seen it displayed with such success that i have encountered some fine ladies and gentlemen who might as well have been born caterpillars
perhaps it impressed me the more then because it was new to me but it certainly did not tend to exalt my opinion of or to strengthen my confidence in mr jack maldon
i came out to inquire whether annie would like to go to the opera tonight said mr maldon turning to her
its the last good night there will be this season and theres a singer there whom she really ought to hear
she is perfectly exquisite
besides which she is so charmingly ugly relapsing into languor
the doctor ever pleased with what was likely to please his young wife turned to her and said you must go annie
you must go i would rather not she said to the doctor
i prefer to remain at home
i would much rather remain at home without looking at her cousin she then addressed me and asked me about agnes and whether she should see her and whether she was not likely to come that day and was so much disturbed that i wondered how even the doctor buttering his toast could be blind to what was so obvious
but he saw nothing
he told her goodnaturedly that she was young and ought to be amused and entertained and must not allow herself to be made dull by a dull old fellow
moreover he said he wanted to hear her sing all the new singers songs to him and how could she do that well unless she went
so the doctor persisted in making the engagement for her and mr jack maldon was to come back to dinner
this concluded he went to his patent place i suppose but at all events went away on his horse looking very idle
i was curious to find out next morning whether she had been
she had not but had sent into london to put her cousin off and had gone out in the afternoon to see agnes and had prevailed upon the doctor to go with her and they had walked home by the fields the doctor told me the evening being delightful
i wondered then whether she would have gone if agnes had not been in town and whether agnes had some good influence over her too
she did not look very happy i thought but it was a good face or a very false one
i often glanced at it for she sat in the window all the time we were at work and made our breakfast which we took by snatches as we were employed
when i left at nine oclock she was kneeling on the ground at the doctors feet putting on his shoes and gaiters for him
there was a softened shade upon her face thrown from some green leaves overhanging the open window of the low room and i thought all the way to doctors commons of the night when i had seen it looking at him as he read
i was pretty busy now up at five in the morning and home at nine or ten at night
but i had infinite satisfaction in being so closely engaged and never walked slowly on any account and felt enthusiastically that the more i tired myself the more i was doing to deserve dora
i had not revealed myself in my altered character to dora yet because she was coming to see miss mills in a few days and i deferred all i had to tell her until then merely informing her in my letters all our communications were secretly forwarded through miss mills that i had much to tell her
in the meantime i put myself on a short allowance of bears grease wholly abandoned scented soap and lavender water and sold off three waistcoats at a prodigious sacrifice as being too luxurious for my stern career
not satisfied with all these proceedings but burning with impatience to do something more i went to see traddles now lodging up behind the parapet of a house in castle street holborn
mr dick who had been with me to highgate twice already and had resumed his companionship with the doctor i took with me
i took mr dick with me because acutely sensitive to my aunts reverses and sincerely believing that no galleyslave or convict worked as i did he had begun to fret and worry himself out of spirits and appetite as having nothing useful to do
in this condition he felt more incapable of finishing the memorial than ever and the harder he worked at it the oftener that unlucky head of king charles the first got into it
seriously apprehending that his malady would increase unless we put some innocent deception upon him and caused him to believe that he was useful or unless we could put him in the way of being really useful which would be better i made up my mind to try if traddles could help us
before we went i wrote traddles a full statement of all that had happened and traddles wrote me back a capital answer expressive of his sympathy and friendship
we found him hard at work with his inkstand and papers refreshed by the sight of the flowerpot stand and the little round table in a corner of the small apartment
he received us cordially and made friends with mr dick in a moment
mr dick professed an absolute certainty of having seen him before and we both said very likely the first subject on which i had to consult traddles was thisi had heard that many men distinguished in various pursuits had begun life by reporting the debates in parliament
traddles having mentioned newspapers to me as one of his hopes i had put the two things together and told traddles in my letter that i wished to know how i could qualify myself for this pursuit
traddles now informed me as the result of his inquiries that the mere mechanical acquisition necessary except in rare cases for thorough excellence in it that is to say a perfect and entire command of the mystery of shorthand writing and reading was about equal in difficulty to the mastery of six languages and that it might perhaps be attained by dint of perseverance in the course of a few years
traddles reasonably supposed that this would settle the business but i only feeling that here indeed were a few tall trees to be hewn down immediately resolved to work my way on to dora through this thicket axe in hand
i am very much obliged to you my dear traddles said i
ill begin tomorrow traddles looked astonished as he well might but he had no notion as yet of my rapturous condition
ill buy a book said i with a good scheme of this art in it ill work at it at the commons where i havent half enough to do ill take down the speeches in our court for practicetraddles my dear fellow ill master it dear me said traddles opening his eyes i had no idea you were such a determined character copperfield i dont know how he should have had for it was new enough to me
i passed that off and brought mr dick on the carpet
you see said mr dick wistfully if i could exert myself mr traddlesif i could beat a drumor blow anything poor fellow
i have little doubt he would have preferred such an employment in his heart to all others
traddles who would not have smiled for the world replied composedly but you are a very good penman sir
you told me so copperfield excellent said i
and indeed he was
he wrote with extraordinary neatness
dont you think said traddles you could copy writings sir if i got them for you mr dick looked doubtfully at me
eh trotwood i shook my head
mr dick shook his and sighed
tell him about the memorial said mr dick
i explained to traddles that there was a difficulty in keeping king charles the first out of mr dicks manuscripts mr dick in the meanwhile looking very deferentially and seriously at traddles and sucking his thumb
but these writings you know that i speak of are already drawn up and finished said traddles after a little consideration
mr
dick has nothing to do with them
wouldnt that make a difference copperfield
at all events wouldnt it be well to try this gave us new hope
traddles and i laying our heads together apart while mr dick anxiously watched us from his chair we concocted a scheme in virtue of which we got him to work next day with triumphant success
on a table by the window in buckingham street we set out the work traddles procured for himwhich was to make i forget how many copies of a legal document about some right of wayand on another table we spread the last unfinished original of the great memorial
our instructions to mr dick were that he should copy exactly what he had before him without the least departure from the original and that when he felt it necessary to make the slightest allusion to king charles the first he should fly to the memorial
we exhorted him to be resolute in this and left my aunt to observe him
my aunt reported to us afterwards that at first he was like a man playing the kettledrums and constantly divided his attentions between the two but that finding this confuse and fatigue him and having his copy there plainly before his eyes he soon sat at it in an orderly businesslike manner and postponed the memorial to a more convenient time
in a word although we took great care that he should have no more to do than was good for him and although he did not begin with the beginning of a week he earned by the following saturday night ten shillings and ninepence and never while i live shall i forget his going about to all the shops in the neighbourhood to change this treasure into sixpences or his bringing them to my aunt arranged in the form of a heart upon a waiter with tears of joy and pride in his eyes
he was like one under the propitious influence of a charm from the moment of his being usefully employed and if there were a happy man in the world that saturday night it was the grateful creature who thought my aunt the most wonderful woman in existence and me the most wonderful young man
no starving now trotwood said mr dick shaking hands with me in a corner
ill provide for her sir and he flourished his ten fingers in the air as if they were ten banks
i hardly know which was the better pleased traddles or i
it really said traddles suddenly taking a letter out of his pocket and giving it to me put mr micawber quite out of my head the letter mr micawber never missed any possible opportunity of writing a letter was addressed to me by the kindness of t traddles esquire of the inner temple it ran thus my dear copperfield you may possibly not be unprepared to receive the intimation that something has turned up
i may have mentioned to you on a former occasion that i was in expectation of such an event
i am about to establish myself in one of the provincial towns of our favoured island where the society may be described as a happy admixture of the agricultural and the clerical in immediate connexion with one of the learned professions
mrs micawber and our offspring will accompany me
our ashes at a future period will probably be found commingled in the cemetery attached to a venerable pile for which the spot to which i refer has acquired a reputation shall i say from china to peru
in bidding adieu to the modern babylon where we have undergone many vicissitudes i trust not ignobly mrs micawber and myself cannot disguise from our minds that we part it may be for years and it may be for ever with an individual linked by strong associations to the altar of our domestic life
if on the eve of such a departure you will accompany our mutual friend mr thomas traddles to our present abode and there reciprocate the wishes natural to the occasion you will confer a boon on one who is ever yours wilkins micawber i was glad to find that mr micawber had got rid of his dust and ashes and that something really had turned up at last
learning from traddles that the invitation referred to the evening then wearing away i expressed my readiness to do honour to it and we went off together to the lodging which mr micawber occupied as mr mortimer and which was situated near the top of the grays inn road
the resources of this lodging were so limited that we found the twins now some eight or nine years old reposing in a turnup bedstead in the family sittingroom where mr micawber had prepared in a washhandstand jug what he called a brew of the agreeable beverage for which he was famous
i had the pleasure on this occasion of renewing the acquaintance of master micawber whom i found a promising boy of about twelve or thirteen very subject to that restlessness of limb which is not an unfrequent phenomenon in youths of his age
i also became once more known to his sister miss micawber in whom as mr micawber told us her mother renewed her youth like the phoenix
my dear copperfield said mr micawber yourself and mr traddles find us on the brink of migration and will excuse any little discomforts incidental to that position glancing round as i made a suitable reply i observed that the family effects were already packed and that the amount of luggage was by no means overwhelming
i congratulated mrs micawber on the approaching change
my dear mr copperfield said mrs micawber of your friendly interest in all our affairs i am well assured
my family may consider it banishment if they please but i am a wife and mother and i never will desert mr micawber traddles appealed to by mrs micawbers eye feelingly acquiesced
that said mrs micawber that at least is my view my dear mr copperfield and mr traddles of the obligation which i took upon myself when i repeated the irrevocable words i emma take thee wilkins i read the service over with a flatcandle on the previous night and the conclusion i derived from it was that i never could desert mr micawber
and said mrs micawber though it is possible i may be mistaken in my view of the ceremony i never will my dear said mr micawber a little impatiently i am not conscious that you are expected to do anything of the sort i am aware my dear mr copperfield pursued mrs micawber that i am now about to cast my lot among strangers and i am also aware that the various members of my family to whom mr micawber has written in the most gentlemanly terms announcing that fact have not taken the least notice of mr micawbers communication
indeed i may be superstitious said mrs micawber but it appears to me that mr micawber is destined never to receive any answers whatever to the great majority of the communications he writes
i may augur from the silence of my family that they object to the resolution i have taken but i should not allow myself to be swerved from the path of duty mr copperfield even by my papa and mama were they still living i expressed my opinion that this was going in the right direction
it may be a sacrifice said mrs micawber to immure onesself in a cathedral town but surely mr copperfield if it is a sacrifice in me it is much more a sacrifice in a man of mr micawbers abilities oh
you are going to a cathedral town said i mr micawber who had been helping us all out of the washhandstand jug replied to canterbury
in fact my dear copperfield i have entered into arrangements by virtue of which i stand pledged and contracted to our friend heep to assist and serve him in the capacity ofand to behis confidential clerk i stared at mr micawber who greatly enjoyed my surprise
i am bound to state to you he said with an official air that the business habits and the prudent suggestions of mrs micawber have in a great measure conduced to this result
the gauntlet to which mrs micawber referred upon a former occasion being thrown down in the form of an advertisement was taken up by my friend heep and led to a mutual recognition
of my friend heep said mr micawber who is a man of remarkable shrewdness i desire to speak with all possible respect
my friend heep has not fixed the positive remuneration at too high a figure but he has made a great deal in the way of extrication from the pressure of pecuniary difficulties contingent on the value of my services and on the value of those services i pin my faith
such address and intelligence as i chance to possess said mr micawber boastfully disparaging himself with the old genteel air will be devoted to my friend heeps service
i have already some acquaintance with the lawas a defendant on civil processand i shall immediately apply myself to the commentaries of one of the most eminent and remarkable of our english jurists
i believe it is unnecessary to add that i allude to mr justice blackstone these observations and indeed the greater part of the observations made that evening were interrupted by mrs micawbers discovering that master micawber was sitting on his boots or holding his head on with both arms as if he felt it loose or accidentally kicking traddles under the table or shuffling his feet over one another or producing them at distances from himself apparently outrageous to nature or lying sideways with his hair among the wineglasses or developing his restlessness of limb in some other form incompatible with the general interests of society and by master micawbers receiving those discoveries in a resentful spirit
i sat all the while amazed by mr micawbers disclosure and wondering what it meant until mrs micawber resumed the thread of the discourse and claimed my attention
what i particularly request mr micawber to be careful of is said mrs micawber that he does not my dear mr copperfield in applying himself to this subordinate branch of the law place it out of his power to rise ultimately to the top of the tree
i am convinced that mr micawber giving his mind to a profession so adapted to his fertile resources and his flow of language must distinguish himself
now for example mr traddles said mrs micawber assuming a profound air a judge or even say a chancellor
does an individual place himself beyond the pale of those preferments by entering on such an office as mr micawber has accepted my dear observed mr micawberbut glancing inquisitively at traddles too we have time enough before us for the consideration of those questions micawber she returned no
your mistake in life is that you do not look forward far enough
you are bound in justice to your family if not to yourself to take in at a comprehensive glance the extremest point in the horizon to which your abilities may lead you mr micawber coughed and drank his punch with an air of exceeding satisfactionstill glancing at traddles as if he desired to have his opinion
why the plain state of the case mrs micawber said traddles mildly breaking the truth to her
i mean the real prosaic fact you know just so said mrs micawber my dear mr traddles i wish to be as prosaic and literal as possible on a subject of so much importance is said traddles that this branch of the law even if mr micawber were a regular solicitor exactly so returned mrs micawber
wilkins you are squinting and will not be able to get your eyes back has nothing pursued traddles to do with that
only a barrister is eligible for such preferments and mr micawber could not be a barrister without being entered at an inn of court as a student for five years do i follow you said mrs micawber with her most affable air of business
do i understand my dear mr traddles that at the expiration of that period mr micawber would be eligible as a judge or chancellor he would be eligible returned traddles with a strong emphasis on that word
thank you said mrs micawber
that is quite sufficient
if such is the case and mr micawber forfeits no privilege by entering on these duties my anxiety is set at rest
i speak said mrs micawber as a female necessarily but i have always been of opinion that mr micawber possesses what i have heard my papa call when i lived at home the judicial mind and i hope mr micawber is now entering on a field where that mind will develop itself and take a commanding station i quite believe that mr micawber saw himself in his judicial minds eye on the woolsack
he passed his hand complacently over his bald head and said with ostentatious resignation my dear we will not anticipate the decrees of fortune
if i am reserved to wear a wig i am at least prepared externally in allusion to his baldness for that distinction
i do not said mr micawber regret my hair and i may have been deprived of it for a specific purpose
i cannot say
it is my intention my dear copperfield to educate my son for the church i will not deny that i should be happy on his account to attain to eminence for the church said i still pondering between whiles on uriah heep
yes said mr micawber
he has a remarkable headvoice and will commence as a chorister
our residence at canterbury and our local connexion will no doubt enable him to take advantage of any vacancy that may arise in the cathedral corps on looking at master micawber again i saw that he had a certain expression of face as if his voice were behind his eyebrows where it presently appeared to be on his singing us as an alternative between that and bed the woodpecker tapping
after many compliments on this performance we fell into some general conversation and as i was too full of my desperate intentions to keep my altered circumstances to myself i made them known to mr and mrs micawber
i cannot express how extremely delighted they both were by the idea of my aunts being in difficulties and how comfortable and friendly it made them
when we were nearly come to the last round of the punch i addressed myself to traddles and reminded him that we must not separate without wishing our friends health happiness and success in their new career
i begged mr micawber to fill us bumpers and proposed the toast in due form shaking hands with him across the table and kissing mrs micawber to commemorate that eventful occasion
traddles imitated me in the first particular but did not consider himself a sufficiently old friend to venture on the second
my dear copperfield said mr micawber rising with one of his thumbs in each of his waistcoat pockets the companion of my youth if i may be allowed the expressionand my esteemed friend traddles if i may be permitted to call him sowill allow me on the part of mrs micawber myself and our offspring to thank them in the warmest and most uncompromising terms for their good wishes
it may be expected that on the eve of a migration which will consign us to a perfectly new existence mr micawber spoke as if they were going five hundred thousand miles i should offer a few valedictory remarks to two such friends as i see before me
but all that i have to say in this way i have said
whatever station in society i may attain through the medium of the learned profession of which i am about to become an unworthy member i shall endeavour not to disgrace and mrs micawber will be safe to adorn
under the temporary pressure of pecuniary liabilities contracted with a view to their immediate liquidation but remaining unliquidated through a combination of circumstances i have been under the necessity of assuming a garb from which my natural instincts recoili allude to spectaclesand possessing myself of a cognomen to which i can establish no legitimate pretensions
all i have to say on that score is that the cloud has passed from the dreary scene and the god of day is once more high upon the mountain tops
on monday next on the arrival of the four oclock afternoon coach at canterbury my foot will be on my native heathmy name micawber mr micawber resumed his seat on the close of these remarks and drank two glasses of punch in grave succession
he then said with much solemnity one thing more i have to do before this separation is complete and that is to perform an act of justice
my friend mr thomas traddles has on two several occasions put his name if i may use a common expression to bills of exchange for my accommodation
on the first occasion mr thomas traddles was leftlet me say in short in the lurch
the fulfilment of the second has not yet arrived
the amount of the first obligation here mr micawber carefully referred to papers was i believe twentythree four nine and a half of the second according to my entry of that transaction eighteen six two
these sums united make a total if my calculation is correct amounting to fortyone ten eleven and a half
my friend copperfield will perhaps do me the favour to check that total i did so and found it correct
to leave this metropolis said mr micawber and my friend mr thomas traddles without acquitting myself of the pecuniary part of this obligation would weigh upon my mind to an insupportable extent
i have therefore prepared for my friend mr thomas traddles and i now hold in my hand a document which accomplishes the desired object
i beg to hand to my friend mr thomas traddles my iou
for fortyone ten eleven and a half and i am happy to recover my moral dignity and to know that i can once more walk erect before my fellow man with this introduction which greatly affected him mr micawber placed his iou
in the hands of traddles and said he wished him well in every relation of life
i am persuaded not only that this was quite the same to mr micawber as paying the money but that traddles himself hardly knew the difference until he had had time to think about it
mr micawber walked so erect before his fellow man on the strength of this virtuous action that his chest looked half as broad again when he lighted us downstairs
we parted with great heartiness on both sides and when i had seen traddles to his own door and was going home alone i thought among the other odd and contradictory things i mused upon that slippery as mr micawber was i was probably indebted to some compassionate recollection he retained of me as his boylodger for never having been asked by him for money
i certainly should not have had the moral courage to refuse it and i have no doubt he knew that to his credit be it written quite as well as i did
my new life had lasted for more than a week and i was stronger than ever in those tremendous practical resolutions that i felt the crisis required
i continued to walk extremely fast and to have a general idea that i was getting on
i made it a rule to take as much out of myself as i possibly could in my way of doing everything to which i applied my energies
i made a perfect victim of myself
i even entertained some idea of putting myself on a vegetable diet vaguely conceiving that in becoming a graminivorous animal i should sacrifice to dora
as yet little dora was quite unconscious of my desperate firmness otherwise than as my letters darkly shadowed it forth
but another saturday came and on that saturday evening she was to be at miss millss and when mr mills had gone to his whistclub telegraphed to me in the street by a birdcage in the drawingroom middle window i was to go there to tea
by this time we were quite settled down in buckingham street where mr dick continued his copying in a state of absolute felicity
my aunt had obtained a signal victory over mrs crupp by paying her off throwing the first pitcher she planted on the stairs out of window and protecting in person up and down the staircase a supernumerary whom she engaged from the outer world
these vigorous measures struck such terror to the breast of mrs crupp that she subsided into her own kitchen under the impression that my aunt was mad
my aunt being supremely indifferent to mrs crupps opinion and everybody elses and rather favouring than discouraging the idea mrs crupp of late the bold became within a few days so fainthearted that rather than encounter my aunt upon the staircase she would endeavour to hide her portly form behind doorsleaving visible however a wide margin of flannel petticoator would shrink into dark corners
this gave my aunt such unspeakable satisfaction that i believe she took a delight in prowling up and down with her bonnet insanely perched on the top of her head at times when mrs crupp was likely to be in the way
my aunt being uncommonly neat and ingenious made so many little improvements in our domestic arrangements that i seemed to be richer instead of poorer
among the rest she converted the pantry into a dressingroom for me and purchased and embellished a bedstead for my occupation which looked as like a bookcase in the daytime as a bedstead could
i was the object of her constant solicitude and my poor mother herself could not have loved me better or studied more how to make me happy
peggotty had considered herself highly privileged in being allowed to participate in these labours and although she still retained something of her old sentiment of awe in reference to my aunt had received so many marks of encouragement and confidence that they were the best friends possible
but the time had now come i am speaking of the saturday when i was to take tea at miss millss when it was necessary for her to return home and enter on the discharge of the duties she had undertaken in behalf of ham
so goodbye barkis said my aunt and take care of yourself
i am sure i never thought i could be sorry to lose you i took peggotty to the coach office and saw her off
she cried at parting and confided her brother to my friendship as ham had done
we had heard nothing of him since he went away that sunny afternoon
and now my own dear davy said peggotty if while youre a prentice you should want any money to spend or if when youre out of your time my dear you should want any to set you up and you must do one or other or both my darling who has such a good right to ask leave to lend it you as my sweet girls own old stupid me i was not so savagely independent as to say anything in reply but that if ever i borrowed money of anyone i would borrow it of her
next to accepting a large sum on the spot i believe this gave peggotty more comfort than anything i could have done
and my dear whispered peggotty tell the pretty little angel that i should so have liked to see her only for a minute
and tell her that before she marries my boy ill come and make your house so beautiful for you if youll let me i declared that nobody else should touch it and this gave peggotty such delight that she went away in good spirits
i fatigued myself as much as i possibly could in the commons all day by a variety of devices and at the appointed time in the evening repaired to mr millss street
mr mills who was a terrible fellow to fall asleep after dinner had not yet gone out and there was no birdcage in the middle window
he kept me waiting so long that i fervently hoped the club would fine him for being late
at last he came out and then i saw my own dora hang up the birdcage and peep into the balcony to look for me and run in again when she saw i was there while jip remained behind to bark injuriously at an immense butchers dog in the street who could have taken him like a pill
dora came to the drawingroom door to meet me and jip came scrambling out tumbling over his own growls under the impression that i was a bandit and we all three went in as happy and loving as could be
i soon carried desolation into the bosom of our joysnot that i meant to do it but that i was so full of the subjectby asking dora without the smallest preparation if she could love a beggar
my pretty little startled dora
her only association with the word was a yellow face and a nightcap or a pair of crutches or a wooden leg or a dog with a decanterstand in his mouth or something of that kind and she stared at me with the most delightful wonder
how can you ask me anything so foolish pouted dora
love a beggar dora my own dearest said i
i am a beggar how can you be such a silly thing replied dora slapping my hand as to sit there telling such stories
ill make jip bite you her childish way was the most delicious way in the world to me but it was necessary to be explicit and i solemnly repeated dora my own life i am your ruined david i declare ill make jip bite you said dora shaking her curls if you are so ridiculous but i looked so serious that dora left off shaking her curls and laid her trembling little hand upon my shoulder and first looked scared and anxious then began to cry
that was dreadful
i fell upon my knees before the sofa caressing her and imploring her not to rend my heart but for some time poor little dora did nothing but exclaim oh dear
oh dear
and oh she was so frightened
and where was julia mills
and oh take her to julia mills and go away please
until i was almost beside myself
at last after an agony of supplication and protestation i got dora to look at me with a horrified expression of face which i gradually soothed until it was only loving and her soft pretty cheek was lying against mine
then i told her with my arms clasped round her how i loved her so dearly and so dearly how i felt it right to offer to release her from her engagement because now i was poor how i never could bear it or recover it if i lost her how i had no fears of poverty if she had none my arm being nerved and my heart inspired by her how i was already working with a courage such as none but lovers knew how i had begun to be practical and look into the future how a crust well earned was sweeter far than a feast inherited and much more to the same purpose which i delivered in a burst of passionate eloquence quite surprising to myself though i had been thinking about it day and night ever since my aunt had astonished me
is your heart mine still dear dora said i rapturously for i knew by her clinging to me that it was
oh yes cried dora
oh yes its all yours
oh dont be dreadful i dreadful
to dora
dont talk about being poor and working hard said dora nestling closer to me
oh dont dont my dearest love said i the crust wellearned oh yes but i dont want to hear any more about crusts said dora
and jip must have a muttonchop every day at twelve or hell die i was charmed with her childish winning way
i fondly explained to dora that jip should have his muttonchop with his accustomed regularity
i drew a picture of our frugal home made independent by my laboursketching in the little house i had seen at highgate and my aunt in her room upstairs
i am not dreadful now dora said i tenderly
oh no no cried dora
but i hope your aunt will keep in her own room a good deal
and i hope shes not a scolding old thing if it were possible for me to love dora more than ever i am sure i did
but i felt she was a little impracticable
it damped my newborn ardour to find that ardour so difficult of communication to her
i made another trial
when she was quite herself again and was curling jips ears as he lay upon her lap i became grave and said my own
may i mention something oh please dont be practical said dora coaxingly
because it frightens me so sweetheart i returned there is nothing to alarm you in all this
i want you to think of it quite differently
i want to make it nerve you and inspire you dora oh but thats so shocking cried dora
my love no
perseverance and strength of character will enable us to bear much worse things but i havent got any strength at all said dora shaking her curls
have i jip
oh do kiss jip and be agreeable it was impossible to resist kissing jip when she held him up to me for that purpose putting her own bright rosy little mouth into kissing form as she directed the operation which she insisted should be performed symmetrically on the centre of his nose
i did as she bade merewarding myself afterwards for my obedienceand she charmed me out of my graver character for i dont know how long
but dora my beloved said i at last resuming it i was going to mention something the judge of the prerogative court might have fallen in love with her to see her fold her little hands and hold them up begging and praying me not to be dreadful any more
indeed i am not going to be my darling i assured her
but dora my love if you will sometimes thinknot despondingly you know far from thatbut if you will sometimes thinkjust to encourage yourselfthat you are engaged to a poor man dont dont
pray dont cried dora
its so very dreadful my soul not at all said i cheerfully
if you will sometimes think of that and look about now and then at your papas housekeeping and endeavour to acquire a little habitof accounts for instance poor little dora received this suggestion with something that was half a sob and half a scream
it would be so useful to us afterwards i went on
and if you would promise me to read a littlea little cookery book that i would send you it would be so excellent for both of us
for our path in life my dora said i warming with the subject is stony and rugged now and it rests with us to smooth it
we must fight our way onward
we must be brave
there are obstacles to be met and we must meet and crush them i was going on at a great rate with a clenched hand and a most enthusiastic countenance but it was quite unnecessary to proceed
i had said enough
i had done it again
oh she was so frightened
oh where was julia mills
oh take her to julia mills and go away please
so that in short i was quite distracted and raved about the drawingroom
i thought i had killed her this time
i sprinkled water on her face
i went down on my knees
i plucked at my hair
i denounced myself as a remorseless brute and a ruthless beast
i implored her forgiveness
i besought her to look up
i ravaged miss millss workbox for a smellingbottle and in my agony of mind applied an ivory needlecase instead and dropped all the needles over dora
i shook my fists at jip who was as frantic as myself
i did every wild extravagance that could be done and was a long way beyond the end of my wits when miss mills came into the room
who has done this exclaimed miss mills succouring her friend
i replied i miss mills
i have done it
behold the destroyeror words to that effectand hid my face from the light in the sofa cushion
at first miss mills thought it was a quarrel and that we were verging on the desert of sahara but she soon found out how matters stood for my dear affectionate little dora embracing her began exclaiming that i was a poor labourer and then cried for me and embraced me and asked me would i let her give me all her money to keep and then fell on miss millss neck sobbing as if her tender heart were broken
miss mills must have been born to be a blessing to us
she ascertained from me in a few words what it was all about comforted dora and gradually convinced her that i was not a labourerfrom my manner of stating the case i believe dora concluded that i was a navigator and went balancing myself up and down a plank all day with a wheelbarrowand so brought us together in peace
when we were quite composed and dora had gone upstairs to put some rosewater to her eyes miss mills rang for tea
in the ensuing interval i told miss mills that she was evermore my friend and that my heart must cease to vibrate ere i could forget her sympathy
i then expounded to miss mills what i had endeavoured so very unsuccessfully to expound to dora
miss mills replied on general principles that the cottage of content was better than the palace of cold splendour and that where love was all was
i said to miss mills that this was very true and who should know it better than i who loved dora with a love that never mortal had experienced yet
but on miss mills observing with despondency that it were well indeed for some hearts if this were so i explained that i begged leave to restrict the observation to mortals of the masculine gender
i then put it to miss mills to say whether she considered that there was or was not any practical merit in the suggestion i had been anxious to make concerning the accounts the housekeeping and the cookery book
miss mills after some consideration thus replied mr
copperfield i will be plain with you
mental suffering and trial supply in some natures the place of years and i will be as plain with you as if i were a lady abbess
no
the suggestion is not appropriate to our dora
our dearest dora is a favourite child of nature
she is a thing of light and airiness and joy
i am free to confess that if it could be done it might be well but and miss mills shook her head
i was encouraged by this closing admission on the part of miss mills to ask her whether for doras sake if she had any opportunity of luring her attention to such preparations for an earnest life she would avail herself of it
miss mills replied in the affirmative so readily that i further asked her if she would take charge of the cookery book and if she ever could insinuate it upon doras acceptance without frightening her undertake to do me that crowning service
miss mills accepted this trust too but was not sanguine
and dora returned looking such a lovely little creature that i really doubted whether she ought to be troubled with anything so ordinary
and she loved me so much and was so captivating particularly when she made jip stand on his hind legs for toast and when she pretended to hold that nose of his against the hot teapot for punishment because he wouldnt that i felt like a sort of monster who had got into a fairys bower when i thought of having frightened her and made her cry
after tea we had the guitar and dora sang those same dear old french songs about the impossibility of ever on any account leaving off dancing la ra la la ra la until i felt a much greater monster than before
we had only one check to our pleasure and that happened a little while before i took my leave when miss mills chancing to make some allusion to tomorrow morning i unluckily let out that being obliged to exert myself now i got up at five oclock
whether dora had any idea that i was a private watchman i am unable to say but it made a great impression on her and she neither played nor sang any more
it was still on her mind when i bade her adieu and she said to me in her pretty coaxing wayas if i were a doll i used to think now dont get up at five oclock you naughty boy
its so nonsensical my love said i i have work to do but dont do it returned dora
why should you it was impossible to say to that sweet little surprised face otherwise than lightly and playfully that we must work to live
oh
how ridiculous cried dora
how shall we live without dora said i
how
any how said dora
she seemed to think she had quite settled the question and gave me such a triumphant little kiss direct from her innocent heart that i would hardly have put her out of conceit with her answer for a fortune
well
i loved her and i went on loving her most absorbingly entirely and completely
but going on too working pretty hard and busily keeping redhot all the irons i now had in the fire i would sit sometimes of a night opposite my aunt thinking how i had frightened dora that time and how i could best make my way with a guitarcase through the forest of difficulty until i used to fancy that my head was turning quite grey
i did not allow my resolution with respect to the parliamentary debates to cool
it was one of the irons i began to heat immediately and one of the irons i kept hot and hammered at with a perseverance i may honestly admire
i bought an approved scheme of the noble art and mystery of stenography which cost me ten and sixpence and plunged into a sea of perplexity that brought me in a few weeks to the confines of distraction
the changes that were rung upon dots which in such a position meant such a thing and in such another position something else entirely different the wonderful vagaries that were played by circles the unaccountable consequences that resulted from marks like flies legs the tremendous effects of a curve in a wrong place not only troubled my waking hours but reappeared before me in my sleep
when i had groped my way blindly through these difficulties and had mastered the alphabet which was an egyptian temple in itself there then appeared a procession of new horrors called arbitrary characters the most despotic characters i have ever known who insisted for instance that a thing like the beginning of a cobweb meant expectation and that a penandink skyrocket stood for disadvantageous
when i had fixed these wretches in my mind i found that they had driven everything else out of it then beginning again i forgot them while i was picking them up i dropped the other fragments of the system in short it was almost heartbreaking
it might have been quite heartbreaking but for dora who was the stay and anchor of my tempestdriven bark
every scratch in the scheme was a gnarled oak in the forest of difficulty and i went on cutting them down one after another with such vigour that in three or four months i was in a condition to make an experiment on one of our crack speakers in the commons
shall i ever forget how the crack speaker walked off from me before i began and left my imbecile pencil staggering about the paper as if it were in a fit
this would not do it was quite clear
i was flying too high and should never get on so
i resorted to traddles for advice who suggested that he should dictate speeches to me at a pace and with occasional stoppages adapted to my weakness
very grateful for this friendly aid i accepted the proposal and night after night almost every night for a long time we had a sort of private parliament in buckingham street after i came home from the doctors
i should like to see such a parliament anywhere else
my aunt and mr dick represented the government or the opposition as the case might be and traddles with the assistance of enfields speakers or a volume of parliamentary orations thundered astonishing invectives against them
standing by the table with his finger in the page to keep the place and his right arm flourishing above his head traddles as mr pitt mr fox mr sheridan mr burke lord castlereagh viscount sidmouth or mr canning would work himself into the most violent heats and deliver the most withering denunciations of the profligacy and corruption of my aunt and mr dick while i used to sit at a little distance with my notebook on my knee fagging after him with all my might and main
the inconsistency and recklessness of traddles were not to be exceeded by any real politician
he was for any description of policy in the compass of a week and nailed all sorts of colours to every denomination of mast
my aunt looking very like an immovable chancellor of the exchequer would occasionally throw in an interruption or two as hear or no or oh when the text seemed to require it which was always a signal to mr dick a perfect country gentleman to follow lustily with the same cry
but mr dick got taxed with such things in the course of his parliamentary career and was made responsible for such awful consequences that he became uncomfortable in his mind sometimes
i believe he actually began to be afraid he really had been doing something tending to the annihilation of the british constitution and the ruin of the country
often and often we pursued these debates until the clock pointed to midnight and the candles were burning down
the result of so much good practice was that by and by i began to keep pace with traddles pretty well and should have been quite triumphant if i had had the least idea what my notes were about
but as to reading them after i had got them i might as well have copied the chinese inscriptions of an immense collection of teachests or the golden characters on all the great red and green bottles in the chemists shops
there was nothing for it but to turn back and begin all over again
it was very hard but i turned back though with a heavy heart and began laboriously and methodically to plod over the same tedious ground at a snails pace stopping to examine minutely every speck in the way on all sides and making the most desperate efforts to know these elusive characters by sight wherever i met them
i was always punctual at the office at the doctors too and i really did work as the common expression is like a carthorse
one day when i went to the commons as usual i found mr spenlow in the doorway looking extremely grave and talking to himself
as he was in the habit of complaining of pains in his headhe had naturally a short throat and i do seriously believe he overstarched himselfi was at first alarmed by the idea that he was not quite right in that direction but he soon relieved my uneasiness
instead of returning my good morning with his usual affability he looked at me in a distant ceremonious manner and coldly requested me to accompany him to a certain coffeehouse which in those days had a door opening into the commons just within the little archway in st pauls churchyard
i complied in a very uncomfortable state and with a warm shooting all over me as if my apprehensions were breaking out into buds
when i allowed him to go on a little before on account of the narrowness of the way i observed that he carried his head with a lofty air that was particularly unpromising and my mind misgave me that he had found out about my darling dora
if i had not guessed this on the way to the coffeehouse i could hardly have failed to know what was the matter when i followed him into an upstairs room and found miss murdstone there supported by a background of sideboard on which were several inverted tumblers sustaining lemons and two of those extraordinary boxes all corners and flutings for sticking knives and forks in which happily for mankind are now obsolete
miss murdstone gave me her chilly fingernails and sat severely rigid
mr spenlow shut the door motioned me to a chair and stood on the hearthrug in front of the fireplace
have the goodness to show mr copperfield said mr spenlow what you have in your reticule miss murdstone i believe it was the old identical steelclasped reticule of my childhood that shut up like a bite
compressing her lips in sympathy with the snap miss murdstone opened itopening her mouth a little at the same timeand produced my last letter to dora teeming with expressions of devoted affection
i believe that is your writing mr copperfield said mr spenlow
i was very hot and the voice i heard was very unlike mine when i said it is sir if i am not mistaken said mr spenlow as miss murdstone brought a parcel of letters out of her reticule tied round with the dearest bit of blue ribbon those are also from your pen mr copperfield i took them from her with a most desolate sensation and glancing at such phrases at the top as my ever dearest and own dora my best beloved angel my blessed one for ever and the like blushed deeply and inclined my head
no thank you said mr spenlow coldly as i mechanically offered them back to him
i will not deprive you of them
miss murdstone be so good as to proceed that gentle creature after a moments thoughtful survey of the carpet delivered herself with much dry unction as follows
i must confess to having entertained my suspicions of miss spenlow in reference to david copperfield for some time
i observed miss spenlow and david copperfield when they first met and the impression made upon me then was not agreeable
the depravity of the human heart is such you will oblige me maam interrupted mr spenlow by confining yourself to facts miss murdstone cast down her eyes shook her head as if protesting against this unseemly interruption and with frowning dignity resumed since i am to confine myself to facts i will state them as dryly as i can
perhaps that will be considered an acceptable course of proceeding
i have already said sir that i have had my suspicions of miss spenlow in reference to david copperfield for some time
i have frequently endeavoured to find decisive corroboration of those suspicions but without effect
i have therefore forborne to mention them to miss spenlows father looking severely at himknowing how little disposition there usually is in such cases to acknowledge the conscientious discharge of duty mr spenlow seemed quite cowed by the gentlemanly sternness of miss murdstones manner and deprecated her severity with a conciliatory little wave of his hand
on my return to norwood after the period of absence occasioned by my brothers marriage pursued miss murdstone in a disdainful voice and on the return of miss spenlow from her visit to her friend miss mills i imagined that the manner of miss spenlow gave me greater occasion for suspicion than before
therefore i watched miss spenlow closely dear tender little dora so unconscious of this dragons eye
still resumed miss murdstone i found no proof until last night
it appeared to me that miss spenlow received too many letters from her friend miss mills but miss mills being her friend with her fathers full concurrence another telling blow at mr spenlow it was not for me to interfere
if i may not be permitted to allude to the natural depravity of the human heart at least i mayi mustbe permitted so far to refer to misplaced confidence mr spenlow apologetically murmured his assent
last evening after tea pursued miss murdstone i observed the little dog starting rolling and growling about the drawingroom worrying something
i said to miss spenlow dora what is that the dog has in his mouth
its paper miss spenlow immediately put her hand to her frock gave a sudden cry and ran to the dog
i interposed and said dora my love you must permit me oh jip miserable spaniel this wretchedness then was your work
miss spenlow endeavoured said miss murdstone to bribe me with kisses workboxes and small articles of jewellerythat of course i pass over
the little dog retreated under the sofa on my approaching him and was with great difficulty dislodged by the fireirons
even when dislodged he still kept the letter in his mouth and on my endeavouring to take it from him at the imminent risk of being bitten he kept it between his teeth so pertinaciously as to suffer himself to be held suspended in the air by means of the document
at length i obtained possession of it
after perusing it i taxed miss spenlow with having many such letters in her possession and ultimately obtained from her the packet which is now in david copperfields hand here she ceased and snapping her reticule again and shutting her mouth looked as if she might be broken but could never be bent
you have heard miss murdstone said mr spenlow turning to me
i beg to ask mr copperfield if you have anything to say in reply the picture i had before me of the beautiful little treasure of my heart sobbing and crying all nightof her being alone frightened and wretched thenof her having so piteously begged and prayed that stonyhearted woman to forgive herof her having vainly offered her those kisses workboxes and trinketsof her being in such grievous distress and all for mevery much impaired the little dignity i had been able to muster
i am afraid i was in a tremulous state for a minute or so though i did my best to disguise it
there is nothing i can say sir i returned except that all the blame is mine
dora miss spenlow if you please said her father majestically
was induced and persuaded by me i went on swallowing that colder designation to consent to this concealment and i bitterly regret it you are very much to blame sir said mr spenlow walking to and fro upon the hearthrug and emphasizing what he said with his whole body instead of his head on account of the stiffness of his cravat and spine
you have done a stealthy and unbecoming action mr copperfield
when i take a gentleman to my house no matter whether he is nineteen twentynine or ninety i take him there in a spirit of confidence
if he abuses my confidence he commits a dishonourable action mr copperfield i feel it sir i assure you i returned
but i never thought so before
sincerely honestly indeed mr spenlow i never thought so before
i love miss spenlow to that extent pooh
nonsense said mr spenlow reddening
pray dont tell me to my face that you love my daughter mr copperfield could i defend my conduct if i did not sir i returned with all humility
can you defend your conduct if you do sir said mr spenlow stopping short upon the hearthrug
have you considered your years and my daughters years mr copperfield
have you considered what it is to undermine the confidence that should subsist between my daughter and myself
have you considered my daughters station in life the projects i may contemplate for her advancement the testamentary intentions i may have with reference to her
have you considered anything mr copperfield very little sir i am afraid i answered speaking to him as respectfully and sorrowfully as i felt but pray believe me i have considered my own worldly position
when i explained it to you we were already engaged i beg said mr spenlow more like punch than i had ever seen him as he energetically struck one hand upon the otheri could not help noticing that even in my despair that you will not talk to me of engagements mr copperfield the otherwise immovable miss murdstone laughed contemptuously in one short syllable
when i explained my altered position to you sir i began again substituting a new form of expression for what was so unpalatable to him this concealment into which i am so unhappy as to have led miss spenlow had begun
since i have been in that altered position i have strained every nerve i have exerted every energy to improve it
i am sure i shall improve it in time
will you grant me timeany length of time
we are both so young sir you are right interrupted mr spenlow nodding his head a great many times and frowning very much you are both very young
its all nonsense
let there be an end of the nonsense
take away those letters and throw them in the fire
give me miss spenlows letters to throw in the fire and although our future intercourse must you are aware be restricted to the commons here we will agree to make no further mention of the past
come mr copperfield you dont want sense and this is the sensible course no
i couldnt think of agreeing to it
i was very sorry but there was a higher consideration than sense
love was above all earthly considerations and i loved dora to idolatry and dora loved me
i didnt exactly say so i softened it down as much as i could but i implied it and i was resolute upon it
i dont think i made myself very ridiculous but i know i was resolute
very well mr copperfield said mr spenlow i must try my influence with my daughter miss murdstone by an expressive sound a long drawn respiration which was neither a sigh nor a moan but was like both gave it as her opinion that he should have done this at first
i must try said mr spenlow confirmed by this support my influence with my daughter
do you decline to take those letters mr copperfield for i had laid them on the table
yes
i told him i hoped he would not think it wrong but i couldnt possibly take them from miss murdstone
nor from me said mr spenlow
no i replied with the profoundest respect nor from him
very well said mr spenlow
a silence succeeding i was undecided whether to go or stay
at length i was moving quietly towards the door with the intention of saying that perhaps i should consult his feelings best by withdrawing when he said with his hands in his coat pockets into which it was as much as he could do to get them and with what i should call upon the whole a decidedly pious air you are probably aware mr copperfield that i am not altogether destitute of worldly possessions and that my daughter is my nearest and dearest relative i hurriedly made him a reply to the effect that i hoped the error into which i had been betrayed by the desperate nature of my love did not induce him to think me mercenary too
i dont allude to the matter in that light said mr spenlow
it would be better for yourself and all of us if you were mercenary mr copperfieldi mean if you were more discreet and less influenced by all this youthful nonsense
no
i merely say with quite another view you are probably aware i have some property to bequeath to my child i certainly supposed so
and you can hardly think said mr spenlow having experience of what we see in the commons here every day of the various unaccountable and negligent proceedings of men in respect of their testamentary arrangementsof all subjects the one on which perhaps the strangest revelations of human inconsistency are to be met withbut that mine are made i inclined my head in acquiescence
i should not allow said mr spenlow with an evident increase of pious sentiment and slowly shaking his head as he poised himself upon his toes and heels alternately my suitable provision for my child to be influenced by a piece of youthful folly like the present
it is mere folly
mere nonsense
in a little while it will weigh lighter than any feather
but i mighti mightif this silly business were not completely relinquished altogether be induced in some anxious moment to guard her from and surround her with protections against the consequences of any foolish step in the way of marriage
now mr copperfield i hope that you will not render it necessary for me to open even for a quarter of an hour that closed page in the book of life and unsettle even for a quarter of an hour grave affairs long since composed there was a serenity a tranquillity a calm sunset air about him which quite affected me
he was so peaceful and resignedclearly had his affairs in such perfect train and so systematically wound upthat he was a man to feel touched in the contemplation of
i really think i saw tears rise to his eyes from the depth of his own feeling of all this
but what could i do
i could not deny dora and my own heart
when he told me i had better take a week to consider of what he had said how could i say i wouldnt take a week yet how could i fail to know that no amount of weeks could influence such love as mine
in the meantime confer with miss trotwood or with any person with any knowledge of life said mr spenlow adjusting his cravat with both hands
take a week mr copperfield i submitted and with a countenance as expressive as i was able to make it of dejected and despairing constancy came out of the room
miss murdstones heavy eyebrows followed me to the doori say her eyebrows rather than her eyes because they were much more important in her faceand she looked so exactly as she used to look at about that hour of the morning in our parlour at blunderstone that i could have fancied i had been breaking down in my lessons again and that the dead weight on my mind was that horrible old spellingbook with oval woodcuts shaped to my youthful fancy like the glasses out of spectacles
when i got to the office and shutting out old tiffey and the rest of them with my hands sat at my desk in my own particular nook thinking of this earthquake that had taken place so unexpectedly and in the bitterness of my spirit cursing jip i fell into such a state of torment about dora that i wonder i did not take up my hat and rush insanely to norwood
the idea of their frightening her and making her cry and of my not being there to comfort her was so excruciating that it impelled me to write a wild letter to mr spenlow beseeching him not to visit upon her the consequences of my awful destiny
i implored him to spare her gentle naturenot to crush a fragile flowerand addressed him generally to the best of my remembrance as if instead of being her father he had been an ogre or the dragon of wantley
this letter i sealed and laid upon his desk before he returned and when he came in i saw him through the halfopened door of his room take it up and read it
he said nothing about it all the morning but before he went away in the afternoon he called me in and told me that i need not make myself at all uneasy about his daughters happiness
he had assured her he said that it was all nonsense and he had nothing more to say to her
he believed he was an indulgent father as indeed he was and i might spare myself any solicitude on her account
you may make it necessary if you are foolish or obstinate mr copperfield he observed for me to send my daughter abroad again for a term but i have a better opinion of you
i hope you will be wiser than that in a few days
as to miss murdstone for i had alluded to her in the letter i respect that ladys vigilance and feel obliged to her but she has strict charge to avoid the subject
all i desire mr copperfield is that it should be forgotten
all you have got to do mr copperfield is to forget it all
in the note i wrote to miss mills i bitterly quoted this sentiment
all i had to do i said with gloomy sarcasm was to forget dora
that was all and what was that
i entreated miss mills to see me that evening
if it could not be done with mr millss sanction and concurrence i besought a clandestine interview in the back kitchen where the mangle was
i informed her that my reason was tottering on its throne and only she miss mills could prevent its being deposed
i signed myself hers distractedly and i couldnt help feeling while i read this composition over before sending it by a porter that it was something in the style of mr micawber
however i sent it
at night i repaired to miss millss street and walked up and down until i was stealthily fetched in by miss millss maid and taken the area way to the back kitchen
i have since seen reason to believe that there was nothing on earth to prevent my going in at the front door and being shown up into the drawingroom except miss millss love of the romantic and mysterious
in the back kitchen i raved as became me
i went there i suppose to make a fool of myself and i am quite sure i did it
miss mills had received a hasty note from dora telling her that all was discovered and saying
oh pray come to me julia do do but miss mills mistrusting the acceptability of her presence to the higher powers had not yet gone and we were all benighted in the desert of sahara
miss mills had a wonderful flow of words and liked to pour them out
i could not help feeling though she mingled her tears with mine that she had a dreadful luxury in our afflictions
she petted them as i may say and made the most of them
a deep gulf she observed had opened between dora and me and love could only span it with its rainbow
love must suffer in this stern world it ever had been so it ever would be so
no matter miss mills remarked
hearts confined by cobwebs would burst at last and then love was avenged
this was small consolation but miss mills wouldnt encourage fallacious hopes
she made me much more wretched than i was before and i felt and told her with the deepest gratitude that she was indeed a friend
we resolved that she should go to dora the first thing in the morning and find some means of assuring her either by looks or words of my devotion and misery
we parted overwhelmed with grief and i think miss mills enjoyed herself completely
i confided all to my aunt when i got home and in spite of all she could say to me went to bed despairing
i got up despairing and went out despairing
it was saturday morning and i went straight to the commons
i was surprised when i came within sight of our officedoor to see the ticketporters standing outside talking together and some halfdozen stragglers gazing at the windows which were shut up
i quickened my pace and passing among them wondering at their looks went hurriedly in
the clerks were there but nobody was doing anything
old tiffey for the first time in his life i should think was sitting on somebody elses stool and had not hung up his hat
this is a dreadful calamity mr copperfield said he as i entered
what is i exclaimed
whats the matter dont you know cried tiffey and all the rest of them coming round me
no said i looking from face to face
mr
spenlow said tiffey
what about him dead i thought it was the office reeling and not i as one of the clerks caught hold of me
they sat me down in a chair untied my neckcloth and brought me some water
i have no idea whether this took any time
dead said i
he dined in town yesterday and drove down in the phaeton by himself said tiffey having sent his own groom home by the coach as he sometimes did you know well the phaeton went home without him
the horses stopped at the stablegate
the man went out with a lantern
nobody in the carriage had they run away they were not hot said tiffey putting on his glasses no hotter i understand than they would have been going down at the usual pace
the reins were broken but they had been dragging on the ground
the house was roused up directly and three of them went out along the road
they found him a mile off more than a mile off mr tiffey interposed a junior
was it
i believe you are right said tiffeymore than a mile offnot far from the churchlying partly on the roadside and partly on the path upon his face
whether he fell out in a fit or got out feeling ill before the fit came onor even whether he was quite dead then though there is no doubt he was quite insensibleno one appears to know
if he breathed certainly he never spoke
medical assistance was got as soon as possible but it was quite useless i cannot describe the state of mind into which i was thrown by this intelligence
the shock of such an event happening so suddenly and happening to one with whom i had been in any respect at variancethe appalling vacancy in the room he had occupied so lately where his chair and table seemed to wait for him and his handwriting of yesterday was like a ghostthe indefinable impossibility of separating him from the place and feeling when the door opened as if he might come inthe lazy hush and rest there was in the office and the insatiable relish with which our people talked about it and other people came in and out all day and gorged themselves with the subjectthis is easily intelligible to anyone
what i cannot describe is how in the innermost recesses of my own heart i had a lurking jealousy even of death
how i felt as if its might would push me from my ground in doras thoughts
how i was in a grudging way i have no words for envious of her grief
how it made me restless to think of her weeping to others or being consoled by others
how i had a grasping avaricious wish to shut out everybody from her but myself and to be all in all to her at that unseasonable time of all times
in the trouble of this state of mindnot exclusively my own i hope but known to othersi went down to norwood that night and finding from one of the servants when i made my inquiries at the door that miss mills was there got my aunt to direct a letter to her which i wrote
i deplored the untimely death of mr spenlow most sincerely and shed tears in doing so
i entreated her to tell dora if dora were in a state to hear it that he had spoken to me with the utmost kindness and consideration and had coupled nothing but tenderness not a single or reproachful word with her name
i know i did this selfishly to have my name brought before her but i tried to believe it was an act of justice to his memory
perhaps i did believe it
my aunt received a few lines next day in reply addressed outside to her within to me
dora was overcome by grief and when her friend had asked her should she send her love to me had only cried as she was always crying oh dear papa
oh poor papa but she had not said no and that i made the most of
mr jorkins who had been at norwood since the occurrence came to the office a few days afterwards
he and tiffey were closeted together for some few moments and then tiffey looked out at the door and beckoned me in
oh said mr jorkins
mr
tiffey and myself mr copperfield are about to examine the desks the drawers and other such repositories of the deceased with the view of sealing up his private papers and searching for a will
there is no trace of any elsewhere
it may be as well for you to assist us if you please i had been in agony to obtain some knowledge of the circumstances in which my dora would be placedas in whose guardianship and so forthand this was something towards it
we began the search at once mr jorkins unlocking the drawers and desks and we all taking out the papers
the officepapers we placed on one side and the private papers which were not numerous on the other
we were very grave and when we came to a stray seal or pencilcase or ring or any little article of that kind which we associated personally with him we spoke very low
we had sealed up several packets and were still going on dustily and quietly when mr jorkins said to us applying exactly the same words to his late partner as his late partner had applied to him mr
spenlow was very difficult to move from the beaten track
you know what he was
i am disposed to think he had made no will oh i know he had said i
they both stopped and looked at me
on the very day when i last saw him said i he told me that he had and that his affairs were long since settled mr jorkins and old tiffey shook their heads with one accord
that looks unpromising said tiffey
very unpromising said mr jorkins
surely you dont doubt i began
my good mr copperfield said tiffey laying his hand upon my arm and shutting up both his eyes as he shook his head if you had been in the commons as long as i have you would know that there is no subject on which men are so inconsistent and so little to be trusted why bless my soul he made that very remark i replied persistently
i should call that almost final observed tiffey
my opinion isno will it appeared a wonderful thing to me but it turned out that there was no will
he had never so much as thought of making one so far as his papers afforded any evidence for there was no kind of hint sketch or memorandum of any testamentary intention whatever
what was scarcely less astonishing to me was that his affairs were in a most disordered state
it was extremely difficult i heard to make out what he owed or what he had paid or of what he died possessed
it was considered likely that for years he could have had no clear opinion on these subjects himself
by little and little it came out that in the competition on all points of appearance and gentility then running high in the commons he had spent more than his professional income which was not a very large one and had reduced his private means if they ever had been great which was exceedingly doubtful to a very low ebb indeed
there was a sale of the furniture and lease at norwood and tiffey told me little thinking how interested i was in the story that paying all the just debts of the deceased and deducting his share of outstanding bad and doubtful debts due to the firm he wouldnt give a thousand pounds for all the assets remaining
this was at the expiration of about six weeks
i had suffered tortures all the time and thought i really must have laid violent hands upon myself when miss mills still reported to me that my brokenhearted little dora would say nothing when i was mentioned but oh poor papa
oh dear papa also that she had no other relations than two aunts maiden sisters of mr spenlow who lived at putney and who had not held any other than chance communication with their brother for many years
not that they had ever quarrelled miss mills informed me but that having been on the occasion of doras christening invited to tea when they considered themselves privileged to be invited to dinner they had expressed their opinion in writing that it was better for the happiness of all parties that they should stay away
since which they had gone their road and their brother had gone his
these two ladies now emerged from their retirement and proposed to take dora to live at putney
dora clinging to them both and weeping exclaimed o yes aunts
please take julia mills and me and jip to putney so they went very soon after the funeral
how i found time to haunt putney i am sure i dont know but i contrived by some means or other to prowl about the neighbourhood pretty often
miss mills for the more exact discharge of the duties of friendship kept a journal and she used to meet me sometimes on the common and read it or if she had not time to do that lend it to me
how i treasured up the entries of which i subjoin a sample

j m miss mills and her journal were my sole consolation at this period
to see her who had seen dora but a little while beforeto trace the initial letter of doras name through her sympathetic pagesto be made more and more miserable by herwere my only comforts
i felt as if i had been living in a palace of cards which had tumbled down leaving only miss mills and me among the ruins i felt as if some grim enchanter had drawn a magic circle round the innocent goddess of my heart which nothing indeed but those same strong pinions capable of carrying so many people over so much would enable me to enter
my aunt beginning i imagine to be made seriously uncomfortable by my prolonged dejection made a pretence of being anxious that i should go to dover to see that all was working well at the cottage which was let and to conclude an agreement with the same tenant for a longer term of occupation
janet was drafted into the service of mrs strong where i saw her every day
she had been undecided on leaving dover whether or no to give the finishing touch to that renunciation of mankind in which she had been educated by marrying a pilot but she decided against that venture
not so much for the sake of principle i believe as because she happened not to like him
although it required an effort to leave miss mills i fell rather willingly into my aunts pretence as a means of enabling me to pass a few tranquil hours with agnes
i consulted the good doctor relative to an absence of three days and the doctor wishing me to take that relaxationhe wished me to take more but my energy could not bear thati made up my mind to go
as to the commons i had no great occasion to be particular about my duties in that quarter
to say the truth we were getting in no very good odour among the tiptop proctors and were rapidly sliding down to but a doubtful position
the business had been indifferent under mr jorkins before mr spenlows time and although it had been quickened by the infusion of new blood and by the display which mr spenlow made still it was not established on a sufficiently strong basis to bear without being shaken such a blow as the sudden loss of its active manager
it fell off very much
mr jorkins notwithstanding his reputation in the firm was an easygoing incapable sort of man whose reputation out of doors was not calculated to back it up
i was turned over to him now and when i saw him take his snuff and let the business go i regretted my aunts thousand pounds more than ever
but this was not the worst of it
there were a number of hangerson and outsiders about the commons who without being proctors themselves dabbled in commonform business and got it done by real proctors who lent their names in consideration of a share in the spoiland there were a good many of these too
as our house now wanted business on any terms we joined this noble band and threw out lures to the hangerson and outsiders to bring their business to us
marriage licences and small probates were what we all looked for and what paid us best and the competition for these ran very high indeed
kidnappers and inveiglers were planted in all the avenues of entrance to the commons with instructions to do their utmost to cut off all persons in mourning and all gentlemen with anything bashful in their appearance and entice them to the offices in which their respective employers were interested which instructions were so well observed that i myself before i was known by sight was twice hustled into the premises of our principal opponent
the conflicting interests of these touting gentlemen being of a nature to irritate their feelings personal collisions took place and the commons was even scandalized by our principal inveigler who had formerly been in the wine trade and afterwards in the sworn brokery line walking about for some days with a black eye
any one of these scouts used to think nothing of politely assisting an old lady in black out of a vehicle killing any proctor whom she inquired for representing his employer as the lawful successor and representative of that proctor and bearing the old lady off sometimes greatly affected to his employers office
many captives were brought to me in this way
as to marriage licences the competition rose to such a pitch that a shy gentleman in want of one had nothing to do but submit himself to the first inveigler or be fought for and become the prey of the strongest
one of our clerks who was an outsider used in the height of this contest to sit with his hat on that he might be ready to rush out and swear before a surrogate any victim who was brought in
the system of inveigling continues i believe to this day
the last time i was in the commons a civil ablebodied person in a white apron pounced out upon me from a doorway and whispering the word marriagelicence in my ear was with great difficulty prevented from taking me up in his arms and lifting me into a proctors
from this digression let me proceed to dover
i found everything in a satisfactory state at the cottage and was enabled to gratify my aunt exceedingly by reporting that the tenant inherited her feud and waged incessant war against donkeys
having settled the little business i had to transact there and slept there one night i walked on to canterbury early in the morning
it was now winter again and the fresh cold windy day and the sweeping downland brightened up my hopes a little
coming into canterbury i loitered through the old streets with a sober pleasure that calmed my spirits and eased my heart
there were the old signs the old names over the shops the old people serving in them
it appeared so long since i had been a schoolboy there that i wondered the place was so little changed until i reflected how little i was changed myself
strange to say that quiet influence which was inseparable in my mind from agnes seemed to pervade even the city where she dwelt
the venerable cathedral towers and the old jackdaws and rooks whose airy voices made them more retired than perfect silence would have done the battered gateways one stuck full with statues long thrown down and crumbled away like the reverential pilgrims who had gazed upon them the still nooks where the ivied growth of centuries crept over gabled ends and ruined walls the ancient houses the pastoral landscape of field orchard and garden everywhereon everythingi felt the same serener air the same calm thoughtful softening spirit
arrived at mr wickfields house i found in the little lower room on the ground floor where uriah heep had been of old accustomed to sit mr micawber plying his pen with great assiduity
he was dressed in a legallooking suit of black and loomed burly and large in that small office
mr micawber was extremely glad to see me but a little confused too
he would have conducted me immediately into the presence of uriah but i declined
i know the house of old you recollect said i and will find my way upstairs
how do you like the law mr micawber my dear copperfield he replied
to a man possessed of the higher imaginative powers the objection to legal studies is the amount of detail which they involve
even in our professional correspondence said mr micawber glancing at some letters he was writing the mind is not at liberty to soar to any exalted form of expression
still it is a great pursuit
a great pursuit he then told me that he had become the tenant of uriah heeps old house and that mrs micawber would be delighted to receive me once more under her own roof
it is humble said mr micawber to quote a favourite expression of my friend heep but it may prove the steppingstone to more ambitious domiciliary accommodation i asked him whether he had reason so far to be satisfied with his friend heeps treatment of him
he got up to ascertain if the door were close shut before he replied in a lower voice my dear copperfield a man who labours under the pressure of pecuniary embarrassments is with the generality of people at a disadvantage
that disadvantage is not diminished when that pressure necessitates the drawing of stipendiary emoluments before those emoluments are strictly due and payable
all i can say is that my friend heep has responded to appeals to which i need not more particularly refer in a manner calculated to redound equally to the honour of his head and of his heart i should not have supposed him to be very free with his money either i observed
pardon me said mr micawber with an air of constraint i speak of my friend heep as i have experience i am glad your experience is so favourable i returned
you are very obliging my dear copperfield said mr micawber and hummed a tune
do you see much of mr wickfield i asked to change the subject
not much said mr micawber slightingly
mr
wickfield is i dare say a man of very excellent intentions but he isin short he is obsolete i am afraid his partner seeks to make him so said i
my dear copperfield returned mr micawber after some uneasy evolutions on his stool allow me to offer a remark
i am here in a capacity of confidence
i am here in a position of trust
the discussion of some topics even with mrs micawber herself so long the partner of my various vicissitudes and a woman of a remarkable lucidity of intellect is i am led to consider incompatible with the functions now devolving on me
i would therefore take the liberty of suggesting that in our friendly intercoursewhich i trust will never be disturbedwe draw a line
on one side of this line said mr micawber representing it on the desk with the office ruler is the whole range of the human intellect with a trifling exception on the other is that exception that is to say the affairs of messrs wickfield and heep with all belonging and appertaining thereunto
i trust i give no offence to the companion of my youth in submitting this proposition to his cooler judgement though i saw an uneasy change in mr micawber which sat tightly on him as if his new duties were a misfit i felt i had no right to be offended
my telling him so appeared to relieve him and he shook hands with me
i am charmed copperfield said mr micawber let me assure you with miss wickfield
she is a very superior young lady of very remarkable attractions graces and virtues
upon my honour said mr micawber indefinitely kissing his hand and bowing with his genteelest air i do homage to miss wickfield
hem i am glad of that at least said i
if you had not assured us my dear copperfield on the occasion of that agreeable afternoon we had the happiness of passing with you that d was your favourite letter said mr micawber i should unquestionably have supposed that a had been so we have all some experience of a feeling that comes over us occasionally of what we are saying and doing having been said and done before in a remote timeof our having been surrounded dim ages ago by the same faces objects and circumstancesof our knowing perfectly what will be said next as if we suddenly remembered it
i never had this mysterious impression more strongly in my life than before he uttered those words
i took my leave of mr micawber for the time charging him with my best remembrances to all at home
as i left him resuming his stool and his pen and rolling his head in his stock to get it into easier writing order i clearly perceived that there was something interposed between him and me since he had come into his new functions which prevented our getting at each other as we used to do and quite altered the character of our intercourse
there was no one in the quaint old drawingroom though it presented tokens of mrs heeps whereabouts
i looked into the room still belonging to agnes and saw her sitting by the fire at a pretty oldfashioned desk she had writing
my darkening the light made her look up
what a pleasure to be the cause of that bright change in her attentive face and the object of that sweet regard and welcome
ah agnes said i when we were sitting together side by side i have missed you so much lately indeed she replied
again
and so soon i shook my head
i dont know how it is agnes i seem to want some faculty of mind that i ought to have
you were so much in the habit of thinking for me in the happy old days here and i came so naturally to you for counsel and support that i really think i have missed acquiring it and what is it said agnes cheerfully
i dont know what to call it i replied
i think i am earnest and persevering i am sure of it said agnes
and patient agnes i inquired with a little hesitation
yes returned agnes laughing
pretty well and yet said i i get so miserable and worried and am so unsteady and irresolute in my power of assuring myself that i know i must wantshall i call itreliance of some kind call it so if you will said agnes
well i returned
see here
you come to london i rely on you and i have an object and a course at once
i am driven out of it i come here and in a moment i feel an altered person
the circumstances that distressed me are not changed since i came into this room but an influence comes over me in that short interval that alters me oh how much for the better
what is it
what is your secret agnes her head was bent down looking at the fire
its the old story said i
dont laugh when i say it was always the same in little things as it is in greater ones
my old troubles were nonsense and now they are serious but whenever i have gone away from my adopted sister agnes looked upwith such a heavenly faceand gave me her hand which i kissed
whenever i have not had you agnes to advise and approve in the beginning i have seemed to go wild and to get into all sorts of difficulty
when i have come to you at last as i have always done i have come to peace and happiness
i come home now like a tired traveller and find such a blessed sense of rest i felt so deeply what i said it affected me so sincerely that my voice failed and i covered my face with my hand and broke into tears
i write the truth
whatever contradictions and inconsistencies there were within me as there are within so many of us whatever might have been so different and so much better whatever i had done in which i had perversely wandered away from the voice of my own heart i knew nothing of
i only knew that i was fervently in earnest when i felt the rest and peace of having agnes near me
in her placid sisterly manner with her beaming eyes with her tender voice and with that sweet composure which had long ago made the house that held her quite a sacred place to me she soon won me from this weakness and led me on to tell all that had happened since our last meeting
and there is not another word to tell agnes said i when i had made an end of my confidence
now my reliance is on you but it must not be on me trotwood returned agnes with a pleasant smile
it must be on someone else on dora said i
assuredly why i have not mentioned agnes said i a little embarrassed that dora is rather difficult toi would not for the world say to rely upon because she is the soul of purity and truthbut rather difficult toi hardly know how to express it really agnes
she is a timid little thing and easily disturbed and frightened
some time ago before her fathers death when i thought it right to mention to herbut ill tell you if you will bear with me how it was accordingly i told agnes about my declaration of poverty about the cookerybook the housekeeping accounts and all the rest of it
oh trotwood she remonstrated with a smile
just your old headlong way
you might have been in earnest in striving to get on in the world without being so very sudden with a timid loving inexperienced girl
poor dora i never heard such sweet forbearing kindness expressed in a voice as she expressed in making this reply
it was as if i had seen her admiringly and tenderly embracing dora and tacitly reproving me by her considerate protection for my hot haste in fluttering that little heart
it was as if i had seen dora in all her fascinating artlessness caressing agnes and thanking her and coaxingly appealing against me and loving me with all her childish innocence
i felt so grateful to agnes and admired her so
i saw those two together in a bright perspective such wellassociated friends each adorning the other so much
what ought i to do then agnes i inquired after looking at the fire a little while
what would it be right to do i think said agnes that the honourable course to take would be to write to those two ladies
dont you think that any secret course is an unworthy one yes
if you think so said i
i am poorly qualified to judge of such matters replied agnes with a modest hesitation but i certainly feelin short i feel that your being secret and clandestine is not being like yourself like myself in the too high opinion you have of me agnes i am afraid said i
like yourself in the candour of your nature she returned and therefore i would write to those two ladies
i would relate as plainly and as openly as possible all that has taken place and i would ask their permission to visit sometimes at their house
considering that you are young and striving for a place in life i think it would be well to say that you would readily abide by any conditions they might impose upon you
i would entreat them not to dismiss your request without a reference to dora and to discuss it with her when they should think the time suitable
i would not be too vehement said agnes gently or propose too much
i would trust to my fidelity and perseveranceand to dora but if they were to frighten dora again agnes by speaking to her said i
and if dora were to cry and say nothing about me is that likely inquired agnes with the same sweet consideration in her face
god bless her she is as easily scared as a bird said i
it might be
or if the two miss spenlows elderly ladies of that sort are odd characters sometimes should not be likely persons to address in that way i dont think trotwood returned agnes raising her soft eyes to mine i would consider that
perhaps it would be better only to consider whether it is right to do this and if it is to do it i had no longer any doubt on the subject
with a lightened heart though with a profound sense of the weighty importance of my task i devoted the whole afternoon to the composition of the draft of this letter for which great purpose agnes relinquished her desk to me
but first i went downstairs to see mr wickfield and uriah heep
i found uriah in possession of a new plastersmelling office built out in the garden looking extraordinarily mean in the midst of a quantity of books and papers
he received me in his usual fawning way and pretended not to have heard of my arrival from mr micawber a pretence i took the liberty of disbelieving
he accompanied me into mr wickfields room which was the shadow of its former selfhaving been divested of a variety of conveniences for the accommodation of the new partnerand stood before the fire warming his back and shaving his chin with his bony hand while mr wickfield and i exchanged greetings
you stay with us trotwood while you remain in canterbury said mr wickfield not without a glance at uriah for his approval
is there room for me said i
i am sure master copperfieldi should say mister but the other comes so natural said uriahi would turn out of your old room with pleasure if it would be agreeable no no said mr wickfield
why should you be inconvenienced
theres another room
theres another room oh but you know returned uriah with a grin i should really be delighted to cut the matter short i said i would have the other room or none at all so it was settled that i should have the other room and taking my leave of the firm until dinner i went upstairs again
i had hoped to have no other companion than agnes
but mrs heep had asked permission to bring herself and her knitting near the fire in that room on pretence of its having an aspect more favourable for her rheumatics as the wind then was than the drawingroom or diningparlour
though i could almost have consigned her to the mercies of the wind on the topmost pinnacle of the cathedral without remorse i made a virtue of necessity and gave her a friendly salutation
im umbly thankful to you sir said mrs heep in acknowledgement of my inquiries concerning her health but im only pretty well
i havent much to boast of
if i could see my uriah well settled in life i couldnt expect much more i think
how do you think my ury looking sir i thought him looking as villainous as ever and i replied that i saw no change in him
oh dont you think hes changed said mrs heep
there i must umbly beg leave to differ from you
dont you see a thinness in him not more than usual i replied
dont you though said mrs heep
but you dont take notice of him with a mothers eye his mothers eye was an evil eye to the rest of the world i thought as it met mine howsoever affectionate to him and i believe she and her son were devoted to one another
it passed me and went on to agnes
dont you see a wasting and a wearing in him miss wickfield inquired mrs heep
no said agnes quietly pursuing the work on which she was engaged
you are too solicitous about him
he is very well mrs heep with a prodigious sniff resumed her knitting
she never left off or left us for a moment
i had arrived early in the day and we had still three or four hours before dinner but she sat there plying her knittingneedles as monotonously as an hourglass might have poured out its sands
she sat on one side of the fire i sat at the desk in front of it a little beyond me on the other side sat agnes
whensoever slowly pondering over my letter i lifted up my eyes and meeting the thoughtful face of agnes saw it clear and beam encouragement upon me with its own angelic expression i was conscious presently of the evil eye passing me and going on to her and coming back to me again and dropping furtively upon the knitting
what the knitting was i dont know not being learned in that art but it looked like a net and as she worked away with those chinese chopsticks of knittingneedles she showed in the firelight like an illlooking enchantress baulked as yet by the radiant goodness opposite but getting ready for a cast of her net by and by
at dinner she maintained her watch with the same unwinking eyes
after dinner her son took his turn and when mr wickfield himself and i were left alone together leered at me and writhed until i could hardly bear it
in the drawingroom there was the mother knitting and watching again
all the time that agnes sang and played the mother sat at the piano
once she asked for a particular ballad which she said her ury who was yawning in a great chair doted on and at intervals she looked round at him and reported to agnes that he was in raptures with the music
but she hardly ever spokei question if she ever didwithout making some mention of him
it was evident to me that this was the duty assigned to her
this lasted until bedtime
to have seen the mother and son like two great bats hanging over the whole house and darkening it with their ugly forms made me so uncomfortable that i would rather have remained downstairs knitting and all than gone to bed
i hardly got any sleep
next day the knitting and watching began again and lasted all day
i had not an opportunity of speaking to agnes for ten minutes
i could barely show her my letter
i proposed to her to walk out with me but mrs heep repeatedly complaining that she was worse agnes charitably remained within to bear her company
towards the twilight i went out by myself musing on what i ought to do and whether i was justified in withholding from agnes any longer what uriah heep had told me in london for that began to trouble me again very much
i had not walked out far enough to be quite clear of the town upon the ramsgate road where there was a good path when i was hailed through the dust by somebody behind me
the shambling figure and the scanty greatcoat were not to be mistaken
i stopped and uriah heep came up
well said i
how fast you walk said he
my legs are pretty long but youve given em quite a job where are you going said i
i am going with you master copperfield if youll allow me the pleasure of a walk with an old acquaintance saying this with a jerk of his body which might have been either propitiatory or derisive he fell into step beside me
uriah said i as civilly as i could after a silence
master copperfield said uriah
to tell you the truth at which you will not be offended i came out to walk alone because i have had so much company he looked at me sideways and said with his hardest grin you mean mother why yes i do said i
ah
but you know were so very umble he returned
and having such a knowledge of our own umbleness we must really take care that were not pushed to the wall by them as isnt umble
all stratagems are fair in love sir raising his great hands until they touched his chin he rubbed them softly and softly chuckled looking as like a malevolent baboon i thought as anything human could look
you see he said still hugging himself in that unpleasant way and shaking his head at me youre quite a dangerous rival master copperfield
you always was you know do you set a watch upon miss wickfield and make her home no home because of me said i
oh
master copperfield
those are very arsh words he replied
put my meaning into any words you like said i
you know what it is uriah as well as i do oh no
you must put it into words he said
oh really
i couldnt myself do you suppose said i constraining myself to be very temperate and quiet with him on account of agnes that i regard miss wickfield otherwise than as a very dear sister well master copperfield he replied you perceive i am not bound to answer that question
you may not you know
but then you see you may anything to equal the low cunning of his visage and of his shadowless eyes without the ghost of an eyelash i never saw
come then said i
for the sake of miss wickfield my agnes he exclaimed with a sickly angular contortion of himself
would you be so good as call her agnes master copperfield for the sake of agnes wickfieldheaven bless her thank you for that blessing master copperfield he interposed
i will tell you what i should under any other circumstances as soon have thought of telling tojack ketch to who sir said uriah stretching out his neck and shading his ear with his hand
to the hangman i returned
the most unlikely person i could think ofthough his own face had suggested the allusion quite as a natural sequence
i am engaged to another young lady
i hope that contents you upon your soul said uriah
i was about indignantly to give my assertion the confirmation he required when he caught hold of my hand and gave it a squeeze
oh master copperfield he said
if you had only had the condescension to return my confidence when i poured out the fulness of my art the night i put you so much out of the way by sleeping before your sittingroom fire i never should have doubted you
as it is im sure ill take off mother directly and only too appy
i know youll excuse the precautions of affection wont you
what a pity master copperfield that you didnt condescend to return my confidence
im sure i gave you every opportunity
but you never have condescended to me as much as i could have wished
i know you have never liked me as i have liked you all this time he was squeezing my hand with his damp fishy fingers while i made every effort i decently could to get it away
but i was quite unsuccessful
he drew it under the sleeve of his mulberrycoloured greatcoat and i walked on almost upon compulsion arminarm with him
shall we turn said uriah by and by wheeling me face about towards the town on which the early moon was now shining silvering the distant windows
before we leave the subject you ought to understand said i breaking a pretty long silence that i believe agnes wickfield to be as far above you and as far removed from all your aspirations as that moon herself peaceful
aint she said uriah
very
now confess master copperfield that you havent liked me quite as i have liked you
all along youve thought me too umble now i shouldnt wonder i am not fond of professions of humility i returned or professions of anything else there now said uriah looking flabby and leadcoloured in the moonlight
didnt i know it
but how little you think of the rightful umbleness of a person in my station master copperfield
father and me was both brought up at a foundation school for boys and mother she was likewise brought up at a public sort of charitable establishment
they taught us all a deal of umblenessnot much else that i know of from morning to night
we was to be umble to this person and umble to that and to pull off our caps here and to make bows there and always to know our place and abase ourselves before our betters
and we had such a lot of betters
father got the monitormedal by being umble
so did i
father got made a sexton by being umble
he had the character among the gentlefolks of being such a wellbehaved man that they were determined to bring him in
be umble uriah says father to me and youll get on
it was what was always being dinned into you and me at school its what goes down best
be umble says father and youll do and really it aint done bad it was the first time it had ever occurred to me that this detestable cant of false humility might have originated out of the heep family
i had seen the harvest but had never thought of the seed
when i was quite a young boy said uriah i got to know what umbleness did and i took to it
i ate umble pie with an appetite
i stopped at the umble point of my learning and says i hold hard when you offered to teach me latin i knew better
people like to be above you says father keep yourself down i am very umble to the present moment master copperfield but ive got a little power and he said all thisi knew as i saw his face in the moonlightthat i might understand he was resolved to recompense himself by using his power
i had never doubted his meanness his craft and malice but i fully comprehended now for the first time what a base unrelenting and revengeful spirit must have been engendered by this early and this long suppression
his account of himself was so far attended with an agreeable result that it led to his withdrawing his hand in order that he might have another hug of himself under the chin
once apart from him i was determined to keep apart and we walked back side by side saying very little more by the way
whether his spirits were elevated by the communication i had made to him or by his having indulged in this retrospect i dont know but they were raised by some influence
he talked more at dinner than was usual with him asked his mother off duty from the moment of our reentering the house whether he was not growing too old for a bachelor and once looked at agnes so that i would have given all i had for leave to knock him down
when we three males were left alone after dinner he got into a more adventurous state
he had taken little or no wine and i presume it was the mere insolence of triumph that was upon him flushed perhaps by the temptation my presence furnished to its exhibition
i had observed yesterday that he tried to entice mr wickfield to drink and interpreting the look which agnes had given me as she went out had limited myself to one glass and then proposed that we should follow her
i would have done so again today but uriah was too quick for me
we seldom see our present visitor sir he said addressing mr wickfield sitting such a contrast to him at the end of the table and i should propose to give him welcome in another glass or two of wine if you have no objections
mr copperfield your elth and appiness i was obliged to make a show of taking the hand he stretched across to me and then with very different emotions i took the hand of the broken gentleman his partner
come fellowpartner said uriah if i may take the libertynow suppose you give us something or another appropriate to copperfield i pass over mr wickfields proposing my aunt his proposing mr dick his proposing doctors commons his proposing uriah his drinking everything twice his consciousness of his own weakness the ineffectual effort that he made against it the struggle between his shame in uriahs deportment and his desire to conciliate him the manifest exultation with which uriah twisted and turned and held him up before me
it made me sick at heart to see and my hand recoils from writing it
come fellowpartner said uriah at last ill give you another one and i umbly ask for bumpers seeing i intend to make it the divinest of her sex her father had his empty glass in his hand
i saw him set it down look at the picture she was so like put his hand to his forehead and shrink back in his elbowchair
im an umble individual to give you her elth proceeded uriah but i admireadore her no physical pain that her fathers grey head could have borne i think could have been more terrible to me than the mental endurance i saw compressed now within both his hands
agnes said uriah either not regarding him or not knowing what the nature of his action was agnes wickfield is i am safe to say the divinest of her sex
may i speak out among friends
to be her father is a proud distinction but to be her usband spare me from ever again hearing such a cry as that with which her father rose up from the table
whats the matter said uriah turning of a deadly colour
you are not gone mad after all mr wickfield i hope
if i say ive an ambition to make your agnes my agnes i have as good a right to it as another man
i have a better right to it than any other man i had my arms round mr wickfield imploring him by everything that i could think of oftenest of all by his love for agnes to calm himself a little
he was mad for the moment tearing out his hair beating his head trying to force me from him and to force himself from me not answering a word not looking at or seeing anyone blindly striving for he knew not what his face all staring and distorteda frightful spectacle
i conjured him incoherently but in the most impassioned manner not to abandon himself to this wildness but to hear me
i besought him to think of agnes to connect me with agnes to recollect how agnes and i had grown up together how i honoured her and loved her how she was his pride and joy
i tried to bring her idea before him in any form i even reproached him with not having firmness to spare her the knowledge of such a scene as this
i may have effected something or his wildness may have spent itself but by degrees he struggled less and began to look at mestrangely at first then with recognition in his eyes
at length he said i know trotwood
my darling child and youi know
but look at him he pointed to uriah pale and glowering in a corner evidently very much out in his calculations and taken by surprise
look at my torturer he replied
before him i have step by step abandoned name and reputation peace and quiet house and home i have kept your name and reputation for you and your peace and quiet and your house and home too said uriah with a sulky hurried defeated air of compromise
dont be foolish mr wickfield
if i have gone a little beyond what you were prepared for i can go back i suppose
theres no harm done i looked for single motives in everyone said mr wickfield and i was satisfied i had bound him to me by motives of interest
but see what he isoh see what he is you had better stop him copperfield if you can cried uriah with his long forefinger pointing towards me
hell say something presentlymind youhell be sorry to have said afterwards and youll be sorry to have heard ill say anything cried mr wickfield with a desperate air
why should i not be in all the worlds power if i am in yours mind
i tell you said uriah continuing to warn me
if you dont stop his mouth youre not his friend
why shouldnt you be in all the worlds power mr wickfield
because you have got a daughter
you and me know what we know dont we
let sleeping dogs liewho wants to rouse em
i dont
cant you see i am as umble as i can be
i tell you if ive gone too far im sorry
what would you have sir oh trotwood trotwood exclaimed mr wickfield wringing his hands
what i have come down to be since i first saw you in this house
i was on my downward way then but the dreary dreary road i have traversed since
weak indulgence has ruined me
indulgence in remembrance and indulgence in forgetfulness
my natural grief for my childs mother turned to disease my natural love for my child turned to disease
i have infected everything i touched
i have brought misery on what i dearly love i knowyou know
i thought it possible that i could truly love one creature in the world and not love the rest i thought it possible that i could truly mourn for one creature gone out of the world and not have some part in the grief of all who mourned
thus the lessons of my life have been perverted
i have preyed on my own morbid coward heart and it has preyed on me
sordid in my grief sordid in my love sordid in my miserable escape from the darker side of both oh see the ruin i am and hate me shun me he dropped into a chair and weakly sobbed
the excitement into which he had been roused was leaving him
uriah came out of his corner
i dont know all i have done in my fatuity said mr wickfield putting out his hands as if to deprecate my condemnation
he knows best meaning uriah heep for he has always been at my elbow whispering me
you see the millstone that he is about my neck
you find him in my house you find him in my business
you heard him but a little time ago
what need have i to say more you havent need to say so much nor half so much nor anything at all observed uriah half defiant and half fawning
you wouldnt have took it up so if it hadnt been for the wine
youll think better of it tomorrow sir
if i have said too much or more than i meant what of it
i havent stood by it the door opened and agnes gliding in without a vestige of colour in her face put her arm round his neck and steadily said papa you are not well
come with me he laid his head upon her shoulder as if he were oppressed with heavy shame and went out with her
her eyes met mine for but an instant yet i saw how much she knew of what had passed
i didnt expect hed cut up so rough master copperfield said uriah
but its nothing
ill be friends with him tomorrow
its for his good
im umbly anxious for his good i gave him no answer and went upstairs into the quiet room where agnes had so often sat beside me at my books
nobody came near me until late at night
i took up a book and tried to read
i heard the clocks strike twelve and was still reading without knowing what i read when agnes touched me
you will be going early in the morning trotwood
let us say goodbye now she had been weeping but her face then was so calm and beautiful
heaven bless you she said giving me her hand
dearest agnes i returned i see you ask me not to speak of tonightbut is there nothing to be done there is god to trust in she replied
can i do nothingi who come to you with my poor sorrows and make mine so much lighter she replied
dear trotwood no dear agnes i said it is presumptuous for me who am so poor in all in which you are so richgoodness resolution all noble qualitiesto doubt or direct you but you know how much i love you and how much i owe you
you will never sacrifice yourself to a mistaken sense of duty agnes more agitated for a moment than i had ever seen her she took her hands from me and moved a step back
say you have no such thought dear agnes
much more than sister
think of the priceless gift of such a heart as yours of such a love as yours oh
long long afterwards i saw that face rise up before me with its momentary look not wondering not accusing not regretting
oh long long afterwards i saw that look subside as it did now into the lovely smile with which she told me she had no fear for herselfi need have none for herand parted from me by the name of brother and was gone
it was dark in the morning when i got upon the coach at the inn door
the day was just breaking when we were about to start and then as i sat thinking of her came struggling up the coach side through the mingled day and night uriahs head
copperfield said he in a croaking whisper as he hung by the iron on the roof i thought youd be glad to hear before you went off that there are no squares broke between us
ive been into his room already and weve made it all smooth
why though im umble im useful to him you know and he understands his interest when he isnt in liquor
what an agreeable man he is after all master copperfield i obliged myself to say that i was glad he had made his apology
oh to be sure said uriah
when a persons umble you know whats an apology
so easy
i say
i suppose with a jerk you have sometimes plucked a pear before it was ripe master copperfield i suppose i have i replied
i did that last night said uriah but itll ripen yet
it only wants attending to
i can wait profuse in his farewells he got down again as the coachman got up
for anything i know he was eating something to keep the raw morning air out but he made motions with his mouth as if the pear were ripe already and he were smacking his lips over it
we had a very serious conversation in buckingham street that night about the domestic occurrences i have detailed in the last chapter
my aunt was deeply interested in them and walked up and down the room with her arms folded for more than two hours afterwards
whenever she was particularly discomposed she always performed one of these pedestrian feats and the amount of her discomposure might always be estimated by the duration of her walk
on this occasion she was so much disturbed in mind as to find it necessary to open the bedroom door and make a course for herself comprising the full extent of the bedrooms from wall to wall and while mr dick and i sat quietly by the fire she kept passing in and out along this measured track at an unchanging pace with the regularity of a clockpendulum
when my aunt and i were left to ourselves by mr dicks going out to bed i sat down to write my letter to the two old ladies
by that time she was tired of walking and sat by the fire with her dress tucked up as usual
but instead of sitting in her usual manner holding her glass upon her knee she suffered it to stand neglected on the chimneypiece and resting her left elbow on her right arm and her chin on her left hand looked thoughtfully at me
as often as i raised my eyes from what i was about i met hers
i am in the lovingest of tempers my dear she would assure me with a nod but i am fidgeted and sorry i had been too busy to observe until after she was gone to bed that she had left her nightmixture as she always called it untasted on the chimneypiece
she came to her door with even more than her usual affection of manner when i knocked to acquaint her with this discovery but only said i have not the heart to take it trot tonight and shook her head and went in again
she read my letter to the two old ladies in the morning and approved of it
i posted it and had nothing to do then but wait as patiently as i could for the reply
i was still in this state of expectation and had been for nearly a week when i left the doctors one snowy night to walk home
it had been a bitter day and a cutting northeast wind had blown for some time
the wind had gone down with the light and so the snow had come on
it was a heavy settled fall i recollect in great flakes and it lay thick
the noise of wheels and tread of people were as hushed as if the streets had been strewn that depth with feathers
my shortest way homeand i naturally took the shortest way on such a nightwas through st martins lane
now the church which gives its name to the lane stood in a less free situation at that time there being no open space before it and the lane winding down to the strand
as i passed the steps of the portico i encountered at the corner a womans face
it looked in mine passed across the narrow lane and disappeared
i knew it
i had seen it somewhere
but i could not remember where
i had some association with it that struck upon my heart directly but i was thinking of anything else when it came upon me and was confused
on the steps of the church there was the stooping figure of a man who had put down some burden on the smooth snow to adjust it my seeing the face and my seeing him were simultaneous
i dont think i had stopped in my surprise but in any case as i went on he rose turned and came down towards me
i stood face to face with mr peggotty
then i remembered the woman
it was martha to whom emily had given the money that night in the kitchen
martha endellside by side with whom he would not have seen his dear niece ham had told me for all the treasures wrecked in the sea
we shook hands heartily
at first neither of us could speak a word
masr davy he said gripping me tight it do my art good to see you sir
well met well met well met my dear old friend said i
i had my thowts o coming to make inquiration for you sir tonight he said but knowing as your aunt was living along wi youfur ive been down yonderyarmouth wayi was afeerd it was too late
i should have come early in the morning sir afore going away again said i
yes sir he replied patiently shaking his head im away tomorrow where were you going now i asked
well he replied shaking the snow out of his long hair i was agoing to turn in somewheers in those days there was a sideentrance to the stableyard of the golden cross the inn so memorable to me in connexion with his misfortune nearly opposite to where we stood
i pointed out the gateway put my arm through his and we went across
two or three publicrooms opened out of the stableyard and looking into one of them and finding it empty and a good fire burning i took him in there
when i saw him in the light i observed not only that his hair was long and ragged but that his face was burnt dark by the sun
he was greyer the lines in his face and forehead were deeper and he had every appearance of having toiled and wandered through all varieties of weather but he looked very strong and like a man upheld by steadfastness of purpose whom nothing could tire out
he shook the snow from his hat and clothes and brushed it away from his face while i was inwardly making these remarks
as he sat down opposite to me at a table with his back to the door by which we had entered he put out his rough hand again and grasped mine warmly
ill tell you masr davy he saidwheer all ive been and whatall weve heerd
ive been fur and weve heerd little but ill tell you i rang the bell for something hot to drink
he would have nothing stronger than ale and while it was being brought and being warmed at the fire he sat thinking
there was a fine massive gravity in his face i did not venture to disturb
when she was a child he said lifting up his head soon after we were left alone she used to talk to me a deal about the sea and about them coasts where the sea got to be dark blue and to lay ashining and ashining in the sun
i thowt odd times as her father being drownded made her think on it so much
i doent know you see but maybe she believedor hopedhe had drifted out to them parts where the flowers is always ablowing and the country bright it is likely to have been a childish fancy i replied
when she waslost said mr peggotty i knowd in my mind as he would take her to them countries
i knowd in my mind as hed have told her wonders of em and how she was to be a lady theer and how he got her to listen to him fust along o sech like
when we see his mother i knowd quite well as i was right
i went acrosschannel to france and landed theer as if id fell down from the sky i saw the door move and the snow drift in
i saw it move a little more and a hand softly interpose to keep it open
i found out an english genleman as was in authority said mr peggotty and told him i was agoing to seek my niece
he got me them papers as i wanted fur to carry me throughi doent rightly know how theyre calledand he would have give me money but that i was thankful to have no need on
i thank him kind for all he done im sure
ive wrote afore you he says to me and i shall speak to many as will come that way and many will know you fur distant from here when youre atravelling alone i told him best as i was able what my gratitoode was and went away through france alone and on foot said i
mostly afoot he rejoined sometimes in carts along with people going to market sometimes in empty coaches
many mile a day afoot and often with some poor soldier or another travelling to see his friends
i couldnt talk to him said mr peggotty nor he to me but we was company for one another too along the dusty roads i should have known that by his friendly tone
when i come to any town he pursued i found the inn and waited about the yard till someone turned up someone mostly did as knowd english
then i told how that i was on my way to seek my niece and they told me what manner of gentlefolks was in the house and i waited to see any as seemed like her going in or out
when it warnt emly i went on agen
by little and little when i come to a new village or that among the poor people i found they knowd about me
they would set me down at their cottage doors and give me whatnot fur to eat and drink and show me where to sleep and many a woman masr davy as has had a daughter of about emlys age ive found awaiting fur me at our saviours cross outside the village fur to do me simlar kindnesses
some has had daughters as was dead
and god only knows how good them mothers was to me it was martha at the door
i saw her haggard listening face distinctly
my dread was lest he should turn his head and see her too
they would often put their childrenparticular their little girls said mr peggotty upon my knee and many a time you might have seen me sitting at their doors when night was coming in amost as if theyd been my darlings children
oh my darling overpowered by sudden grief he sobbed aloud
i laid my trembling hand upon the hand he put before his face
thankee sir he said doent take no notice in a very little while he took his hand away and put it on his breast and went on with his story
they often walked with me he said in the morning maybe a mile or two upon my road and when we parted and i said im very thankful to you
god bless you they always seemed to understand and answered pleasant
at last i come to the sea
it warnt hard you may suppose for a seafaring man like me to work his way over to italy
when i got theer i wandered on as i had done afore
the people was just as good to me and i should have gone from town to town maybe the country through but that i got news of her being seen among them swiss mountains yonder
one as knowd his servant see em there all three and told me how they travelled and where they was
i made fur them mountains masr davy day and night
ever so fur as i went ever so fur the mountains seemed to shift away from me
but i come up with em and i crossed em
when i got nigh the place as i had been told of i began to think within my own self what shall i do when i see her the listening face insensible to the inclement night still drooped at the door and the hands begged meprayed menot to cast it forth
i never doubted her said mr peggotty
no
not a bit
ony let her see my faceony let her heer my voiceony let my stanning still afore her bring to her thoughts the home she had fled away from and the child she had beenand if she had growed to be a royal lady shed have fell down at my feet
i knowd it well
many a time in my sleep had i heerd her cry out uncle and seen her fall like death afore me
many a time in my sleep had i raised her up and whispered to her emly my dear i am come fur to bring forgiveness and to take you home he stopped and shook his head and went on with a sigh
he was nowt to me now
emly was all
i bought a country dress to put upon her and i knowd that once found she would walk beside me over them stony roads go where i would and never never leave me more
to put that dress upon her and to cast off what she woreto take her on my arm again and wander towards hometo stop sometimes upon the road and heal her bruised feet and her worsebruised heartwas all that i thowt of now
i doent believe i should have done so much as look at him
but masr davy it warnt to benot yet
i was too late and they was gone
wheer i couldnt learn
some said heer some said theer
i travelled heer and i travelled theer but i found no emly and i travelled home how long ago i asked
a matter o fower days said mr peggotty
i sighted the old boat arter dark and the light ashining in the winder
when i come nigh and looked in through the glass i see the faithful creetur missis gummidge sittin by the fire as we had fixed upon alone
i called out doent be afeerd
its danl and i went in
i never could have thowt the old boat would have been so strange from some pocket in his breast he took out with a very careful hand a small paper bundle containing two or three letters or little packets which he laid upon the table
this fust one come he said selecting it from the rest afore i had been gone a week
a fifty pound bank note in a sheet of paper directed to me and put underneath the door in the night
she tried to hide her writing but she couldnt hide it from me he folded up the note again with great patience and care in exactly the same form and laid it on one side
this come to missis gummidge he said opening another two or three months ago after looking at it for some moments he gave it to me and added in a low voice be so good as read it sir i read as follows oh what will you feel when you see this writing and know it comes from my wicked hand
but try trynot for my sake but for uncles goodness try to let your heart soften to me only for a little little time
try pray do to relent towards a miserable girl and write down on a bit of paper whether he is well and what he said about me before you left off ever naming me among yourselvesand whether of a night when it is my old time of coming home you ever see him look as if he thought of one he used to love so dear
oh my heart is breaking when i think about it
i am kneeling down to you begging and praying you not to be as hard with me as i deserveas i well well know i deservebut to be so gentle and so good as to write down something of him and to send it to me
you need not call me little you need not call me by the name i have disgraced but oh listen to my agony and have mercy on me so far as to write me some word of uncle never never to be seen in this world by my eyes again
dear if your heart is hard towards mejustly hard i knowbut listen if it is hard dear ask him i have wronged the mosthim whose wife i was to have beenbefore you quite decide against my poor poor prayer
if he should be so compassionate as to say that you might write something for me to readi think he would oh i think he would if you would only ask him for he always was so brave and so forgivingtell him then but not else that when i hear the wind blowing at night i feel as if it was passing angrily from seeing him and uncle and was going up to god against me
tell him that if i was to die tomorrow and oh if i was fit i would be so glad to die
i would bless him and uncle with my last words and pray for his happy home with my last breath some money was enclosed in this letter also
five pounds
it was untouched like the previous sum and he refolded it in the same way
detailed instructions were added relative to the address of a reply which although they betrayed the intervention of several hands and made it difficult to arrive at any very probable conclusion in reference to her place of concealment made it at least not unlikely that she had written from that spot where she was stated to have been seen
what answer was sent i inquired of mr peggotty
missis gummidge he returned not being a good scholar sir ham kindly drawed it out and she made a copy on it
they told her i was gone to seek her and what my parting words was is that another letter in your hand said i
its money sir said mr peggotty unfolding it a little way
ten pound you see
and wrote inside from a true friend like the fust
but the fust was put underneath the door and this come by the post day afore yesterday
im agoing to seek her at the postmark he showed it to me
it was a town on the upper rhine
he had found out at yarmouth some foreign dealers who knew that country and they had drawn him a rude map on paper which he could very well understand
he laid it between us on the table and with his chin resting on one hand tracked his course upon it with the other
i asked him how ham was
he shook his head
he works he said as bold as a man can
his names as good in all that part as any mans is anywheres in the wureld
anyones hand is ready to help him you understand and his is ready to help them
hes never been heerd fur to complain
but my sisters belief is twixt ourselves as it has cut him deep poor fellow i can believe it he aint no care masr davy said mr peggotty in a solemn whisperkinder no care nohow for his life
when a mans wanted for rough sarvice in rough weather hes theer
when theres hard duty to be done with danger in it he steps forard afore all his mates
and yet hes as gentle as any child
there aint a child in yarmouth that doent know him he gathered up the letters thoughtfully smoothing them with his hand put them into their little bundle and placed it tenderly in his breast again
the face was gone from the door
i still saw the snow drifting in but nothing else was there
well he said looking to his bag having seen you tonight masr davy and that doos me good
i shall away betimes tomorrow morning
you have seen what ive got heer putting his hand on where the little packet lay all that troubles me is to think that any harm might come to me afore that money was give back
if i was to die and it was lost or stole or elseways made away with and it was never knowd by him but what id took it i believe the tother wureld wouldnt hold me
i believe i must come back he rose and i rose too we grasped each other by the hand again before going out
id go ten thousand mile he said id go till i dropped dead to lay that money down afore him
if i do that and find my emly im content
if i doent find her maybe shell come to hear sometime as her loving uncle only ended his search for her when he ended his life and if i know her even that will turn her home at last as he went out into the rigorous night i saw the lonely figure flit away before us
i turned him hastily on some pretence and held him in conversation until it was gone
he spoke of a travellers house on the dover road where he knew he could find a clean plain lodging for the night
i went with him over westminster bridge and parted from him on the surrey shore
everything seemed to my imagination to be hushed in reverence for him as he resumed his solitary journey through the snow
i returned to the inn yard and impressed by my remembrance of the face looked awfully around for it
it was not there
the snow had covered our late footprints my new track was the only one to be seen and even that began to die away it snowed so fast as i looked back over my shoulder
at last an answer came from the two old ladies
they presented their compliments to mr copperfield and informed him that they had given his letter their best consideration with a view to the happiness of both partieswhich i thought rather an alarming expression not only because of the use they had made of it in relation to the family difference beforementioned but because i had and have all my life observed that conventional phrases are a sort of fireworks easily let off and liable to take a great variety of shapes and colours not at all suggested by their original form
the misses spenlow added that they begged to forbear expressing through the medium of correspondence an opinion on the subject of mr copperfields communication but that if mr copperfield would do them the favour to call upon a certain day accompanied if he thought proper by a confidential friend they would be happy to hold some conversation on the subject
to this favour mr copperfield immediately replied with his respectful compliments that he would have the honour of waiting on the misses spenlow at the time appointed accompanied in accordance with their kind permission by his friend mr thomas traddles of the inner temple
having dispatched which missive mr copperfield fell into a condition of strong nervous agitation and so remained until the day arrived
it was a great augmentation of my uneasiness to be bereaved at this eventful crisis of the inestimable services of miss mills
but mr mills who was always doing something or other to annoy meor i felt as if he were which was the same thinghad brought his conduct to a climax by taking it into his head that he would go to india
why should he go to india except to harass me
to be sure he had nothing to do with any other part of the world and had a good deal to do with that part being entirely in the india trade whatever that was i had floating dreams myself concerning golden shawls and elephants teeth having been at calcutta in his youth and designing now to go out there again in the capacity of resident partner
but this was nothing to me
however it was so much to him that for india he was bound and julia with him and julia went into the country to take leave of her relations and the house was put into a perfect suit of bills announcing that it was to be let or sold and that the furniture mangle and all was to be taken at a valuation
so here was another earthquake of which i became the sport before i had recovered from the shock of its predecessor
i was in several minds how to dress myself on the important day being divided between my desire to appear to advantage and my apprehensions of putting on anything that might impair my severely practical character in the eyes of the misses spenlow
i endeavoured to hit a happy medium between these two extremes my aunt approved the result and mr dick threw one of his shoes after traddles and me for luck as we went downstairs
excellent fellow as i knew traddles to be and warmly attached to him as i was i could not help wishing on that delicate occasion that he had never contracted the habit of brushing his hair so very upright
it gave him a surprised looknot to say a hearthbroomy kind of expressionwhich my apprehensions whispered might be fatal to us
i took the liberty of mentioning it to traddles as we were walking to putney and saying that if he would smooth it down a little my dear copperfield said traddles lifting off his hat and rubbing his hair all kinds of ways nothing would give me greater pleasure
but it wont wont be smoothed down said i
no said traddles
nothing will induce it
if i was to carry a halfhundredweight upon it all the way to putney it would be up again the moment the weight was taken off
you have no idea what obstinate hair mine is copperfield
i am quite a fretful porcupine i was a little disappointed i must confess but thoroughly charmed by his goodnature too
i told him how i esteemed his goodnature and said that his hair must have taken all the obstinacy out of his character for he had none
oh returned traddles laughing
i assure you its quite an old story my unfortunate hair
my uncles wife couldnt bear it
she said it exasperated her
it stood very much in my way too when i first fell in love with sophy
very much did she object to it she didnt rejoined traddles but her eldest sisterthe one thats the beautyquite made game of it i understand
in fact all the sisters laugh at it agreeable said i
yes returned traddles with perfect innocence its a joke for us
they pretend that sophy has a lock of it in her desk and is obliged to shut it in a clasped book to keep it down
we laugh about it by the by my dear traddles said i your experience may suggest something to me
when you became engaged to the young lady whom you have just mentioned did you make a regular proposal to her family
was there anything likewhat we are going through today for instance i added nervously
why replied traddles on whose attentive face a thoughtful shade had stolen it was rather a painful transaction copperfield in my case
you see sophy being of so much use in the family none of them could endure the thought of her ever being married
indeed they had quite settled among themselves that she never was to be married and they called her the old maid
accordingly when i mentioned it with the greatest precaution to mrs crewler the mama said i
the mama said traddlesreverend horace crewlerwhen i mentioned it with every possible precaution to mrs crewler the effect upon her was such that she gave a scream and became insensible
i couldnt approach the subject again for months you did at last said i
well the reverend horace did said traddles
he is an excellent man most exemplary in every way and he pointed out to her that she ought as a christian to reconcile herself to the sacrifice especially as it was so uncertain and to bear no uncharitable feeling towards me
as to myself copperfield i give you my word i felt a perfect bird of prey towards the family the sisters took your part i hope traddles why i cant say they did he returned
when we had comparatively reconciled mrs crewler to it we had to break it to sarah
you recollect my mentioning sarah as the one that has something the matter with her spine perfectly she clenched both her hands said traddles looking at me in dismay shut her eyes turned leadcolour became perfectly stiff and took nothing for two days but toastandwater administered with a teaspoon what a very unpleasant girl traddles i remarked
oh i beg your pardon copperfield said traddles
she is a very charming girl but she has a great deal of feeling
in fact they all have
sophy told me afterwards that the selfreproach she underwent while she was in attendance upon sarah no words could describe
i know it must have been severe by my own feelings copperfield which were like a criminals
after sarah was restored we still had to break it to the other eight and it produced various effects upon them of a most pathetic nature
the two little ones whom sophy educates have only just left off detesting me at any rate they are all reconciled to it now i hope said i
yeyes i should say they were on the whole resigned to it said traddles doubtfully
the fact is we avoid mentioning the subject and my unsettled prospects and indifferent circumstances are a great consolation to them
there will be a deplorable scene whenever we are married
it will be much more like a funeral than a wedding
and theyll all hate me for taking her away his honest face as he looked at me with a seriocomic shake of his head impresses me more in the remembrance than it did in the reality for i was by this time in a state of such excessive trepidation and wandering of mind as to be quite unable to fix my attention on anything
on our approaching the house where the misses spenlow lived i was at such a discount in respect of my personal looks and presence of mind that traddles proposed a gentle stimulant in the form of a glass of ale
this having been administered at a neighbouring publichouse he conducted me with tottering steps to the misses spenlows door
i had a vague sensation of being as it were on view when the maid opened it and of wavering somehow across a hall with a weatherglass in it into a quiet little drawingroom on the groundfloor commanding a neat garden
also of sitting down here on a sofa and seeing traddless hair start up now his hat was removed like one of those obtrusive little figures made of springs that fly out of fictitious snuffboxes when the lid is taken off
also of hearing an oldfashioned clock ticking away on the chimneypiece and trying to make it keep time to the jerking of my heartwhich it wouldnt
also of looking round the room for any sign of dora and seeing none
also of thinking that jip once barked in the distance and was instantly choked by somebody
ultimately i found myself backing traddles into the fireplace and bowing in great confusion to two dry little elderly ladies dressed in black and each looking wonderfully like a preparation in chip or tan of the late mr spenlow
pray said one of the two little ladies be seated when i had done tumbling over traddles and had sat upon something which was not a catmy first seat wasi so far recovered my sight as to perceive that mr spenlow had evidently been the youngest of the family that there was a disparity of six or eight years between the two sisters and that the younger appeared to be the manager of the conference inasmuch as she had my letter in her handso familiar as it looked to me and yet so oddand was referring to it through an eyeglass
they were dressed alike but this sister wore her dress with a more youthful air than the other and perhaps had a trifle more frill or tucker or brooch or bracelet or some little thing of that kind which made her look more lively
they were both upright in their carriage formal precise composed and quiet
the sister who had not my letter had her arms crossed on her breast and resting on each other like an idol
mr
copperfield i believe said the sister who had got my letter addressing herself to traddles
this was a frightful beginning
traddles had to indicate that i was mr copperfield and i had to lay claim to myself and they had to divest themselves of a preconceived opinion that traddles was mr copperfield and altogether we were in a nice condition
to improve it we all distinctly heard jip give two short barks and receive another choke
mr
copperfield said the sister with the letter
i did somethingbowed i supposeand was all attention when the other sister struck in
my sister lavinia said she being conversant with matters of this nature will state what we consider most calculated to promote the happiness of both parties i discovered afterwards that miss lavinia was an authority in affairs of the heart by reason of there having anciently existed a certain mr pidger who played short whist and was supposed to have been enamoured of her
my private opinion is that this was entirely a gratuitous assumption and that pidger was altogether innocent of any such sentimentsto which he had never given any sort of expression that i could ever hear of
both miss lavinia and miss clarissa had a superstition however that he would have declared his passion if he had not been cut short in his youth at about sixty by overdrinking his constitution and overdoing an attempt to set it right again by swilling bath water
they had a lurking suspicion even that he died of secret love though i must say there was a picture of him in the house with a damask nose which concealment did not appear to have ever preyed upon
we will not said miss lavinia enter on the past history of this matter
our poor brother franciss death has cancelled that we had not said miss clarissa been in the habit of frequent association with our brother francis but there was no decided division or disunion between us
francis took his road we took ours
we considered it conducive to the happiness of all parties that it should be so
and it was so each of the sisters leaned a little forward to speak shook her head after speaking and became upright again when silent
miss clarissa never moved her arms
she sometimes played tunes upon them with her fingersminuets and marches i should thinkbut never moved them
our nieces position or supposed position is much changed by our brother franciss death said miss lavinia and therefore we consider our brothers opinions as regarded her position as being changed too
we have no reason to doubt mr copperfield that you are a young gentleman possessed of good qualities and honourable character or that you have an affectionor are fully persuaded that you have an affectionfor our niece i replied as i usually did whenever i had a chance that nobody had ever loved anybody else as i loved dora
traddles came to my assistance with a confirmatory murmur
miss lavinia was going on to make some rejoinder when miss clarissa who appeared to be incessantly beset by a desire to refer to her brother francis struck in again if doras mama she said when she married our brother francis had at once said that there was not room for the family at the dinnertable it would have been better for the happiness of all parties sister clarissa said miss lavinia
perhaps we neednt mind that now sister lavinia said miss clarissa it belongs to the subject
with your branch of the subject on which alone you are competent to speak i should not think of interfering
on this branch of the subject i have a voice and an opinion
it would have been better for the happiness of all parties if doras mama when she married our brother francis had mentioned plainly what her intentions were
we should then have known what we had to expect
we should have said pray do not invite us at any time and all possibility of misunderstanding would have been avoided when miss clarissa had shaken her head miss lavinia resumed again referring to my letter through her eyeglass
they both had little bright round twinkling eyes by the way which were like birds eyes
they were not unlike birds altogether having a sharp brisk sudden manner and a little short spruce way of adjusting themselves like canaries
miss lavinia as i have said resumed you ask permission of my sister clarissa and myself mr copperfield to visit here as the accepted suitor of our niece if our brother francis said miss clarissa breaking out again if i may call anything so calm a breaking out wished to surround himself with an atmosphere of doctors commons and of doctors commons only what right or desire had we to object
none i am sure
we have ever been far from wishing to obtrude ourselves on anyone
but why not say so
let our brother francis and his wife have their society
let my sister lavinia and myself have our society
we can find it for ourselves i hope as this appeared to be addressed to traddles and me both traddles and i made some sort of reply
traddles was inaudible
i think i observed myself that it was highly creditable to all concerned
i dont in the least know what i meant
sister lavinia said miss clarissa having now relieved her mind you can go on my dear miss lavinia proceeded mr
copperfield my sister clarissa and i have been very careful indeed in considering this letter and we have not considered it without finally showing it to our niece and discussing it with our niece
we have no doubt that you think you like her very much think maam i rapturously began oh but miss clarissa giving me a look just like a sharp canary as requesting that i would not interrupt the oracle i begged pardon
affection said miss lavinia glancing at her sister for corroboration which she gave in the form of a little nod to every clause mature affection homage devotion does not easily express itself
its voice is low
it is modest and retiring it lies in ambush waits and waits
such is the mature fruit
sometimes a life glides away and finds it still ripening in the shade of course i did not understand then that this was an allusion to her supposed experience of the stricken pidger but i saw from the gravity with which miss clarissa nodded her head that great weight was attached to these words
the lightfor i call them in comparison with such sentiments the lightinclinations of very young people pursued miss lavinia are dust compared to rocks
it is owing to the difficulty of knowing whether they are likely to endure or have any real foundation that my sister clarissa and myself have been very undecided how to act mr copperfield and mr traddles said my friend finding himself looked at
i beg pardon
of the inner temple i believe said miss clarissa again glancing at my letter
traddles said exactly so and became pretty red in the face
now although i had not received any express encouragement as yet i fancied that i saw in the two little sisters and particularly in miss lavinia an intensified enjoyment of this new and fruitful subject of domestic interest a settling down to make the most of it a disposition to pet it in which there was a good bright ray of hope
i thought i perceived that miss lavinia would have uncommon satisfaction in superintending two young lovers like dora and me and that miss clarissa would have hardly less satisfaction in seeing her superintend us and in chiming in with her own particular department of the subject whenever that impulse was strong upon her
this gave me courage to protest most vehemently that i loved dora better than i could tell or anyone believe that all my friends knew how i loved her that my aunt agnes traddles everyone who knew me knew how i loved her and how earnest my love had made me
for the truth of this i appealed to traddles
and traddles firing up as if he were plunging into a parliamentary debate really did come out nobly confirming me in good round terms and in a plain sensible practical manner that evidently made a favourable impression
i speak if i may presume to say so as one who has some little experience of such things said traddles being myself engaged to a young ladyone of ten down in devonshireand seeing no probability at present of our engagement coming to a termination you may be able to confirm what i have said mr traddles observed miss lavinia evidently taking a new interest in him of the affection that is modest and retiring that waits and waits entirely maam said traddles
miss clarissa looked at miss lavinia and shook her head gravely
miss lavinia looked consciously at miss clarissa and heaved a little sigh
sister lavinia said miss clarissa take my smellingbottle miss lavinia revived herself with a few whiffs of aromatic vinegartraddles and i looking on with great solicitude the while and then went on to say rather faintly my sister and myself have been in great doubt mr traddles what course we ought to take in reference to the likings or imaginary likings of such very young people as your friend mr copperfield and our niece our brother franciss child remarked miss clarissa
if our brother franciss wife had found it convenient in her lifetime though she had an unquestionable right to act as she thought best to invite the family to her dinnertable we might have known our brother franciss child better at the present moment
sister lavinia proceed miss lavinia turned my letter so as to bring the superscription towards herself and referred through her eyeglass to some orderlylooking notes she had made on that part of it
it seems to us said she prudent mr traddles to bring these feelings to the test of our own observation
at present we know nothing of them and are not in a situation to judge how much reality there may be in them
therefore we are inclined so far to accede to mr copperfields proposal as to admit his visits here i shall never dear ladies i exclaimed relieved of an immense load of apprehension forget your kindness but pursued miss laviniabut we would prefer to regard those visits mr traddles as made at present to us
we must guard ourselves from recognizing any positive engagement between mr copperfield and our niece until we have had an opportunity until you have had an opportunity sister lavinia said miss clarissa
be it so assented miss lavinia with a sighuntil i have had an opportunity of observing them copperfield said traddles turning to me you feel i am sure that nothing could be more reasonable or considerate nothing cried i
i am deeply sensible of it in this position of affairs said miss lavinia again referring to her notes and admitting his visits on this understanding only we must require from mr copperfield a distinct assurance on his word of honour that no communication of any kind shall take place between him and our niece without our knowledge
that no project whatever shall be entertained with regard to our niece without being first submitted to us to you sister lavinia miss clarissa interposed
be it so clarissa assented miss lavinia resignedlyto meand receiving our concurrence
we must make this a most express and serious stipulation not to be broken on any account
we wished mr copperfield to be accompanied by some confidential friend today with an inclination of her head towards traddles who bowed in order that there might be no doubt or misconception on this subject
if mr copperfield or if you mr traddles feel the least scruple in giving this promise i beg you to take time to consider it i exclaimed in a state of high ecstatic fervour that not a moments consideration could be necessary
i bound myself by the required promise in a most impassioned manner called upon traddles to witness it and denounced myself as the most atrocious of characters if i ever swerved from it in the least degree
stay said miss lavinia holding up her hand we resolved before we had the pleasure of receiving you two gentlemen to leave you alone for a quarter of an hour to consider this point
you will allow us to retire it was in vain for me to say that no consideration was necessary
they persisted in withdrawing for the specified time
accordingly these little birds hopped out with great dignity leaving me to receive the congratulations of traddles and to feel as if i were translated to regions of exquisite happiness
exactly at the expiration of the quarter of an hour they reappeared with no less dignity than they had disappeared
they had gone rustling away as if their little dresses were made of autumnleaves and they came rustling back in like manner
i then bound myself once more to the prescribed conditions
sister clarissa said miss lavinia the rest is with you miss clarissa unfolding her arms for the first time took the notes and glanced at them
we shall be happy said miss clarissa to see mr copperfield to dinner every sunday if it should suit his convenience
our hour is three i bowed
in the course of the week said miss clarissa we shall be happy to see mr copperfield to tea
our hour is halfpast six i bowed again
twice in the week said miss clarissa but as a rule not oftener i bowed again
miss trotwood said miss clarissa mentioned in mr copperfields letter will perhaps call upon us
when visiting is better for the happiness of all parties we are glad to receive visits and return them
when it is better for the happiness of all parties that no visiting should take place as in the case of our brother francis and his establishment that is quite different i intimated that my aunt would be proud and delighted to make their acquaintance though i must say i was not quite sure of their getting on very satisfactorily together
the conditions being now closed i expressed my acknowledgements in the warmest manner and taking the hand first of miss clarissa and then of miss lavinia pressed it in each case to my lips
miss lavinia then arose and begging mr traddles to excuse us for a minute requested me to follow her
i obeyed all in a tremble and was conducted into another room
there i found my blessed darling stopping her ears behind the door with her dear little face against the wall and jip in the platewarmer with his head tied up in a towel
oh
how beautiful she was in her black frock and how she sobbed and cried at first and wouldnt come out from behind the door
how fond we were of one another when she did come out at last and what a state of bliss i was in when we took jip out of the platewarmer and restored him to the light sneezing very much and were all three reunited
my dearest dora
now indeed my own for ever oh dont pleaded dora
please are you not my own for ever dora oh yes of course i am cried dora but i am so frightened frightened my own oh yes
i dont like him said dora
why dont he go who my life your friend said dora
it isnt any business of his
what a stupid he must be my love there never was anything so coaxing as her childish ways
he is the best creature oh but we dont want any best creatures pouted dora
my dear i argued you will soon know him well and like him of all things
and here is my aunt coming soon and youll like her of all things too when you know her no please dont bring her said dora giving me a horrified little kiss and folding her hands
dont
i know shes a naughty mischiefmaking old thing
dont let her come here doady which was a corruption of david
remonstrance was of no use then so i laughed and admired and was very much in love and very happy and she showed me jips new trick of standing on his hind legs in a cornerwhich he did for about the space of a flash of lightning and then fell downand i dont know how long i should have stayed there oblivious of traddles if miss lavinia had not come in to take me away
miss lavinia was very fond of dora she told me dora was exactly like what she had been herself at her ageshe must have altered a good deal and she treated dora just as if she had been a toy
i wanted to persuade dora to come and see traddles but on my proposing it she ran off to her own room and locked herself in so i went to traddles without her and walked away with him on air
nothing could be more satisfactory said traddles and they are very agreeable old ladies i am sure
i shouldnt be at all surprised if you were to be married years before me copperfield does your sophy play on any instrument traddles i inquired in the pride of my heart
she knows enough of the piano to teach it to her little sisters said traddles
does she sing at all i asked
why she sings ballads sometimes to freshen up the others a little when theyre out of spirits said traddles
nothing scientific she doesnt sing to the guitar said i
oh dear no said traddles
paint at all not at all said traddles
i promised traddles that he should hear dora sing and see some of her flowerpainting
he said he should like it very much and we went home arm in arm in great good humour and delight
i encouraged him to talk about sophy on the way which he did with a loving reliance on her that i very much admired
i compared her in my mind with dora with considerable inward satisfaction but i candidly admitted to myself that she seemed to be an excellent kind of girl for traddles too
of course my aunt was immediately made acquainted with the successful issue of the conference and with all that had been said and done in the course of it
she was happy to see me so happy and promised to call on doras aunts without loss of time
but she took such a long walk up and down our rooms that night while i was writing to agnes that i began to think she meant to walk till morning
my letter to agnes was a fervent and grateful one narrating all the good effects that had resulted from my following her advice
she wrote by return of post to me
her letter was hopeful earnest and cheerful
she was always cheerful from that time
i had my hands more full than ever now
my daily journeys to highgate considered putney was a long way off and i naturally wanted to go there as often as i could
the proposed teadrinkings being quite impracticable i compounded with miss lavinia for permission to visit every saturday afternoon without detriment to my privileged sundays
so the close of every week was a delicious time for me and i got through the rest of the week by looking forward to it
i was wonderfully relieved to find that my aunt and doras aunts rubbed on all things considered much more smoothly than i could have expected
my aunt made her promised visit within a few days of the conference and within a few more days doras aunts called upon her in due state and form
similar but more friendly exchanges took place afterwards usually at intervals of three or four weeks
i know that my aunt distressed doras aunts very much by utterly setting at naught the dignity of flyconveyance and walking out to putney at extraordinary times as shortly after breakfast or just before tea likewise by wearing her bonnet in any manner that happened to be comfortable to her head without at all deferring to the prejudices of civilization on that subject
but doras aunts soon agreed to regard my aunt as an eccentric and somewhat masculine lady with a strong understanding and although my aunt occasionally ruffled the feathers of doras aunts by expressing heretical opinions on various points of ceremony she loved me too well not to sacrifice some of her little peculiarities to the general harmony
the only member of our small society who positively refused to adapt himself to circumstances was jip
he never saw my aunt without immediately displaying every tooth in his head retiring under a chair and growling incessantly with now and then a doleful howl as if she really were too much for his feelings
all kinds of treatment were tried with him coaxing scolding slapping bringing him to buckingham street where he instantly dashed at the two cats to the terror of all beholders but he never could prevail upon himself to bear my aunts society
he would sometimes think he had got the better of his objection and be amiable for a few minutes and then would put up his snub nose and howl to that extent that there was nothing for it but to blind him and put him in the platewarmer
at length dora regularly muffled him in a towel and shut him up there whenever my aunt was reported at the door
one thing troubled me much after we had fallen into this quiet train
it was that dora seemed by one consent to be regarded like a pretty toy or plaything
my aunt with whom she gradually became familiar always called her little blossom and the pleasure of miss lavinias life was to wait upon her curl her hair make ornaments for her and treat her like a pet child
what miss lavinia did her sister did as a matter of course
it was very odd to me but they all seemed to treat dora in her degree much as dora treated jip in his
i made up my mind to speak to dora about this and one day when we were out walking for we were licensed by miss lavinia after a while to go out walking by ourselves i said to her that i wished she could get them to behave towards her differently
because you know my darling i remonstrated you are not a child there said dora
now youre going to be cross cross my love i am sure theyre very kind to me said dora and i am very happy well
but my dearest life said i you might be very happy and yet be treated rationally dora gave me a reproachful lookthe prettiest lookand then began to sob saying if i didnt like her why had i ever wanted so much to be engaged to her
and why didnt i go away now if i couldnt bear her
what could i do but kiss away her tears and tell her how i doted on her after that
i am sure i am very affectionate said dora you oughtnt to be cruel to me doady cruel my precious love
as if i wouldor couldbe cruel to you for the world then dont find fault with me said dora making a rosebud of her mouth and ill be good i was charmed by her presently asking me of her own accord to give her that cookerybook i had once spoken of and to show her how to keep accounts as i had once promised i would
i brought the volume with me on my next visit i got it prettily bound first to make it look less dry and more inviting and as we strolled about the common i showed her an old housekeepingbook of my aunts and gave her a set of tablets and a pretty little pencilcase and box of leads to practise housekeeping with
but the cookerybook made doras head ache and the figures made her cry
they wouldnt add up she said
so she rubbed them out and drew little nosegays and likenesses of me and jip all over the tablets
then i playfully tried verbal instruction in domestic matters as we walked about on a saturday afternoon
sometimes for example when we passed a butchers shop i would say now suppose my pet that we were married and you were going to buy a shoulder of mutton for dinner would you know how to buy it my pretty little doras face would fall and she would make her mouth into a bud again as if she would very much prefer to shut mine with a kiss
would you know how to buy it my darling i would repeat perhaps if i were very inflexible
dora would think a little and then reply perhaps with great triumph why the butcher would know how to sell it and what need i know
oh you silly boy so when i once asked dora with an eye to the cookerybook what she would do if we were married and i were to say i should like a nice irish stew she replied that she would tell the servant to make it and then clapped her little hands together across my arm and laughed in such a charming manner that she was more delightful than ever
consequently the principal use to which the cookerybook was devoted was being put down in the corner for jip to stand upon
but dora was so pleased when she had trained him to stand upon it without offering to come off and at the same time to hold the pencilcase in his mouth that i was very glad i had bought it
and we fell back on the guitarcase and the flowerpainting and the songs about never leaving off dancing ta ra la
and were as happy as the week was long
i occasionally wished i could venture to hint to miss lavinia that she treated the darling of my heart a little too much like a plaything and i sometimes awoke as it were wondering to find that i had fallen into the general fault and treated her like a plaything toobut not often
i feel as if it were not for me to record even though this manuscript is intended for no eyes but mine how hard i worked at that tremendous shorthand and all improvement appertaining to it in my sense of responsibility to dora and her aunts
i will only add to what i have already written of my perseverance at this time of my life and of a patient and continuous energy which then began to be matured within me and which i know to be the strong part of my character if it have any strength at all that there on looking back i find the source of my success
i have been very fortunate in worldly matters many men have worked much harder and not succeeded half so well but i never could have done what i have done without the habits of punctuality order and diligence without the determination to concentrate myself on one object at a time no matter how quickly its successor should come upon its heels which i then formed
heaven knows i write this in no spirit of selflaudation
the man who reviews his own life as i do mine in going on here from page to page had need to have been a good man indeed if he would be spared the sharp consciousness of many talents neglected many opportunities wasted many erratic and perverted feelings constantly at war within his breast and defeating him
i do not hold one natural gift i dare say that i have not abused
my meaning simply is that whatever i have tried to do in life i have tried with all my heart to do well that whatever i have devoted myself to i have devoted myself to completely that in great aims and in small i have always been thoroughly in earnest
i have never believed it possible that any natural or improved ability can claim immunity from the companionship of the steady plain hardworking qualities and hope to gain its end
there is no such thing as such fulfilment on this earth
some happy talent and some fortunate opportunity may form the two sides of the ladder on which some men mount but the rounds of that ladder must be made of stuff to stand wear and tear and there is no substitute for thoroughgoing ardent and sincere earnestness
never to put one hand to anything on which i could throw my whole self and never to affect depreciation of my work whatever it was i find now to have been my golden rules
how much of the practice i have just reduced to precept i owe to agnes i will not repeat here
my narrative proceeds to agnes with a thankful love
she came on a visit of a fortnight to the doctors
mr wickfield was the doctors old friend and the doctor wished to talk with him and do him good
it had been matter of conversation with agnes when she was last in town and this visit was the result
she and her father came together
i was not much surprised to hear from her that she had engaged to find a lodging in the neighbourhood for mrs heep whose rheumatic complaint required change of air and who would be charmed to have it in such company
neither was i surprised when on the very next day uriah like a dutiful son brought his worthy mother to take possession
you see master copperfield said he as he forced himself upon my company for a turn in the doctors garden where a person loves a person is a little jealousleastways anxious to keep an eye on the beloved one of whom are you jealous now said i
thanks to you master copperfield he returned of no one in particular just at presentno male person at least do you mean that you are jealous of a female person he gave me a sidelong glance out of his sinister red eyes and laughed
really master copperfield he said i should say mister but i know youll excuse the abit ive got intoyoure so insinuating that you draw me like a corkscrew
well i dont mind telling you putting his fishlike hand on mine im not a ladys man in general sir and i never was with mrs strong his eyes looked green now as they watched mine with a rascally cunning
what do you mean said i
why though i am a lawyer master copperfield he replied with a dry grin i mean just at present what i say and what do you mean by your look i retorted quietly
by my look
dear me copperfield thats sharp practice
what do i mean by my look yes said i
by your look he seemed very much amused and laughed as heartily as it was in his nature to laugh
after some scraping of his chin with his hand he went on to say with his eyes cast downwardstill scraping very slowly when i was but an umble clerk she always looked down upon me
she was for ever having my agnes backwards and forwards at her ouse and she was for ever being a friend to you master copperfield but i was too far beneath her myself to be noticed well said i suppose you were and beneath him too pursued uriah very distinctly and in a meditative tone of voice as he continued to scrape his chin
dont you know the doctor better said i than to suppose him conscious of your existence when you were not before him he directed his eyes at me in that sidelong glance again and he made his face very lanternjawed for the greater convenience of scraping as he answered oh dear i am not referring to the doctor
oh no poor man
i mean mr maldon my heart quite died within me
all my old doubts and apprehensions on that subject all the doctors happiness and peace all the mingled possibilities of innocence and compromise that i could not unravel i saw in a moment at the mercy of this fellows twisting
he never could come into the office without ordering and shoving me about said uriah
one of your fine gentlemen he was
i was very meek and umbleand i am
but i didnt like that sort of thingand i dont he left off scraping his chin and sucked in his cheeks until they seemed to meet inside keeping his sidelong glance upon me all the while
she is one of your lovely women she is he pursued when he had slowly restored his face to its natural form and ready to be no friend to such as me i know
shes just the person as would put my agnes up to higher sort of game
now i aint one of your ladys men master copperfield but ive had eyes in my ed a pretty long time back
we umble ones have got eyes mostly speakingand we look out of em i endeavoured to appear unconscious and not disquieted but i saw in his face with poor success
now im not agoing to let myself be run down copperfield he continued raising that part of his countenance where his red eyebrows would have been if he had had any with malignant triumph and i shall do what i can to put a stop to this friendship
i dont approve of it
i dont mind acknowledging to you that ive got rather a grudging disposition and want to keep off all intruders
i aint agoing if i know it to run the risk of being plotted against you are always plotting and delude yourself into the belief that everybody else is doing the like i think said i
perhaps so master copperfield he replied
but ive got a motive as my fellowpartner used to say and i go at it tooth and nail
i mustnt be put upon as a numble person too much
i cant allow people in my way
really they must come out of the cart master copperfield i dont understand you said i
dont you though he returned with one of his jerks
im astonished at that master copperfield you being usually so quick
ill try to be plainer another timeis that mr maldon anorseback ringing at the gate sir it looks like him i replied as carelessly as i could
uriah stopped short put his hands between his great knobs of knees and doubled himself up with laughter
with perfectly silent laughter
not a sound escaped from him
i was so repelled by his odious behaviour particularly by this concluding instance that i turned away without any ceremony and left him doubled up in the middle of the garden like a scarecrow in want of support
it was not on that evening but as i well remember on the next evening but one which was a sunday that i took agnes to see dora
i had arranged the visit beforehand with miss lavinia and agnes was expected to tea
i was in a flutter of pride and anxiety pride in my dear little betrothed and anxiety that agnes should like her
all the way to putney agnes being inside the stagecoach and i outside i pictured dora to myself in every one of the pretty looks i knew so well now making up my mind that i should like her to look exactly as she looked at such a time and then doubting whether i should not prefer her looking as she looked at such another time and almost worrying myself into a fever about it
i was troubled by no doubt of her being very pretty in any case but it fell out that i had never seen her look so well
she was not in the drawingroom when i presented agnes to her little aunts but was shyly keeping out of the way
i knew where to look for her now and sure enough i found her stopping her ears again behind the same dull old door
at first she wouldnt come at all and then she pleaded for five minutes by my watch
when at length she put her arm through mine to be taken to the drawingroom her charming little face was flushed and had never been so pretty
but when we went into the room and it turned pale she was ten thousand times prettier yet
dora was afraid of agnes
she had told me that she knew agnes was too clever
but when she saw her looking at once so cheerful and so earnest and so thoughtful and so good she gave a faint little cry of pleased surprise and just put her affectionate arms round agness neck and laid her innocent cheek against her face
i never was so happy
i never was so pleased as when i saw those two sit down together side by side
as when i saw my little darling looking up so naturally to those cordial eyes
as when i saw the tender beautiful regard which agnes cast upon her
miss lavinia and miss clarissa partook in their way of my joy
it was the pleasantest teatable in the world
miss clarissa presided
i cut and handed the sweet seedcakethe little sisters had a birdlike fondness for picking up seeds and pecking at sugar miss lavinia looked on with benignant patronage as if our happy love were all her work and we were perfectly contented with ourselves and one another
the gentle cheerfulness of agnes went to all their hearts
her quiet interest in everything that interested dora her manner of making acquaintance with jip who responded instantly her pleasant way when dora was ashamed to come over to her usual seat by me her modest grace and ease eliciting a crowd of blushing little marks of confidence from dora seemed to make our circle quite complete
i am so glad said dora after tea that you like me
i didnt think you would and i want more than ever to be liked now julia mills is gone i have omitted to mention it by the by
miss mills had sailed and dora and i had gone aboard a great east indiaman at gravesend to see her and we had had preserved ginger and guava and other delicacies of that sort for lunch and we had left miss mills weeping on a campstool on the quarterdeck with a large new diary under her arm in which the original reflections awakened by the contemplation of ocean were to be recorded under lock and key
agnes said she was afraid i must have given her an unpromising character but dora corrected that directly
oh no she said shaking her curls at me it was all praise
he thinks so much of your opinion that i was quite afraid of it my good opinion cannot strengthen his attachment to some people whom he knows said agnes with a smile it is not worth their having but please let me have it said dora in her coaxing way if you can we made merry about doras wanting to be liked and dora said i was a goose and she didnt like me at any rate and the short evening flew away on gossamerwings
the time was at hand when the coach was to call for us
i was standing alone before the fire when dora came stealing softly in to give me that usual precious little kiss before i went
dont you think if i had had her for a friend a long time ago doady said dora her bright eyes shining very brightly and her little right hand idly busying itself with one of the buttons of my coat i might have been more clever perhaps my love said i what nonsense do you think it is nonsense returned dora without looking at me
are you sure it is of course i am i have forgotten said dora still turning the button round and round what relation agnes is to you you dear bad boy no bloodrelation i replied but we were brought up together like brother and sister i wonder why you ever fell in love with me said dora beginning on another button of my coat
perhaps because i couldnt see you and not love you dora suppose you had never seen me at all said dora going to another button
suppose we had never been born said i gaily
i wondered what she was thinking about as i glanced in admiring silence at the little soft hand travelling up the row of buttons on my coat and at the clustering hair that lay against my breast and at the lashes of her downcast eyes slightly rising as they followed her idle fingers
at length her eyes were lifted up to mine and she stood on tiptoe to give me more thoughtfully than usual that precious little kissonce twice three timesand went out of the room
they all came back together within five minutes afterwards and doras unusual thoughtfulness was quite gone then
she was laughingly resolved to put jip through the whole of his performances before the coach came
they took some time not so much on account of their variety as jips reluctance and were still unfinished when it was heard at the door
there was a hurried but affectionate parting between agnes and herself and dora was to write to agnes who was not to mind her letters being foolish she said and agnes was to write to dora and they had a second parting at the coach door and a third when dora in spite of the remonstrances of miss lavinia would come running out once more to remind agnes at the coach window about writing and to shake her curls at me on the box
the stagecoach was to put us down near covent garden where we were to take another stagecoach for highgate
i was impatient for the short walk in the interval that agnes might praise dora to me
ah
what praise it was
how lovingly and fervently did it commend the pretty creature i had won with all her artless graces best displayed to my most gentle care
how thoughtfully remind me yet with no pretence of doing so of the trust in which i held the orphan child
never never had i loved dora so deeply and truly as i loved her that night
when we had again alighted and were walking in the starlight along the quiet road that led to the doctors house i told agnes it was her doing
when you were sitting by her said i you seemed to be no less her guardian angel than mine and you seem so now agnes a poor angel she returned but faithful the clear tone of her voice going straight to my heart made it natural to me to say the cheerfulness that belongs to you agnes and to no one else that ever i have seen is so restored i have observed today that i have begun to hope you are happier at home i am happier in myself she said i am quite cheerful and lighthearted i glanced at the serene face looking upward and thought it was the stars that made it seem so noble
there has been no change at home said agnes after a few moments
no fresh reference said i toi wouldnt distress you agnes but i cannot help askingto what we spoke of when we parted last no none she answered
i have thought so much about it you must think less about it
remember that i confide in simple love and truth at last
have no apprehensions for me trotwood she added after a moment the step you dread my taking i shall never take although i think i had never really feared it in any season of cool reflection it was an unspeakable relief to me to have this assurance from her own truthful lips
i told her so earnestly
and when this visit is over said ifor we may not be alone another timehow long is it likely to be my dear agnes before you come to london again probably a long time she replied i think it will be bestfor papas saketo remain at home
we are not likely to meet often for some time to come but i shall be a good correspondent of doras and we shall frequently hear of one another that way we were now within the little courtyard of the doctors cottage
it was growing late
there was a light in the window of mrs strongs chamber and agnes pointing to it bade me good night
do not be troubled she said giving me her hand by our misfortunes and anxieties
i can be happier in nothing than in your happiness
if you can ever give me help rely upon it i will ask you for it
god bless you always in her beaming smile and in these last tones of her cheerful voice i seemed again to see and hear my little dora in her company
i stood awhile looking through the porch at the stars with a heart full of love and gratitude and then walked slowly forth
i had engaged a bed at a decent alehouse close by and was going out at the gate when happening to turn my head i saw a light in the doctors study
a halfreproachful fancy came into my mind that he had been working at the dictionary without my help
with the view of seeing if this were so and in any case of bidding him good night if he were yet sitting among his books i turned back and going softly across the hall and gently opening the door looked in
the first person whom i saw to my surprise by the sober light of the shaded lamp was uriah
he was standing close beside it with one of his skeleton hands over his mouth and the other resting on the doctors table
the doctor sat in his study chair covering his face with his hands
mr wickfield sorely troubled and distressed was leaning forward irresolutely touching the doctors arm
for an instant i supposed that the doctor was ill
i hastily advanced a step under that impression when i met uriahs eye and saw what was the matter
i would have withdrawn but the doctor made a gesture to detain me and i remained
at any rate observed uriah with a writhe of his ungainly person we may keep the door shut
we neednt make it known to all the town saying which he went on his toes to the door which i had left open and carefully closed it
he then came back and took up his former position
there was an obtrusive show of compassionate zeal in his voice and manner more intolerableat least to methan any demeanour he could have assumed
i have felt it incumbent upon me master copperfield said uriah to point out to doctor strong what you and me have already talked about
you didnt exactly understand me though i gave him a look but no other answer and going to my good old master said a few words that i meant to be words of comfort and encouragement
he put his hand upon my shoulder as it had been his custom to do when i was quite a little fellow but did not lift his grey head
as you didnt understand me master copperfield resumed uriah in the same officious manner i may take the liberty of umbly mentioning being among friends that i have called doctor strongs attention to the goingson of mrs strong
its much against the grain with me i assure you copperfield to be concerned in anything so unpleasant but really as it is were all mixing ourselves up with what oughtnt to be
that was what my meaning was sir when you didnt understand me i wonder now when i recall his leer that i did not collar him and try to shake the breath out of his body
i dare say i didnt make myself very clear he went on nor you neither
naturally we was both of us inclined to give such a subject a wide berth
howsever at last i have made up my mind to speak plain and i have mentioned to doctor strong thatdid you speak sir this was to the doctor who had moaned
the sound might have touched any heart i thought but it had no effect upon uriahs
mentioned to doctor strong he proceeded that anyone may see that mr maldon and the lovely and agreeable lady as is doctor strongs wife are too sweet on one another
really the time is come we being at present all mixing ourselves up with what oughtnt to be when doctor strong must be told that this was full as plain to everybody as the sun before mr maldon went to india that mr maldon made excuses to come back for nothing else and that hes always here for nothing else
when you come in sir i was just putting it to my fellowpartner towards whom he turned to say to doctor strong upon his word and honour whether hed ever been of this opinion long ago or not
come mr wickfield sir
would you be so good as tell us
yes or no sir
come partner for gods sake my dear doctor said mr wickfield again laying his irresolute hand upon the doctors arm dont attach too much weight to any suspicions i may have entertained there cried uriah shaking his head
what a melancholy confirmation aint it
him
such an old friend
bless your soul when i was nothing but a clerk in his office copperfield ive seen him twenty times if ive seen him once quite in a taking about itquite put out you know and very proper in him as a father im sure i cant blame him to think that miss agnes was mixing herself up with what oughtnt to be my dear strong said mr wickfield in a tremulous voice my good friend i neednt tell you that it has been my vice to look for some one master motive in everybody and to try all actions by one narrow test
i may have fallen into such doubts as i have had through this mistake you have had doubts wickfield said the doctor without lifting up his head
you have had doubts speak up fellowpartner urged uriah
i had at one time certainly said mr wickfield
igod forgive mei thought you had no no no returned the doctor in a tone of most pathetic grief
i thought at one time said mr wickfield that you wished to send maldon abroad to effect a desirable separation no no no returned the doctor
to give annie pleasure by making some provision for the companion of her childhood
nothing else so i found said mr wickfield
i couldnt doubt it when you told me so
but i thoughti implore you to remember the narrow construction which has been my besetting sinthat in a case where there was so much disparity in point of years thats the way to put it you see master copperfield observed uriah with fawning and offensive pity
a lady of such youth and such attractions however real her respect for you might have been influenced in marrying by worldly considerations only
i make no allowance for innumerable feelings and circumstances that may have all tended to good
for heavens sake remember that how kind he puts it said uriah shaking his head
always observing her from one point of view said mr wickfield but by all that is dear to you my old friend i entreat you to consider what it was i am forced to confess now having no escape no
theres no way out of it mr wickfield sir observed uriah when its got to this that i did said mr wickfield glancing helplessly and distractedly at his partner that i did doubt her and think her wanting in her duty to you and that i did sometimes if i must say all feel averse to agnes being in such a familiar relation towards her as to see what i saw or in my diseased theory fancied that i saw
i never mentioned this to anyone
i never meant it to be known to anyone
and though it is terrible to you to hear said mr wickfield quite subdued if you knew how terrible it is for me to tell you would feel compassion for me the doctor in the perfect goodness of his nature put out his hand
mr wickfield held it for a little while in his with his head bowed down
i am sure said uriah writhing himself into the silence like a congereel that this is a subject full of unpleasantness to everybody
but since we have got so far i ought to take the liberty of mentioning that copperfield has noticed it too i turned upon him and asked him how he dared refer to me
oh
its very kind of you copperfield returned uriah undulating all over and we all know what an amiable character yours is but you know that the moment i spoke to you the other night you knew what i meant
you know you knew what i meant copperfield
dont deny it
you deny it with the best intentions but dont do it copperfield i saw the mild eye of the good old doctor turned upon me for a moment and i felt that the confession of my old misgivings and remembrances was too plainly written in my face to be overlooked
it was of no use raging
i could not undo that
say what i would i could not unsay it
we were silent again and remained so until the doctor rose and walked twice or thrice across the room
presently he returned to where his chair stood and leaning on the back of it and occasionally putting his handkerchief to his eyes with a simple honesty that did him more honour to my thinking than any disguise he could have effected said i have been much to blame
i believe i have been very much to blame
i have exposed one whom i hold in my heart to trials and aspersionsi call them aspersions even to have been conceived in anybodys inmost mindof which she never but for me could have been the object uriah heep gave a kind of snivel
i think to express sympathy
of which my annie said the doctor never but for me could have been the object
gentlemen i am old now as you know i do not feel tonight that i have much to live for
but my lifemy lifeupon the truth and honour of the dear lady who has been the subject of this conversation i do not think that the best embodiment of chivalry the realization of the handsomest and most romantic figure ever imagined by painter could have said this with a more impressive and affecting dignity than the plain old doctor did
but i am not prepared he went on to denyperhaps i may have been without knowing it in some degree prepared to admitthat i may have unwittingly ensnared that lady into an unhappy marriage
i am a man quite unaccustomed to observe and i cannot but believe that the observation of several people of different ages and positions all too plainly tending in one direction and that so natural is better than mine i had often admired as i have elsewhere described his benignant manner towards his youthful wife but the respectful tenderness he manifested in every reference to her on this occasion and the almost reverential manner in which he put away from him the lightest doubt of her integrity exalted him in my eyes beyond description
i married that lady said the doctor when she was extremely young
i took her to myself when her character was scarcely formed
so far as it was developed it had been my happiness to form it
i knew her father well
i knew her well
i had taught her what i could for the love of all her beautiful and virtuous qualities
if i did her wrong as i fear i did in taking advantage but i never meant it of her gratitude and her affection i ask pardon of that lady in my heart he walked across the room and came back to the same place holding the chair with a grasp that trembled like his subdued voice in its earnestness
i regarded myself as a refuge for her from the dangers and vicissitudes of life
i persuaded myself that unequal though we were in years she would live tranquilly and contentedly with me
i did not shut out of my consideration the time when i should leave her free and still young and still beautiful but with her judgement more maturedno gentlemenupon my truth his homely figure seemed to be lightened up by his fidelity and generosity
every word he uttered had a force that no other grace could have imparted to it
my life with this lady has been very happy
until tonight i have had uninterrupted occasion to bless the day on which i did her great injustice his voice more and more faltering in the utterance of these words stopped for a few moments then he went on once awakened from my dreami have been a poor dreamer in one way or other all my lifei see how natural it is that she should have some regretful feeling towards her old companion and her equal
that she does regard him with some innocent regret with some blameless thoughts of what might have been but for me is i fear too true
much that i have seen but not noted has come back upon me with new meaning during this last trying hour
but beyond this gentlemen the dear ladys name never must be coupled with a word a breath of doubt for a little while his eye kindled and his voice was firm for a little while he was again silent
presently he proceeded as before it only remains for me to bear the knowledge of the unhappiness i have occasioned as submissively as i can
it is she who should reproach not i
to save her from misconstruction cruel misconstruction that even my friends have not been able to avoid becomes my duty
the more retired we live the better i shall discharge it
and when the time comesmay it come soon if it be his merciful pleasurewhen my death shall release her from constraint i shall close my eyes upon her honoured face with unbounded confidence and love and leave her with no sorrow then to happier and brighter days i could not see him for the tears which his earnestness and goodness so adorned by and so adorning the perfect simplicity of his manner brought into my eyes
he had moved to the door when he added gentlemen i have shown you my heart
i am sure you will respect it
what we have said tonight is never to be said more
wickfield give me an old friends arm upstairs mr wickfield hastened to him
without interchanging a word they went slowly out of the room together uriah looking after them
well master copperfield said uriah meekly turning to me
the thing hasnt took quite the turn that might have been expected for the old scholarwhat an excellent manis as blind as a brickbat but this familys out of the cart i think i needed but the sound of his voice to be so madly enraged as i never was before and never have been since
you villain said i what do you mean by entrapping me into your schemes
how dare you appeal to me just now you false rascal as if we had been in discussion together as we stood front to front i saw so plainly in the stealthy exultation of his face what i already so plainly knew i mean that he forced his confidence upon me expressly to make me miserable and had set a deliberate trap for me in this very matter that i couldnt bear it
the whole of his lank cheek was invitingly before me and i struck it with my open hand with that force that my fingers tingled as if i had burnt them
he caught the hand in his and we stood in that connexion looking at each other
we stood so a long time long enough for me to see the white marks of my fingers die out of the deep red of his cheek and leave it a deeper red
copperfield he said at length in a breathless voice have you taken leave of your senses i have taken leave of you said i wresting my hand away
you dog ill know no more of you wont you said he constrained by the pain of his cheek to put his hand there
perhaps you wont be able to help it
isnt this ungrateful of you now i have shown you often enough said i that i despise you
i have shown you now more plainly that i do
why should i dread your doing your worst to all about you
what else do you ever do he perfectly understood this allusion to the considerations that had hitherto restrained me in my communications with him
i rather think that neither the blow nor the allusion would have escaped me but for the assurance i had had from agnes that night
it is no matter
there was another long pause
his eyes as he looked at me seemed to take every shade of colour that could make eyes ugly
copperfield he said removing his hand from his cheek you have always gone against me
i know you always used to be against me at mr wickfields you may think what you like said i still in a towering rage
if it is not true so much the worthier you and yet i always liked you copperfield he rejoined
i deigned to make him no reply and taking up my hat was going out to bed when he came between me and the door
copperfield he said there must be two parties to a quarrel
i wont be one you may go to the devil said i
dont say that he replied
i know youll be sorry afterwards
how can you make yourself so inferior to me as to show such a bad spirit
but i forgive you you forgive me i repeated disdainfully
i do and you cant help yourself replied uriah
to think of your going and attacking me that have always been a friend to you
but there cant be a quarrel without two parties and i wont be one
i will be a friend to you in spite of you
so now you know what youve got to expect the necessity of carrying on this dialogue his part in which was very slow mine very quick in a low tone that the house might not be disturbed at an unseasonable hour did not improve my temper though my passion was cooling down
merely telling him that i should expect from him what i always had expected and had never yet been disappointed in i opened the door upon him as if he had been a great walnut put there to be cracked and went out of the house
but he slept out of the house too at his mothers lodging and before i had gone many hundred yards came up with me
you know copperfield he said in my ear i did not turn my head youre in quite a wrong position which i felt to be true and that made me chafe the more you cant make this a brave thing and you cant help being forgiven
i dont intend to mention it to mother nor to any living soul
im determined to forgive you
but i do wonder that you should lift your hand against a person that you knew to be so umble i felt only less mean than he
he knew me better than i knew myself
if he had retorted or openly exasperated me it would have been a relief and a justification but he had put me on a slow fire on which i lay tormented half the night
in the morning when i came out the early churchbell was ringing and he was walking up and down with his mother
he addressed me as if nothing had happened and i could do no less than reply
i had struck him hard enough to give him the toothache i suppose
at all events his face was tied up in a black silk handkerchief which with his hat perched on the top of it was far from improving his appearance
i heard that he went to a dentists in london on the monday morning and had a tooth out
i hope it was a double one
the doctor gave out that he was not quite well and remained alone for a considerable part of every day during the remainder of the visit
agnes and her father had been gone a week before we resumed our usual work
on the day preceding its resumption the doctor gave me with his own hands a folded note not sealed
it was addressed to myself and laid an injunction on me in a few affectionate words never to refer to the subject of that evening
i had confided it to my aunt but to no one else
it was not a subject i could discuss with agnes and agnes certainly had not the least suspicion of what had passed
neither i felt convinced had mrs strong then
several weeks elapsed before i saw the least change in her
it came on slowly like a cloud when there is no wind
at first she seemed to wonder at the gentle compassion with which the doctor spoke to her and at his wish that she should have her mother with her to relieve the dull monotony of her life
often when we were at work and she was sitting by i would see her pausing and looking at him with that memorable face
afterwards i sometimes observed her rise with her eyes full of tears and go out of the room
gradually an unhappy shadow fell upon her beauty and deepened every day
mrs markleham was a regular inmate of the cottage then but she talked and talked and saw nothing
as this change stole on annie once like sunshine in the doctors house the doctor became older in appearance and more grave but the sweetness of his temper the placid kindness of his manner and his benevolent solicitude for her if they were capable of any increase were increased
i saw him once early on the morning of her birthday when she came to sit in the window while we were at work which she had always done but now began to do with a timid and uncertain air that i thought very touching take her forehead between his hands kiss it and go hurriedly away too much moved to remain
i saw her stand where he had left her like a statue and then bend down her head and clasp her hands and weep i cannot say how sorrowfully
sometimes after that i fancied that she tried to speak even to me in intervals when we were left alone
but she never uttered a word
the doctor always had some new project for her participating in amusements away from home with her mother and mrs markleham who was very fond of amusements and very easily dissatisfied with anything else entered into them with great goodwill and was loud in her commendations
but annie in a spiritless unhappy way only went whither she was led and seemed to have no care for anything
i did not know what to think
neither did my aunt who must have walked at various times a hundred miles in her uncertainty
what was strangest of all was that the only real relief which seemed to make its way into the secret region of this domestic unhappiness made its way there in the person of mr dick
what his thoughts were on the subject or what his observation was i am as unable to explain as i dare say he would have been to assist me in the task
but as i have recorded in the narrative of my school days his veneration for the doctor was unbounded and there is a subtlety of perception in real attachment even when it is borne towards man by one of the lower animals which leaves the highest intellect behind
to this mind of the heart if i may call it so in mr dick some bright ray of the truth shot straight
he had proudly resumed his privilege in many of his spare hours of walking up and down the garden with the doctor as he had been accustomed to pace up and down the doctors walk at canterbury
but matters were no sooner in this state than he devoted all his spare time and got up earlier to make it more to these perambulations
if he had never been so happy as when the doctor read that marvellous performance the dictionary to him he was now quite miserable unless the doctor pulled it out of his pocket and began
when the doctor and i were engaged he now fell into the custom of walking up and down with mrs strong and helping her to trim her favourite flowers or weed the beds
i dare say he rarely spoke a dozen words in an hour but his quiet interest and his wistful face found immediate response in both their breasts each knew that the other liked him and that he loved both and he became what no one else could bea link between them
when i think of him with his impenetrably wise face walking up and down with the doctor delighted to be battered by the hard words in the dictionary when i think of him carrying huge wateringpots after annie kneeling down in very paws of gloves at patient microscopic work among the little leaves expressing as no philosopher could have expressed in everything he did a delicate desire to be her friend showering sympathy trustfulness and affection out of every hole in the wateringpot when i think of him never wandering in that better mind of his to which unhappiness addressed itself never bringing the unfortunate king charles into the garden never wavering in his grateful service never diverted from his knowledge that there was something wrong or from his wish to set it righti really feel almost ashamed of having known that he was not quite in his wits taking account of the utmost i have done with mine
nobody but myself trot knows what that man is my aunt would proudly remark when we conversed about it
dick will distinguish himself yet i must refer to one other topic before i close this chapter
while the visit at the doctors was still in progress i observed that the postman brought two or three letters every morning for uriah heep who remained at highgate until the rest went back it being a leisure time and that these were always directed in a businesslike manner by mr micawber who now assumed a round legal hand
i was glad to infer from these slight premises that mr micawber was doing well and consequently was much surprised to receive about this time the following letter from his amiable wife
canterbury monday evening
you will doubtless be surprised my dear mr copperfield to receive this communication
still more so by its contents
still more so by the stipulation of implicit confidence which i beg to impose
but my feelings as a wife and mother require relief and as i do not wish to consult my family already obnoxious to the feelings of mr micawber i know no one of whom i can better ask advice than my friend and former lodger
you may be aware my dear mr copperfield that between myself and mr micawber whom i will never desert there has always been preserved a spirit of mutual confidence
mr micawber may have occasionally given a bill without consulting me or he may have misled me as to the period when that obligation would become due
this has actually happened
but in general mr micawber has had no secrets from the bosom of affectioni allude to his wifeand has invariably on our retirement to rest recalled the events of the day
you will picture to yourself my dear mr copperfield what the poignancy of my feelings must be when i inform you that mr micawber is entirely changed
he is reserved
he is secret
his life is a mystery to the partner of his joys and sorrowsi again allude to his wifeand if i should assure you that beyond knowing that it is passed from morning to night at the office i now know less of it than i do of the man in the south connected with whose mouth the thoughtless children repeat an idle tale respecting cold plum porridge i should adopt a popular fallacy to express an actual fact
but this is not all
mr micawber is morose
he is severe
he is estranged from our eldest son and daughter he has no pride in his twins he looks with an eye of coldness even on the unoffending stranger who last became a member of our circle
the pecuniary means of meeting our expenses kept down to the utmost farthing are obtained from him with great difficulty and even under fearful threats that he will settle himself the exact expression and he inexorably refuses to give any explanation whatever of this distracting policy
this is hard to bear
this is heartbreaking
if you will advise me knowing my feeble powers such as they are how you think it will be best to exert them in a dilemma so unwonted you will add another friendly obligation to the many you have already rendered me
with loves from the children and a smile from the happilyunconscious stranger i remain dear mr copperfield your afflicted emma micawber i did not feel justified in giving a wife of mrs micawbers experience any other recommendation than that she should try to reclaim mr micawber by patience and kindness as i knew she would in any case but the letter set me thinking about him very much
once again let me pause upon a memorable period of my life
let me stand aside to see the phantoms of those days go by me accompanying the shadow of myself in dim procession
weeks months seasons pass along
they seem little more than a summer day and a winter evening
now the common where i walk with dora is all in bloom a field of bright gold and now the unseen heather lies in mounds and bunches underneath a covering of snow
in a breath the river that flows through our sunday walks is sparkling in the summer sun is ruffled by the winter wind or thickened with drifting heaps of ice
faster than ever river ran towards the sea it flashes darkens and rolls away
not a thread changes in the house of the two little birdlike ladies
the clock ticks over the fireplace the weatherglass hangs in the hall
neither clock nor weatherglass is ever right but we believe in both devoutly
i have come legally to mans estate
i have attained the dignity of twentyone
but this is a sort of dignity that may be thrust upon one
let me think what i have achieved
i have tamed that savage stenographic mystery
i make a respectable income by it
i am in high repute for my accomplishment in all pertaining to the art and am joined with eleven others in reporting the debates in parliament for a morning newspaper
night after night i record predictions that never come to pass professions that are never fulfilled explanations that are only meant to mystify
i wallow in words
britannia that unfortunate female is always before me like a trussed fowl skewered through and through with officepens and bound hand and foot with red tape
i am sufficiently behind the scenes to know the worth of political life
i am quite an infidel about it and shall never be converted
my dear old traddles has tried his hand at the same pursuit but it is not in traddless way
he is perfectly goodhumoured respecting his failure and reminds me that he always did consider himself slow
he has occasional employment on the same newspaper in getting up the facts of dry subjects to be written about and embellished by more fertile minds
he is called to the bar and with admirable industry and selfdenial has scraped another hundred pounds together to fee a conveyancer whose chambers he attends
a great deal of very hot port wine was consumed at his call and considering the figure i should think the inner temple must have made a profit by it
i have come out in another way
i have taken with fear and trembling to authorship
i wrote a little something in secret and sent it to a magazine and it was published in the magazine
since then i have taken heart to write a good many trifling pieces
now i am regularly paid for them
altogether i am well off when i tell my income on the fingers of my left hand i pass the third finger and take in the fourth to the middle joint
we have removed from buckingham street to a pleasant little cottage very near the one i looked at when my enthusiasm first came on
my aunt however who has sold the house at dover to good advantage is not going to remain here but intends removing herself to a still more tiny cottage close at hand
what does this portend
my marriage
yes
yes
i am going to be married to dora
miss lavinia and miss clarissa have given their consent and if ever canary birds were in a flutter they are
miss lavinia selfcharged with the superintendence of my darlings wardrobe is constantly cutting out brownpaper cuirasses and differing in opinion from a highly respectable young man with a long bundle and a yard measure under his arm
a dressmaker always stabbed in the breast with a needle and thread boards and lodges in the house and seems to me eating drinking or sleeping never to take her thimble off
they make a layfigure of my dear
they are always sending for her to come and try something on
we cant be happy together for five minutes in the evening but some intrusive female knocks at the door and says oh if you please miss dora would you step upstairs miss clarissa and my aunt roam all over london to find out articles of furniture for dora and me to look at
it would be better for them to buy the goods at once without this ceremony of inspection for when we go to see a kitchen fender and meatscreen dora sees a chinese house for jip with little bells on the top and prefers that
and it takes a long time to accustom jip to his new residence after we have bought it whenever he goes in or out he makes all the little bells ring and is horribly frightened
peggotty comes up to make herself useful and falls to work immediately
her department appears to be to clean everything over and over again
she rubs everything that can be rubbed until it shines like her own honest forehead with perpetual friction
and now it is that i begin to see her solitary brother passing through the dark streets at night and looking as he goes among the wandering faces
i never speak to him at such an hour
i know too well as his grave figure passes onward what he seeks and what he dreads
why does traddles look so important when he calls upon me this afternoon in the commonswhere i still occasionally attend for forms sake when i have time
the realization of my boyish daydreams is at hand
i am going to take out the licence
it is a little document to do so much and traddles contemplates it as it lies upon my desk half in admiration half in awe
there are the names in the sweet old visionary connexion david copperfield and dora spenlow and there in the corner is that parental institution the stamp office which is so benignantly interested in the various transactions of human life looking down upon our union and there is the archbishop of canterbury invoking a blessing on us in print and doing it as cheap as could possibly be expected
nevertheless i am in a dream a flustered happy hurried dream
i cant believe that it is going to be and yet i cant believe but that everyone i pass in the street must have some kind of perception that i am to be married the day after tomorrow
the surrogate knows me when i go down to be sworn and disposes of me easily as if there were a masonic understanding between us
traddles is not at all wanted but is in attendance as my general backer
i hope the next time you come here my dear fellow i say to traddles it will be on the same errand for yourself
and i hope it will be soon thank you for your good wishes my dear copperfield he replies
i hope so too
its a satisfaction to know that shell wait for me any length of time and that she really is the dearest girl when are you to meet her at the coach i ask
at seven says traddles looking at his plain old silver watchthe very watch he once took a wheel out of at school to make a watermill
that is about miss wickfields time is it not a little earlier
her time is half past eight i assure you my dear boy says traddles i am almost as pleased as if i were going to be married myself to think that this event is coming to such a happy termination
and really the great friendship and consideration of personally associating sophy with the joyful occasion and inviting her to be a bridesmaid in conjunction with miss wickfield demands my warmest thanks
i am extremely sensible of it i hear him and shake hands with him and we talk and walk and dine and so on but i dont believe it
nothing is real
sophy arrives at the house of doras aunts in due course
she has the most agreeable of facesnot absolutely beautiful but extraordinarily pleasantand is one of the most genial unaffected frank engaging creatures i have ever seen
traddles presents her to us with great pride and rubs his hands for ten minutes by the clock with every individual hair upon his head standing on tiptoe when i congratulate him in a corner on his choice
i have brought agnes from the canterbury coach and her cheerful and beautiful face is among us for the second time
agnes has a great liking for traddles and it is capital to see them meet and to observe the glory of traddles as he commends the dearest girl in the world to her acquaintance
still i dont believe it
we have a delightful evening and are supremely happy but i dont believe it yet
i cant collect myself
i cant check off my happiness as it takes place
i feel in a misty and unsettled kind of state as if i had got up very early in the morning a week or two ago and had never been to bed since
i cant make out when yesterday was
i seem to have been carrying the licence about in my pocket many months
next day too when we all go in a flock to see the houseour housedoras and minei am quite unable to regard myself as its master
i seem to be there by permission of somebody else
i half expect the real master to come home presently and say he is glad to see me
such a beautiful little house as it is with everything so bright and new with the flowers on the carpets looking as if freshly gathered and the green leaves on the paper as if they had just come out with the spotless muslin curtains and the blushing rosecoloured furniture and doras garden hat with the blue ribbondo i remember now how i loved her in such another hat when i first knew heralready hanging on its little peg the guitarcase quite at home on its heels in a corner and everybody tumbling over jips pagoda which is much too big for the establishment
another happy evening quite as unreal as all the rest of it and i steal into the usual room before going away
dora is not there
i suppose they have not done trying on yet
miss lavinia peeps in and tells me mysteriously that she will not be long
she is rather long notwithstanding but by and by i hear a rustling at the door and someone taps
i say come in but someone taps again
i go to the door wondering who it is there i meet a pair of bright eyes and a blushing face they are doras eyes and face and miss lavinia has dressed her in tomorrows dress bonnet and all for me to see
i take my little wife to my heart and miss lavinia gives a little scream because i tumble the bonnet and dora laughs and cries at once because i am so pleased and i believe it less than ever
do you think it pretty doady says dora
pretty
i should rather think i did
and are you sure you like me very much says dora
the topic is fraught with such danger to the bonnet that miss lavinia gives another little scream and begs me to understand that dora is only to be looked at and on no account to be touched
so dora stands in a delightful state of confusion for a minute or two to be admired and then takes off her bonnetlooking so natural without itand runs away with it in her hand and comes dancing down again in her own familiar dress and asks jip if i have got a beautiful little wife and whether hell forgive her for being married and kneels down to make him stand upon the cookerybook for the last time in her single life
i go home more incredulous than ever to a lodging that i have hard by and get up very early in the morning to ride to the highgate road and fetch my aunt
i have never seen my aunt in such state
she is dressed in lavendercoloured silk and has a white bonnet on and is amazing
janet has dressed her and is there to look at me
peggotty is ready to go to church intending to behold the ceremony from the gallery
mr dick who is to give my darling to me at the altar has had his hair curled
traddles whom i have taken up by appointment at the turnpike presents a dazzling combination of cream colour and light blue and both he and mr dick have a general effect about them of being all gloves
no doubt i see this because i know it is so but i am astray and seem to see nothing
nor do i believe anything whatever
still as we drive along in an open carriage this fairy marriage is real enough to fill me with a sort of wondering pity for the unfortunate people who have no part in it but are sweeping out the shops and going to their daily occupations
my aunt sits with my hand in hers all the way
when we stop a little way short of the church to put down peggotty whom we have brought on the box she gives it a squeeze and me a kiss
god bless you trot
my own boy never could be dearer
i think of poor dear baby this morning so do i
and of all i owe to you dear aunt tut child says my aunt and gives her hand in overflowing cordiality to traddles who then gives his to mr dick who then gives his to me who then gives mine to traddles and then we come to the church door
the church is calm enough i am sure but it might be a steampower loom in full action for any sedative effect it has on me
i am too far gone for that
the rest is all a more or less incoherent dream
a dream of their coming in with dora of the pewopener arranging us like a drillsergeant before the altar rails of my wondering even then why pewopeners must always be the most disagreeable females procurable and whether there is any religious dread of a disastrous infection of goodhumour which renders it indispensable to set those vessels of vinegar upon the road to heaven
of the clergyman and clerk appearing of a few boatmen and some other people strolling in of an ancient mariner behind me strongly flavouring the church with rum of the service beginning in a deep voice and our all being very attentive
of miss lavinia who acts as a semiauxiliary bridesmaid being the first to cry and of her doing homage as i take it to the memory of pidger in sobs of miss clarissa applying a smellingbottle of agnes taking care of dora of my aunt endeavouring to represent herself as a model of sternness with tears rolling down her face of little dora trembling very much and making her responses in faint whispers
of our kneeling down together side by side of doras trembling less and less but always clasping agnes by the hand of the service being got through quietly and gravely of our all looking at each other in an april state of smiles and tears when it is over of my young wife being hysterical in the vestry and crying for her poor papa her dear papa
of her soon cheering up again and our signing the register all round
of my going into the gallery for peggotty to bring her to sign it of peggottys hugging me in a corner and telling me she saw my own dear mother married of its being over and our going away
of my walking so proudly and lovingly down the aisle with my sweet wife upon my arm through a mist of halfseen people pulpits monuments pews fonts organs and church windows in which there flutter faint airs of association with my childish church at home so long ago
of their whispering as we pass what a youthful couple we are and what a pretty little wife she is
of our all being so merry and talkative in the carriage going back
of sophy telling us that when she saw traddles whom i had entrusted with the licence asked for it she almost fainted having been convinced that he would contrive to lose it or to have his pocket picked
of agnes laughing gaily and of dora being so fond of agnes that she will not be separated from her but still keeps her hand
of there being a breakfast with abundance of things pretty and substantial to eat and drink whereof i partake as i should do in any other dream without the least perception of their flavour eating and drinking as i may say nothing but love and marriage and no more believing in the viands than in anything else
of my making a speech in the same dreamy fashion without having an idea of what i want to say beyond such as may be comprehended in the full conviction that i havent said it
of our being very sociably and simply happy always in a dream though and of jips having wedding cake and its not agreeing with him afterwards
of the pair of hired posthorses being ready and of doras going away to change her dress
of my aunt and miss clarissa remaining with us and our walking in the garden and my aunt who has made quite a speech at breakfast touching doras aunts being mightily amused with herself but a little proud of it too
of doras being ready and of miss lavinias hovering about her loth to lose the pretty toy that has given her so much pleasant occupation
of doras making a long series of surprised discoveries that she has forgotten all sorts of little things and of everybodys running everywhere to fetch them
of their all closing about dora when at last she begins to say goodbye looking with their bright colours and ribbons like a bed of flowers
of my darling being almost smothered among the flowers and coming out laughing and crying both together to my jealous arms
of my wanting to carry jip who is to go along with us and doras saying no that she must carry him or else hell think she dont like him any more now she is married and will break his heart
of our going arm in arm and dora stopping and looking back and saying if i have ever been cross or ungrateful to anybody dont remember it and bursting into tears
of her waving her little hand and our going away once more
of her once more stopping and looking back and hurrying to agnes and giving agnes above all the others her last kisses and farewells
we drive away together and i awake from the dream
i believe it at last
it is my dear dear little wife beside me whom i love so well
are you happy now you foolish boy says dora and sure you dont repent i have stood aside to see the phantoms of those days go by me
they are gone and i resume the journey of my story
it was a strange condition of things the honeymoon being over and the bridesmaids gone home when i found myself sitting down in my own small house with dora quite thrown out of employment as i may say in respect of the delicious old occupation of making love
it seemed such an extraordinary thing to have dora always there
it was so unaccountable not to be obliged to go out to see her not to have any occasion to be tormenting myself about her not to have to write to her not to be scheming and devising opportunities of being alone with her
sometimes of an evening when i looked up from my writing and saw her seated opposite i would lean back in my chair and think how queer it was that there we were alone together as a matter of coursenobodys business any moreall the romance of our engagement put away upon a shelf to rustno one to please but one anotherone another to please for life
when there was a debate and i was kept out very late it seemed so strange to me as i was walking home to think that dora was at home
it was such a wonderful thing at first to have her coming softly down to talk to me as i ate my supper
it was such a stupendous thing to know for certain that she put her hair in papers
it was altogether such an astonishing event to see her do it
i doubt whether two young birds could have known less about keeping house than i and my pretty dora did
we had a servant of course
she kept house for us
i have still a latent belief that she must have been mrs crupps daughter in disguise we had such an awful time of it with mary anne
her name was paragon
her nature was represented to us when we engaged her as being feebly expressed in her name
she had a written character as large as a proclamation and according to this document could do everything of a domestic nature that ever i heard of and a great many things that i never did hear of
she was a woman in the prime of life of a severe countenance and subject particularly in the arms to a sort of perpetual measles or fiery rash
she had a cousin in the lifeguards with such long legs that he looked like the afternoon shadow of somebody else
his shelljacket was as much too little for him as he was too big for the premises
he made the cottage smaller than it need have been by being so very much out of proportion to it
besides which the walls were not thick and whenever he passed the evening at our house we always knew of it by hearing one continual growl in the kitchen
our treasure was warranted sober and honest
i am therefore willing to believe that she was in a fit when we found her under the boiler and that the deficient teaspoons were attributable to the dustman
but she preyed upon our minds dreadfully
we felt our inexperience and were unable to help ourselves
we should have been at her mercy if she had had any but she was a remorseless woman and had none
she was the cause of our first little quarrel
my dearest life i said one day to dora do you think mary anne has any idea of time why doady inquired dora looking up innocently from her drawing
my love because its five and we were to have dined at four dora glanced wistfully at the clock and hinted that she thought it was too fast
on the contrary my love said i referring to my watch its a few minutes too slow my little wife came and sat upon my knee to coax me to be quiet and drew a line with her pencil down the middle of my nose but i couldnt dine off that though it was very agreeable
dont you think my dear said i it would be better for you to remonstrate with mary anne oh no please
i couldnt doady said dora
why not my love i gently asked
oh because i am such a little goose said dora and she knows i am i thought this sentiment so incompatible with the establishment of any system of check on mary anne that i frowned a little
oh what ugly wrinkles in my bad boys forehead said dora and still being on my knee she traced them with her pencil putting it to her rosy lips to make it mark blacker and working at my forehead with a quaint little mockery of being industrious that quite delighted me in spite of myself
theres a good child said dora it makes its face so much prettier to laugh but my love said i
no no
please cried dora with a kiss dont be a naughty blue beard
dont be serious my precious wife said i we must be serious sometimes
come
sit down on this chair close beside me
give me the pencil
there
now let us talk sensibly
you know dear what a little hand it was to hold and what a tiny weddingring it was to see
you know my love it is not exactly comfortable to have to go out without ones dinner
now is it nnno replied dora faintly
my love how you tremble because i know youre going to scold me exclaimed dora in a piteous voice
my sweet i am only going to reason oh but reasoning is worse than scolding exclaimed dora in despair
i didnt marry to be reasoned with
if you meant to reason with such a poor little thing as i am you ought to have told me so you cruel boy i tried to pacify dora but she turned away her face and shook her curls from side to side and said you cruel cruel boy so many times that i really did not exactly know what to do so i took a few turns up and down the room in my uncertainty and came back again
dora my darling no i am not your darling
because you must be sorry that you married me or else you wouldnt reason with me returned dora
i felt so injured by the inconsequential nature of this charge that it gave me courage to be grave
now my own dora said i you are very childish and are talking nonsense
you must remember i am sure that i was obliged to go out yesterday when dinner was half over and that the day before i was made quite unwell by being obliged to eat underdone veal in a hurry today i dont dine at alland i am afraid to say how long we waited for breakfastand then the water didnt boil
i dont mean to reproach you my dear but this is not comfortable oh you cruel cruel boy to say i am a disagreeable wife cried dora
now my dear dora you must know that i never said that you said i wasnt comfortable cried dora
i said the housekeeping was not comfortable its exactly the same thing cried dora
and she evidently thought so for she wept most grievously
i took another turn across the room full of love for my pretty wife and distracted by selfaccusatory inclinations to knock my head against the door
i sat down again and said i am not blaming you dora
we have both a great deal to learn
i am only trying to show you my dear that you mustyou really must i was resolved not to give this upaccustom yourself to look after mary anne
likewise to act a little for yourself and me i wonder i do at your making such ungrateful speeches sobbed dora
when you know that the other day when you said you would like a little bit of fish i went out myself miles and miles and ordered it to surprise you and it was very kind of you my own darling said i
i felt it so much that i wouldnt on any account have even mentioned that you bought a salmonwhich was too much for two
or that it cost one pound sixwhich was more than we can afford you enjoyed it very much sobbed dora
and you said i was a mouse and ill say so again my love i returned a thousand times but i had wounded doras soft little heart and she was not to be comforted
she was so pathetic in her sobbing and bewailing that i felt as if i had said i dont know what to hurt her
i was obliged to hurry away i was kept out late and i felt all night such pangs of remorse as made me miserable
i had the conscience of an assassin and was haunted by a vague sense of enormous wickedness
it was two or three hours past midnight when i got home
i found my aunt in our house sitting up for me
is anything the matter aunt said i alarmed
nothing trot she replied
sit down sit down
little blossom has been rather out of spirits and i have been keeping her company
thats all i leaned my head upon my hand and felt more sorry and downcast as i sat looking at the fire than i could have supposed possible so soon after the fulfilment of my brightest hopes
as i sat thinking i happened to meet my aunts eyes which were resting on my face
there was an anxious expression in them but it cleared directly
i assure you aunt said i i have been quite unhappy myself all night to think of doras being so
but i had no other intention than to speak to her tenderly and lovingly about our homeaffairs my aunt nodded encouragement
you must have patience trot said she
of course
heaven knows i dont mean to be unreasonable aunt no no said my aunt
but little blossom is a very tender little blossom and the wind must be gentle with her i thanked my good aunt in my heart for her tenderness towards my wife and i was sure that she knew i did
dont you think aunt said i after some further contemplation of the fire that you could advise and counsel dora a little for our mutual advantage now and then trot returned my aunt with some emotion no
dont ask me such a thing her tone was so very earnest that i raised my eyes in surprise
i look back on my life child said my aunt and i think of some who are in their graves with whom i might have been on kinder terms
if i judged harshly of other peoples mistakes in marriage it may have been because i had bitter reason to judge harshly of my own
let that pass
i have been a grumpy frumpy wayward sort of a woman a good many years
i am still and i always shall be
but you and i have done one another some good trotat all events you have done me good my dear and division must not come between us at this time of day division between us cried i
child child said my aunt smoothing her dress how soon it might come between us or how unhappy i might make our little blossom if i meddled in anything a prophet couldnt say
i want our pet to like me and be as gay as a butterfly
remember your own home in that second marriage and never do both me and her the injury you have hinted at i comprehended at once that my aunt was right and i comprehended the full extent of her generous feeling towards my dear wife
these are early days trot she pursued and rome was not built in a day nor in a year
you have chosen freely for yourself a cloud passed over her face for a moment i thought and you have chosen a very pretty and a very affectionate creature
it will be your duty and it will be your pleasure tooof course i know that i am not delivering a lectureto estimate her as you chose her by the qualities she has and not by the qualities she may not have
the latter you must develop in her if you can
and if you cannot child here my aunt rubbed her nose you must just accustom yourself to do without em
but remember my dear your future is between you two
no one can assist you you are to work it out for yourselves
this is marriage trot and heaven bless you both in it for a pair of babes in the wood as you are my aunt said this in a sprightly way and gave me a kiss to ratify the blessing
now said she light my little lantern and see me into my bandbox by the garden path for there was a communication between our cottages in that direction
give betsey trotwoods love to blossom when you come back and whatever you do trot never dream of setting betsey up as a scarecrow for if i ever saw her in the glass shes quite grim enough and gaunt enough in her private capacity with this my aunt tied her head up in a handkerchief with which she was accustomed to make a bundle of it on such occasions and i escorted her home
as she stood in her garden holding up her little lantern to light me back i thought her observation of me had an anxious air again but i was too much occupied in pondering on what she had said and too much impressedfor the first time in realityby the conviction that dora and i had indeed to work out our future for ourselves and that no one could assist us to take much notice of it
dora came stealing down in her little slippers to meet me now that i was alone and cried upon my shoulder and said i had been hardhearted and she had been naughty and i said much the same thing in effect i believe and we made it up and agreed that our first little difference was to be our last and that we were never to have another if we lived a hundred years
the next domestic trial we went through was the ordeal of servants
mary annes cousin deserted into our coalhole and was brought out to our great amazement by a piquet of his companions in arms who took him away handcuffed in a procession that covered our frontgarden with ignominy
this nerved me to get rid of mary anne who went so mildly on receipt of wages that i was surprised until i found out about the teaspoons and also about the little sums she had borrowed in my name of the tradespeople without authority
after an interval of mrs kidgerburythe oldest inhabitant of kentish town i believe who went out charing but was too feeble to execute her conceptions of that artwe found another treasure who was one of the most amiable of women but who generally made a point of falling either up or down the kitchen stairs with the tray and almost plunged into the parlour as into a bath with the teathings
the ravages committed by this unfortunate rendering her dismissal necessary she was succeeded with intervals of mrs kidgerbury by a long line of incapables terminating in a young person of genteel appearance who went to greenwich fair in doras bonnet
after whom i remember nothing but an average equality of failure
everybody we had anything to do with seemed to cheat us
our appearance in a shop was a signal for the damaged goods to be brought out immediately
if we bought a lobster it was full of water
all our meat turned out to be tough and there was hardly any crust to our loaves
in search of the principle on which joints ought to be roasted to be roasted enough and not too much i myself referred to the cookery book and found it there established as the allowance of a quarter of an hour to every pound and say a quarter over
but the principle always failed us by some curious fatality and we never could hit any medium between redness and cinders
i had reason to believe that in accomplishing these failures we incurred a far greater expense than if we had achieved a series of triumphs
it appeared to me on looking over the tradesmens books as if we might have kept the basement storey paved with butter such was the extensive scale of our consumption of that article
i dont know whether the excise returns of the period may have exhibited any increase in the demand for pepper but if our performances did not affect the market i should say several families must have left off using it
and the most wonderful fact of all was that we never had anything in the house
as to the washerwoman pawning the clothes and coming in a state of penitent intoxication to apologize i suppose that might have happened several times to anybody
also the chimney on fire the parish engine and perjury on the part of the beadle
but i apprehend that we were personally fortunate in engaging a servant with a taste for cordials who swelled our running account for porter at the publichouse by such inexplicable items as quartern rum shrub mrs c halfquartern gin and cloves mrs c glass rum and peppermint mrs cthe parentheses always referring to dora who was supposed it appeared on explanation to have imbibed the whole of these refreshments
one of our first feats in the housekeeping way was a little dinner to traddles
i met him in town and asked him to walk out with me that afternoon
he readily consenting i wrote to dora saying i would bring him home
it was pleasant weather and on the road we made my domestic happiness the theme of conversation
traddles was very full of it and said that picturing himself with such a home and sophy waiting and preparing for him he could think of nothing wanting to complete his bliss
i could not have wished for a prettier little wife at the opposite end of the table but i certainly could have wished when we sat down for a little more room
i did not know how it was but though there were only two of us we were at once always cramped for room and yet had always room enough to lose everything in
i suspect it may have been because nothing had a place of its own except jips pagoda which invariably blocked up the main thoroughfare
on the present occasion traddles was so hemmed in by the pagoda and the guitarcase and doras flowerpainting and my writingtable that i had serious doubts of the possibility of his using his knife and fork but he protested with his own goodhumour oceans of room copperfield
i assure you oceans there was another thing i could have wished namely that jip had never been encouraged to walk about the tablecloth during dinner
i began to think there was something disorderly in his being there at all even if he had not been in the habit of putting his foot in the salt or the melted butter
on this occasion he seemed to think he was introduced expressly to keep traddles at bay and he barked at my old friend and made short runs at his plate with such undaunted pertinacity that he may be said to have engrossed the conversation
however as i knew how tenderhearted my dear dora was and how sensitive she would be to any slight upon her favourite i hinted no objection
for similar reasons i made no allusion to the skirmishing plates upon the floor or to the disreputable appearance of the castors which were all at sixes and sevens and looked drunk or to the further blockade of traddles by wandering vegetable dishes and jugs
i could not help wondering in my own mind as i contemplated the boiled leg of mutton before me previous to carving it how it came to pass that our joints of meat were of such extraordinary shapesand whether our butcher contracted for all the deformed sheep that came into the world but i kept my reflections to myself
my love said i to dora what have you got in that dish i could not imagine why dora had been making tempting little faces at me as if she wanted to kiss me
oysters dear said dora timidly
was that your thought said i delighted
yeyes doady said dora
there never was a happier one i exclaimed laying down the carvingknife and fork
there is nothing traddles likes so much yeyes doady said dora and so i bought a beautiful little barrel of them and the man said they were very good
but ii am afraid theres something the matter with them
they dont seem right here dora shook her head and diamonds twinkled in her eyes
they are only opened in both shells said i
take the top one off my love but it wont come off said dora trying very hard and looking very much distressed
do you know copperfield said traddles cheerfully examining the dish i think it is in consequencethey are capital oysters but i think it is in consequenceof their never having been opened they never had been opened and we had no oysterknivesand couldnt have used them if we had so we looked at the oysters and ate the mutton
at least we ate as much of it as was done and made up with capers
if i had permitted him i am satisfied that traddles would have made a perfect savage of himself and eaten a plateful of raw meat to express enjoyment of the repast but i would hear of no such immolation on the altar of friendship and we had a course of bacon instead there happening by good fortune to be cold bacon in the larder
my poor little wife was in such affliction when she thought i should be annoyed and in such a state of joy when she found i was not that the discomfiture i had subdued very soon vanished and we passed a happy evening dora sitting with her arm on my chair while traddles and i discussed a glass of wine and taking every opportunity of whispering in my ear that it was so good of me not to be a cruel cross old boy
by and by she made tea for us which it was so pretty to see her do as if she was busying herself with a set of dolls teathings that i was not particular about the quality of the beverage
then traddles and i played a game or two at cribbage and dora singing to the guitar the while it seemed to me as if our courtship and marriage were a tender dream of mine and the night when i first listened to her voice were not yet over
when traddles went away and i came back into the parlour from seeing him out my wife planted her chair close to mine and sat down by my side
i am very sorry she said
will you try to teach me doady i must teach myself first dora said i
i am as bad as you love ah
but you can learn she returned and you are a clever clever man nonsense mouse said i
i wish resumed my wife after a long silence that i could have gone down into the country for a whole year and lived with agnes her hands were clasped upon my shoulder and her chin rested on them and her blue eyes looked quietly into mine
why so i asked
i think she might have improved me and i think i might have learned from her said dora
all in good time my love
agnes has had her father to take care of for these many years you should remember
even when she was quite a child she was the agnes whom we know said i
will you call me a name i want you to call me inquired dora without moving
what is it i asked with a smile
its a stupid name she said shaking her curls for a moment
childwife i laughingly asked my childwife what her fancy was in desiring to be so called
she answered without moving otherwise than as the arm i twined about her may have brought her blue eyes nearer to me i dont mean you silly fellow that you should use the name instead of dora
i only mean that you should think of me that way
when you are going to be angry with me say to yourself its only my childwife when i am very disappointing say i knew a long time ago that she would make but a childwife when you miss what i should like to be and i think can never be say still my foolish childwife loves me for indeed i do i had not been serious with her having no idea until now that she was serious herself
but her affectionate nature was so happy in what i now said to her with my whole heart that her face became a laughing one before her glittering eyes were dry
she was soon my childwife indeed sitting down on the floor outside the chinese house ringing all the little bells one after another to punish jip for his recent bad behaviour while jip lay blinking in the doorway with his head out even too lazy to be teased
this appeal of doras made a strong impression on me
i look back on the time i write of i invoke the innocent figure that i dearly loved to come out from the mists and shadows of the past and turn its gentle head towards me once again and i can still declare that this one little speech was constantly in my memory
i may not have used it to the best account i was young and inexperienced but i never turned a deaf ear to its artless pleading
dora told me shortly afterwards that she was going to be a wonderful housekeeper
accordingly she polished the tablets pointed the pencil bought an immense accountbook carefully stitched up with a needle and thread all the leaves of the cookery book which jip had torn and made quite a desperate little attempt to be good as she called it
but the figures had the old obstinate propensitythey would not add up
when she had entered two or three laborious items in the accountbook jip would walk over the page wagging his tail and smear them all out
her own little righthand middle finger got steeped to the very bone in ink and i think that was the only decided result obtained
sometimes of an evening when i was at home and at workfor i wrote a good deal now and was beginning in a small way to be known as a writeri would lay down my pen and watch my childwife trying to be good
first of all she would bring out the immense accountbook and lay it down upon the table with a deep sigh
then she would open it at the place where jip had made it illegible last night and call jip up to look at his misdeeds
this would occasion a diversion in jips favour and some inking of his nose perhaps as a penalty
then she would tell jip to lie down on the table instantly like a lionwhich was one of his tricks though i cannot say the likeness was strikingand if he were in an obedient humour he would obey
then she would take up a pen and begin to write and find a hair in it
then she would take up another pen and begin to write and find that it spluttered
then she would take up another pen and begin to write and say in a low voice oh its a talking pen and will disturb doady and then she would give it up as a bad job and put the accountbook away after pretending to crush the lion with it
or if she were in a very sedate and serious state of mind she would sit down with the tablets and a little basket of bills and other documents which looked more like curlpapers than anything else and endeavour to get some result out of them
after severely comparing one with another and making entries on the tablets and blotting them out and counting all the fingers of her left hand over and over again backwards and forwards she would be so vexed and discouraged and would look so unhappy that it gave me pain to see her bright face cloudedand for meand i would go softly to her and say whats the matter dora dora would look up hopelessly and reply they wont come right
they make my head ache so
and they wont do anything i want then i would say now let us try together
let me show you dora then i would commence a practical demonstration to which dora would pay profound attention perhaps for five minutes when she would begin to be dreadfully tired and would lighten the subject by curling my hair or trying the effect of my face with my shirtcollar turned down
if i tacitly checked this playfulness and persisted she would look so scared and disconsolate as she became more and more bewildered that the remembrance of her natural gaiety when i first strayed into her path and of her being my childwife would come reproachfully upon me and i would lay the pencil down and call for the guitar
i had a great deal of work to do and had many anxieties but the same considerations made me keep them to myself
i am far from sure now that it was right to do this but i did it for my childwifes sake
i search my breast and i commit its secrets if i know them without any reservation to this paper
the old unhappy loss or want of something had i am conscious some place in my heart but not to the embitterment of my life
when i walked alone in the fine weather and thought of the summer days when all the air had been filled with my boyish enchantment i did miss something of the realization of my dreams but i thought it was a softened glory of the past which nothing could have thrown upon the present time
i did feel sometimes for a little while that i could have wished my wife had been my counsellor had had more character and purpose to sustain me and improve me by had been endowed with power to fill up the void which somewhere seemed to be about me but i felt as if this were an unearthly consummation of my happiness that never had been meant to be and never could have been
i was a boyish husband as to years
i had known the softening influence of no other sorrows or experiences than those recorded in these leaves
if i did any wrong as i may have done much i did it in mistaken love and in my want of wisdom
i write the exact truth
it would avail me nothing to extenuate it now
thus it was that i took upon myself the toils and cares of our life and had no partner in them
we lived much as before in reference to our scrambling household arrangements but i had got used to those and dora i was pleased to see was seldom vexed now
she was bright and cheerful in the old childish way loved me dearly and was happy with her old trifles
when the debates were heavyi mean as to length not quality for in the last respect they were not often otherwiseand i went home late dora would never rest when she heard my footsteps but would always come downstairs to meet me
when my evenings were unoccupied by the pursuit for which i had qualified myself with so much pains and i was engaged in writing at home she would sit quietly near me however late the hour and be so mute that i would often think she had dropped asleep
but generally when i raised my head i saw her blue eyes looking at me with the quiet attention of which i have already spoken
oh what a weary boy said dora one night when i met her eyes as i was shutting up my desk
what a weary girl said i
thats more to the purpose
you must go to bed another time my love
its far too late for you no dont send me to bed pleaded dora coming to my side
pray dont do that dora to my amazement she was sobbing on my neck
not well my dear
not happy yes
quite well and very happy said dora
but say youll let me stop and see you write why what a sight for such bright eyes at midnight i replied
are they bright though returned dora laughing
im so glad theyre bright little vanity said i
but it was not vanity it was only harmless delight in my admiration
i knew that very well before she told me so
if you think them pretty say i may always stop and see you write said dora
do you think them pretty very pretty then let me always stop and see you write i am afraid that wont improve their brightness dora yes it will
because you clever boy youll not forget me then while you are full of silent fancies
will you mind it if i say something very very sillymore than usual inquired dora peeping over my shoulder into my face
what wonderful thing is that said i
please let me hold the pens said dora
i want to have something to do with all those many hours when you are so industrious
may i hold the pens the remembrance of her pretty joy when i said yes brings tears into my eyes
the next time i sat down to write and regularly afterwards she sat in her old place with a spare bundle of pens at her side
her triumph in this connexion with my work and her delight when i wanted a new penwhich i very often feigned to dosuggested to me a new way of pleasing my childwife
i occasionally made a pretence of wanting a page or two of manuscript copied
then dora was in her glory
the preparations she made for this great work the aprons she put on the bibs she borrowed from the kitchen to keep off the ink the time she took the innumerable stoppages she made to have a laugh with jip as if he understood it all her conviction that her work was incomplete unless she signed her name at the end and the way in which she would bring it to me like a schoolcopy and then when i praised it clasp me round the neck are touching recollections to me simple as they might appear to other men
she took possession of the keys soon after this and went jingling about the house with the whole bunch in a little basket tied to her slender waist
i seldom found that the places to which they belonged were locked or that they were of any use except as a plaything for jipbut dora was pleased and that pleased me
she was quite satisfied that a good deal was effected by this makebelief of housekeeping and was as merry as if we had been keeping a babyhouse for a joke
so we went on
dora was hardly less affectionate to my aunt than to me and often told her of the time when she was afraid she was a cross old thing
i never saw my aunt unbend more systematically to anyone
she courted jip though jip never responded listened day after day to the guitar though i am afraid she had no taste for music never attacked the incapables though the temptation must have been severe went wonderful distances on foot to purchase as surprises any trifles that she found out dora wanted and never came in by the garden and missed her from the room but she would call out at the foot of the stairs in a voice that sounded cheerfully all over the house wheres little blossom it was some time now since i had left the doctor
living in his neighbourhood i saw him frequently and we all went to his house on two or three occasions to dinner or tea
the old soldier was in permanent quarters under the doctors roof
she was exactly the same as ever and the same immortal butterflies hovered over her cap
like some other mothers whom i have known in the course of my life mrs markleham was far more fond of pleasure than her daughter was
she required a great deal of amusement and like a deep old soldier pretended in consulting her own inclinations to be devoting herself to her child
the doctors desire that annie should be entertained was therefore particularly acceptable to this excellent parent who expressed unqualified approval of his discretion
i have no doubt indeed that she probed the doctors wound without knowing it
meaning nothing but a certain matured frivolity and selfishness not always inseparable from fullblown years i think she confirmed him in his fear that he was a constraint upon his young wife and that there was no congeniality of feeling between them by so strongly commending his design of lightening the load of her life
my dear soul she said to him one day when i was present you know there is no doubt it would be a little pokey for annie to be always shut up here the doctor nodded his benevolent head
when she comes to her mothers age said mrs markleham with a flourish of her fan then itll be another thing
you might put me into a jail with genteel society and a rubber and i should never care to come out
but i am not annie you know and annie is not her mother surely surely said the doctor
you are the best of creaturesno i beg your pardon for the doctor made a gesture of deprecation i must say before your face as i always say behind your back you are the best of creatures but of course you dontnow do youenter into the same pursuits and fancies as annie no said the doctor in a sorrowful tone
no of course not retorted the old soldier
take your dictionary for example
what a useful work a dictionary is
what a necessary work
the meanings of words
without doctor johnson or somebody of that sort we might have been at this present moment calling an italianiron a bedstead
but we cant expect a dictionaryespecially when its makingto interest annie can we the doctor shook his head
and thats why i so much approve said mrs markleham tapping him on the shoulder with her shutup fan of your thoughtfulness
it shows that you dont expect as many elderly people do expect old heads on young shoulders
you have studied annies character and you understand it
thats what i find so charming even the calm and patient face of doctor strong expressed some little sense of pain i thought under the infliction of these compliments
therefore my dear doctor said the old soldier giving him several affectionate taps you may command me at all times and seasons
now do understand that i am entirely at your service
i am ready to go with annie to operas concerts exhibitions all kinds of places and you shall never find that i am tired
duty my dear doctor before every consideration in the universe she was as good as her word
she was one of those people who can bear a great deal of pleasure and she never flinched in her perseverance in the cause
she seldom got hold of the newspaper which she settled herself down in the softest chair in the house to read through an eyeglass every day for two hours but she found out something that she was certain annie would like to see
it was in vain for annie to protest that she was weary of such things
her mothers remonstrance always was now my dear annie i am sure you know better and i must tell you my love that you are not making a proper return for the kindness of doctor strong this was usually said in the doctors presence and appeared to me to constitute annies principal inducement for withdrawing her objections when she made any
but in general she resigned herself to her mother and went where the old soldier would
it rarely happened now that mr maldon accompanied them
sometimes my aunt and dora were invited to do so and accepted the invitation
sometimes dora only was asked
the time had been when i should have been uneasy in her going but reflection on what had passed that former night in the doctors study had made a change in my mistrust
i believed that the doctor was right and i had no worse suspicions
my aunt rubbed her nose sometimes when she happened to be alone with me and said she couldnt make it out she wished they were happier she didnt think our military friend so she always called the old soldier mended the matter at all
my aunt further expressed her opinion that if our military friend would cut off those butterflies and give em to the chimneysweepers for mayday it would look like the beginning of something sensible on her part but her abiding reliance was on mr dick
that man had evidently an idea in his head she said and if he could only once pen it up into a corner which was his great difficulty he would distinguish himself in some extraordinary manner
unconscious of this prediction mr dick continued to occupy precisely the same ground in reference to the doctor and to mrs strong
he seemed neither to advance nor to recede
he appeared to have settled into his original foundation like a building and i must confess that my faith in his ever moving was not much greater than if he had been a building
but one night when i had been married some months mr dick put his head into the parlour where i was writing alone dora having gone out with my aunt to take tea with the two little birds and said with a significant cough you couldnt speak to me without inconveniencing yourself trotwood i am afraid certainly mr dick said i come in trotwood said mr dick laying his finger on the side of his nose after he had shaken hands with me
before i sit down i wish to make an observation
you know your aunt a little i replied
she is the most wonderful woman in the world sir after the delivery of this communication which he shot out of himself as if he were loaded with it mr dick sat down with greater gravity than usual and looked at me
now boy said mr dick i am going to put a question to you as many as you please said i
what do you consider me sir asked mr dick folding his arms
a dear old friend said i
thank you trotwood returned mr dick laughing and reaching across in high glee to shake hands with me
but i mean boy resuming his gravity what do you consider me in this respect touching his forehead
i was puzzled how to answer but he helped me with a word
weak said mr dick
well i replied dubiously
rather so exactly cried mr dick who seemed quite enchanted by my reply
that is trotwood when they took some of the trouble out of youknowwhos head and put it you know where there was a mr dick made his two hands revolve very fast about each other a great number of times and then brought them into collision and rolled them over and over one another to express confusion
there was that sort of thing done to me somehow
eh i nodded at him and he nodded back again
in short boy said mr dick dropping his voice to a whisper i am simple i would have qualified that conclusion but he stopped me
yes i am
she pretends i am not
she wont hear of it but i am
i know i am
if she hadnt stood my friend sir i should have been shut up to lead a dismal life these many years
but ill provide for her
i never spend the copying money
i put it in a box
i have made a will
ill leave it all to her
she shall be richnoble mr dick took out his pockethandkerchief and wiped his eyes
he then folded it up with great care pressed it smooth between his two hands put it in his pocket and seemed to put my aunt away with it
now you are a scholar trotwood said mr dick
you are a fine scholar
you know what a learned man what a great man the doctor is
you know what honour he has always done me
not proud in his wisdom
humble humblecondescending even to poor dick who is simple and knows nothing
i have sent his name up on a scrap of paper to the kite along the string when it has been in the sky among the larks
the kite has been glad to receive it sir and the sky has been brighter with it i delighted him by saying most heartily that the doctor was deserving of our best respect and highest esteem
and his beautiful wife is a star said mr dick
a shining star
i have seen her shine sir
but bringing his chair nearer and laying one hand upon my kneeclouds sirclouds i answered the solicitude which his face expressed by conveying the same expression into my own and shaking my head
what clouds said mr dick
he looked so wistfully into my face and was so anxious to understand that i took great pains to answer him slowly and distinctly as i might have entered on an explanation to a child
there is some unfortunate division between them i replied
some unhappy cause of separation
a secret
it may be inseparable from the discrepancy in their years
it may have grown up out of almost nothing mr dick who had told off every sentence with a thoughtful nod paused when i had done and sat considering with his eyes upon my face and his hand upon my knee
doctor not angry with her trotwood he said after some time
no
devoted to her then i have got it boy said mr dick
the sudden exultation with which he slapped me on the knee and leaned back in his chair with his eyebrows lifted up as high as he could possibly lift them made me think him farther out of his wits than ever
he became as suddenly grave again and leaning forward as before saidfirst respectfully taking out his pockethandkerchief as if it really did represent my aunt most wonderful woman in the world trotwood
why has she done nothing to set things right too delicate and difficult a subject for such interference i replied
fine scholar said mr dick touching me with his finger
why has he done nothing for the same reason i returned
then i have got it boy said mr dick
and he stood up before me more exultingly than before nodding his head and striking himself repeatedly upon the breast until one might have supposed that he had nearly nodded and struck all the breath out of his body
a poor fellow with a craze sir said mr dick a simpleton a weakminded personpresent company you know striking himself again may do what wonderful people may not do
ill bring them together boy
ill try
theyll not blame me
theyll not object to me
theyll not mind what i do if its wrong
im only mr dick
and who minds dick
dicks nobody
whoo he blew a slight contemptuous breath as if he blew himself away
it was fortunate he had proceeded so far with his mystery for we heard the coach stop at the little garden gate which brought my aunt and dora home
not a word boy he pursued in a whisper leave all the blame with dicksimple dickmad dick
i have been thinking sir for some time that i was getting it and now i have got it
after what you have said to me i am sure i have got it
all right not another word did mr dick utter on the subject but he made a very telegraph of himself for the next halfhour to the great disturbance of my aunts mind to enjoin inviolable secrecy on me
to my surprise i heard no more about it for some two or three weeks though i was sufficiently interested in the result of his endeavours descrying a strange gleam of good sensei say nothing of good feeling for that he always exhibitedin the conclusion to which he had come
at last i began to believe that in the flighty and unsettled state of his mind he had either forgotten his intention or abandoned it
one fair evening when dora was not inclined to go out my aunt and i strolled up to the doctors cottage
it was autumn when there were no debates to vex the evening air and i remember how the leaves smelt like our garden at blunderstone as we trod them under foot and how the old unhappy feeling seemed to go by on the sighing wind
it was twilight when we reached the cottage
mrs strong was just coming out of the garden where mr dick yet lingered busy with his knife helping the gardener to point some stakes
the doctor was engaged with someone in his study but the visitor would be gone directly mrs strong said and begged us to remain and see him
we went into the drawingroom with her and sat down by the darkening window
there was never any ceremony about the visits of such old friends and neighbours as we were
we had not sat here many minutes when mrs markleham who usually contrived to be in a fuss about something came bustling in with her newspaper in her hand and said out of breath my goodness gracious annie why didnt you tell me there was someone in the study my dear mama she quietly returned how could i know that you desired the information desired the information said mrs markleham sinking on the sofa
i never had such a turn in all my life have you been to the study then mama asked annie
been to the study my dear she returned emphatically
indeed i have
i came upon the amiable creatureif youll imagine my feelings miss trotwood and davidin the act of making his will her daughter looked round from the window quickly
in the act my dear annie repeated mrs markleham spreading the newspaper on her lap like a tablecloth and patting her hands upon it of making his last will and testament
the foresight and affection of the dear
i must tell you how it was
i really must in justice to the darlingfor he is nothing lesstell you how it was
perhaps you know miss trotwood that there is never a candle lighted in this house until ones eyes are literally falling out of ones head with being stretched to read the paper
and that there is not a chair in this house in which a paper can be what i call read except one in the study
this took me to the study where i saw a light
i opened the door
in company with the dear doctor were two professional people evidently connected with the law and they were all three standing at the table the darling doctor pen in hand
this simply expresses then said the doctorannie my love attend to the very wordsthis simply expresses then gentlemen the confidence i have in mrs strong and gives her all unconditionally one of the professional people replied and gives her all unconditionally upon that with the natural feelings of a mother i said good god i beg your pardon fell over the doorstep and came away through the little back passage where the pantry is mrs strong opened the window and went out into the verandah where she stood leaning against a pillar
but now isnt it miss trotwood isnt it david invigorating said mrs markleham mechanically following her with her eyes to find a man at doctor strongs time of life with the strength of mind to do this kind of thing
it only shows how right i was
i said to annie when doctor strong paid a very flattering visit to myself and made her the subject of a declaration and an offer i said my dear there is no doubt whatever in my opinion with reference to a suitable provision for you that doctor strong will do more than he binds himself to do here the bell rang and we heard the sound of the visitors feet as they went out
its all over no doubt said the old soldier after listening the dear creature has signed sealed and delivered and his minds at rest
well it may be
what a mind
annie my love i am going to the study with my paper for i am a poor creature without news
miss trotwood david pray come and see the doctor i was conscious of mr dicks standing in the shadow of the room shutting up his knife when we accompanied her to the study and of my aunts rubbing her nose violently by the way as a mild vent for her intolerance of our military friend but who got first into the study or how mrs markleham settled herself in a moment in her easychair or how my aunt and i came to be left together near the door unless her eyes were quicker than mine and she held me back i have forgotten if i ever knew
but this i knowthat we saw the doctor before he saw us sitting at his table among the folio volumes in which he delighted resting his head calmly on his hand
that in the same moment we saw mrs strong glide in pale and trembling
that mr dick supported her on his arm
that he laid his other hand upon the doctors arm causing him to look up with an abstracted air
that as the doctor moved his head his wife dropped down on one knee at his feet and with her hands imploringly lifted fixed upon his face the memorable look i had never forgotten
that at this sight mrs markleham dropped the newspaper and stared more like a figurehead intended for a ship to be called the astonishment than anything else i can think of
the gentleness of the doctors manner and surprise the dignity that mingled with the supplicating attitude of his wife the amiable concern of mr dick and the earnestness with which my aunt said to herself that man mad triumphantly expressive of the misery from which she had saved himi see and hear rather than remember as i write about it
doctor said mr dick
what is it thats amiss
look here annie cried the doctor
not at my feet my dear yes she said
i beg and pray that no one will leave the room
oh my husband and father break this long silence
let us both know what it is that has come between us mrs markleham by this time recovering the power of speech and seeming to swell with family pride and motherly indignation here exclaimed annie get up immediately and dont disgrace everybody belonging to you by humbling yourself like that unless you wish to see me go out of my mind on the spot mama returned annie
waste no words on me for my appeal is to my husband and even you are nothing here nothing exclaimed mrs markleham
me nothing
the child has taken leave of her senses
please to get me a glass of water i was too attentive to the doctor and his wife to give any heed to this request and it made no impression on anybody else so mrs markleham panted stared and fanned herself
annie said the doctor tenderly taking her in his hands
my dear
if any unavoidable change has come in the sequence of time upon our married life you are not to blame
the fault is mine and only mine
there is no change in my affection admiration and respect
i wish to make you happy
i truly love and honour you
rise annie pray but she did not rise
after looking at him for a little while she sank down closer to him laid her arm across his knee and dropping her head upon it said if i have any friend here who can speak one word for me or for my husband in this matter if i have any friend here who can give a voice to any suspicion that my heart has sometimes whispered to me if i have any friend here who honours my husband or has ever cared for me and has anything within his knowledge no matter what it is that may help to mediate between us i implore that friend to speak there was a profound silence
after a few moments of painful hesitation i broke the silence
mrs
strong i said there is something within my knowledge which i have been earnestly entreated by doctor strong to conceal and have concealed until tonight
but i believe the time has come when it would be mistaken faith and delicacy to conceal it any longer and when your appeal absolves me from his injunction she turned her face towards me for a moment and i knew that i was right
i could not have resisted its entreaty if the assurance that it gave me had been less convincing
our future peace she said may be in your hands
i trust it confidently to your not suppressing anything
i know beforehand that nothing you or anyone can tell me will show my husbands noble heart in any other light than one
howsoever it may seem to you to touch me disregard that
i will speak for myself before him and before god afterwards thus earnestly besought i made no reference to the doctor for his permission but without any other compromise of the truth than a little softening of the coarseness of uriah heep related plainly what had passed in that same room that night
the staring of mrs markleham during the whole narration and the shrill sharp interjections with which she occasionally interrupted it defy description
when i had finished annie remained for some few moments silent with her head bent down as i have described
then she took the doctors hand he was sitting in the same attitude as when we had entered the room and pressed it to her breast and kissed it
mr dick softly raised her and she stood when she began to speak leaning on him and looking down upon her husbandfrom whom she never turned her eyes
all that has ever been in my mind since i was married she said in a low submissive tender voice i will lay bare before you
i could not live and have one reservation knowing what i know now nay annie said the doctor mildly i have never doubted you my child
there is no need indeed there is no need my dear there is great need she answered in the same way that i should open my whole heart before the soul of generosity and truth whom year by year and day by day i have loved and venerated more and more as heaven knows really interrupted mrs markleham if i have any discretion at all which you havent you marplot observed my aunt in an indignant whisper
i must be permitted to observe that it cannot be requisite to enter into these details no one but my husband can judge of that mama said annie without removing her eyes from his face and he will hear me
if i say anything to give you pain mama forgive me
i have borne pain first often and long myself upon my word gasped mrs markleham
when i was very young said annie quite a little child my first associations with knowledge of any kind were inseparable from a patient friend and teacherthe friend of my dead fatherwho was always dear to me
i can remember nothing that i know without remembering him
he stored my mind with its first treasures and stamped his character upon them all
they never could have been i think as good as they have been to me if i had taken them from any other hands makes her mother nothing exclaimed mrs markleham
not so mama said annie but i make him what he was
i must do that
as i grew up he occupied the same place still
i was proud of his interest deeply fondly gratefully attached to him
i looked up to him i can hardly describe howas a father as a guide as one whose praise was different from all other praise as one in whom i could have trusted and confided if i had doubted all the world
you know mama how young and inexperienced i was when you presented him before me of a sudden as a lover i have mentioned the fact fifty times at least to everybody here said mrs markleham
then hold your tongue for the lords sake and dont mention it any more muttered my aunt
it was so great a change so great a loss i felt it at first said annie still preserving the same look and tone that i was agitated and distressed
i was but a girl and when so great a change came in the character in which i had so long looked up to him i think i was sorry
but nothing could have made him what he used to be again and i was proud that he should think me so worthy and we were married at saint alphage canterbury observed mrs markleham
confound the woman said my aunt she wont be quiet i never thought proceeded annie with a heightened colour of any worldly gain that my husband would bring to me
my young heart had no room in its homage for any such poor reference
mama forgive me when i say that it was you who first presented to my mind the thought that anyone could wrong me and wrong him by such a cruel suspicion me cried mrs markleham
ah
you to be sure observed my aunt and you cant fan it away my military friend it was the first unhappiness of my new life said annie
it was the first occasion of every unhappy moment i have known
these moments have been more of late than i can count but notmy generous husbandnot for the reason you suppose for in my heart there is not a thought a recollection or a hope that any power could separate from you she raised her eyes and clasped her hands and looked as beautiful and true i thought as any spirit
the doctor looked on her henceforth as steadfastly as she on him
mama is blameless she went on of having ever urged you for herself and she is blameless in intention every way i am surebut when i saw how many importunate claims were pressed upon you in my name how you were traded on in my name how generous you were and how mr wickfield who had your welfare very much at heart resented it the first sense of my exposure to the mean suspicion that my tenderness was boughtand sold to you of all men on earthfell upon me like unmerited disgrace in which i forced you to participate
i cannot tell you what it wasmama cannot imagine what it wasto have this dread and trouble always on my mind yet know in my own soul that on my marriageday i crowned the love and honour of my life a specimen of the thanks one gets cried mrs markleham in tears for taking care of ones family
i wish i was a turk i wish you were with all my heartand in your native country said my aunt
it was at that time that mama was most solicitous about my cousin maldon
i had liked him she spoke softly but without any hesitation very much
we had been little lovers once
if circumstances had not happened otherwise i might have come to persuade myself that i really loved him and might have married him and been most wretched
there can be no disparity in marriage like unsuitability of mind and purpose i pondered on those words even while i was studiously attending to what followed as if they had some particular interest or some strange application that i could not divine
there can be no disparity in marriage like unsuitability of mind and purposeno disparity in marriage like unsuitability of mind and purpose there is nothing said annie that we have in common
i have long found that there is nothing
if i were thankful to my husband for no more instead of for so much i should be thankful to him for having saved me from the first mistaken impulse of my undisciplined heart she stood quite still before the doctor and spoke with an earnestness that thrilled me
yet her voice was just as quiet as before
when he was waiting to be the object of your munificence so freely bestowed for my sake and when i was unhappy in the mercenary shape i was made to wear i thought it would have become him better to have worked his own way on
i thought that if i had been he i would have tried to do it at the cost of almost any hardship
but i thought no worse of him until the night of his departure for india
that night i knew he had a false and thankless heart
i saw a double meaning then in mr wickfields scrutiny of me
i perceived for the first time the dark suspicion that shadowed my life suspicion annie said the doctor
no no no in your mind there was none i know my husband she returned
and when i came to you that night to lay down all my load of shame and grief and knew that i had to tell that underneath your roof one of my own kindred to whom you had been a benefactor for the love of me had spoken to me words that should have found no utterance even if i had been the weak and mercenary wretch he thought memy mind revolted from the taint the very tale conveyed
it died upon my lips and from that hour till now has never passed them mrs markleham with a short groan leaned back in her easychair and retired behind her fan as if she were never coming out any more
i have never but in your presence interchanged a word with him from that time then only when it has been necessary for the avoidance of this explanation
years have passed since he knew from me what his situation here was
the kindnesses you have secretly done for his advancement and then disclosed to me for my surprise and pleasure have been you will believe but aggravations of the unhappiness and burden of my secret she sunk down gently at the doctors feet though he did his utmost to prevent her and said looking up tearfully into his face do not speak to me yet
let me say a little more
right or wrong if this were to be done again i think i should do just the same
you never can know what it was to be devoted to you with those old associations to find that anyone could be so hard as to suppose that the truth of my heart was bartered away and to be surrounded by appearances confirming that belief
i was very young and had no adviser
between mama and me in all relating to you there was a wide division
if i shrunk into myself hiding the disrespect i had undergone it was because i honoured you so much and so much wished that you should honour me annie my pure heart said the doctor my dear girl a little more
a very few words more
i used to think there were so many whom you might have married who would not have brought such charge and trouble on you and who would have made your home a worthier home
i used to be afraid that i had better have remained your pupil and almost your child
i used to fear that i was so unsuited to your learning and wisdom
if all this made me shrink within myself as indeed it did when i had that to tell it was still because i honoured you so much and hoped that you might one day honour me that day has shone this long time annie said the doctor and can have but one long night my dear another word
i afterwards meantsteadfastly meant and purposed to myselfto bear the whole weight of knowing the unworthiness of one to whom you had been so good
and now a last word dearest and best of friends
the cause of the late change in you which i have seen with so much pain and sorrow and have sometimes referred to my old apprehensionat other times to lingering suppositions nearer to the truthhas been made clear tonight and by an accident i have also come to know tonight the full measure of your noble trust in me even under that mistake
i do not hope that any love and duty i may render in return will ever make me worthy of your priceless confidence but with all this knowledge fresh upon me i can lift my eyes to this dear face revered as a fathers loved as a husbands sacred to me in my childhood as a friends and solemnly declare that in my lightest thought i have never wronged you never wavered in the love and the fidelity i owe you she had her arms around the doctors neck and he leant his head down over her mingling his grey hair with her dark brown tresses
oh hold me to your heart my husband
never cast me out
do not think or speak of disparity between us for there is none except in all my many imperfections
every succeeding year i have known this better as i have esteemed you more and more
oh take me to your heart my husband for my love was founded on a rock and it endures in the silence that ensued my aunt walked gravely up to mr dick without at all hurrying herself and gave him a hug and a sounding kiss
and it was very fortunate with a view to his credit that she did so for i am confident that i detected him at that moment in the act of making preparations to stand on one leg as an appropriate expression of delight
you are a very remarkable man dick said my aunt with an air of unqualified approbation and never pretend to be anything else for i know better with that my aunt pulled him by the sleeve and nodded to me and we three stole quietly out of the room and came away
thats a settler for our military friend at any rate said my aunt on the way home
i should sleep the better for that if there was nothing else to be glad of she was quite overcome i am afraid said mr dick with great commiseration
what
did you ever see a crocodile overcome inquired my aunt
i dont think i ever saw a crocodile returned mr dick mildly
there never would have been anything the matter if it hadnt been for that old animal said my aunt with strong emphasis
its very much to be wished that some mothers would leave their daughters alone after marriage and not be so violently affectionate
they seem to think the only return that can be made them for bringing an unfortunate young woman into the worldgod bless my soul as if she asked to be brought or wanted to comeis full liberty to worry her out of it again
what are you thinking of trot i was thinking of all that had been said
my mind was still running on some of the expressions used
there can be no disparity in marriage like unsuitability of mind and purpose the first mistaken impulse of an undisciplined heart my love was founded on a rock but we were at home and the trodden leaves were lying underfoot and the autumn wind was blowing
i must have been married if i may trust to my imperfect memory for dates about a year or so when one evening as i was returning from a solitary walk thinking of the book i was then writingfor my success had steadily increased with my steady application and i was engaged at that time upon my first work of fictioni came past mrs steerforths house
i had often passed it before during my residence in that neighbourhood though never when i could choose another road
howbeit it did sometimes happen that it was not easy to find another without making a long circuit and so i had passed that way upon the whole pretty often
i had never done more than glance at the house as i went by with a quickened step
it had been uniformly gloomy and dull
none of the best rooms abutted on the road and the narrow heavilyframed oldfashioned windows never cheerful under any circumstances looked very dismal close shut and with their blinds always drawn down
there was a covered way across a little paved court to an entrance that was never used and there was one round staircase window at odds with all the rest and the only one unshaded by a blind which had the same unoccupied blank look
i do not remember that i ever saw a light in all the house
if i had been a casual passerby i should have probably supposed that some childless person lay dead in it
if i had happily possessed no knowledge of the place and had seen it often in that changeless state i should have pleased my fancy with many ingenious speculations i dare say
as it was i thought as little of it as i might
but my mind could not go by it and leave it as my body did and it usually awakened a long train of meditations
coming before me on this particular evening that i mention mingled with the childish recollections and later fancies the ghosts of halfformed hopes the broken shadows of disappointments dimly seen and understood the blending of experience and imagination incidental to the occupation with which my thoughts had been busy it was more than commonly suggestive
i fell into a brown study as i walked on and a voice at my side made me start
it was a womans voice too
i was not long in recollecting mrs steerforths little parlourmaid who had formerly worn blue ribbons in her cap
she had taken them out now to adapt herself i suppose to the altered character of the house and wore but one or two disconsolate bows of sober brown
if you please sir would you have the goodness to walk in and speak to miss dartle has miss dartle sent you for me i inquired
not tonight sir but its just the same
miss dartle saw you pass a night or two ago and i was to sit at work on the staircase and when i saw you pass again to ask you to step in and speak to her i turned back and inquired of my conductor as we went along how mrs steerforth was
she said her lady was but poorly and kept her own room a good deal
when we arrived at the house i was directed to miss dartle in the garden and left to make my presence known to her myself
she was sitting on a seat at one end of a kind of terrace overlooking the great city
it was a sombre evening with a lurid light in the sky and as i saw the prospect scowling in the distance with here and there some larger object starting up into the sullen glare i fancied it was no inapt companion to the memory of this fierce woman
she saw me as i advanced and rose for a moment to receive me
i thought her then still more colourless and thin than when i had seen her last the flashing eyes still brighter and the scar still plainer
our meeting was not cordial
we had parted angrily on the last occasion and there was an air of disdain about her which she took no pains to conceal
i am told you wish to speak to me miss dartle said i standing near her with my hand upon the back of the seat and declining her gesture of invitation to sit down
if you please said she
pray has this girl been found no and yet she has run away i saw her thin lips working while she looked at me as if they were eager to load her with reproaches
run away i repeated
yes
from him she said with a laugh
if she is not found perhaps she never will be found
she may be dead the vaunting cruelty with which she met my glance i never saw expressed in any other face that ever i have seen
to wish her dead said i may be the kindest wish that one of her own sex could bestow upon her
i am glad that time has softened you so much miss dartle she condescended to make no reply but turning on me with another scornful laugh said the friends of this excellent and muchinjured young lady are friends of yours
you are their champion and assert their rights
do you wish to know what is known of her yes said i
she rose with an illfavoured smile and taking a few steps towards a wall of holly that was near at hand dividing the lawn from a kitchengarden said in a louder voice come hereas if she were calling to some unclean beast
you will restrain any demonstrative championship or vengeance in this place of course mr copperfield said she looking over her shoulder at me with the same expression
i inclined my head without knowing what she meant and she said come here again and returned followed by the respectable mr littimer who with undiminished respectability made me a bow and took up his position behind her
the air of wicked grace of triumph in which strange to say there was yet something feminine and alluring with which she reclined upon the seat between us and looked at me was worthy of a cruel princess in a legend
now said she imperiously without glancing at him and touching the old wound as it throbbed perhaps in this instance with pleasure rather than pain
tell mr copperfield about the flight mr
james and myself maam dont address yourself to me she interrupted with a frown
mr
james and myself sir nor to me if you please said i mr littimer without being at all discomposed signified by a slight obeisance that anything that was most agreeable to us was most agreeable to him and began again
mr
james and myself have been abroad with the young woman ever since she left yarmouth under mr jamess protection
we have been in a variety of places and seen a deal of foreign country
we have been in france switzerland italy in fact almost all parts he looked at the back of the seat as if he were addressing himself to that and softly played upon it with his hands as if he were striking chords upon a dumb piano
mr
james took quite uncommonly to the young woman and was more settled for a length of time than i have known him to be since i have been in his service
the young woman was very improvable and spoke the languages and wouldnt have been known for the same countryperson
i noticed that she was much admired wherever we went miss dartle put her hand upon her side
i saw him steal a glance at her and slightly smile to himself
very much admired indeed the young woman was
what with her dress what with the air and sun what with being made so much of what with this that and the other her merits really attracted general notice he made a short pause
her eyes wandered restlessly over the distant prospect and she bit her nether lip to stop that busy mouth
taking his hands from the seat and placing one of them within the other as he settled himself on one leg mr littimer proceeded with his eyes cast down and his respectable head a little advanced and a little on one side the young woman went on in this manner for some time being occasionally low in her spirits until i think she began to weary mr james by giving way to her low spirits and tempers of that kind and things were not so comfortable
mr james he began to be restless again
the more restless he got the worse she got and i must say for myself that i had a very difficult time of it indeed between the two
still matters were patched up here and made good there over and over again and altogether lasted i am sure for a longer time than anybody could have expected recalling her eyes from the distance she looked at me again now with her former air
mr littimer clearing his throat behind his hand with a respectable short cough changed legs and went on at last when there had been upon the whole a good many words and reproaches mr james he set off one morning from the neighbourhood of naples where we had a villa the young woman being very partial to the sea and under pretence of coming back in a day or so left it in charge with me to break it out that for the general happiness of all concerned he washere an interruption of the short coughgone
but mr james i must say certainly did behave extremely honourable for he proposed that the young woman should marry a very respectable person who was fully prepared to overlook the past and who was at least as good as anybody the young woman could have aspired to in a regular way her connexions being very common he changed legs again and wetted his lips
i was convinced that the scoundrel spoke of himself and i saw my conviction reflected in miss dartles face
this i also had it in charge to communicate
i was willing to do anything to relieve mr james from his difficulty and to restore harmony between himself and an affectionate parent who has undergone so much on his account
therefore i undertook the commission
the young womans violence when she came to after i broke the fact of his departure was beyond all expectations
she was quite mad and had to be held by force or if she couldnt have got to a knife or got to the sea shed have beaten her head against the marble floor miss dartle leaning back upon the seat with a light of exultation in her face seemed almost to caress the sounds this fellow had uttered
but when i came to the second part of what had been entrusted to me said mr littimer rubbing his hands uneasily which anybody might have supposed would have been at all events appreciated as a kind intention then the young woman came out in her true colours
a more outrageous person i never did see
her conduct was surprisingly bad
she had no more gratitude no more feeling no more patience no more reason in her than a stock or a stone
if i hadnt been upon my guard i am convinced she would have had my blood i think the better of her for it said i indignantly
mr littimer bent his head as much as to say indeed sir
but youre young and resumed his narrative
it was necessary in short for a time to take away everything nigh her that she could do herself or anybody else an injury with and to shut her up close
notwithstanding which she got out in the night forced the lattice of a window that i had nailed up myself dropped on a vine that was trailed below and never has been seen or heard of to my knowledge since she is dead perhaps said miss dartle with a smile as if she could have spurned the body of the ruined girl
she may have drowned herself miss returned mr littimer catching at an excuse for addressing himself to somebody
its very possible
or she may have had assistance from the boatmen and the boatmens wives and children
being given to low company she was very much in the habit of talking to them on the beach miss dartle and sitting by their boats
i have known her do it when mr james has been away whole days
mr james was far from pleased to find out once that she had told the children she was a boatmans daughter and that in her own country long ago she had roamed about the beach like them oh emily
unhappy beauty
what a picture rose before me of her sitting on the faroff shore among the children like herself when she was innocent listening to little voices such as might have called her mother had she been a poor mans wife and to the great voice of the sea with its eternal never more when it was clear that nothing could be done miss dartle did i tell you not to speak to me she said with stern contempt
you spoke to me miss he replied
i beg your pardon
but it is my service to obey do your service she returned
finish your story and go when it was clear he said with infinite respectability and an obedient bow that she was not to be found i went to mr james at the place where it had been agreed that i should write to him and informed him of what had occurred
words passed between us in consequence and i felt it due to my character to leave him
i could bear and i have borne a great deal from mr james but he insulted me too far
he hurt me
knowing the unfortunate difference between himself and his mother and what her anxiety of mind was likely to be i took the liberty of coming home to england and relating for money which i paid him said miss dartle to me
just so maamand relating what i knew
i am not aware said mr littimer after a moments reflection that there is anything else
i am at present out of employment and should be happy to meet with a respectable situation miss dartle glanced at me as though she would inquire if there were anything that i desired to ask
as there was something which had occurred to my mind i said in reply i could wish to know from thiscreature i could not bring myself to utter any more conciliatory word whether they intercepted a letter that was written to her from home or whether he supposes that she received it he remained calm and silent with his eyes fixed on the ground and the tip of every finger of his right hand delicately poised against the tip of every finger of his left
miss dartle turned her head disdainfully towards him
i beg your pardon miss he said awakening from his abstraction but however submissive to you i have my position though a servant
mr copperfield and you miss are different people
if mr copperfield wishes to know anything from me i take the liberty of reminding mr copperfield that he can put a question to me
i have a character to maintain after a momentary struggle with myself i turned my eyes upon him and said you have heard my question
consider it addressed to yourself if you choose
what answer do you make sir he rejoined with an occasional separation and reunion of those delicate tips my answer must be qualified because to betray mr jamess confidence to his mother and to betray it to you are two different actions
it is not probable i consider that mr james would encourage the receipt of letters likely to increase low spirits and unpleasantness but further than that sir i should wish to avoid going is that all inquired miss dartle of me
i indicated that i had nothing more to say
except i added as i saw him moving off that i understand this fellows part in the wicked story and that as i shall make it known to the honest man who has been her father from her childhood i would recommend him to avoid going too much into public he had stopped the moment i began and had listened with his usual repose of manner
thank you sir
but youll excuse me if i say sir that there are neither slaves nor slavedrivers in this country and that people are not allowed to take the law into their own hands
if they do it is more to their own peril i believe than to other peoples
consequently speaking i am not at all afraid of going wherever i may wish sir with that he made a polite bow and with another to miss dartle went away through the arch in the wall of holly by which he had come
miss dartle and i regarded each other for a little while in silence her manner being exactly what it was when she had produced the man
he says besides she observed with a slow curling of her lip that his master as he hears is coasting spain and this done is away to gratify his seafaring tastes till he is weary
but this is of no interest to you
between these two proud persons mother and son there is a wider breach than before and little hope of its healing for they are one at heart and time makes each more obstinate and imperious
neither is this of any interest to you but it introduces what i wish to say
this devil whom you make an angel of
i mean this low girl whom he picked out of the tidemud with her black eyes full upon me and her passionate finger up may be alivefor i believe some common things are hard to die
if she is you will desire to have a pearl of such price found and taken care of
we desire that too that he may not by any chance be made her prey again
so far we are united in one interest and that is why i who would do her any mischief that so coarse a wretch is capable of feeling have sent for you to hear what you have heard i saw by the change in her face that someone was advancing behind me
it was mrs steerforth who gave me her hand more coldly than of yore and with an augmentation of her former stateliness of manner but still i perceivedand i was touched by itwith an ineffaceable remembrance of my old love for her son
she was greatly altered
her fine figure was far less upright her handsome face was deeply marked and her hair was almost white
but when she sat down on the seat she was a handsome lady still and well i knew the bright eye with its lofty look that had been a light in my very dreams at school
is mr copperfield informed of everything rosa yes and has he heard littimer himself yes i have told him why you wished it you are a good girl
i have had some slight correspondence with your former friend sir addressing me but it has not restored his sense of duty or natural obligation
therefore i have no other object in this than what rosa has mentioned
if by the course which may relieve the mind of the decent man you brought here for whom i am sorryi can say no more my son may be saved from again falling into the snares of a designing enemy well she drew herself up and sat looking straight before her far away
madam i said respectfully i understand
i assure you i am in no danger of putting any strained construction on your motives
but i must say even to you having known this injured family from childhood that if you suppose the girl so deeply wronged has not been cruelly deluded and would not rather die a hundred deaths than take a cup of water from your sons hand now you cherish a terrible mistake well rosa well said mrs steerforth as the other was about to interpose it is no matter
let it be
you are married sir i am told i answered that i had been some time married
and are doing well
i hear little in the quiet life i lead but i understand you are beginning to be famous i have been very fortunate i said and find my name connected with some praise you have no motherin a softened voice
no it is a pity she returned
she would have been proud of you
good night i took the hand she held out with a dignified unbending air and it was as calm in mine as if her breast had been at peace
her pride could still its very pulses it appeared and draw the placid veil before her face through which she sat looking straight before her on the far distance
as i moved away from them along the terrace i could not help observing how steadily they both sat gazing on the prospect and how it thickened and closed around them
here and there some early lamps were seen to twinkle in the distant city and in the eastern quarter of the sky the lurid light still hovered
but from the greater part of the broad valley interposed a mist was rising like a sea which mingling with the darkness made it seem as if the gathering waters would encompass them
i have reason to remember this and think of it with awe for before i looked upon those two again a stormy sea had risen to their feet
reflecting on what had been thus told me i felt it right that it should be communicated to mr peggotty
on the following evening i went into london in quest of him
he was always wandering about from place to place with his one object of recovering his niece before him but was more in london than elsewhere
often and often now had i seen him in the dead of night passing along the streets searching among the few who loitered out of doors at those untimely hours for what he dreaded to find
he kept a lodging over the little chandlers shop in hungerford market which i have had occasion to mention more than once and from which he first went forth upon his errand of mercy
hither i directed my walk
on making inquiry for him i learned from the people of the house that he had not gone out yet and i should find him in his room upstairs
he was sitting reading by a window in which he kept a few plants
the room was very neat and orderly
i saw in a moment that it was always kept prepared for her reception and that he never went out but he thought it possible he might bring her home
he had not heard my tap at the door and only raised his eyes when i laid my hand upon his shoulder
masr davy
thankee sir
thankee hearty for this visit
sit ye down
youre kindly welcome sir mr
peggotty said i taking the chair he handed me dont expect much
i have heard some news of emly he put his hand in a nervous manner on his mouth and turned pale as he fixed his eyes on mine
it gives no clue to where she is but she is not with him he sat down looking intently at me and listened in profound silence to all i had to tell
i well remember the sense of dignity beauty even with which the patient gravity of his face impressed me when having gradually removed his eyes from mine he sat looking downward leaning his forehead on his hand
he offered no interruption but remained throughout perfectly still
he seemed to pursue her figure through the narrative and to let every other shape go by him as if it were nothing
when i had done he shaded his face and continued silent
i looked out of the window for a little while and occupied myself with the plants
how do you fare to feel about it masr davy he inquired at length
i think that she is living i replied
i doent know
maybe the first shock was too rough and in the wildness of her art
that there blue water as she used to speak on
could she have thowt o that so many year because it was to be her grave he said this musing in a low frightened voice and walked across the little room
and yet he added masr davy i have felt so sure as she was livingi have knowd awake and sleeping as it was so trew that i should find heri have been so led on by it and held up by itthat i doent believe i can have been deceived
no
emlys alive he put his hand down firmly on the table and set his sunburnt face into a resolute expression
my niece emly is alive sir he said steadfastly
i doent know wheer it comes from or how tis but i am told as shes alive he looked almost like a man inspired as he said it
i waited for a few moments until he could give me his undivided attention and then proceeded to explain the precaution that it had occurred to me last night it would be wise to take
now my dear friendi began
thankee thankee kind sir he said grasping my hand in both of his
if she should make her way to london which is likelyfor where could she lose herself so readily as in this vast city and what would she wish to do but lose and hide herself if she does not go home and she wont go home he interposed shaking his head mournfully
if she had left of her own accord she might not as it was sir if she should come here said i i believe there is one person here more likely to discover her than any other in the world
do you rememberhear what i say with fortitudethink of your great objectdo you remember martha of our town i needed no other answer than his face
do you know that she is in london i have seen her in the streets he answered with a shiver
but you dont know said i that emily was charitable to her with hams help long before she fled from home
nor that when we met one night and spoke together in the room yonder over the way she listened at the door masr davy he replied in astonishment
that night when it snew so hard that night
i have never seen her since
i went back after parting from you to speak to her but she was gone
i was unwilling to mention her to you then and i am now but she is the person of whom i speak and with whom i think we should communicate
do you understand too well sir he replied
we had sunk our voices almost to a whisper and continued to speak in that tone
you say you have seen her
do you think that you could find her
i could only hope to do so by chance i think masr davy i know wheer to look it is dark
being together shall we go out now and try to find her tonight he assented and prepared to accompany me
without appearing to observe what he was doing i saw how carefully he adjusted the little room put a candle ready and the means of lighting it arranged the bed and finally took out of a drawer one of her dresses i remember to have seen her wear it neatly folded with some other garments and a bonnet which he placed upon a chair
he made no allusion to these clothes neither did i
there they had been waiting for her many and many a night no doubt
the time was masr davy he said as we came downstairs when i thowt this girl martha amost like the dirt underneath my emlys feet
god forgive me theers a difference now as we went along partly to hold him in conversation and partly to satisfy myself i asked him about ham
he said almost in the same words as formerly that ham was just the same wearing away his life with kiender no care nohow for t but never murmuring and liked by all
i asked him what he thought hams state of mind was in reference to the cause of their misfortunes
whether he believed it was dangerous
what he supposed for example ham would do if he and steerforth ever should encounter
i doent know sir he replied
i have thowt of it oftentimes but i cant awize myself of it no matters i recalled to his remembrance the morning after her departure when we were all three on the beach
do you recollect said i a certain wild way in which he looked out to sea and spoke about the end of it sure i do said he
what do you suppose he meant masr davy he replied ive put the question to myself a mort o times and never found no answer
and theers one curious thingthat though he is so pleasant i wouldnt fare to feel comfortable to try and get his mind upon t
he never said a wured to me as warnt as dootiful as dootiful could be and it aint likely as hed begin to speak any other ways now but its fur from being fleet water in his mind where them thowts lays
its deep sir and i cant see down you are right said i and that has sometimes made me anxious and me too masr davy he rejoined
even more so i do assure you than his ventersome ways though both belongs to the alteration in him
i doent know as hed do violence under any circumstances but i hope as them two may be kep asunders we had come through temple bar into the city
conversing no more now and walking at my side he yielded himself up to the one aim of his devoted life and went on with that hushed concentration of his faculties which would have made his figure solitary in a multitude
we were not far from blackfriars bridge when he turned his head and pointed to a solitary female figure flitting along the opposite side of the street
i knew it readily to be the figure that we sought
we crossed the road and were pressing on towards her when it occurred to me that she might be more disposed to feel a womans interest in the lost girl if we spoke to her in a quieter place aloof from the crowd and where we should be less observed
i advised my companion therefore that we should not address her yet but follow her consulting in this likewise an indistinct desire i had to know where she went
he acquiescing we followed at a distance never losing sight of her but never caring to come very near as she frequently looked about
once she stopped to listen to a band of music and then we stopped too
she went on a long way
still we went on
it was evident from the manner in which she held her course that she was going to some fixed destination and this and her keeping in the busy streets and i suppose the strange fascination in the secrecy and mystery of so following anyone made me adhere to my first purpose
at length she turned into a dull dark street where the noise and crowd were lost and i said we may speak to her now and mending our pace we went after her
we were now down in westminster
we had turned back to follow her having encountered her coming towards us and westminster abbey was the point at which she passed from the lights and noise of the leading streets
she proceeded so quickly when she got free of the two currents of passengers setting towards and from the bridge that between this and the advance she had of us when she struck off we were in the narrow waterside street by millbank before we came up with her
at that moment she crossed the road as if to avoid the footsteps that she heard so close behind and without looking back passed on even more rapidly
a glimpse of the river through a dull gateway where some waggons were housed for the night seemed to arrest my feet
i touched my companion without speaking and we both forbore to cross after her and both followed on that opposite side of the way keeping as quietly as we could in the shadow of the houses but keeping very near her
there was and is when i write at the end of that lowlying street a dilapidated little wooden building probably an obsolete old ferryhouse
its position is just at that point where the street ceases and the road begins to lie between a row of houses and the river
as soon as she came here and saw the water she stopped as if she had come to her destination and presently went slowly along by the brink of the river looking intently at it
all the way here i had supposed that she was going to some house indeed i had vaguely entertained the hope that the house might be in some way associated with the lost girl
but that one dark glimpse of the river through the gateway had instinctively prepared me for her going no farther
the neighbourhood was a dreary one at that time as oppressive sad and solitary by night as any about london
there were neither wharves nor houses on the melancholy waste of road near the great blank prison
a sluggish ditch deposited its mud at the prison walls
coarse grass and rank weeds straggled over all the marshy land in the vicinity
in one part carcases of houses inauspiciously begun and never finished rotted away
in another the ground was cumbered with rusty iron monsters of steamboilers wheels cranks pipes furnaces paddles anchors divingbells windmillsails and i know not what strange objects accumulated by some speculator and grovelling in the dust underneath whichhaving sunk into the soil of their own weight in wet weatherthey had the appearance of vainly trying to hide themselves
the clash and glare of sundry fiery works upon the riverside arose by night to disturb everything except the heavy and unbroken smoke that poured out of their chimneys
slimy gaps and causeways winding among old wooden piles with a sickly substance clinging to the latter like green hair and the rags of last years handbills offering rewards for drowned men fluttering above highwater mark led down through the ooze and slush to the ebbtide
there was a story that one of the pits dug for the dead in the time of the great plague was hereabout and a blighting influence seemed to have proceeded from it over the whole place
or else it looked as if it had gradually decomposed into that nightmare condition out of the overflowings of the polluted stream
as if she were a part of the refuse it had cast out and left to corruption and decay the girl we had followed strayed down to the rivers brink and stood in the midst of this nightpicture lonely and still looking at the water
there were some boats and barges astrand in the mud and these enabled us to come within a few yards of her without being seen
i then signed to mr peggotty to remain where he was and emerged from their shade to speak to her
i did not approach her solitary figure without trembling for this gloomy end to her determined walk and the way in which she stood almost within the cavernous shadow of the iron bridge looking at the lights crookedly reflected in the strong tide inspired a dread within me
i think she was talking to herself
i am sure although absorbed in gazing at the water that her shawl was off her shoulders and that she was muffling her hands in it in an unsettled and bewildered way more like the action of a sleepwalker than a waking person
i know and never can forget that there was that in her wild manner which gave me no assurance but that she would sink before my eyes until i had her arm within my grasp
at the same moment i said martha she uttered a terrified scream and struggled with me with such strength that i doubt if i could have held her alone
but a stronger hand than mine was laid upon her and when she raised her frightened eyes and saw whose it was she made but one more effort and dropped down between us
we carried her away from the water to where there were some dry stones and there laid her down crying and moaning
in a little while she sat among the stones holding her wretched head with both her hands
oh the river she cried passionately
oh the river hush hush said i
calm yourself but she still repeated the same words continually exclaiming oh the river over and over again
i know its like me she exclaimed
i know that i belong to it
i know that its the natural company of such as i am
it comes from country places where there was once no harm in itand it creeps through the dismal streets defiled and miserableand it goes away like my life to a great sea that is always troubledand i feel that i must go with it i have never known what despair was except in the tone of those words
i cant keep away from it
i cant forget it
it haunts me day and night
its the only thing in all the world that i am fit for or thats fit for me
oh the dreadful river the thought passed through my mind that in the face of my companion as he looked upon her without speech or motion i might have read his nieces history if i had known nothing of it
i never saw in any painting or reality horror and compassion so impressively blended
he shook as if he would have fallen and his handi touched it with my own for his appearance alarmed mewas deadly cold
she is in a state of frenzy i whispered to him
she will speak differently in a little time i dont know what he would have said in answer
he made some motion with his mouth and seemed to think he had spoken but he had only pointed to her with his outstretched hand
a new burst of crying came upon her now in which she once more hid her face among the stones and lay before us a prostrate image of humiliation and ruin
knowing that this state must pass before we could speak to her with any hope i ventured to restrain him when he would have raised her and we stood by in silence until she became more tranquil
martha said i then leaning down and helping her to riseshe seemed to want to rise as if with the intention of going away but she was weak and leaned against a boat
do you know who this is who is with me she said faintly yes do you know that we have followed you a long way tonight she shook her head
she looked neither at him nor at me but stood in a humble attitude holding her bonnet and shawl in one hand without appearing conscious of them and pressing the other clenched against her forehead
are you composed enough said i to speak on the subject which so interested youi hope heaven may remember itthat snowy night her sobs broke out afresh and she murmured some inarticulate thanks to me for not having driven her away from the door
i want to say nothing for myself she said after a few moments
i am bad i am lost
i have no hope at all
but tell him sir she had shrunk away from him if you dont feel too hard to me to do it that i never was in any way the cause of his misfortune it has never been attributed to you i returned earnestly responding to her earnestness
it was you if i dont deceive myself she said in a broken voice that came into the kitchen the night she took such pity on me was so gentle to me didnt shrink away from me like all the rest and gave me such kind help
was it you sir it was said i
i should have been in the river long ago she said glancing at it with a terrible expression if any wrong to her had been upon my mind
i never could have kept out of it a single winters night if i had not been free of any share in that the cause of her flight is too well understood i said
you are innocent of any part in it we thoroughly believewe know oh i might have been much the better for her if i had had a better heart exclaimed the girl with most forlorn regret for she was always good to me
she never spoke a word to me but what was pleasant and right
is it likely i would try to make her what i am myself knowing what i am myself so well
when i lost everything that makes life dear the worst of all my thoughts was that i was parted for ever from her mr peggotty standing with one hand on the gunwale of the boat and his eyes cast down put his disengaged hand before his face
and when i heard what had happened before that snowy night from some belonging to our town cried martha the bitterest thought in all my mind was that the people would remember she once kept company with me and would say i had corrupted her
when heaven knows i would have died to have brought back her good name long unused to any selfcontrol the piercing agony of her remorse and grief was terrible
to have died would not have been muchwhat can i sayi would have lived she cried
i would have lived to be old in the wretched streetsand to wander about avoided in the darkand to see the day break on the ghastly line of houses and remember how the same sun used to shine into my room and wake me oncei would have done even that to save her sinking on the stones she took some in each hand and clenched them up as if she would have ground them
she writhed into some new posture constantly stiffening her arms twisting them before her face as though to shut out from her eyes the little light there was and drooping her head as if it were heavy with insupportable recollections
what shall i ever do she said fighting thus with her despair
how can i go on as i am a solitary curse to myself a living disgrace to everyone i come near suddenly she turned to my companion
stamp upon me kill me
when she was your pride you would have thought i had done her harm if i had brushed against her in the street
you cant believewhy should youa syllable that comes out of my lips
it would be a burning shame upon you even now if she and i exchanged a word
i dont complain
i dont say she and i are alikei know there is a long long way between us
i only say with all my guilt and wretchedness upon my head that i am grateful to her from my soul and love her
oh dont think that all the power i had of loving anything is quite worn out
throw me away as all the world does
kill me for being what i am and having ever known her but dont think that of me he looked upon her while she made this supplication in a wild distracted manner and when she was silent gently raised her
martha said mr peggotty god forbid as i should judge you
forbid as i of all men should do that my girl
you doent know half the change thats come in course of time upon me when you think it likely
well he paused a moment then went on
you doent understand how tis that this here gentleman and me has wished to speak to you
you doent understand what tis we has afore us
listen now his influence upon her was complete
she stood shrinkingly before him as if she were afraid to meet his eyes but her passionate sorrow was quite hushed and mute
if you heerd said mr peggotty owt of what passed between masr davy and me th night when it snew so hard you know as i have beenwheer notfur to seek my dear niece
my dear niece he repeated steadily
fur shes more dear to me now martha than she was dear afore she put her hands before her face but otherwise remained quiet
i have heerd her tell said mr peggotty as you was early left fatherless and motherless with no friend fur to take in a rough seafaringway their place
maybe you can guess that if youd had such a friend youd have got into a way of being fond of him in course of time and that my niece was kiender daughterlike to me as she was silently trembling he put her shawl carefully about her taking it up from the ground for that purpose
whereby said he i know both as she would go to the wurelds furdest end with me if she could once see me again and that she would fly to the wurelds furdest end to keep off seeing me
for though she aint no call to doubt my love and doentand doent he repeated with a quiet assurance of the truth of what he said theres shame steps in and keeps betwixt us i read in every word of his plain impressive way of delivering himself new evidence of his having thought of this one topic in every feature it presented
according to our reckoning he proceeded masr davys here and mine she is like one day to make her own poor solitary course to london
we believemasr davy me and all of usthat you are as innocent of everything that has befell her as the unborn child
youve spoke of her being pleasant kind and gentle to you
bless her i knew she was
i knew she always was to all
youre thankful to her and you love her
help us all you can to find her and may heaven reward you she looked at him hastily and for the first time as if she were doubtful of what he had said
will you trust me she asked in a low voice of astonishment
full and free said mr peggotty
to speak to her if i should ever find her shelter her if i have any shelter to divide with her and then without her knowledge come to you and bring you to her she asked hurriedly
we both replied together yes she lifted up her eyes and solemnly declared that she would devote herself to this task fervently and faithfully
that she would never waver in it never be diverted from it never relinquish it while there was any chance of hope
if she were not true to it might the object she now had in life which bound her to something devoid of evil in its passing away from her leave her more forlorn and more despairing if that were possible than she had been upon the rivers brink that night and then might all help human and divine renounce her evermore
she did not raise her voice above her breath or address us but said this to the night sky then stood profoundly quiet looking at the gloomy water
we judged it expedient now to tell her all we knew which i recounted at length
she listened with great attention and with a face that often changed but had the same purpose in all its varying expressions
her eyes occasionally filled with tears but those she repressed
it seemed as if her spirit were quite altered and she could not be too quiet
she asked when all was told where we were to be communicated with if occasion should arise
under a dull lamp in the road i wrote our two addresses on a leaf of my pocketbook which i tore out and gave to her and which she put in her poor bosom
i asked her where she lived herself
she said after a pause in no place long
it were better not to know
mr peggotty suggesting to me in a whisper what had already occurred to myself i took out my purse but i could not prevail upon her to accept any money nor could i exact any promise from her that she would do so at another time
i represented to her that mr peggotty could not be called for one in his condition poor and that the idea of her engaging in this search while depending on her own resources shocked us both
she continued steadfast
in this particular his influence upon her was equally powerless with mine
she gratefully thanked him but remained inexorable
there may be work to be got she said
ill try at least take some assistance i returned until you have tried i could not do what i have promised for money she replied
i could not take it if i was starving
to give me money would be to take away your trust to take away the object that you have given me to take away the only certain thing that saves me from the river in the name of the great judge said i before whom you and all of us must stand at his dread time dismiss that terrible idea
we can all do some good if we will she trembled and her lip shook and her face was paler as she answered it has been put into your hearts perhaps to save a wretched creature for repentance
i am afraid to think so it seems too bold
if any good should come of me i might begin to hope for nothing but harm has ever come of my deeds yet
i am to be trusted for the first time in a long while with my miserable life on account of what you have given me to try for
i know no more and i can say no more again she repressed the tears that had begun to flow and putting out her trembling hand and touching mr peggotty as if there was some healing virtue in him went away along the desolate road
she had been ill probably for a long time
i observed upon that closer opportunity of observation that she was worn and haggard and that her sunken eyes expressed privation and endurance
we followed her at a short distance our way lying in the same direction until we came back into the lighted and populous streets
i had such implicit confidence in her declaration that i then put it to mr peggotty whether it would not seem in the onset like distrusting her to follow her any farther
he being of the same mind and equally reliant on her we suffered her to take her own road and took ours which was towards highgate
he accompanied me a good part of the way and when we parted with a prayer for the success of this fresh effort there was a new and thoughtful compassion in him that i was at no loss to interpret
it was midnight when i arrived at home
i had reached my own gate and was standing listening for the deep bell of st pauls the sound of which i thought had been borne towards me among the multitude of striking clocks when i was rather surprised to see that the door of my aunts cottage was open and that a faint light in the entry was shining out across the road
thinking that my aunt might have relapsed into one of her old alarms and might be watching the progress of some imaginary conflagration in the distance i went to speak to her
it was with very great surprise that i saw a man standing in her little garden
he had a glass and bottle in his hand and was in the act of drinking
i stopped short among the thick foliage outside for the moon was up now though obscured and i recognized the man whom i had once supposed to be a delusion of mr dicks and had once encountered with my aunt in the streets of the city
he was eating as well as drinking and seemed to eat with a hungry appetite
he seemed curious regarding the cottage too as if it were the first time he had seen it
after stooping to put the bottle on the ground he looked up at the windows and looked about though with a covert and impatient air as if he was anxious to be gone
the light in the passage was obscured for a moment and my aunt came out
she was agitated and told some money into his hand
i heard it chink
whats the use of this he demanded
i can spare no more returned my aunt
then i cant go said he
here
you may take it back you bad man returned my aunt with great emotion how can you use me so
but why do i ask
it is because you know how weak i am
what have i to do to free myself for ever of your visits but to abandon you to your deserts and why dont you abandon me to my deserts said he
you ask me why returned my aunt
what a heart you must have he stood moodily rattling the money and shaking his head until at length he said is this all you mean to give me then it is all i can give you said my aunt
you know i have had losses and am poorer than i used to be
i have told you so
having got it why do you give me the pain of looking at you for another moment and seeing what you have become i have become shabby enough if you mean that he said
i lead the life of an owl you stripped me of the greater part of all i ever had said my aunt
you closed my heart against the whole world years and years
you treated me falsely ungratefully and cruelly
go and repent of it
dont add new injuries to the long long list of injuries you have done me aye he returned
its all very finewell
i must do the best i can for the present i suppose in spite of himself he appeared abashed by my aunts indignant tears and came slouching out of the garden
taking two or three quick steps as if i had just come up i met him at the gate and went in as he came out
we eyed one another narrowly in passing and with no favour
aunt said i hurriedly
this man alarming you again
let me speak to him
who is he child returned my aunt taking my arm come in and dont speak to me for ten minutes we sat down in her little parlour
my aunt retired behind the round green fan of former days which was screwed on the back of a chair and occasionally wiped her eyes for about a quarter of an hour
then she came out and took a seat beside me
trot said my aunt calmly its my husband your husband aunt
i thought he had been dead dead to me returned my aunt but living i sat in silent amazement
betsey trotwood dont look a likely subject for the tender passion said my aunt composedly but the time was trot when she believed in that man most entirely
when she loved him trot right well
when there was no proof of attachment and affection that she would not have given him
he repaid her by breaking her fortune and nearly breaking her heart
so she put all that sort of sentiment once and for ever in a grave and filled it up and flattened it down my dear good aunt i left him my aunt proceeded laying her hand as usual on the back of mine generously
i may say at this distance of time trot that i left him generously
he had been so cruel to me that i might have effected a separation on easy terms for myself but i did not
he soon made ducks and drakes of what i gave him sank lower and lower married another woman i believe became an adventurer a gambler and a cheat
what he is now you see
but he was a finelooking man when i married him said my aunt with an echo of her old pride and admiration in her tone and i believed himi was a foolto be the soul of honour she gave my hand a squeeze and shook her head
he is nothing to me now trotless than nothing
but sooner than have him punished for his offences as he would be if he prowled about in this country i give him more money than i can afford at intervals when he reappears to go away
i was a fool when i married him and i am so far an incurable fool on that subject that for the sake of what i once believed him to be i wouldnt have even this shadow of my idle fancy hardly dealt with
for i was in earnest trot if ever a woman was my aunt dismissed the matter with a heavy sigh and smoothed her dress
there my dear she said
now you know the beginning middle and end and all about it
we wont mention the subject to one another any more neither of course will you mention it to anybody else
this is my grumpy frumpy story and well keep it to ourselves trot i laboured hard at my book without allowing it to interfere with the punctual discharge of my newspaper duties and it came out and was very successful
i was not stunned by the praise which sounded in my ears notwithstanding that i was keenly alive to it and thought better of my own performance i have little doubt than anybody else did
it has always been in my observation of human nature that a man who has any good reason to believe in himself never flourishes himself before the faces of other people in order that they may believe in him
for this reason i retained my modesty in very selfrespect and the more praise i got the more i tried to deserve
it is not my purpose in this record though in all other essentials it is my written memory to pursue the history of my own fictions
they express themselves and i leave them to themselves
when i refer to them incidentally it is only as a part of my progress
having some foundation for believing by this time that nature and accident had made me an author i pursued my vocation with confidence
without such assurance i should certainly have left it alone and bestowed my energy on some other endeavour
i should have tried to find out what nature and accident really had made me and to be that and nothing else
i had been writing in the newspaper and elsewhere so prosperously that when my new success was achieved i considered myself reasonably entitled to escape from the dreary debates
one joyful night therefore i noted down the music of the parliamentary bagpipes for the last time and i have never heard it since though i still recognize the old drone in the newspapers without any substantial variation except perhaps that there is more of it all the livelong session
i now write of the time when i had been married i suppose about a year and a half
after several varieties of experiment we had given up the housekeeping as a bad job
the house kept itself and we kept a page
the principal function of this retainer was to quarrel with the cook in which respect he was a perfect whittington without his cat or the remotest chance of being made lord mayor
he appears to me to have lived in a hail of saucepanlids
his whole existence was a scuffle
he would shriek for help on the most improper occasionsas when we had a little dinnerparty or a few friends in the eveningand would come tumbling out of the kitchen with iron missiles flying after him
we wanted to get rid of him but he was very much attached to us and wouldnt go
he was a tearful boy and broke into such deplorable lamentations when a cessation of our connexion was hinted at that we were obliged to keep him
he had no motherno anything in the way of a relative that i could discover except a sister who fled to america the moment we had taken him off her hands and he became quartered on us like a horrible young changeling
he had a lively perception of his own unfortunate state and was always rubbing his eyes with the sleeve of his jacket or stooping to blow his nose on the extreme corner of a little pockethandkerchief which he never would take completely out of his pocket but always economized and secreted
this unlucky page engaged in an evil hour at six pounds ten per annum was a source of continual trouble to me
i watched him as he grewand he grew like scarlet beanswith painful apprehensions of the time when he would begin to shave even of the days when he would be bald or grey
i saw no prospect of ever getting rid of him and projecting myself into the future used to think what an inconvenience he would be when he was an old man
i never expected anything less than this unfortunates manner of getting me out of my difficulty
he stole doras watch which like everything else belonging to us had no particular place of its own and converting it into money spent the produce he was always a weakminded boy in incessantly riding up and down between london and uxbridge outside the coach
he was taken to bow street as well as i remember on the completion of his fifteenth journey when fourandsixpence and a secondhand fife which he couldnt play were found upon his person
the surprise and its consequences would have been much less disagreeable to me if he had not been penitent
but he was very penitent indeed and in a peculiar waynot in the lump but by instalments
for example the day after that on which i was obliged to appear against him he made certain revelations touching a hamper in the cellar which we believed to be full of wine but which had nothing in it except bottles and corks
we supposed he had now eased his mind and told the worst he knew of the cook but a day or two afterwards his conscience sustained a new twinge and he disclosed how she had a little girl who early every morning took away our bread and also how he himself had been suborned to maintain the milkman in coals
in two or three days more i was informed by the authorities of his having led to the discovery of sirloins of beef among the kitchenstuff and sheets in the ragbag
a little while afterwards he broke out in an entirely new direction and confessed to a knowledge of burglarious intentions as to our premises on the part of the potboy who was immediately taken up
i got to be so ashamed of being such a victim that i would have given him any money to hold his tongue or would have offered a round bribe for his being permitted to run away
it was an aggravating circumstance in the case that he had no idea of this but conceived that he was making me amends in every new discovery not to say heaping obligations on my head
at last i ran away myself whenever i saw an emissary of the police approaching with some new intelligence and lived a stealthy life until he was tried and ordered to be transported
even then he couldnt be quiet but was always writing us letters and wanted so much to see dora before he went away that dora went to visit him and fainted when she found herself inside the iron bars
in short i had no peace of my life until he was expatriated and made as i afterwards heard a shepherd of up the country somewhere i have no geographical idea where
all this led me into some serious reflections and presented our mistakes in a new aspect as i could not help communicating to dora one evening in spite of my tenderness for her
my love said i it is very painful to me to think that our want of system and management involves not only ourselves which we have got used to but other people you have been silent for a long time and now you are going to be cross said dora
no my dear indeed
let me explain to you what i mean i think i dont want to know said dora
but i want you to know my love
put jip down dora put his nose to mine and said boh to drive my seriousness away but not succeeding ordered him into his pagoda and sat looking at me with her hands folded and a most resigned little expression of countenance
the fact is my dear i began there is contagion in us
we infect everyone about us i might have gone on in this figurative manner if doras face had not admonished me that she was wondering with all her might whether i was going to propose any new kind of vaccination or other medical remedy for this unwholesome state of ours
therefore i checked myself and made my meaning plainer
it is not merely my pet said i that we lose money and comfort and even temper sometimes by not learning to be more careful but that we incur the serious responsibility of spoiling everyone who comes into our service or has any dealings with us
i begin to be afraid that the fault is not entirely on one side but that these people all turn out ill because we dont turn out very well ourselves oh what an accusation exclaimed dora opening her eyes wide to say that you ever saw me take gold watches
oh my dearest i remonstrated dont talk preposterous nonsense
who has made the least allusion to gold watches you did returned dora
you know you did
you said i hadnt turned out well and compared me to him to whom i asked
to the page sobbed dora
oh you cruel fellow to compare your affectionate wife to a transported page
why didnt you tell me your opinion of me before we were married
why didnt you say you hardhearted thing that you were convinced i was worse than a transported page
oh what a dreadful opinion to have of me
oh my goodness now dora my love i returned gently trying to remove the handkerchief she pressed to her eyes this is not only very ridiculous of you but very wrong
in the first place its not true you always said he was a storyteller sobbed dora
and now you say the same of me
oh what shall i do
what shall i do my darling girl i retorted i really must entreat you to be reasonable and listen to what i did say and do say
my dear dora unless we learn to do our duty to those whom we employ they will never learn to do their duty to us
i am afraid we present opportunities to people to do wrong that never ought to be presented
even if we were as lax as we are in all our arrangements by choicewhich we are noteven if we liked it and found it agreeable to be sowhich we donti am persuaded we should have no right to go on in this way
we are positively corrupting people
we are bound to think of that
i cant help thinking of it dora
it is a reflection i am unable to dismiss and it sometimes makes me very uneasy
there dear thats all
come now
dont be foolish dora would not allow me for a long time to remove the handkerchief
she sat sobbing and murmuring behind it that if i was uneasy why had i ever been married
why hadnt i said even the day before we went to church that i knew i should be uneasy and i would rather not
if i couldnt bear her why didnt i send her away to her aunts at putney or to julia mills in india
julia would be glad to see her and would not call her a transported page julia never had called her anything of the sort
in short dora was so afflicted and so afflicted me by being in that condition that i felt it was of no use repeating this kind of effort though never so mildly and i must take some other course
what other course was left to take
to form her mind
this was a common phrase of words which had a fair and promising sound and i resolved to form doras mind
i began immediately
when dora was very childish and i would have infinitely preferred to humour her i tried to be graveand disconcerted her and myself too
i talked to her on the subjects which occupied my thoughts and i read shakespeare to herand fatigued her to the last degree
i accustomed myself to giving her as it were quite casually little scraps of useful information or sound opinionand she started from them when i let them off as if they had been crackers
no matter how incidentally or naturally i endeavoured to form my little wifes mind i could not help seeing that she always had an instinctive perception of what i was about and became a prey to the keenest apprehensions
in particular it was clear to me that she thought shakespeare a terrible fellow
the formation went on very slowly
i pressed traddles into the service without his knowledge and whenever he came to see us exploded my mines upon him for the edification of dora at second hand
the amount of practical wisdom i bestowed upon traddles in this manner was immense and of the best quality but it had no other effect upon dora than to depress her spirits and make her always nervous with the dread that it would be her turn next
i found myself in the condition of a schoolmaster a trap a pitfall of always playing spider to doras fly and always pouncing out of my hole to her infinite disturbance
still looking forward through this intermediate stage to the time when there should be a perfect sympathy between dora and me and when i should have formed her mind to my entire satisfaction i persevered even for months
finding at last however that although i had been all this time a very porcupine or hedgehog bristling all over with determination i had effected nothing it began to occur to me that perhaps doras mind was already formed
on further consideration this appeared so likely that i abandoned my scheme which had had a more promising appearance in words than in action resolving henceforth to be satisfied with my childwife and to try to change her into nothing else by any process
i was heartily tired of being sagacious and prudent by myself and of seeing my darling under restraint so i bought a pretty pair of earrings for her and a collar for jip and went home one day to make myself agreeable
dora was delighted with the little presents and kissed me joyfully but there was a shadow between us however slight and i had made up my mind that it should not be there
if there must be such a shadow anywhere i would keep it for the future in my own breast
i sat down by my wife on the sofa and put the earrings in her ears and then i told her that i feared we had not been quite as good company lately as we used to be and that the fault was mine
which i sincerely felt and which indeed it was
the truth is dora my life i said i have been trying to be wise and to make me wise too said dora timidly
havent you doady i nodded assent to the pretty inquiry of the raised eyebrows and kissed the parted lips
its of not a bit of use said dora shaking her head until the earrings rang again
you know what a little thing i am and what i wanted you to call me from the first
if you cant do so i am afraid youll never like me
are you sure you dont think sometimes it would have been better to have done what my dear for she made no effort to proceed
nothing said dora
nothing i repeated
she put her arms round my neck and laughed and called herself by her favourite name of a goose and hid her face on my shoulder in such a profusion of curls that it was quite a task to clear them away and see it
dont i think it would have been better to have done nothing than to have tried to form my little wifes mind said i laughing at myself
is that the question
yes indeed i do is that what you have been trying cried dora
oh what a shocking boy but i shall never try any more said i
for i love her dearly as she is without a storyreally inquired dora creeping closer to me
why should i seek to change said i what has been so precious to me for so long
you never can show better than as your own natural self my sweet dora and well try no conceited experiments but go back to our old way and be happy and be happy returned dora
yes
all day
and you wont mind things going a tiny morsel wrong sometimes no no said i
we must do the best we can and you wont tell me any more that we make other people bad coaxed dora will you
because you know its so dreadfully cross no no said i
its better for me to be stupid than uncomfortable isnt it said dora
better to be naturally dora than anything else in the world in the world
ah doady its a large place she shook her head turned her delighted bright eyes up to mine kissed me broke into a merry laugh and sprang away to put on jips new collar
so ended my last attempt to make any change in dora
i had been unhappy in trying it i could not endure my own solitary wisdom i could not reconcile it with her former appeal to me as my childwife
i resolved to do what i could in a quiet way to improve our proceedings myself but i foresaw that my utmost would be very little or i must degenerate into the spider again and be for ever lying in wait
and the shadow i have mentioned that was not to be between us any more but was to rest wholly on my own heart
how did that fall
the old unhappy feeling pervaded my life
it was deepened if it were changed at all but it was as undefined as ever and addressed me like a strain of sorrowful music faintly heard in the night
i loved my wife dearly and i was happy but the happiness i had vaguely anticipated once was not the happiness i enjoyed and there was always something wanting
in fulfilment of the compact i have made with myself to reflect my mind on this paper i again examine it closely and bring its secrets to the light
what i missed i still regardedi always regardedas something that had been a dream of my youthful fancy that was incapable of realization that i was now discovering to be so with some natural pain as all men did
but that it would have been better for me if my wife could have helped me more and shared the many thoughts in which i had no partner and that this might have been i knew
between these two irreconcilable conclusions the one that what i felt was general and unavoidable the other that it was particular to me and might have been different i balanced curiously with no distinct sense of their opposition to each other
when i thought of the airy dreams of youth that are incapable of realization i thought of the better state preceding manhood that i had outgrown and then the contented days with agnes in the dear old house arose before me like spectres of the dead that might have some renewal in another world but never more could be reanimated here
sometimes the speculation came into my thoughts what might have happened or what would have happened if dora and i had never known each other
but she was so incorporated with my existence that it was the idlest of all fancies and would soon rise out of my reach and sight like gossamer floating in the air
i always loved her
what i am describing slumbered and half awoke and slept again in the innermost recesses of my mind
there was no evidence of it in me i know of no influence it had in anything i said or did
i bore the weight of all our little cares and all my projects dora held the pens and we both felt that our shares were adjusted as the case required
she was truly fond of me and proud of me and when agnes wrote a few earnest words in her letters to dora of the pride and interest with which my old friends heard of my growing reputation and read my book as if they heard me speaking its contents dora read them out to me with tears of joy in her bright eyes and said i was a dear old clever famous boy
the first mistaken impulse of an undisciplined heart those words of mrs strongs were constantly recurring to me at this time were almost always present to my mind
i awoke with them often in the night i remember to have even read them in dreams inscribed upon the walls of houses
for i knew now that my own heart was undisciplined when it first loved dora and that if it had been disciplined it never could have felt when we were married what it had felt in its secret experience
there can be no disparity in marriage like unsuitability of mind and purpose those words i remembered too
i had endeavoured to adapt dora to myself and found it impracticable
it remained for me to adapt myself to dora to share with her what i could and be happy to bear on my own shoulders what i must and be happy still
this was the discipline to which i tried to bring my heart when i began to think
it made my second year much happier than my first and what was better still made doras life all sunshine
but as that year wore on dora was not strong
i had hoped that lighter hands than mine would help to mould her character and that a babysmile upon her breast might change my childwife to a woman
it was not to be
the spirit fluttered for a moment on the threshold of its little prison and unconscious of captivity took wing
when i can run about again as i used to do aunt said dora i shall make jip race
he is getting quite slow and lazy i suspect my dear said my aunt quietly working by her side he has a worse disorder than that
age dora do you think he is old said dora astonished
oh how strange it seems that jip should be old its a complaint we are all liable to little one as we get on in life said my aunt cheerfully i dont feel more free from it than i used to be i assure you but jip said dora looking at him with compassion even little jip
oh poor fellow i dare say hell last a long time yet blossom said my aunt patting dora on the cheek as she leaned out of her couch to look at jip who responded by standing on his hind legs and baulking himself in various asthmatic attempts to scramble up by the head and shoulders
he must have a piece of flannel in his house this winter and i shouldnt wonder if he came out quite fresh again with the flowers in the spring
bless the little dog exclaimed my aunt if he had as many lives as a cat and was on the point of losing em all hed bark at me with his last breath i believe dora had helped him up on the sofa where he really was defying my aunt to such a furious extent that he couldnt keep straight but barked himself sideways
the more my aunt looked at him the more he reproached her for she had lately taken to spectacles and for some inscrutable reason he considered the glasses personal
dora made him lie down by her with a good deal of persuasion and when he was quiet drew one of his long ears through and through her hand repeating thoughtfully even little jip
oh poor fellow his lungs are good enough said my aunt gaily and his dislikes are not at all feeble
he has a good many years before him no doubt
but if you want a dog to race with little blossom he has lived too well for that and ill give you one thank you aunt said dora faintly
but dont please no said my aunt taking off her spectacles
i couldnt have any other dog but jip said dora
it would be so unkind to jip
besides i couldnt be such friends with any other dog but jip because he wouldnt have known me before i was married and wouldnt have barked at doady when he first came to our house
i couldnt care for any other dog but jip i am afraid aunt to be sure said my aunt patting her cheek again
you are right you are not offended said dora
are you why what a sensitive pet it is cried my aunt bending over her affectionately
to think that i could be offended no no i didnt really think so returned dora but i am a little tired and it made me silly for a momenti am always a silly little thing you know but it made me more sillyto talk about jip
he has known me in all that has happened to me havent you jip
and i couldnt bear to slight him because he was a little alteredcould i jip jip nestled closer to his mistress and lazily licked her hand
you are not so old jip are you that youll leave your mistress yet said dora
we may keep one another company a little longer my pretty dora
when she came down to dinner on the ensuing sunday and was so glad to see old traddles who always dined with us on sunday we thought she would be running about as she used to do in a few days
but they said wait a few days more and then wait a few days more and still she neither ran nor walked
she looked very pretty and was very merry but the little feet that used to be so nimble when they danced round jip were dull and motionless
i began to carry her downstairs every morning and upstairs every night
she would clasp me round the neck and laugh the while as if i did it for a wager
jip would bark and caper round us and go on before and look back on the landing breathing short to see that we were coming
my aunt the best and most cheerful of nurses would trudge after us a moving mass of shawls and pillows
mr dick would not have relinquished his post of candlebearer to anyone alive
traddles would be often at the bottom of the staircase looking on and taking charge of sportive messages from dora to the dearest girl in the world
we made quite a gay procession of it and my childwife was the gayest there
but sometimes when i took her up and felt that she was lighter in my arms a dead blank feeling came upon me as if i were approaching to some frozen region yet unseen that numbed my life
i avoided the recognition of this feeling by any name or by any communing with myself until one night when it was very strong upon me and my aunt had left her with a parting cry of good night little blossom i sat down at my desk alone and tried to think oh what a fatal name it was and how the blossom withered in its bloom upon the tree
i received one morning by the post the following letter dated canterbury and addressed to me at doctors commons which i read with some surprise my dear sir circumstances beyond my individual control have for a considerable lapse of time effected a severance of that intimacy which in the limited opportunities conceded to me in the midst of my professional duties of contemplating the scenes and events of the past tinged by the prismatic hues of memory has ever afforded me as it ever must continue to afford gratifying emotions of no common description
this fact my dear sir combined with the distinguished elevation to which your talents have raised you deters me from presuming to aspire to the liberty of addressing the companion of my youth by the familiar appellation of copperfield
it is sufficient to know that the name to which i do myself the honour to refer will ever be treasured among the muniments of our house i allude to the archives connected with our former lodgers preserved by mrs micawber with sentiments of personal esteem amounting to affection
it is not for one situated through his original errors and a fortuitous combination of unpropitious events as is the foundered bark if he may be allowed to assume so maritime a denomination who now takes up the pen to address youit is not i repeat for one so circumstanced to adopt the language of compliment or of congratulation
that he leaves to abler and to purer hands
if your more important avocations should admit of your ever tracing these imperfect characters thus farwhich may be or may not be as circumstances ariseyou will naturally inquire by what object am i influenced then in inditing the present missive
allow me to say that i fully defer to the reasonable character of that inquiry and proceed to develop it premising that it is not an object of a pecuniary nature
without more directly referring to any latent ability that may possibly exist on my part of wielding the thunderbolt or directing the devouring and avenging flame in any quarter i may be permitted to observe in passing that my brightest visions are for ever dispelledthat my peace is shattered and my power of enjoyment destroyedthat my heart is no longer in the right placeand that i no more walk erect before my fellow man
the canker is in the flower
the cup is bitter to the brim
the worm is at his work and will soon dispose of his victim
the sooner the better
but i will not digress
placed in a mental position of peculiar painfulness beyond the assuaging reach even of mrs micawbers influence though exercised in the tripartite character of woman wife and mother it is my intention to fly from myself for a short period and devote a respite of eightandforty hours to revisiting some metropolitan scenes of past enjoyment
among other havens of domestic tranquillity and peace of mind my feet will naturally tend towards the kings bench prison
in stating that i shall be d v on the outside of the south wall of that place of incarceration on civil process the day after tomorrow at seven in the evening precisely my object in this epistolary communication is accomplished
i do not feel warranted in soliciting my former friend mr copperfield or my former friend mr thomas traddles of the inner temple if that gentleman is still existent and forthcoming to condescend to meet me and renew so far as may be our past relations of the olden time
i confine myself to throwing out the observation that at the hour and place i have indicated may be found such ruined vestiges as yet remain of a fallen tower wilkins micawber
ps
it may be advisable to superadd to the above the statement that mrs micawber is not in confidential possession of my intentions i read the letter over several times
making due allowance for mr micawbers lofty style of composition and for the extraordinary relish with which he sat down and wrote long letters on all possible and impossible occasions i still believed that something important lay hidden at the bottom of this roundabout communication
i put it down to think about it and took it up again to read it once more and was still pursuing it when traddles found me in the height of my perplexity
my dear fellow said i i never was better pleased to see you
you come to give me the benefit of your sober judgement at a most opportune time
i have received a very singular letter traddles from mr micawber no cried traddles
you dont say so
and i have received one from mrs micawber with that traddles who was flushed with walking and whose hair under the combined effects of exercise and excitement stood on end as if he saw a cheerful ghost produced his letter and made an exchange with me
i watched him into the heart of mr micawbers letter and returned the elevation of eyebrows with which he said wielding the thunderbolt or directing the devouring and avenging flame bless me copperfieldand then entered on the perusal of mrs micawbers epistle
it ran thus my best regards to mr thomas traddles and if he should still remember one who formerly had the happiness of being well acquainted with him may i beg a few moments of his leisure time
i assure mr t t that i would not intrude upon his kindness were i in any other position than on the confines of distraction
though harrowing to myself to mention the alienation of mr micawber formerly so domesticated from his wife and family is the cause of my addressing my unhappy appeal to mr traddles and soliciting his best indulgence
mr t can form no adequate idea of the change in mr micawbers conduct of his wildness of his violence
it has gradually augmented until it assumes the appearance of aberration of intellect
scarcely a day passes i assure mr traddles on which some paroxysm does not take place
mr t will not require me to depict my feelings when i inform him that i have become accustomed to hear mr micawber assert that he has sold himself to the d mystery and secrecy have long been his principal characteristic have long replaced unlimited confidence
the slightest provocation even being asked if there is anything he would prefer for dinner causes him to express a wish for a separation
last night on being childishly solicited for twopence to buy lemonstunnersa local sweetmeathe presented an oysterknife at the twins
i entreat mr traddles to bear with me in entering into these details
without them mr t would indeed find it difficult to form the faintest conception of my heartrending situation
may i now venture to confide to mr t the purport of my letter
will he now allow me to throw myself on his friendly consideration
oh yes for i know his heart
the quick eye of affection is not easily blinded when of the female sex
mr micawber is going to london
though he studiously concealed his hand this morning before breakfast in writing the directioncard which he attached to the little brown valise of happier days the eagleglance of matrimonial anxiety detected d o n distinctly traced
the westend destination of the coach is the golden cross
dare i fervently implore mr t to see my misguided husband and to reason with him
dare i ask mr t to endeavour to step in between mr micawber and his agonized family
oh no for that would be too much
if mr copperfield should yet remember one unknown to fame will mr t take charge of my unalterable regards and similar entreaties
in any case he will have the benevolence to consider this communication strictly private and on no account whatever to be alluded to however distantly in the presence of mr micawber
if mr t should ever reply to it which i cannot but feel to be most improbable a letter addressed to m e post office canterbury will be fraught with less painful consequences than any addressed immediately to one who subscribes herself in extreme distress mr
thomas traddless respectful friend and suppliant emma micawber what do you think of that letter said traddles casting his eyes upon me when i had read it twice
what do you think of the other said i
for he was still reading it with knitted brows
i think that the two together copperfield replied traddles mean more than mr and mrs micawber usually mean in their correspondencebut i dont know what
they are both written in good faith i have no doubt and without any collusion
poor thing he was now alluding to mrs micawbers letter and we were standing side by side comparing the two it will be a charity to write to her at all events and tell her that we will not fail to see mr micawber i acceded to this the more readily because i now reproached myself with having treated her former letter rather lightly
it had set me thinking a good deal at the time as i have mentioned in its place but my absorption in my own affairs my experience of the family and my hearing nothing more had gradually ended in my dismissing the subject
i had often thought of the micawbers but chiefly to wonder what pecuniary liabilities they were establishing in canterbury and to recall how shy mr micawber was of me when he became clerk to uriah heep
however i now wrote a comforting letter to mrs micawber in our joint names and we both signed it
as we walked into town to post it traddles and i held a long conference and launched into a number of speculations which i need not repeat
we took my aunt into our counsels in the afternoon but our only decided conclusion was that we would be very punctual in keeping mr micawbers appointment
although we appeared at the stipulated place a quarter of an hour before the time we found mr micawber already there
he was standing with his arms folded over against the wall looking at the spikes on the top with a sentimental expression as if they were the interlacing boughs of trees that had shaded him in his youth
when we accosted him his manner was something more confused and something less genteel than of yore
he had relinquished his legal suit of black for the purposes of this excursion and wore the old surtout and tights but not quite with the old air
he gradually picked up more and more of it as we conversed with him but his very eyeglass seemed to hang less easily and his shirtcollar though still of the old formidable dimensions rather drooped
gentlemen said mr micawber after the first salutations you are friends in need and friends indeed
allow me to offer my inquiries with reference to the physical welfare of mrs copperfield in esse and mrs traddles in possepresuming that is to say that my friend mr traddles is not yet united to the object of his affections for weal and for woe we acknowledged his politeness and made suitable replies
he then directed our attention to the wall and was beginning i assure you gentlemen when i ventured to object to that ceremonious form of address and to beg that he would speak to us in the old way
my dear copperfield he returned pressing my hand your cordiality overpowers me
this reception of a shattered fragment of the temple once called manif i may be permitted so to express myselfbespeaks a heart that is an honour to our common nature
i was about to observe that i again behold the serene spot where some of the happiest hours of my existence fleeted by made so i am sure by mrs micawber said i
i hope she is well thank you returned mr micawber whose face clouded at this reference she is but soso
and this said mr micawber nodding his head sorrowfully is the bench
where for the first time in many revolving years the overwhelming pressure of pecuniary liabilities was not proclaimed from day to day by importune voices declining to vacate the passage where there was no knocker on the door for any creditor to appeal to where personal service of process was not required and detainees were merely lodged at the gate
gentlemen said mr micawber when the shadow of that ironwork on the summit of the brick structure has been reflected on the gravel of the parade i have seen my children thread the mazes of the intricate pattern avoiding the dark marks
i have been familiar with every stone in the place
if i betray weakness you will know how to excuse me we have all got on in life since then mr micawber said i
mr
copperfield returned mr micawber bitterly when i was an inmate of that retreat i could look my fellowman in the face and punch his head if he offended me
my fellowman and myself are no longer on those glorious terms turning from the building in a downcast manner mr micawber accepted my proffered arm on one side and the proffered arm of traddles on the other and walked away between us
there are some landmarks observed mr micawber looking fondly back over his shoulder on the road to the tomb which but for the impiety of the aspiration a man would wish never to have passed
such is the bench in my chequered career oh you are in low spirits mr micawber said traddles
i am sir interposed mr micawber
i hope said traddles it is not because you have conceived a dislike to the lawfor i am a lawyer myself you know mr micawber answered not a word
how is our friend heep mr micawber said i after a silence
my dear copperfield returned mr micawber bursting into a state of much excitement and turning pale if you ask after my employer as your friend i am sorry for it if you ask after him as my friend i sardonically smile at it
in whatever capacity you ask after my employer i beg without offence to you to limit my reply to thisthat whatever his state of health may be his appearance is foxy not to say diabolical
you will allow me as a private individual to decline pursuing a subject which has lashed me to the utmost verge of desperation in my professional capacity i expressed my regret for having innocently touched upon a theme that roused him so much
may i ask said i without any hazard of repeating the mistake how my old friends mr and miss wickfield are miss wickfield said mr micawber now turning red is as she always is a pattern and a bright example
my dear copperfield she is the only starry spot in a miserable existence
my respect for that young lady my admiration of her character my devotion to her for her love and truth and goodnesstake me said mr micawber down a turning for upon my soul in my present state of mind i am not equal to this we wheeled him off into a narrow street where he took out his pockethandkerchief and stood with his back to a wall
if i looked as gravely at him as traddles did he must have found our company by no means inspiriting
it is my fate said mr micawber unfeignedly sobbing but doing even that with a shadow of the old expression of doing something genteel it is my fate gentlemen that the finer feelings of our nature have become reproaches to me
my homage to miss wickfield is a flight of arrows in my bosom
you had better leave me if you please to walk the earth as a vagabond
the worm will settle my business in doublequick time without attending to this invocation we stood by until he put up his pockethandkerchief pulled up his shirtcollar and to delude any person in the neighbourhood who might have been observing him hummed a tune with his hat very much on one side
i then mentionednot knowing what might be lost if we lost sight of him yetthat it would give me great pleasure to introduce him to my aunt if he would ride out to highgate where a bed was at his service
you shall make us a glass of your own punch mr micawber said i and forget whatever you have on your mind in pleasanter reminiscences or if confiding anything to friends will be more likely to relieve you you shall impart it to us mr micawber said traddles prudently
gentlemen returned mr micawber do with me as you will
i am a straw upon the surface of the deep and am tossed in all directions by the elephantsi beg your pardon i should have said the elements we walked on arminarm again found the coach in the act of starting and arrived at highgate without encountering any difficulties by the way
i was very uneasy and very uncertain in my mind what to say or do for the bestso was traddles evidently
mr micawber was for the most part plunged into deep gloom
he occasionally made an attempt to smarten himself and hum the fagend of a tune but his relapses into profound melancholy were only made the more impressive by the mockery of a hat exceedingly on one side and a shirtcollar pulled up to his eyes
we went to my aunts house rather than to mine because of doras not being well
my aunt presented herself on being sent for and welcomed mr micawber with gracious cordiality
mr micawber kissed her hand retired to the window and pulling out his pockethandkerchief had a mental wrestle with himself
mr dick was at home
he was by nature so exceedingly compassionate of anyone who seemed to be ill at ease and was so quick to find any such person out that he shook hands with mr micawber at least halfadozen times in five minutes
to mr micawber in his trouble this warmth on the part of a stranger was so extremely touching that he could only say on the occasion of each successive shake my dear sir you overpower me which gratified mr dick so much that he went at it again with greater vigour than before
the friendliness of this gentleman said mr micawber to my aunt if you will allow me maam to cull a figure of speech from the vocabulary of our coarser national sportsfloors me
to a man who is struggling with a complicated burden of perplexity and disquiet such a reception is trying i assure you my friend mr dick replied my aunt proudly is not a common man that i am convinced of said mr micawber
my dear sir for mr dick was shaking hands with him again i am deeply sensible of your cordiality how do you find yourself said mr dick with an anxious look
indifferent my dear sir returned mr micawber sighing
you must keep up your spirits said mr dick and make yourself as comfortable as possible mr micawber was quite overcome by these friendly words and by finding mr dicks hand again within his own
it has been my lot he observed to meet in the diversified panorama of human existence with an occasional oasis but never with one so green so gushing as the present at another time i should have been amused by this but i felt that we were all constrained and uneasy and i watched mr micawber so anxiously in his vacillations between an evident disposition to reveal something and a counterdisposition to reveal nothing that i was in a perfect fever
traddles sitting on the edge of his chair with his eyes wide open and his hair more emphatically erect than ever stared by turns at the ground and at mr micawber without so much as attempting to put in a word
my aunt though i saw that her shrewdest observation was concentrated on her new guest had more useful possession of her wits than either of us for she held him in conversation and made it necessary for him to talk whether he liked it or not
you are a very old friend of my nephews mr micawber said my aunt
i wish i had had the pleasure of seeing you before madam returned mr micawber i wish i had had the honour of knowing you at an earlier period
i was not always the wreck you at present behold i hope mrs micawber and your family are well sir said my aunt
mr micawber inclined his head
they are as well maam he desperately observed after a pause as aliens and outcasts can ever hope to be lord bless you sir exclaimed my aunt in her abrupt way
what are you talking about the subsistence of my family maam returned mr micawber trembles in the balance
my employer here mr micawber provokingly left off and began to peel the lemons that had been under my directions set before him together with all the other appliances he used in making punch
your employer you know said mr dick jogging his arm as a gentle reminder
my good sir returned mr micawber you recall me i am obliged to you they shook hands again
my employer maammr heeponce did me the favour to observe to me that if i were not in the receipt of the stipendiary emoluments appertaining to my engagement with him i should probably be a mountebank about the country swallowing a swordblade and eating the devouring element
for anything that i can perceive to the contrary it is still probable that my children may be reduced to seek a livelihood by personal contortion while mrs micawber abets their unnatural feats by playing the barrelorgan mr micawber with a random but expressive flourish of his knife signified that these performances might be expected to take place after he was no more then resumed his peeling with a desperate air
my aunt leaned her elbow on the little round table that she usually kept beside her and eyed him attentively
notwithstanding the aversion with which i regarded the idea of entrapping him into any disclosure he was not prepared to make voluntarily i should have taken him up at this point but for the strange proceedings in which i saw him engaged whereof his putting the lemonpeel into the kettle the sugar into the snuffertray the spirit into the empty jug and confidently attempting to pour boiling water out of a candlestick were among the most remarkable
i saw that a crisis was at hand and it came
he clattered all his means and implements together rose from his chair pulled out his pockethandkerchief and burst into tears
my dear copperfield said mr micawber behind his handkerchief this is an occupation of all others requiring an untroubled mind and selfrespect
i cannot perform it
it is out of the question mr
micawber said i what is the matter
pray speak out
you are among friends among friends sir repeated mr micawber and all he had reserved came breaking out of him
good heavens it is principally because i am among friends that my state of mind is what it is
what is the matter gentlemen
what is not the matter
villainy is the matter baseness is the matter deception fraud conspiracy are the matter and the name of the whole atrocious mass isheep my aunt clapped her hands and we all started up as if we were possessed
the struggle is over said mr micawber violently gesticulating with his pockethandkerchief and fairly striking out from time to time with both arms as if he were swimming under superhuman difficulties
i will lead this life no longer
i am a wretched being cut off from everything that makes life tolerable
i have been under a taboo in that infernal scoundrels service
give me back my wife give me back my family substitute micawber for the petty wretch who walks about in the boots at present on my feet and call upon me to swallow a sword tomorrow and ill do it
with an appetite i never saw a man so hot in my life
i tried to calm him that we might come to something rational but he got hotter and hotter and wouldnt hear a word
ill put my hand in no mans hand said mr micawber gasping puffing and sobbing to that degree that he was like a man fighting with cold water until i haveblown to fragmentstheadetestableserpentheep

the manner in which he struggled through these inarticulate sentences and whenever he found himself getting near the name of heep fought his way on to it dashed at it in a fainting state and brought it out with a vehemence little less than marvellous was frightful but now when he sank into a chair steaming and looked at us with every possible colour in his face that had no business there and an endless procession of lumps following one another in hot haste up his throat whence they seemed to shoot into his forehead he had the appearance of being in the last extremity
i would have gone to his assistance but he waved me off and wouldnt hear a word

no more to sayaor listen to persuasiongo immediatelynot capableabear societyupon the track of devoted and doomed traitorheep with this last repetition of the magic word that had kept him going at all and in which he surpassed all his previous efforts mr micawber rushed out of the house leaving us in a state of excitement hope and wonder that reduced us to a condition little better than his own
but even then his passion for writing letters was too strong to be resisted for while we were yet in the height of our excitement hope and wonder the following pastoral note was brought to me from a neighbouring tavern at which he had called to write it most secret and confidential
my dear sir i beg to be allowed to convey through you my apologies to your excellent aunt for my late excitement
an explosion of a smouldering volcano long suppressed was the result of an internal contest more easily conceived than described
i trust i rendered tolerably intelligible my appointment for the morning of this day week at the house of public entertainment at canterbury where mrs micawber and myself had once the honour of uniting our voices to yours in the wellknown strain of the immortal exciseman nurtured beyond the tweed
the duty done and act of reparation performed which can alone enable me to contemplate my fellow mortal i shall be known no more
i shall simply require to be deposited in that place of universal resort where each in his narrow cell for ever laid the rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep with the plain inscription wilkins micawber by this time some months had passed since our interview on the bank of the river with martha
i had never seen her since but she had communicated with mr peggotty on several occasions
nothing had come of her zealous intervention nor could i infer from what he told me that any clue had been obtained for a moment to emilys fate
i confess that i began to despair of her recovery and gradually to sink deeper and deeper into the belief that she was dead
his conviction remained unchanged
so far as i knowand i believe his honest heart was transparent to mehe never wavered again in his solemn certainty of finding her
his patience never tired
and although i trembled for the agony it might one day be to him to have his strong assurance shivered at a blow there was something so religious in it so affectingly expressive of its anchor being in the purest depths of his fine nature that the respect and honour in which i held him were exalted every day
his was not a lazy trustfulness that hoped and did no more
he had been a man of sturdy action all his life and he knew that in all things wherein he wanted help he must do his own part faithfully and help himself
i have known him set out in the night on a misgiving that the light might not be by some accident in the window of the old boat and walk to yarmouth
i have known him on reading something in the newspaper that might apply to her take up his stick and go forth on a journey of threeor fourscore miles
he made his way by sea to naples and back after hearing the narrative to which miss dartle had assisted me
all his journeys were ruggedly performed for he was always steadfast in a purpose of saving money for emilys sake when she should be found
in all this long pursuit i never heard him repine i never heard him say he was fatigued or out of heart
dora had often seen him since our marriage and was quite fond of him
i fancy his figure before me now standing near her sofa with his rough cap in his hand and the blue eyes of my childwife raised with a timid wonder to his face
sometimes of an evening about twilight when he came to talk with me i would induce him to smoke his pipe in the garden as we slowly paced to and fro together and then the picture of his deserted home and the comfortable air it used to have in my childish eyes of an evening when the fire was burning and the wind moaning round it came most vividly into my mind
one evening at this hour he told me that he had found martha waiting near his lodging on the preceding night when he came out and that she had asked him not to leave london on any account until he should have seen her again
did she tell you why i inquired
i asked her masr davy he replied but it is but few words as she ever says and she ony got my promise and so went away did she say when you might expect to see her again i demanded
no masr davy he returned drawing his hand thoughtfully down his face
i asked that too but it was more she said than she could tell as i had long forborne to encourage him with hopes that hung on threads i made no other comment on this information than that i supposed he would see her soon
such speculations as it engendered within me i kept to myself and those were faint enough
i was walking alone in the garden one evening about a fortnight afterwards
i remember that evening well
it was the second in mr micawbers week of suspense
there had been rain all day and there was a damp feeling in the air
the leaves were thick upon the trees and heavy with wet but the rain had ceased though the sky was still dark and the hopeful birds were singing cheerfully
as i walked to and fro in the garden and the twilight began to close around me their little voices were hushed and that peculiar silence which belongs to such an evening in the country when the lightest trees are quite still save for the occasional droppings from their boughs prevailed
there was a little green perspective of trelliswork and ivy at the side of our cottage through which i could see from the garden where i was walking into the road before the house
i happened to turn my eyes towards this place as i was thinking of many things and i saw a figure beyond dressed in a plain cloak
it was bending eagerly towards me and beckoning
martha said i going to it
can you come with me she inquired in an agitated whisper
i have been to him and he is not at home
i wrote down where he was to come and left it on his table with my own hand
they said he would not be out long
i have tidings for him
can you come directly my answer was to pass out at the gate immediately
she made a hasty gesture with her hand as if to entreat my patience and my silence and turned towards london whence as her dress betokened she had come expeditiously on foot
i asked her if that were not our destination
on her motioning yes with the same hasty gesture as before i stopped an empty coach that was coming by and we got into it
when i asked her where the coachman was to drive she answered anywhere near golden square
and quickthen shrunk into a corner with one trembling hand before her face and the other making the former gesture as if she could not bear a voice
now much disturbed and dazzled with conflicting gleams of hope and dread i looked at her for some explanation
but seeing how strongly she desired to remain quiet and feeling that it was my own natural inclination too at such a time i did not attempt to break the silence
we proceeded without a word being spoken
sometimes she glanced out of the window as though she thought we were going slowly though indeed we were going fast but otherwise remained exactly as at first
we alighted at one of the entrances to the square she had mentioned where i directed the coach to wait not knowing but that we might have some occasion for it
she laid her hand on my arm and hurried me on to one of the sombre streets of which there are several in that part where the houses were once fair dwellings in the occupation of single families but have and had long degenerated into poor lodgings let off in rooms
entering at the open door of one of these and releasing my arm she beckoned me to follow her up the common staircase which was like a tributary channel to the street
the house swarmed with inmates
as we went up doors of rooms were opened and peoples heads put out and we passed other people on the stairs who were coming down
in glancing up from the outside before we entered i had seen women and children lolling at the windows over flowerpots and we seemed to have attracted their curiosity for these were principally the observers who looked out of their doors
it was a broad panelled staircase with massive balustrades of some dark wood cornices above the doors ornamented with carved fruit and flowers and broad seats in the windows
but all these tokens of past grandeur were miserably decayed and dirty rot damp and age had weakened the flooring which in many places was unsound and even unsafe
some attempts had been made i noticed to infuse new blood into this dwindling frame by repairing the costly old woodwork here and there with common deal but it was like the marriage of a reduced old noble to a plebeian pauper and each party to the illassorted union shrunk away from the other
several of the back windows on the staircase had been darkened or wholly blocked up
in those that remained there was scarcely any glass and through the crumbling frames by which the bad air seemed always to come in and never to go out i saw through other glassless windows into other houses in a similar condition and looked giddily down into a wretched yard which was the common dustheap of the mansion
we proceeded to the topstorey of the house
two or three times by the way i thought i observed in the indistinct light the skirts of a female figure going up before us
as we turned to ascend the last flight of stairs between us and the roof we caught a full view of this figure pausing for a moment at a door
then it turned the handle and went in
whats this said martha in a whisper
she has gone into my room
i dont know her i knew her
i had recognized her with amazement for miss dartle
i said something to the effect that it was a lady whom i had seen before in a few words to my conductress and had scarcely done so when we heard her voice in the room though not from where we stood what she was saying
martha with an astonished look repeated her former action and softly led me up the stairs and then by a little backdoor which seemed to have no lock and which she pushed open with a touch into a small empty garret with a low sloping roof little better than a cupboard
between this and the room she had called hers there was a small door of communication standing partly open
here we stopped breathless with our ascent and she placed her hand lightly on my lips
i could only see of the room beyond that it was pretty large that there was a bed in it and that there were some common pictures of ships upon the walls
i could not see miss dartle or the person whom we had heard her address
certainly my companion could not for my position was the best
a dead silence prevailed for some moments
martha kept one hand on my lips and raised the other in a listening attitude
it matters little to me her not being at home said rosa dartle haughtily i know nothing of her
it is you i come to see me replied a soft voice
at the sound of it a thrill went through my frame
for it was emilys
yes returned miss dartle i have come to look at you
what
you are not ashamed of the face that has done so much the resolute and unrelenting hatred of her tone its cold stern sharpness and its mastered rage presented her before me as if i had seen her standing in the light
i saw the flashing black eyes and the passionwasted figure and i saw the scar with its white track cutting through her lips quivering and throbbing as she spoke
i have come to see she said james steerforths fancy the girl who ran away with him and is the towntalk of the commonest people of her native place the bold flaunting practised companion of persons like james steerforth
i want to know what such a thing is like there was a rustle as if the unhappy girl on whom she heaped these taunts ran towards the door and the speaker swiftly interposed herself before it
it was succeeded by a moments pause
when miss dartle spoke again it was through her set teeth and with a stamp upon the ground
stay there she said or ill proclaim you to the house and the whole street
if you try to evade me ill stop you if its by the hair and raise the very stones against you a frightened murmur was the only reply that reached my ears
a silence succeeded
i did not know what to do
much as i desired to put an end to the interview i felt that i had no right to present myself that it was for mr peggotty alone to see her and recover her
would he never come
i thought impatiently
so said rosa dartle with a contemptuous laugh i see her at last
why he was a poor creature to be taken by that delicate mockmodesty and that hanging head oh for heavens sake spare me exclaimed emily
whoever you are you know my pitiable story and for heavens sake spare me if you would be spared yourself if i would be spared returned the other fiercely what is there in common between us do you think nothing but our sex said emily with a burst of tears
and that said rosa dartle is so strong a claim preferred by one so infamous that if i had any feeling in my breast but scorn and abhorrence of you it would freeze it up
our sex
you are an honour to our sex i have deserved this said emily but its dreadful
dear dear lady think what i have suffered and how i am fallen
oh martha come back
oh home home miss dartle placed herself in a chair within view of the door and looked downward as if emily were crouching on the floor before her
being now between me and the light i could see her curled lip and her cruel eyes intently fixed on one place with a greedy triumph
listen to what i say she said and reserve your false arts for your dupes
do you hope to move me by your tears
no more than you could charm me by your smiles you purchased slave oh have some mercy on me cried emily
show me some compassion or i shall die mad it would be no great penance said rosa dartle for your crimes
do you know what you have done
do you ever think of the home you have laid waste oh is there ever night or day when i dont think of it cried emily and now i could just see her on her knees with her head thrown back her pale face looking upward her hands wildly clasped and held out and her hair streaming about her
has there ever been a single minute waking or sleeping when it hasnt been before me just as it used to be in the lost days when i turned my back upon it for ever and for ever
oh home home
oh dear dear uncle if you ever could have known the agony your love would cause me when i fell away from good you never would have shown it to me so constant much as you felt it but would have been angry to me at least once in my life that i might have had some comfort
i have none none no comfort upon earth for all of them were always fond of me she dropped on her face before the imperious figure in the chair with an imploring effort to clasp the skirt of her dress
rosa dartle sat looking down upon her as inflexible as a figure of brass
her lips were tightly compressed as if she knew that she must keep a strong constraint upon herselfi write what i sincerely believeor she would be tempted to strike the beautiful form with her foot
i saw her distinctly and the whole power of her face and character seemed forced into that expressionwould he never come
the miserable vanity of these earthworms she said when she had so far controlled the angry heavings of her breast that she could trust herself to speak
your home
do you imagine that i bestow a thought on it or suppose you could do any harm to that low place which money would not pay for and handsomely
your home
you were a part of the trade of your home and were bought and sold like any other vendible thing your people dealt in oh not that cried emily
say anything of me but dont visit my disgrace and shame more than i have done on folks who are as honourable as you
have some respect for them as you are a lady if you have no mercy for me i speak she said not deigning to take any heed of this appeal and drawing away her dress from the contamination of emilys touch i speak of his homewhere i live
here she said stretching out her hand with her contemptuous laugh and looking down upon the prostrate girl is a worthy cause of division between ladymother and gentlemanson of grief in a house where she wouldnt have been admitted as a kitchengirl of anger and repining and reproach
this piece of pollution picked up from the waterside to be made much of for an hour and then tossed back to her original place no
no cried emily clasping her hands together
when he first came into my waythat the day had never dawned upon me and he had met me being carried to my gravei had been brought up as virtuous as you or any lady and was going to be the wife of as good a man as you or any lady in the world can ever marry
if you live in his home and know him you know perhaps what his power with a weak vain girl might be
i dont defend myself but i know well and he knows well or he will know when he comes to die and his mind is troubled with it that he used all his power to deceive me and that i believed him trusted him and loved him rosa dartle sprang up from her seat recoiled and in recoiling struck at her with a face of such malignity so darkened and disfigured by passion that i had almost thrown myself between them
the blow which had no aim fell upon the air
as she now stood panting looking at her with the utmost detestation that she was capable of expressing and trembling from head to foot with rage and scorn i thought i had never seen such a sight and never could see such another
you love him
you she cried with her clenched hand quivering as if it only wanted a weapon to stab the object of her wrath
emily had shrunk out of my view
there was no reply
and tell that to me she added with your shameful lips
why dont they whip these creatures
if i could order it to be done i would have this girl whipped to death and so she would i have no doubt
i would not have trusted her with the rack itself while that furious look lasted
she slowly very slowly broke into a laugh and pointed at emily with her hand as if she were a sight of shame for gods and men
she love she said
that carrion
and he ever cared for her shed tell me
ha ha
the liars that these traders are her mockery was worse than her undisguised rage
of the two i would have much preferred to be the object of the latter
but when she suffered it to break loose it was only for a moment
she had chained it up again and however it might tear her within she subdued it to herself
i came here you pure fountain of love she said to seeas i began by telling youwhat such a thing as you was like
i was curious
i am satisfied
also to tell you that you had best seek that home of yours with all speed and hide your head among those excellent people who are expecting you and whom your money will console
when its all gone you can believe and trust and love again you know
i thought you a broken toy that had lasted its time a worthless spangle that was tarnished and thrown away
but finding you true gold a very lady and an illused innocent with a fresh heart full of love and trustfulnesswhich you look like and is quite consistent with your storyi have something more to say
attend to it for what i say ill do
do you hear me you fairy spirit
what i say i mean to do her rage got the better of her again for a moment but it passed over her face like a spasm and left her smiling
hide yourself she pursued if not at home somewhere
let it be somewhere beyond reach in some obscure lifeor better still in some obscure death
i wonder if your loving heart will not break you have found no way of helping it to be still
i have heard of such means sometimes
i believe they may be easily found a low crying on the part of emily interrupted her here
she stopped and listened to it as if it were music
i am of a strange nature perhaps rosa dartle went on but i cant breathe freely in the air you breathe
i find it sickly
therefore i will have it cleared i will have it purified of you
if you live here tomorrow ill have your story and your character proclaimed on the common stair
there are decent women in the house i am told and it is a pity such a light as you should be among them and concealed
if leaving here you seek any refuge in this town in any character but your true one which you are welcome to bear without molestation from me the same service shall be done you if i hear of your retreat
being assisted by a gentleman who not long ago aspired to the favour of your hand i am sanguine as to that would he never never come
how long was i to bear this
how long could i bear it
oh me oh me exclaimed the wretched emily in a tone that might have touched the hardest heart i should have thought but there was no relenting in rosa dartles smile
what what shall i do do returned the other
live happy in your own reflections
consecrate your existence to the recollection of james steerforths tendernesshe would have made you his servingmans wife would he notor to feeling grateful to the upright and deserving creature who would have taken you as his gift
or if those proud remembrances and the consciousness of your own virtues and the honourable position to which they have raised you in the eyes of everything that wears the human shape will not sustain you marry that good man and be happy in his condescension
if this will not do either die
there are doorways and dustheaps for such deaths and such despairfind one and take your flight to heaven i heard a distant foot upon the stairs
i knew it i was certain
it was his thank god
she moved slowly from before the door when she said this and passed out of my sight
but mark she added slowly and sternly opening the other door to go away i am resolved for reasons that i have and hatreds that i entertain to cast you out unless you withdraw from my reach altogether or drop your pretty mask
this is what i had to say and what i say i mean to do the foot upon the stairs came nearernearerpassed her as she went downrushed into the room
uncle a fearful cry followed the word
i paused a moment and looking in saw him supporting her insensible figure in his arms
he gazed for a few seconds in the face then stooped to kiss itoh how tenderlyand drew a handkerchief before it
masr davy he said in a low tremulous voice when it was covered i thank my heavnly father as my dreams come true
i thank him hearty for having guided of me in his own ways to my darling with those words he took her up in his arms and with the veiled face lying on his bosom and addressed towards his own carried her motionless and unconscious down the stairs
it was yet early in the morning of the following day when as i was walking in my garden with my aunt who took little other exercise now being so much in attendance on my dear dora i was told that mr peggotty desired to speak with me
he came into the garden to meet me halfway on my going towards the gate and bared his head as it was always his custom to do when he saw my aunt for whom he had a high respect
i had been telling her all that had happened overnight
without saying a word she walked up with a cordial face shook hands with him and patted him on the arm
it was so expressively done that she had no need to say a word
mr peggotty understood her quite as well as if she had said a thousand
ill go in now trot said my aunt and look after little blossom who will be getting up presently not along of my being heer maam i hope said mr peggotty
unless my wits is gone a bahds neezingby which mr peggotty meant to say birdsnestingthis morning tis along of me as youre agoing to quit us you have something to say my good friend returned my aunt and will do better without me by your leave maam returned mr peggotty i should take it kind pervising you doent mind my clicketten if youd bide heer would you said my aunt with short goodnature
then i am sure i will so she drew her arm through mr peggottys and walked with him to a leafy little summerhouse there was at the bottom of the garden where she sat down on a bench and i beside her
there was a seat for mr peggotty too but he preferred to stand leaning his hand on the small rustic table
as he stood looking at his cap for a little while before beginning to speak i could not help observing what power and force of character his sinewy hand expressed and what a good and trusty companion it was to his honest brow and irongrey hair
i took my dear child away last night mr peggotty began as he raised his eyes to ours to my lodging wheer i have a long time been expecting of her and preparing fur her
it was hours afore she knowed me right and when she did she kneeled down at my feet and kiender said to me as if it was her prayers how it all come to be
you may believe me when i heerd her voice as i had heerd at home so playfuland see her humbled as it might be in the dust our saviour wrote in with his blessed handi felt a wownd go to my art in the midst of all its thankfulness he drew his sleeve across his face without any pretence of concealing why and then cleared his voice
it warnt for long as i felt that for she was found
i had ony to think as she was found and it was gone
i doent know why i do so much as mention of it now im sure
i didnt have it in my mind a minute ago to say a word about myself but it come up so natral that i yielded to it afore i was aweer you are a selfdenying soul said my aunt and will have your reward mr peggotty with the shadows of the leaves playing athwart his face made a surprised inclination of the head towards my aunt as an acknowledgement of her good opinion then took up the thread he had relinquished
when my emly took flight he said in stern wrath for the moment from the house wheer she was made a prisoner by that theer spotted snake as masr davy seeand his storys trew and may god confound himshe took flight in the night
it was a dark night with a many stars ashining
she was wild
she ran along the sea beach believing the old boat was theer and calling out to us to turn away our faces for she was acoming by
she heerd herself acrying out like as if it was another person and cut herself on them sharppinted stones and rocks and felt it no more than if she had been rock herself
ever so fur she run and there was fire afore her eyes and roarings in her ears
of a suddenor so she thowt you unnerstandthe day broke wet and windy and she was lying blow a heap of stone upon the shore and a woman was aspeaking to her saying in the language of that country what was it as had gone so much amiss he saw everything he related
it passed before him as he spoke so vividly that in the intensity of his earnestness he presented what he described to me with greater distinctness than i can express
i can hardly believe writing now long afterwards but that i was actually present in these scenes they are impressed upon me with such an astonishing air of fidelity
as emlys eyeswhich was heavysee this woman better mr peggotty went on she knowd as she was one of them as she had often talked to on the beach
fur though she had run as i have said ever so fur in the night she had oftentimes wandered long ways partly afoot partly in boats and carriages and knowd all that country long the coast miles and miles
she hadnt no children of her own this woman being a young wife but she was alooking to have one afore long
and may my prayers go up to heaven that twill be a happiness to her and a comfort and a honour all her life
may it love her and be dootiful to her in her old age helpful of her at the last a angel to her heer and heerafter amen said my aunt
she had been summat timorous and down said mr peggotty and had sat at first a little way off at her spinning or such work as it was when emly talked to the children
but emly had took notice of her and had gone and spoke to her and as the young woman was partial to the children herself they had soon made friends
sermuchser that when emly went that way she always giv emly flowers
this was her as now asked what it was that had gone so much amiss
emly told her and shetook her home
she did indeed
she took her home said mr peggotty covering his face
he was more affected by this act of kindness than i had ever seen him affected by anything since the night she went away
my aunt and i did not attempt to disturb him
it was a little cottage you may suppose he said presently but she found space for emly in ither husband was away at seaand she kep it secret and prevailed upon such neighbours as she had they was not many near to keep it secret too
emly was took bad with fever and what is very strange to me ismaybe tis not so strange to scholarsthe language of that country went out of her head and she could only speak her own that no one unnerstood
she recollects as if she had dreamed it that she lay there always atalking her own tongue always believing as the old boat was round the next pint in the bay and begging and imploring of em to send theer and tell how she was dying and bring back a message of forgiveness if it was ony a wured
amost the whole time she thowtnow that him as i made mention on just now was lurking for her unnerneath the winder now that him as had brought her to this was in the roomand cried to the good young woman not to give her up and knowd at the same time that she couldnt unnerstand and dreaded that she must be took away
likewise the fire was afore her eyes and the roarings in her ears and theer was no today nor yesterday nor yet tomorrow but everything in her life as ever had been or as ever could be and everything as never had been and as never could be was a crowding on her all at once and nothing clear nor welcome and yet she sang and laughed about it
how long this lasted i doent know but then theer come a sleep and in that sleep from being a many times stronger than her own self she fell into the weakness of the littlest child here he stopped as if for relief from the terrors of his own description
after being silent for a few moments he pursued his story
it was a pleasant arternoon when she awoke and so quiet that there warnt a sound but the rippling of that blue sea without a tide upon the shore
it was her belief at first that she was at home upon a sunday morning but the vine leaves as she see at the winder and the hills beyond warnt home and contradicted of her
then come in her friend to watch alongside of her bed and then she knowd as the old boat warnt round that next pint in the bay no more but was fur off and knowd where she was and why and broke out acrying on that good young womans bosom wheer i hope her baby is alying now acheering of her with its pretty eyes he could not speak of this good friend of emilys without a flow of tears
it was in vain to try
he broke down again endeavouring to bless her
that done my emly good he resumed after such emotion as i could not behold without sharing in and as to my aunt she wept with all her heart that done emly good and she begun to mend
but the language of that country was quite gone from her and she was forced to make signs
so she went on getting better from day to day slow but sure and trying to learn the names of common thingsnames as she seemed never to have heerd in all her lifetill one evening come when she was asetting at her window looking at a little girl at play upon the beach
and of a sudden this child held out her hand and said what would be in english fishermans daughter heres a shellfor you are to unnerstand that they used at first to call her pretty lady as the general way in that country is and that she had taught em to call her fishermans daughter instead
the child says of a sudden fishermans daughter heres a shell then emly unnerstands her and she answers bursting out acrying and it all comes back
when emly got strong again said mr peggotty after another short interval of silence she cast about to leave that good young creetur and get to her own country
the husband was come home then and the two together put her aboard a small trader bound to leghorn and from that to france
she had a little money but it was less than little as they would take for all they done
im amost glad on it though they was so poor
what they done is laid up wheer neither moth or rust doth corrupt and wheer thieves do not break through nor steal
masr davy itll outlast all the treasure in the wureld
emly got to france and took service to wait on travelling ladies at a inn in the port
theer theer come one day that snake
let him never come nigh me
i doent know what hurt i might do himsoon as she see him without him seeing her all her fear and wildness returned upon her and she fled afore the very breath he drawd
she come to england and was set ashore at dover
i doent know said mr peggotty for sure when her art begun to fail her but all the way to england she had thowt to come to her dear home
soon as she got to england she turned her face towrds it
but fear of not being forgiv fear of being pinted at fear of some of us being dead along of her fear of many things turned her from it kiender by force upon the road uncle uncle she says to me the fear of not being worthy to do what my torn and bleeding breast so longed to do was the most frightning fear of all
i turned back when my art was full of prayers that i might crawl to the old doorstep in the night kiss it lay my wicked face upon it and theer be found dead in the morning she come said mr peggotty dropping his voice to an awestricken whisper to london
sheas had never seen it in her lifealonewithout a pennyyoungso prettycome to london
amost the moment as she lighted heer all so desolate she found as she believed a friend a decent woman as spoke to her about the needlework as she had been brought up to do about finding plenty of it fur her about a lodging fur the night and making secret inquiration concerning of me and all at home tomorrow
when my child he said aloud and with an energy of gratitude that shook him from head to foot stood upon the brink of more than i can say or think onmartha trew to her promise saved her i could not repress a cry of joy
masr davy said he gripping my hand in that strong hand of his it was you as first made mention of her to me
i thankee sir
she was arnest
she had knowd of her bitter knowledge wheer to watch and what to do
she had done it
and the lord was above all
she come white and hurried upon emly in her sleep
she says to her rise up from worse than death and come with me them belonging to the house would have stopped her but they might as soon have stopped the sea
stand away from me she says i am a ghost that calls her from beside her open grave she told emly she had seen me and knowd i loved her and forgive her
she wrapped her hasty in her clothes
she took her faint and trembling on her arm
she heeded no more what they said than if she had had no ears
she walked among em with my child minding only her and brought her safe out in the dead of the night from that black pit of ruin
she attended on emly said mr peggotty who had released my hand and put his own hand on his heaving chest she attended to my emly lying wearied out and wandering betwixt whiles till late next day
then she went in search of me then in search of you masr davy
she didnt tell emly what she come out fur lest her art should fail and she should think of hiding of herself
how the cruel lady knowd of her being theer i cant say
whether him as i have spoke so much of chanced to see em going theer or whether which is most like to my thinking he had heerd it from the woman i doent greatly ask myself
my niece is found
all night long said mr peggotty we have been together emly and me
tis little considering the time as she has said in wureds through them brokenhearted tears tis less as i have seen of her dear face as growd into a womans at my hearth
but all night long her arms has been about my neck and her head has laid heer and we knows full well as we can put our trust in one another ever more he ceased to speak and his hand upon the table rested there in perfect repose with a resolution in it that might have conquered lions
it was a gleam of light upon me trot said my aunt drying her eyes when i formed the resolution of being godmother to your sister betsey trotwood who disappointed me but next to that hardly anything would have given me greater pleasure than to be godmother to that good young creatures baby mr peggotty nodded his understanding of my aunts feelings but could not trust himself with any verbal reference to the subject of her commendation
we all remained silent and occupied with our own reflections my aunt drying her eyes and now sobbing convulsively and now laughing and calling herself a fool until i spoke
you have quite made up your mind said i to mr peggotty as to the future good friend
i need scarcely ask you quite masr davy he returned and told emly
theers mighty countries fur from heer
our future life lays over the sea they will emigrate together aunt said i

i was down at the docks early this morning sir he returned to get information concerning of them ships

hell set and talk to her with a calm spirit wen its like he couldnt bring himself to open his lips to another
poor fellow said mr peggotty shaking his head theers not so much left him that he could spare the little as he has and mrs gummidge said i
well ive had a mort of consideration i do tell you returned mr peggotty with a perplexed look which gradually cleared as he went on concerning of missis gummidge
you see wen missis gummidge falls athinking of the old un she ant what you may call good company
betwixt you and me masr davyand you maamwen mrs gummidge takes to wimickingour old country word for cryingshes liable to be considered to be by them as didnt know the old un peevishlike
now i did know the old un said mr peggotty and i knowd his merits so i unnerstan her but tant entirely so you see with othersnatrally cant be my aunt and i both acquiesced
wheerby said mr peggotty my sister mighti doent say she would but mightfind missis gummidge give her a leetle trouble nowandagain
theerfur tant my intentions to moor missis gummidge long with them but to find a beein fur her wheer she can fisherate for herself a beein signifies in that dialect a home and to fisherate is to provide
fur which purpose said mr peggotty i means to make her a lowance afore i go asll leave her pretty comfortble
shes the faithfullest of creeturs
tant to be expected of course at her time of life and being lone and lorn as the good old mawther is to be knocked about aboardship and in the woods and wilds of a new and furaway country
so thats what im agoing to do with her he forgot nobody
he thought of everybodys claims and strivings but his own
emly he continued will keep along with mepoor child shes sore in need of peace and restuntil such time as we goes upon our voyage
shell work at them clothes as must be made and i hope her troubles will begin to seem longer ago than they was wen she finds herself once more by her rough but loving uncle my aunt nodded confirmation of this hope and imparted great satisfaction to mr peggotty
theers one thing furder masr davy said he putting his hand in his breastpocket and gravely taking out the little paper bundle i had seen before which he unrolled on the table
theers these here banknotesfifty pound and ten
to them i wish to add the money as she come away with
ive asked her about that but not saying why and have added of it up
i ant a scholar
would you be so kind as see how tis he handed me apologetically for his scholarship a piece of paper and observed me while i looked it over
it was quite right
thankee sir he said taking it back
this money if you doent see objections masr davy i shall put up jest afore i go in a cover directed to him and put that up in another directed to his mother
i shall tell her in no more wureds than i speak to you what its the price on and that im gone and past receiving of it back i told him that i thought it would be right to do sothat i was thoroughly convinced it would be since he felt it to be right
i said that theer was ony one thing furder he proceeded with a grave smile when he had made up his little bundle again and put it in his pocket but theer was two
i warnt sure in my mind wen i come out this morning as i could go and break to ham of my own self what had so thankfully happened
so i writ a letter while i was out and put it in the postoffice telling of em how all was as tis and that i should come down tomorrow to unload my mind of what little needs adoing of down theer and mostlike take my farewell leave of yarmouth and do you wish me to go with you said i seeing that he left something unsaid
if you could do me that kind favour masr davy he replied
i know the sight on you would cheer em up a bit my little dora being in good spirits and very desirous that i should goas i found on talking it over with heri readily pledged myself to accompany him in accordance with his wish
next morning consequently we were on the yarmouth coach and again travelling over the old ground
as we passed along the familiar street at nightmr peggotty in despite of all my remonstrances carrying my bagi glanced into omer and jorams shop and saw my old friend mr omer there smoking his pipe
i felt reluctant to be present when mr peggotty first met his sister and ham and made mr omer my excuse for lingering behind
how is mr omer after this long time said i going in
he fanned away the smoke of his pipe that he might get a better view of me and soon recognized me with great delight
i should get up sir to acknowledge such an honour as this visit said he only my limbs are rather out of sorts and i am wheeled about
with the exception of my limbs and my breath howsoever i am as hearty as a man can be im thankful to say i congratulated him on his contented looks and his good spirits and saw now that his easychair went on wheels
its an ingenious thing aint it he inquired following the direction of my glance and polishing the elbow with his arm
it runs as light as a feather and tracks as true as a mailcoach
bless you my little minniemy granddaughter you know minnies childputs her little strength against the back gives it a shove and away we go as clever and merry as ever you see anything
and i tell you whatits a most uncommon chair to smoke a pipe in i never saw such a good old fellow to make the best of a thing and find out the enjoyment of it as mr omer
he was as radiant as if his chair his asthma and the failure of his limbs were the various branches of a great invention for enhancing the luxury of a pipe
i see more of the world i can assure you said mr omer in this chair than ever i see out of it
youd be surprised at the number of people that looks in of a day to have a chat
you really would
theres twice as much in the newspaper since ive taken to this chair as there used to be
as to general reading dear me what a lot of it i do get through
thats what i feel so strong you know
if it had been my eyes what should i have done
if it had been my ears what should i have done
being my limbs what does it signify
why my limbs only made my breath shorter when i used em
and now if i want to go out into the street or down to the sands ive only got to call dick jorams youngest prentice and away i go in my own carriage like the lord mayor of london he half suffocated himself with laughing here
lord bless you said mr omer resuming his pipe a man must take the fat with the lean thats what he must make up his mind to in this life
joram does a fine business
excellent business i am very glad to hear it said i
i knew you would be said mr omer
and joram and minnie are like valentines
what more can a man expect
whats his limbs to that his supreme contempt for his own limbs as he sat smoking was one of the pleasantest oddities i have ever encountered
and since ive took to general reading youve took to general writing eh sir said mr omer surveying me admiringly
what a lovely work that was of yours
what expressions in it
i read it every wordevery word
and as to feeling sleepy
not at all i laughingly expressed my satisfaction but i must confess that i thought this association of ideas significant
i give you my word and honour sir said mr omer that when i lay that book upon the table and look at it outside compact in three separate and indiwidual wollumesone two three i am as proud as punch to think that i once had the honour of being connected with your family
and dear me its a long time ago now aint it
over at blunderstone
with a pretty little party laid along with the other party
and you quite a small party then yourself
dear dear i changed the subject by referring to emily
after assuring him that i did not forget how interested he had always been in her and how kindly he had always treated her i gave him a general account of her restoration to her uncle by the aid of martha which i knew would please the old man
he listened with the utmost attention and said feelingly when i had done i am rejoiced at it sir
its the best news i have heard for many a day
dear dear dear
and whats going to be undertook for that unfortunate young woman martha now you touch a point that my thoughts have been dwelling on since yesterday said i but on which i can give you no information yet mr omer
mr peggotty has not alluded to it and i have a delicacy in doing so
i am sure he has not forgotten it
he forgets nothing that is disinterested and good because you know said mr omer taking himself up where he had left off whatever is done i should wish to be a member of
put me down for anything you may consider right and let me know
i never could think the girl all bad and i am glad to find shes not
so will my daughter minnie be
young women are contradictory creatures in some thingsher mother was just the same as herbut their hearts are soft and kind
its all show with minnie about martha
why she should consider it necessary to make any show i dont undertake to tell you
but its all show bless you
shed do her any kindness in private
so put me down for whatever you may consider right will you be so good
and drop me a line where to forward it
dear me said mr omer when a man is drawing on to a time of life where the two ends of life meet when he finds himself however hearty he is being wheeled about for the second time in a speeches of gocart he should be overrejoiced to do a kindness if he can
he wants plenty
and i dont speak of myself particular said mr omer because sir the way i look at it is that we are all drawing on to the bottom of the hill whatever age we are on account of time never standing still for a single moment
so let us always do a kindness and be overrejoiced
to be sure he knocked the ashes out of his pipe and put it on a ledge in the back of his chair expressly made for its reception
theres emlys cousin him that she was to have been married to said mr omer rubbing his hands feebly as fine a fellow as there is in yarmouth
hell come and talk or read to me in the evening for an hour together sometimes
thats a kindness i should call it
all his lifes a kindness i am going to see him now said i
are you said mr omer
tell him i was hearty and sent my respects
minnie and jorams at a ball
they would be as proud to see you as i am if they was at home
minnie wont hardly go out at all you see on account of father as she says
so i swore tonight that if she didnt go id go to bed at six
in consequence of which mr omer shook himself and his chair with laughter at the success of his device she and jorams at a ball i shook hands with him and wished him good night
half a minute sir said mr omer
if you was to go without seeing my little elephant youd lose the best of sights
you never see such a sight
minnie a musical little voice answered from somewhere upstairs i am coming grandfather and a pretty little girl with long flaxen curling hair soon came running into the shop
this is my little elephant sir said mr omer fondling the child
siamese breed sir
now little elephant the little elephant set the door of the parlour open enabling me to see that in these latter days it was converted into a bedroom for mr omer who could not be easily conveyed upstairs and then hid her pretty forehead and tumbled her long hair against the back of mr omers chair
the elephant butts you know sir said mr omer winking when he goes at a object
once elephant
twice
three times at this signal the little elephant with a dexterity that was next to marvellous in so small an animal whisked the chair round with mr omer in it and rattled it off pellmell into the parlour without touching the doorpost mr omer indescribably enjoying the performance and looking back at me on the road as if it were the triumphant issue of his lifes exertions
after a stroll about the town i went to hams house
peggotty had now removed here for good and had let her own house to the successor of mr barkis in the carrying business who had paid her very well for the goodwill cart and horse
i believe the very same slow horse that mr barkis drove was still at work
i found them in the neat kitchen accompanied by mrs gummidge who had been fetched from the old boat by mr peggotty himself
i doubt if she could have been induced to desert her post by anyone else
he had evidently told them all
both peggotty and mrs gummidge had their aprons to their eyes and ham had just stepped out to take a turn on the beach
he presently came home very glad to see me and i hope they were all the better for my being there
we spoke with some approach to cheerfulness of mr peggottys growing rich in a new country and of the wonders he would describe in his letters
we said nothing of emily by name but distantly referred to her more than once
ham was the serenest of the party
but peggotty told me when she lighted me to a little chamber where the crocodile book was lying ready for me on the table that he always was the same
she believed she told me crying that he was brokenhearted though he was as full of courage as of sweetness and worked harder and better than any boatbuilder in any yard in all that part
there were times she said of an evening when he talked of their old life in the boathouse and then he mentioned emily as a child
but he never mentioned her as a woman
i thought i had read in his face that he would like to speak to me alone
i therefore resolved to put myself in his way next evening as he came home from his work
having settled this with myself i fell asleep
that night for the first time in all those many nights the candle was taken out of the window mr peggotty swung in his old hammock in the old boat and the wind murmured with the old sound round his head
all next day he was occupied in disposing of his fishingboat and tackle in packing up and sending to london by waggon such of his little domestic possessions as he thought would be useful to him and in parting with the rest or bestowing them on mrs gummidge
she was with him all day
as i had a sorrowful wish to see the old place once more before it was locked up i engaged to meet them there in the evening
but i so arranged it as that i should meet ham first
it was easy to come in his way as i knew where he worked
i met him at a retired part of the sands which i knew he would cross and turned back with him that he might have leisure to speak to me if he really wished
i had not mistaken the expression of his face
we had walked but a little way together when he said without looking at me masr davy have you seen her only for a moment when she was in a swoon i softly answered
we walked a little farther and he said masr davy shall you see her dye think it would be too painful to her perhaps said i
i have thowt of that he replied
so twould sir so twould but ham said i gently if there is anything that i could write to her for you in case i could not tell it if there is anything you would wish to make known to her through me i should consider it a sacred trust i am sure ont
i thankee sir most kind
i think theer is something i could wish said or wrote what is it we walked a little farther in silence and then he spoke
tant that i forgive her
tant that so much
tis more as i beg of her to forgive me for having pressed my affections upon her
odd times i think that if i hadnt had her promise fur to marry me sir she was that trustful of me in a friendly way that shed have told me what was struggling in her mind and would have counselled with me and i might have saved her i pressed his hand
is that all theers yet a something else he returned if i can say it masr davy we walked on farther than we had walked yet before he spoke again
he was not crying when he made the pauses i shall express by lines
he was merely collecting himself to speak very plainly
i loved herand i love the memry of hertoo deepto be able to lead her to believe of my own self as im a happy man
i could only be happyby forgetting of herand im afeerd i couldnt hardly bear as she should be told i done that
but if you being so full of learning masr davy could think of anything to say as might bring her to believe i wasnt greatly hurt still loving of her and mourning for her anything as might bring her to believe as i was not tired of my life and yet was hoping fur to see her without blame wheer the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at restanything as would ease her sorrowful mind and yet not make her think as i could ever marry or as twas possible that anyone could ever be to me what she wasi should ask of you to say thatwith my prayers for herthat was so dear i pressed his manly hand again and told him i would charge myself to do this as well as i could
i thankee sir he answered
twas kind of you to meet me
twas kind of you to bear him company down
masr davy i unnerstan very well though my aunt will come to lonon afore they sail and theyll unite once more that i am not like to see him agen
i fare to feel sure ont
we doent say so but so twill be and better so
the last you see on himthe very lastwill you give him the lovingest duty and thanks of the orphan as he was ever more than a father to this i also promised faithfully
i thankee agen sir he said heartily shaking hands
i know wheer youre agoing
goodbye with a slight wave of his hand as though to explain to me that he could not enter the old place he turned away
as i looked after his figure crossing the waste in the moonlight i saw him turn his face towards a strip of silvery light upon the sea and pass on looking at it until he was a shadow in the distance
the door of the boathouse stood open when i approached and on entering i found it emptied of all its furniture saving one of the old lockers on which mrs gummidge with a basket on her knee was seated looking at mr peggotty
he leaned his elbow on the rough chimneypiece and gazed upon a few expiring embers in the grate but he raised his head hopefully on my coming in and spoke in a cheery manner
come according to promise to bid farewell to t eh masr davy he said taking up the candle
bare enough now ant it indeed you have made good use of the time said i
why we have not been idle sir
missis gummidge has worked like ai doent know what missis gummidge ant worked like said mr peggotty looking at her at a loss for a sufficiently approving simile
mrs gummidge leaning on her basket made no observation
theers the very locker that you used to sit on long with emly said mr peggotty in a whisper
im agoing to carry it away with me last of all
and heers your old little bedroom see masr davy
amost as bleak tonight as art could wish in truth the wind though it was low had a solemn sound and crept around the deserted house with a whispered wailing that was very mournful
everything was gone down to the little mirror with the oystershell frame
i thought of myself lying here when that first great change was being wrought at home
i thought of the blueeyed child who had enchanted me
i thought of steerforth and a foolish fearful fancy came upon me of his being near at hand and liable to be met at any turn
tis like to be long said mr peggotty in a low voice afore the boat finds new tenants
they look upon t down heer as being unfortunate now does it belong to anybody in the neighbourhood i asked
to a mastmaker up town said mr peggotty
im agoing to give the key to him tonight we looked into the other little room and came back to mrs gummidge sitting on the locker whom mr peggotty putting the light on the chimneypiece requested to rise that he might carry it outside the door before extinguishing the candle
danl said mrs gummidge suddenly deserting her basket and clinging to his arm my dear danl the parting words i speak in this house is i mustnt be left behind
doent ye think of leaving me behind danl
oh doent ye ever do it mr peggotty taken aback looked from mrs gummidge to me and from me to mrs gummidge as if he had been awakened from a sleep
doent ye dearest danl doent ye cried mrs gummidge fervently
take me long with you danl take me long with you and emly
ill be your servant constant and trew
if theres slaves in them parts where youre agoing ill be bound to you for one and happy but doent ye leave me behind danl thats a deary dear my good soul said mr peggotty shaking his head you doent know what a long voyage and what a hard life tis yes i do danl
i can guess cried mrs gummidge
but my parting words under this roof is i shall go into the house and die if i am not took
i can dig danl
i can work
i can live hard
i can be loving and patient nowmore than you think danl if youll ony try me
i wouldnt touch the lowance not if i was dying of want danl peggotty but ill go with you and emly if youll ony let me to the worlds end
i know how tis i know you think that i am lone and lorn but deary love tant so no more
i aint sat here so long awatching and athinking of your trials without some good being done me
masr davy speak to him for me
i knows his ways and emlys and i knows their sorrows and can be a comfort to em some odd times and labour for em allus
danl deary danl let me go long with you and mrs gummidge took his hand and kissed it with a homely pathos and affection in a homely rapture of devotion and gratitude that he well deserved
we brought the locker out extinguished the candle fastened the door on the outside and left the old boat close shut up a dark speck in the cloudy night
next day when we were returning to london outside the coach mrs gummidge and her basket were on the seat behind and mrs gummidge was happy
when the time mr micawber had appointed so mysteriously was within fourandtwenty hours of being come my aunt and i consulted how we should proceed for my aunt was very unwilling to leave dora
ah
how easily i carried dora up and down stairs now
we were disposed notwithstanding mr micawbers stipulation for my aunts attendance to arrange that she should stay at home and be represented by mr dick and me
in short we had resolved to take this course when dora again unsettled us by declaring that she never would forgive herself and never would forgive her bad boy if my aunt remained behind on any pretence
i wont speak to you said dora shaking her curls at my aunt
ill be disagreeable
ill make jip bark at you all day
i shall be sure that you really are a cross old thing if you dont go tut blossom laughed my aunt
you know you cant do without me yes i can said dora
you are no use to me at all
you never run up and down stairs for me all day long
you never sit and tell me stories about doady when his shoes were worn out and he was covered with dustoh what a poor little mite of a fellow
you never do anything at all to please me do you dear dora made haste to kiss my aunt and say yes you do
im only jokinglest my aunt should think she really meant it
but aunt said dora coaxingly now listen
you must go
i shall tease you till you let me have my own way about it
i shall lead my naughty boy such a life if he dont make you go
i shall make myself so disagreeableand so will jip
youll wish you had gone like a good thing for ever and ever so long if you dont go
besides said dora putting back her hair and looking wonderingly at my aunt and me why shouldnt you both go
i am not very ill indeed
am i why what a question cried my aunt
what a fancy said i
yes
i know i am a silly little thing said dora slowly looking from one of us to the other and then putting up her pretty lips to kiss us as she lay upon her couch
well then you must both go or i shall not believe you and then i shall cry i saw in my aunts face that she began to give way now and dora brightened again as she saw it too
youll come back with so much to tell me that itll take at least a week to make me understand said dora
because i know i shant understand for a length of time if theres any business in it
and theres sure to be some business in it
if theres anything to add up besides i dont know when i shall make it out and my bad boy will look so miserable all the time
there
now youll go wont you
youll only be gone one night and jip will take care of me while you are gone
doady will carry me upstairs before you go and i wont come down again till you come back and you shall take agnes a dreadfully scolding letter from me because she has never been to see us we agreed without any more consultation that we would both go and that dora was a little impostor who feigned to be rather unwell because she liked to be petted
she was greatly pleased and very merry and we four that is to say my aunt mr dick traddles and i went down to canterbury by the dover mail that night
at the hotel where mr micawber had requested us to await him which we got into with some trouble in the middle of the night i found a letter importing that he would appear in the morning punctually at half past nine
after which we went shivering at that uncomfortable hour to our respective beds through various close passages which smelt as if they had been steeped for ages in a solution of soup and stables
early in the morning i sauntered through the dear old tranquil streets and again mingled with the shadows of the venerable gateways and churches
the rooks were sailing about the cathedral towers and the towers themselves overlooking many a long unaltered mile of the rich country and its pleasant streams were cutting the bright morning air as if there were no such thing as change on earth
yet the bells when they sounded told me sorrowfully of change in everything told me of their own age and my pretty doras youth and of the many never old who had lived and loved and died while the reverberations of the bells had hummed through the rusty armour of the black prince hanging up within and motes upon the deep of time had lost themselves in air as circles do in water
i looked at the old house from the corner of the street but did not go nearer to it lest being observed i might unwittingly do any harm to the design i had come to aid
the early sun was striking edgewise on its gables and latticewindows touching them with gold and some beams of its old peace seemed to touch my heart
i strolled into the country for an hour or so and then returned by the main street which in the interval had shaken off its last nights sleep
among those who were stirring in the shops i saw my ancient enemy the butcher now advanced to topboots and a baby and in business for himself
he was nursing the baby and appeared to be a benignant member of society
we all became very anxious and impatient when we sat down to breakfast
as it approached nearer and nearer to half past nine oclock our restless expectation of mr micawber increased
at last we made no more pretence of attending to the meal which except with mr dick had been a mere form from the first but my aunt walked up and down the room
traddles sat upon the sofa affecting to read the paper with his eyes on the ceiling and i looked out of the window to give early notice of mr micawbers coming
nor had i long to watch for at the first chime of the half hour he appeared in the street
here he is said i and not in his legal attire my aunt tied the strings of her bonnet she had come down to breakfast in it and put on her shawl as if she were ready for anything that was resolute and uncompromising
traddles buttoned his coat with a determined air
mr dick disturbed by these formidable appearances but feeling it necessary to imitate them pulled his hat with both hands as firmly over his ears as he possibly could and instantly took it off again to welcome mr micawber
gentlemen and madam said mr micawber good morning
my dear sir to mr dick who shook hands with him violently you are extremely good have you breakfasted said mr dick
have a chop not for the world my good sir cried mr micawber stopping him on his way to the bell appetite and myself mr dixon have long been strangers mr dixon was so well pleased with his new name and appeared to think it so obliging in mr micawber to confer it upon him that he shook hands with him again and laughed rather childishly
dick said my aunt attention mr dick recovered himself with a blush
now sir said my aunt to mr micawber as she put on her gloves we are ready for mount vesuvius or anything else as soon as you please madam returned mr micawber i trust you will shortly witness an eruption
mr traddles i have your permission i believe to mention here that we have been in communication together it is undoubtedly the fact copperfield said traddles to whom i looked in surprise
mr
micawber has consulted me in reference to what he has in contemplation and i have advised him to the best of my judgement unless i deceive myself mr traddles pursued mr micawber what i contemplate is a disclosure of an important nature highly so said traddles
perhaps under such circumstances madam and gentlemen said mr micawber you will do me the favour to submit yourselves for the moment to the direction of one who however unworthy to be regarded in any other light but as a waif and stray upon the shore of human nature is still your fellowman though crushed out of his original form by individual errors and the accumulative force of a combination of circumstances we have perfect confidence in you mr micawber said i and will do what you please mr
copperfield returned mr micawber your confidence is not at the existing juncture illbestowed
i would beg to be allowed a start of five minutes by the clock and then to receive the present company inquiring for miss wickfield at the office of wickfield and heep whose stipendiary i am my aunt and i looked at traddles who nodded his approval
i have no more observed mr micawber to say at present with which to my infinite surprise he included us all in a comprehensive bow and disappeared his manner being extremely distant and his face extremely pale
traddles only smiled and shook his head with his hair standing upright on the top of it when i looked to him for an explanation so i took out my watch and as a last resource counted off the five minutes
my aunt with her own watch in her hand did the like
when the time was expired traddles gave her his arm and we all went out together to the old house without saying one word on the way
we found mr micawber at his desk in the turret office on the ground floor either writing or pretending to write hard
the large officeruler was stuck into his waistcoat and was not so well concealed but that a foot or more of that instrument protruded from his bosom like a new kind of shirtfrill
as it appeared to me that i was expected to speak i said aloud how do you do mr micawber mr
copperfield said mr micawber gravely i hope i see you well is miss wickfield at home said i
mr
wickfield is unwell in bed sir of a rheumatic fever he returned but miss wickfield i have no doubt will be happy to see old friends
will you walk in sir he preceded us to the diningroomthe first room i had entered in that houseand flinging open the door of mr wickfields former office said in a sonorous voice miss trotwood mr david copperfield mr thomas traddles and mr dixon i had not seen uriah heep since the time of the blow
our visit astonished him evidently not the less i dare say because it astonished ourselves
he did not gather his eyebrows together for he had none worth mentioning but he frowned to that degree that he almost closed his small eyes while the hurried raising of his grisly hand to his chin betrayed some trepidation or surprise
this was only when we were in the act of entering his room and when i caught a glance at him over my aunts shoulder
a moment afterwards he was as fawning and as humble as ever
well i am sure he said
this is indeed an unexpected pleasure
to have as i may say all friends round st pauls at once is a treat unlooked for
mr copperfield i hope i see you well andif i may umbly express myself sofriendly towards them as is ever your friends whether or not
mrs copperfield sir i hope shes getting on
we have been made quite uneasy by the poor accounts we have had of her state lately i do assure you i felt ashamed to let him take my hand but i did not know yet what else to do
things are changed in this office miss trotwood since i was an umble clerk and held your pony aint they said uriah with his sickliest smile
but i am not changed miss trotwood well sir returned my aunt to tell you the truth i think you are pretty constant to the promise of your youth if thats any satisfaction to you thank you miss trotwood said uriah writhing in his ungainly manner for your good opinion
micawber tell em to let miss agnes knowand mother
mother will be quite in a state when she sees the present company said uriah setting chairs
you are not busy mr heep said traddles whose eye the cunning red eye accidentally caught as it at once scrutinized and evaded us
no mr traddles replied uriah resuming his official seat and squeezing his bony hands laid palm to palm between his bony knees
not so much so as i could wish
but lawyers sharks and leeches are not easily satisfied you know
not but what myself and micawber have our hands pretty full in general on account of mr wickfields being hardly fit for any occupation sir
but its a pleasure as well as a duty i am sure to work for him
youve not been intimate with mr wickfield i think mr traddles
i believe ive only had the honour of seeing you once myself no i have not been intimate with mr wickfield returned traddles or i might perhaps have waited on you long ago mr heep there was something in the tone of this reply which made uriah look at the speaker again with a very sinister and suspicious expression
but seeing only traddles with his goodnatured face simple manner and hair on end he dismissed it as he replied with a jerk of his whole body but especially his throat i am sorry for that mr traddles
you would have admired him as much as we all do
his little failings would only have endeared him to you the more
but if you would like to hear my fellowpartner eloquently spoken of i should refer you to copperfield
the family is a subject hes very strong upon if you never heard him i was prevented from disclaiming the compliment if i should have done so in any case by the entrance of agnes now ushered in by mr micawber
she was not quite so selfpossessed as usual i thought and had evidently undergone anxiety and fatigue
but her earnest cordiality and her quiet beauty shone with the gentler lustre for it
i saw uriah watch her while she greeted us and he reminded me of an ugly and rebellious genie watching a good spirit
in the meanwhile some slight sign passed between mr micawber and traddles and traddles unobserved except by me went out
dont wait micawber said uriah
mr micawber with his hand upon the ruler in his breast stood erect before the door most unmistakably contemplating one of his fellowmen and that man his employer
what are you waiting for said uriah
micawber
did you hear me tell you not to wait yes replied the immovable mr micawber
then why do you wait said uriah
because iin short choose replied mr micawber with a burst
uriahs cheeks lost colour and an unwholesome paleness still faintly tinged by his pervading red overspread them
he looked at mr micawber attentively with his whole face breathing short and quick in every feature
you are a dissipated fellow as all the world knows he said with an effort at a smile and i am afraid youll oblige me to get rid of you
go along
ill talk to you presently if there is a scoundrel on this earth said mr micawber suddenly breaking out again with the utmost vehemence with whom i have already talked too much that scoundrels name isheep uriah fell back as if he had been struck or stung
looking slowly round upon us with the darkest and wickedest expression that his face could wear he said in a lower voice oho
this is a conspiracy
you have met here by appointment
you are playing booty with my clerk are you copperfield
now take care
youll make nothing of this
we understand each other you and me
theres no love between us
you were always a puppy with a proud stomach from your first coming here and you envy me my rise do you
none of your plots against me ill counterplot you
micawber you be off
ill talk to you presently mr
micawber said i there is a sudden change in this fellow in more respects than the extraordinary one of his speaking the truth in one particular which assures me that he is brought to bay
deal with him as he deserves you are a precious set of people aint you said uriah in the same low voice and breaking out into a clammy heat which he wiped from his forehead with his long lean hand to buy over my clerk who is the very scum of societyas you yourself were copperfield you know it before anyone had charity on youto defame me with his lies
miss trotwood you had better stop this or ill stop your husband shorter than will be pleasant to you
i wont know your story professionally for nothing old lady
miss wickfield if you have any love for your father you had better not join that gang
ill ruin him if you do
now come
i have got some of you under the harrow
think twice before it goes over you
think twice you micawber if you dont want to be crushed
i recommend you to take yourself off and be talked to presently you fool
while theres time to retreat
wheres mother he said suddenly appearing to notice with alarm the absence of traddles and pulling down the bellrope
fine doings in a persons own house mrs
heep is here sir said traddles returning with that worthy mother of a worthy son
i have taken the liberty of making myself known to her who are you to make yourself known retorted uriah
and what do you want here i am the agent and friend of mr wickfield sir said traddles in a composed and businesslike way
and i have a power of attorney from him in my pocket to act for him in all matters the old ass has drunk himself into a state of dotage said uriah turning uglier than before and it has been got from him by fraud something has been got from him by fraud i know returned traddles quietly and so do you mr heep
we will refer that question if you please to mr micawber ury mrs heep began with an anxious gesture
you hold your tongue mother he returned least said soonest mended but my ury will you hold your tongue mother and leave it to me though i had long known that his servility was false and all his pretences knavish and hollow i had had no adequate conception of the extent of his hypocrisy until i now saw him with his mask off
the suddenness with which he dropped it when he perceived that it was useless to him the malice insolence and hatred he revealed the leer with which he exulted even at this moment in the evil he had doneall this time being desperate too and at his wits end for the means of getting the better of usthough perfectly consistent with the experience i had of him at first took even me by surprise who had known him so long and disliked him so heartily
i say nothing of the look he conferred on me as he stood eyeing us one after another for i had always understood that he hated me and i remembered the marks of my hand upon his cheek
but when his eyes passed on to agnes and i saw the rage with which he felt his power over her slipping away and the exhibition in their disappointment of the odious passions that had led him to aspire to one whose virtues he could never appreciate or care for i was shocked by the mere thought of her having lived an hour within sight of such a man
after some rubbing of the lower part of his face and some looking at us with those bad eyes over his grisly fingers he made one more address to me half whining and half abusive
you think it justifiable do you copperfield you who pride yourself so much on your honour and all the rest of it to sneak about my place eavesdropping with my clerk
if it had been me i shouldnt have wondered for i dont make myself out a gentleman though i never was in the streets either as you were according to micawber but being youand youre not afraid of doing this either
you dont think at all of what i shall do in return or of getting yourself into trouble for conspiracy and so forth
very well
we shall see
mr whatsyourname you were going to refer some question to micawber
theres your referee
why dont you make him speak
he has learnt his lesson i see seeing that what he said had no effect on me or any of us he sat on the edge of his table with his hands in his pockets and one of his splay feet twisted round the other leg waiting doggedly for what might follow
mr micawber whose impetuosity i had restrained thus far with the greatest difficulty and who had repeatedly interposed with the first syllable of scoundrel
without getting to the second now burst forward drew the ruler from his breast apparently as a defensive weapon and produced from his pocket a foolscap document folded in the form of a large letter
opening this packet with his old flourish and glancing at the contents as if he cherished an artistic admiration of their style of composition he began to read as follows dear miss trotwood and gentlemen bless and save the man exclaimed my aunt in a low voice
hed write letters by the ream if it was a capital offence mr micawber without hearing her went on
in appearing before you to denounce probably the most consummate villain that has ever existed mr micawber without looking off the letter pointed the ruler like a ghostly truncheon at uriah heep i ask no consideration for myself
the victim from my cradle of pecuniary liabilities to which i have been unable to respond i have ever been the sport and toy of debasing circumstances
ignominy want despair and madness have collectively or separately been the attendants of my career the relish with which mr micawber described himself as a prey to these dismal calamities was only to be equalled by the emphasis with which he read his letter and the kind of homage he rendered to it with a roll of his head when he thought he had hit a sentence very hard indeed
in an accumulation of ignominy want despair and madness i entered the officeor as our lively neighbour the gaul would term it the bureauof the firm nominally conducted under the appellation of wickfield andheep but in reality wielded byheep alone
heep and only heep is the mainspring of that machine
heep and only heep is the forger and the cheat uriah more blue than white at these words made a dart at the letter as if to tear it in pieces
mr micawber with a perfect miracle of dexterity or luck caught his advancing knuckles with the ruler and disabled his right hand
it dropped at the wrist as if it were broken
the blow sounded as if it had fallen on wood
the devil take you said uriah writhing in a new way with pain
ill be even with you approach me again youyouyou heep of infamy gasped mr micawber and if your head is human ill break it
come on come on i think i never saw anything more ridiculousi was sensible of it even at the timethan mr micawber making broadsword guards with the ruler and crying come on while traddles and i pushed him back into a corner from which as often as we got him into it he persisted in emerging again
his enemy muttering to himself after wringing his wounded hand for sometime slowly drew off his neckkerchief and bound it up then held it in his other hand and sat upon his table with his sullen face looking down
mr micawber when he was sufficiently cool proceeded with his letter
the stipendiary emoluments in consideration of which i entered into the service ofheep always pausing before that word and uttering it with astonishing vigour were not defined beyond the pittance of twentytwo shillings and six per week
the rest was left contingent on the value of my professional exertions in other and more expressive words on the baseness of my nature the cupidity of my motives the poverty of my family the general moral or rather immoral resemblance between myself andheep
need i say that it soon became necessary for me to solicit fromheeppecuniary advances towards the support of mrs micawber and our blighted but rising family
need i say that this necessity had been foreseen byheep
that those advances were secured by ious and other similar acknowledgements known to the legal institutions of this country
and that i thus became immeshed in the web he had spun for my reception mr micawbers enjoyment of his epistolary powers in describing this unfortunate state of things really seemed to outweigh any pain or anxiety that the reality could have caused him
he read on then it was thatheepbegan to favour me with just so much of his confidence as was necessary to the discharge of his infernal business
then it was that i began if i may so shakespearianly express myself to dwindle peak and pine
i found that my services were constantly called into requisition for the falsification of business and the mystification of an individual whom i will designate as mr w that mr w was imposed upon kept in ignorance and deluded in every possible way yet that all this while the ruffianheepwas professing unbounded gratitude to and unbounded friendship for that muchabused gentleman
this was bad enough but as the philosophic dane observes with that universal applicability which distinguishes the illustrious ornament of the elizabethan era worse remains behind mr micawber was so very much struck by this happy rounding off with a quotation that he indulged himself and us with a second reading of the sentence under pretence of having lost his place
it is not my intention he continued reading on to enter on a detailed list within the compass of the present epistle though it is ready elsewhere of the various malpractices of a minor nature affecting the individual whom i have denominated mr w to which i have been a tacitly consenting party
my object when the contest within myself between stipend and no stipend baker and no baker existence and nonexistence ceased was to take advantage of my opportunities to discover and expose the major malpractices committed to that gentlemans grievous wrong and injury byheep
stimulated by the silent monitor within and by a no less touching and appealing monitor withoutto whom i will briefly refer as miss wi entered on a not unlaborious task of clandestine investigation protractednow to the best of my knowledge information and belief over a period exceeding twelve calendar months he read this passage as if it were from an act of parliament and appeared majestically refreshed by the sound of the words
my charges againstheep he read on glancing at him and drawing the ruler into a convenient position under his left arm in case of need are as follows we all held our breath i think
i am sure uriah held his
first said mr micawber when mr ws faculties and memory for business became through causes into which it is not necessary or expedient for me to enter weakened and confusedheepdesignedly perplexed and complicated the whole of the official transactions
when mr w was least fit to enter on businessheep was always at hand to force him to enter on it
he obtained mr ws signature under such circumstances to documents of importance representing them to be other documents of no importance
he induced mr w to empower him to draw out thus one particular sum of trustmoney amounting to twelve six fourteen two and nine and employed it to meet pretended business charges and deficiencies which were either already provided for or had never really existed
he gave this proceeding throughout the appearance of having originated in mr ws own dishonest intention and of having been accomplished by mr ws own dishonest act and has used it ever since to torture and constrain him you shall prove this you copperfield said uriah with a threatening shake of the head
all in good time askheepmr traddles who lived in his house after him said mr micawber breaking off from the letter will you the fool himselfand lives there now said uriah disdainfully
askheepif he ever kept a pocketbook in that house said mr micawber will you i saw uriahs lank hand stop involuntarily in the scraping of his chin
or ask him said mr micawber if he ever burnt one there
if he says yes and asks you where the ashes are refer him to wilkins micawber and he will hear of something not at all to his advantage the triumphant flourish with which mr micawber delivered himself of these words had a powerful effect in alarming the mother who cried out in much agitation ury ury
be umble and make terms my dear mother he retorted will you keep quiet
youre in a fright and dont know what you say or mean
umble he repeated looking at me with a snarl ive umbled some of em for a pretty long time back umble as i was mr micawber genteelly adjusting his chin in his cravat presently proceeded with his composition
second
heep has on several occasions to the best of my knowledge information and belief but that wont do muttered uriah relieved
mother you keep quiet we will endeavour to provide something that will do and do for you finally sir very shortly replied mr micawber
second
heep has on several occasions to the best of my knowledge information and belief systematically forged to various entries books and documents the signature of mr w and has distinctly done so in one instance capable of proof by me
to wit in manner following that is to say again mr micawber had a relish in this formal piling up of words which however ludicrously displayed in his case was i must say not at all peculiar to him
i have observed it in the course of my life in numbers of men
it seems to me to be a general rule
in the taking of legal oaths for instance deponents seem to enjoy themselves mightily when they come to several good words in succession for the expression of one idea as that they utterly detest abominate and abjure or so forth and the old anathemas were made relishing on the same principle
we talk about the tyranny of words but we like to tyrannize over them too we are fond of having a large superfluous establishment of words to wait upon us on great occasions we think it looks important and sounds well
as we are not particular about the meaning of our liveries on state occasions if they be but fine and numerous enough so the meaning or necessity of our words is a secondary consideration if there be but a great parade of them
and as individuals get into trouble by making too great a show of liveries or as slaves when they are too numerous rise against their masters so i think i could mention a nation that has got into many great difficulties and will get into many greater from maintaining too large a retinue of words
mr micawber read on almost smacking his lips to wit in manner following that is to say
mr w being infirm and it being within the bounds of probability that his decease might lead to some discoveries and to the downfall ofheepspower over the w familyas i wilkins micawber the undersigned assumeunless the filial affection of his daughter could be secretly influenced from allowing any investigation of the partnership affairs to be ever made the saidheepdeemed it expedient to have a bond ready by him as from mr w for the beforementioned sum of twelve six fourteen two and nine with interest stated therein to have been advanced byheepto mr w to save mr w from dishonour though really the sum was never advanced by him and has long been replaced
the signatures to this instrument purporting to be executed by mr w and attested by wilkins micawber are forgeries byheep
i have in my possession in his hand and pocketbook several similar imitations of mr ws signature here and there defaced by fire but legible to anyone
i never attested any such document
and i have the document itself in my possession uriah heep with a start took out of his pocket a bunch of keys and opened a certain drawer then suddenly bethought himself of what he was about and turned again towards us without looking in it
and i have the document mr micawber read again looking about as if it were the text of a sermon in my possessionthat is to say i had early this morning when this was written but have since relinquished it to mr traddles it is quite true assented traddles
ury ury cried the mother be umble and make terms
i know my son will be umble gentlemen if youll give him time to think
mr copperfield im sure you know that he was always very umble sir it was singular to see how the mother still held to the old trick when the son had abandoned it as useless
mother he said with an impatient bite at the handkerchief in which his hand was wrapped you had better take and fire a loaded gun at me but i love you ury cried mrs heep
and i have no doubt she did or that he loved her however strange it may appear though to be sure they were a congenial couple
and i cant bear to hear you provoking the gentlemen and endangering of yourself more
i told the gentleman at first when he told me upstairs it was come to light that i would answer for your being umble and making amends
oh see how umble i am gentlemen and dont mind him why theres copperfield mother he angrily retorted pointing his lean finger at me against whom all his animosity was levelled as the prime mover in the discovery and i did not undeceive him theres copperfield would have given you a hundred pound to say less than youve blurted out i cant help it ury cried his mother
i cant see you running into danger through carrying your head so high
better be umble as you always was he remained for a little biting the handkerchief and then said to me with a scowl what more have you got to bring forward
if anything go on with it
what do you look at me for mr micawber promptly resumed his letter glad to revert to a performance with which he was so highly satisfied
third
and last
i am now in a condition to show byheepsfalse books andheepsreal memoranda beginning with the partially destroyed pocketbook which i was unable to comprehend at the time of its accidental discovery by mrs micawber on our taking possession of our present abode in the locker or bin devoted to the reception of the ashes calcined on our domestic hearth that the weaknesses the faults the very virtues the parental affections and the sense of honour of the unhappy mr w have been for years acted on by and warped to the base purposes ofheep
that mr w has been for years deluded and plundered in every conceivable manner to the pecuniary aggrandisement of the avaricious false and graspingheep
that the engrossing object ofheepwas next to gain to subdue mr and miss w of his ulterior views in reference to the latter i say nothing entirely to himself
that his last act completed but a few months since was to induce mr w to execute a relinquishment of his share in the partnership and even a bill of sale on the very furniture of his house in consideration of a certain annuity to be well and truly paid byheepon the four common quarterdays in each and every year
that these meshes beginning with alarming and falsified accounts of the estate of which mr w is the receiver at a period when mr w had launched into imprudent and illjudged speculations and may not have had the money for which he was morally and legally responsible in hand going on with pretended borrowings of money at enormous interest really coming fromheepand byheepfraudulently obtained or withheld from mr w himself on pretence of such speculations or otherwise perpetuated by a miscellaneous catalogue of unscrupulous chicaneriesgradually thickened until the unhappy mr w could see no world beyond
bankrupt as he believed alike in circumstances in all other hope and in honour his sole reliance was upon the monster in the garb of manmr micawber made a good deal of this as a new turn of expressionwho by making himself necessary to him had achieved his destruction
all this i undertake to show
probably much more i whispered a few words to agnes who was weeping half joyfully half sorrowfully at my side and there was a movement among us as if mr micawber had finished
he said with exceeding gravity pardon me and proceeded with a mixture of the lowest spirits and the most intense enjoyment to the peroration of his letter
i have now concluded
it merely remains for me to substantiate these accusations and then with my illstarred family to disappear from the landscape on which we appear to be an encumbrance
that is soon done
it may be reasonably inferred that our baby will first expire of inanition as being the frailest member of our circle and that our twins will follow next in order
so be it
for myself my canterbury pilgrimage has done much imprisonment on civil process and want will soon do more
i trust that the labour and hazard of an investigationof which the smallest results have been slowly pieced together in the pressure of arduous avocations under grinding penurious apprehensions at rise of morn at dewy eve in the shadows of night under the watchful eye of one whom it were superfluous to call demoncombined with the struggle of parental poverty to turn it when completed to the right account may be as the sprinkling of a few drops of sweet water on my funeral pyre
i ask no more
let it be in justice merely said of me as of a gallant and eminent naval hero with whom i have no pretensions to cope that what i have done i did in despite of mercenary and selfish objects for england home and beauty
remaining always c c wilkins micawber much affected but still intensely enjoying himself mr micawber folded up his letter and handed it with a bow to my aunt as something she might like to keep
there was as i had noticed on my first visit long ago an iron safe in the room
the key was in it
a hasty suspicion seemed to strike uriah and with a glance at mr micawber he went to it and threw the doors clanking open
it was empty
where are the books he cried with a frightful face
some thief has stolen the books mr micawber tapped himself with the ruler
i did when i got the key from you as usualbut a little earlierand opened it this morning dont be uneasy said traddles
they have come into my possession
i will take care of them under the authority i mentioned you receive stolen goods do you cried uriah
under such circumstances answered traddles yes what was my astonishment when i beheld my aunt who had been profoundly quiet and attentive make a dart at uriah heep and seize him by the collar with both hands
you know what i want said my aunt
a straitwaistcoat said he
no
my property returned my aunt
agnes my dear as long as i believed it had been really made away with by your father i wouldntand my dear i didnt even to trot as he knowsbreathe a syllable of its having been placed here for investment
but now i know this fellows answerable for it and ill have it
trot come and take it away from him whether my aunt supposed for the moment that he kept her property in his neckkerchief i am sure i dont know but she certainly pulled at it as if she thought so
i hastened to put myself between them and to assure her that we would all take care that he should make the utmost restitution of everything he had wrongly got
this and a few moments reflection pacified her but she was not at all disconcerted by what she had done though i cannot say as much for her bonnet and resumed her seat composedly
during the last few minutes mrs heep had been clamouring to her son to be umble and had been going down on her knees to all of us in succession and making the wildest promises
her son sat her down in his chair and standing sulkily by her holding her arm with his hand but not rudely said to me with a ferocious look what do you want done i will tell you what must be done said traddles
has that copperfield no tongue muttered uriah i would do a good deal for you if you could tell me without lying that somebody had cut it out my uriah means to be umble cried his mother
dont mind what he says good gentlemen what must be done said traddles is this
first the deed of relinquishment that we have heard of must be given over to me nowhere suppose i havent got it he interrupted
but you have said traddles therefore you know we wont suppose so and i cannot help avowing that this was the first occasion on which i really did justice to the clear head and the plain patient practical good sense of my old schoolfellow
then said traddles you must prepare to disgorge all that your rapacity has become possessed of and to make restoration to the last farthing
all the partnership books and papers must remain in our possession all your books and papers all money accounts and securities of both kinds
in short everything here must it
i dont know that said uriah
i must have time to think about that certainly replied traddles but in the meanwhile and until everything is done to our satisfaction we shall maintain possession of these things and beg youin short compel youto keep to your own room and hold no communication with anyone i wont do it said uriah with an oath
maidstone jail is a safer place of detention observed traddles and though the law may be longer in righting us and may not be able to right us so completely as you can there is no doubt of its punishing you
dear me you know that quite as well as i
copperfield will you go round to the guildhall and bring a couple of officers here mrs heep broke out again crying on her knees to agnes to interfere in their behalf exclaiming that he was very humble and it was all true and if he didnt do what we wanted she would and much more to the same purpose being half frantic with fears for her darling
to inquire what he might have done if he had had any boldness would be like inquiring what a mongrel cur might do if it had the spirit of a tiger
he was a coward from head to foot and showed his dastardly nature through his sullenness and mortification as much as at any time of his mean life
stop he growled to me and wiped his hot face with his hand
mother hold your noise
well
let em have that deed
go and fetch it do you help her mr dick said traddles if you please proud of his commission and understanding it mr dick accompanied her as a shepherds dog might accompany a sheep
but mrs heep gave him little trouble for she not only returned with the deed but with the box in which it was where we found a bankers book and some other papers that were afterwards serviceable
good said traddles when this was brought
now mr heep you can retire to think particularly observing if you please that i declare to you on the part of all present that there is only one thing to be done that it is what i have explained and that it must be done without delay uriah without lifting his eyes from the ground shuffled across the room with his hand to his chin and pausing at the door said copperfield i have always hated you
youve always been an upstart and youve always been against me as i think i told you once before said i it is you who have been in your greed and cunning against all the world
it may be profitable to you to reflect in future that there never were greed and cunning in the world yet that did not do too much and overreach themselves
it is as certain as death or as certain as they used to teach at school the same school where i picked up so much umbleness from nine oclock to eleven that labour was a curse and from eleven oclock to one that it was a blessing and a cheerfulness and a dignity and i dont know what all eh said he with a sneer
you preach about as consistent as they did
wont umbleness go down
i shouldnt have got round my gentleman fellowpartner without it i think
micawber you old bully ill pay you mr micawber supremely defiant of him and his extended finger and making a great deal of his chest until he had slunk out at the door then addressed himself to me and proffered me the satisfaction of witnessing the reestablishment of mutual confidence between himself and mrs micawber
after which he invited the company generally to the contemplation of that affecting spectacle
the veil that has long been interposed between mrs micawber and myself is now withdrawn said mr micawber and my children and the author of their being can once more come in contact on equal terms as we were all very grateful to him and all desirous to show that we were as well as the hurry and disorder of our spirits would permit i dare say we should all have gone but that it was necessary for agnes to return to her father as yet unable to bear more than the dawn of hope and for someone else to hold uriah in safe keeping
so traddles remained for the latter purpose to be presently relieved by mr dick and mr dick my aunt and i went home with mr micawber
as i parted hurriedly from the dear girl to whom i owed so much and thought from what she had been saved perhaps that morningher better resolution notwithstandingi felt devoutly thankful for the miseries of my younger days which had brought me to the knowledge of mr micawber
his house was not far off and as the street door opened into the sittingroom and he bolted in with a precipitation quite his own we found ourselves at once in the bosom of the family
mr micawber exclaiming emma
my life rushed into mrs micawbers arms
mrs micawber shrieked and folded mr micawber in her embrace
miss micawber nursing the unconscious stranger of mrs micawbers last letter to me was sensibly affected
the stranger leaped
the twins testified their joy by several inconvenient but innocent demonstrations
master micawber whose disposition appeared to have been soured by early disappointment and whose aspect had become morose yielded to his better feelings and blubbered
emma said mr micawber
the cloud is past from my mind
mutual confidence so long preserved between us once is restored to know no further interruption
now welcome poverty cried mr micawber shedding tears
welcome misery welcome houselessness welcome hunger rags tempest and beggary
mutual confidence will sustain us to the end with these expressions mr micawber placed mrs micawber in a chair and embraced the family all round welcoming a variety of bleak prospects which appeared to the best of my judgement to be anything but welcome to them and calling upon them to come out into canterbury and sing a chorus as nothing else was left for their support
but mrs micawber having in the strength of her emotions fainted away the first thing to be done even before the chorus could be considered complete was to recover her
this my aunt and mr micawber did and then my aunt was introduced and mrs micawber recognized me
excuse me dear mr copperfield said the poor lady giving me her hand but i am not strong and the removal of the late misunderstanding between mr micawber and myself was at first too much for me is this all your family maam said my aunt
there are no more at present returned mrs micawber
good gracious i didnt mean that maam said my aunt
i mean are all these yours madam replied mr micawber it is a true bill and that eldest young gentleman now said my aunt musing what has he been brought up to it was my hope when i came here said mr micawber to have got wilkins into the church or perhaps i shall express my meaning more strictly if i say the choir
but there was no vacancy for a tenor in the venerable pile for which this city is so justly eminent and he hasin short he has contracted a habit of singing in publichouses rather than in sacred edifices but he means well said mrs micawber tenderly
i dare say my love rejoined mr micawber that he means particularly well but i have not yet found that he carries out his meaning in any given direction whatsoever master micawbers moroseness of aspect returned upon him again and he demanded with some temper what he was to do
whether he had been born a carpenter or a coachpainter any more than he had been born a bird
whether he could go into the next street and open a chemists shop
whether he could rush to the next assizes and proclaim himself a lawyer
whether he could come out by force at the opera and succeed by violence
whether he could do anything without being brought up to something
my aunt mused a little while and then said mr
micawber i wonder you have never turned your thoughts to emigration madam returned mr micawber it was the dream of my youth and the fallacious aspiration of my riper years i am thoroughly persuaded by the by that he had never thought of it in his life
aye said my aunt with a glance at me
why what a thing it would be for yourselves and your family mr and mrs micawber if you were to emigrate now capital madam capital urged mr micawber gloomily
that is the principal i may say the only difficulty my dear mr copperfield assented his wife
capital cried my aunt
but you are doing us a great servicehave done us a great service i may say for surely much will come out of the fireand what could we do for you that would be half so good as to find the capital i could not receive it as a gift said mr micawber full of fire and animation but if a sufficient sum could be advanced say at five per cent interest per annum upon my personal liabilitysay my notes of hand at twelve eighteen and twentyfour months respectively to allow time for something to turn up could be
can be and shall be on your own terms returned my aunt if you say the word
think of this now both of you
here are some people david knows going out to australia shortly
if you decide to go why shouldnt you go in the same ship
you may help each other
think of this now mr and mrs micawber
take your time and weigh it well there is but one question my dear maam i could wish to ask said mrs micawber
the climate i believe is healthy finest in the world said my aunt
just so returned mrs micawber
then my question arises
now are the circumstances of the country such that a man of mr micawbers abilities would have a fair chance of rising in the social scale
i will not say at present might he aspire to be governor or anything of that sort but would there be a reasonable opening for his talents to develop themselvesthat would be amply sufficientand find their own expansion no better opening anywhere said my aunt for a man who conducts himself well and is industrious for a man who conducts himself well repeated mrs micawber with her clearest business manner and is industrious
precisely
it is evident to me that australia is the legitimate sphere of action for mr micawber i entertain the conviction my dear madam said mr micawber that it is under existing circumstances the land the only land for myself and family and that something of an extraordinary nature will turn up on that shore
it is no distancecomparatively speaking and though consideration is due to the kindness of your proposal i assure you that is a mere matter of form shall i ever forget how in a moment he was the most sanguine of men looking on to fortune or how mrs micawber presently discoursed about the habits of the kangaroo
shall i ever recall that street of canterbury on a marketday without recalling him as he walked back with us expressing in the hardy roving manner he assumed the unsettled habits of a temporary sojourner in the land and looking at the bullocks as they came by with the eye of an australian farmer
i must pause yet once again
o my childwife there is a figure in the moving crowd before my memory quiet and still saying in its innocent love and childish beauty stop to think of meturn to look upon the little blossom as it flutters to the ground
i do
all else grows dim and fades away
i am again with dora in our cottage
i do not know how long she has been ill
i am so used to it in feeling that i cannot count the time
it is not really long in weeks or months but in my usage and experience it is a weary weary while
they have left off telling me to wait a few days more
i have begun to fear remotely that the day may never shine when i shall see my childwife running in the sunlight with her old friend jip
he is as it were suddenly grown very old
it may be that he misses in his mistress something that enlivened him and made him younger but he mopes and his sight is weak and his limbs are feeble and my aunt is sorry that he objects to her no more but creeps near her as he lies on doras bedshe sitting at the bedsideand mildly licks her hand
dora lies smiling on us and is beautiful and utters no hasty or complaining word
she says that we are very good to her that her dear old careful boy is tiring himself out she knows that my aunt has no sleep yet is always wakeful active and kind
sometimes the little birdlike ladies come to see her and then we talk about our weddingday and all that happy time
what a strange rest and pause in my life there seems to beand in all life within doors and withoutwhen i sit in the quiet shaded orderly room with the blue eyes of my childwife turned towards me and her little fingers twining round my hand
many and many an hour i sit thus but of all those times three times come the freshest on my mind
it is morning and dora made so trim by my aunts hands shows me how her pretty hair will curl upon the pillow yet an how long and bright it is and how she likes to have it loosely gathered in that net she wears
not that i am vain of it now you mocking boy she says when i smile but because you used to say you thought it so beautiful and because when i first began to think about you i used to peep in the glass and wonder whether you would like very much to have a lock of it
oh what a foolish fellow you were doady when i gave you one that was on the day when you were painting the flowers i had given you dora and when i told you how much in love i was ah
but i didnt like to tell you says dora then how i had cried over them because i believed you really liked me
when i can run about again as i used to do doady let us go and see those places where we were such a silly couple shall we
and take some of the old walks
and not forget poor papa yes we will and have some happy days
so you must make haste to get well my dear oh i shall soon do that
i am so much better you dont know it is evening and i sit in the same chair by the same bed with the same face turned towards me
we have been silent and there is a smile upon her face
i have ceased to carry my light burden up and down stairs now
she lies here all the day
doady my dear dora you wont think what i am going to say unreasonable after what you told me such a little while ago of mr wickfields not being well
i want to see agnes
very much i want to see her i will write to her my dear will you directly what a good kind boy
doady take me on your arm
indeed my dear its not a whim
its not a foolish fancy
i want very much indeed to see her i am certain of it
i have only to tell her so and she is sure to come you are very lonely when you go downstairs now dora whispers with her arm about my neck
how can i be otherwise my own love when i see your empty chair my empty chair she clings to me for a little while in silence
and you really miss me doady looking up and brightly smiling
even poor giddy stupid me my heart who is there upon earth that i could miss so much oh husband
i am so glad yet so sorry creeping closer to me and folding me in both her arms
she laughs and sobs and then is quiet and quite happy
quite she says
only give agnes my dear love and tell her that i want very very much to see her and i have nothing left to wish for except to get well again dora ah doady
sometimes i thinkyou know i always was a silly little thingthat that will never be dont say so dora
dearest love dont think so i wont if i can help it doady
but i am very happy though my dear boy is so lonely by himself before his childwifes empty chair it is night and i am with her still
agnes has arrived has been among us for a whole day and an evening
she my aunt and i have sat with dora since the morning all together
we have not talked much but dora has been perfectly contented and cheerful
we are now alone
do i know now that my childwife will soon leave me
they have told me so they have told me nothing new to my thoughtsbut i am far from sure that i have taken that truth to heart
i cannot master it
i have withdrawn by myself many times today to weep
i have remembered who wept for a parting between the living and the dead
i have bethought me of all that gracious and compassionate history
i have tried to resign myself and to console myself and that i hope i may have done imperfectly but what i cannot firmly settle in my mind is that the end will absolutely come
i hold her hand in mine i hold her heart in mine i see her love for me alive in all its strength
i cannot shut out a pale lingering shadow of belief that she will be spared
i am going to speak to you doady
i am going to say something i have often thought of saying lately
you wont mind with a gentle look
mind my darling because i dont know what you will think or what you may have thought sometimes
perhaps you have often thought the same
doady dear i am afraid i was too young i lay my face upon the pillow by her and she looks into my eyes and speaks very softly
gradually as she goes on i feel with a stricken heart that she is speaking of herself as past
i am afraid dear i was too young
i dont mean in years only but in experience and thoughts and everything
i was such a silly little creature
i am afraid it would have been better if we had only loved each other as a boy and girl and forgotten it
i have begun to think i was not fit to be a wife i try to stay my tears and to reply oh dora love as fit as i to be a husband i dont know with the old shake of her curls
perhaps
but if i had been more fit to be married i might have made you more so too
besides you are very clever and i never was we have been very happy my sweet dora i was very happy very
but as years went on my dear boy would have wearied of his childwife
she would have been less and less a companion for him
he would have been more and more sensible of what was wanting in his home
she wouldnt have improved
it is better as it is oh dora dearest dearest do not speak to me so
every word seems a reproach no not a syllable she answers kissing me
oh my dear you never deserved it and i loved you far too well to say a reproachful word to you in earnestit was all the merit i had except being prettyor you thought me so
is it lonely downstairs doady very
very dont cry
is my chair there in its old place oh how my poor boy cries
hush hush
now make me one promise
i want to speak to agnes
when you go downstairs tell agnes so and send her up to me and while i speak to her let no one comenot even aunt
i want to speak to agnes by herself
i want to speak to agnes quite alone i promise that she shall immediately but i cannot leave her for my grief
i said that it was better as it is she whispers as she holds me in her arms
oh doady after more years you never could have loved your childwife better than you do and after more years she would so have tried and disappointed you that you might not have been able to love her half so well
i know i was too young and foolish
it is much better as it is agnes is downstairs when i go into the parlour and i give her the message
she disappears leaving me alone with jip
his chinese house is by the fire and he lies within it on his bed of flannel querulously trying to sleep
the bright moon is high and clear
as i look out on the night my tears fall fast and my undisciplined heart is chastened heavilyheavily
i sit down by the fire thinking with a blind remorse of all those secret feelings i have nourished since my marriage
i think of every little trifle between me and dora and feel the truth that trifles make the sum of life
ever rising from the sea of my remembrance is the image of the dear child as i knew her first graced by my young love and by her own with every fascination wherein such love is rich
would it indeed have been better if we had loved each other as a boy and a girl and forgotten it
undisciplined heart reply
how the time wears i know not until i am recalled by my childwifes old companion
more restless than he was he crawls out of his house and looks at me and wanders to the door and whines to go upstairs
not tonight jip
not tonight he comes very slowly back to me licks my hand and lifts his dim eyes to my face
oh jip
it may be never again he lies down at my feet stretches himself out as if to sleep and with a plaintive cry is dead
oh agnes
look look here that face so full of pity and of grief that rain of tears that awful mute appeal to me that solemn hand upraised towards heaven
agnes it is over
darkness comes before my eyes and for a time all things are blotted out of my remembrance
this is not the time at which i am to enter on the state of my mind beneath its load of sorrow
i came to think that the future was walled up before me that the energy and action of my life were at an end that i never could find any refuge but in the grave
i came to think so i say but not in the first shock of my grief
it slowly grew to that
if the events i go on to relate had not thickened around me in the beginning to confuse and in the end to augment my affliction it is possible though i think not probable that i might have fallen at once into this condition
as it was an interval occurred before i fully knew my own distress an interval in which i even supposed that its sharpest pangs were past and when my mind could soothe itself by resting on all that was most innocent and beautiful in the tender story that was closed for ever
when it was first proposed that i should go abroad or how it came to be agreed among us that i was to seek the restoration of my peace in change and travel i do not even now distinctly know
the spirit of agnes so pervaded all we thought and said and did in that time of sorrow that i assume i may refer the project to her influence
but her influence was so quiet that i know no more
and now indeed i began to think that in my old association of her with the stainedglass window in the church a prophetic foreshadowing of what she would be to me in the calamity that was to happen in the fullness of time had found a way into my mind
in all that sorrow from the moment never to be forgotten when she stood before me with her upraised hand she was like a sacred presence in my lonely house
when the angel of death alighted there my childwife fell asleepthey told me so when i could bear to hear iton her bosom with a smile
from my swoon i first awoke to a consciousness of her compassionate tears her words of hope and peace her gentle face bending down as from a purer region nearer heaven over my undisciplined heart and softening its pain
let me go on
i was to go abroad
that seemed to have been determined among us from the first
the ground now covering all that could perish of my departed wife i waited only for what mr micawber called the final pulverization of heep and for the departure of the emigrants
at the request of traddles most affectionate and devoted of friends in my trouble we returned to canterbury i mean my aunt agnes and i
we proceeded by appointment straight to mr micawbers house where and at mr wickfields my friend had been labouring ever since our explosive meeting
when poor mrs micawber saw me come in in my black clothes she was sensibly affected
there was a great deal of good in mrs micawbers heart which had not been dunned out of it in all those many years
well mr and mrs micawber was my aunts first salutation after we were seated
pray have you thought about that emigration proposal of mine my dear madam returned mr micawber perhaps i cannot better express the conclusion at which mrs micawber your humble servant and i may add our children have jointly and severally arrived than by borrowing the language of an illustrious poet to reply that our boat is on the shore and our bark is on the sea thats right said my aunt
i augur all sort of good from your sensible decision madam you do us a great deal of honour he rejoined
he then referred to a memorandum
with respect to the pecuniary assistance enabling us to launch our frail canoe on the ocean of enterprise i have reconsidered that important businesspoint and would beg to propose my notes of handdrawn it is needless to stipulate on stamps of the amounts respectively required by the various acts of parliament applying to such securitiesat eighteen twentyfour and thirty months
the proposition i originally submitted was twelve eighteen and twentyfour but i am apprehensive that such an arrangement might not allow sufficient time for the requisite amount ofsomethingto turn up
we might not said mr micawber looking round the room as if it represented several hundred acres of highly cultivated land on the first responsibility becoming due have been successful in our harvest or we might not have got our harvest in
labour i believe is sometimes difficult to obtain in that portion of our colonial possessions where it will be our lot to combat with the teeming soil arrange it in any way you please sir said my aunt
madam he replied mrs
micawber and myself are deeply sensible of the very considerate kindness of our friends and patrons
what i wish is to be perfectly businesslike and perfectly punctual
turning over as we are about to turn over an entirely new leaf and falling back as we are now in the act of falling back for a spring of no common magnitude it is important to my sense of selfrespect besides being an example to my son that these arrangements should be concluded as between man and man i dont know that mr micawber attached any meaning to this last phrase i dont know that anybody ever does or did but he appeared to relish it uncommonly and repeated with an impressive cough as between man and man
i propose said mr micawber billsa convenience to the mercantile world for which i believe we are originally indebted to the jews who appear to me to have had a devilish deal too much to do with them ever sincebecause they are negotiable
but if a bond or any other description of security would be preferred i should be happy to execute any such instrument
as between man and man my aunt observed that in a case where both parties were willing to agree to anything she took it for granted there would be no difficulty in settling this point
mr micawber was of her opinion
in reference to our domestic preparations madam said mr micawber with some pride for meeting the destiny to which we are now understood to be selfdevoted i beg to report them
my eldest daughter attends at five every morning in a neighbouring establishment to acquire the processif process it may be calledof milking cows
my younger children are instructed to observe as closely as circumstances will permit the habits of the pigs and poultry maintained in the poorer parts of this city a pursuit from which they have on two occasions been brought home within an inch of being run over
i have myself directed some attention during the past week to the art of baking and my son wilkins has issued forth with a walkingstick and driven cattle when permitted by the rugged hirelings who had them in charge to render any voluntary service in that directionwhich i regret to say for the credit of our nature was not often he being generally warned with imprecations to desist all very right indeed said my aunt encouragingly
mrs
micawber has been busy too i have no doubt my dear madam returned mrs micawber with her businesslike air
i am free to confess that i have not been actively engaged in pursuits immediately connected with cultivation or with stock though well aware that both will claim my attention on a foreign shore
such opportunities as i have been enabled to alienate from my domestic duties i have devoted to corresponding at some length with my family
for i own it seems to me my dear mr copperfield said mrs micawber who always fell back on me i suppose from old habit to whomsoever else she might address her discourse at starting that the time is come when the past should be buried in oblivion when my family should take mr micawber by the hand and mr micawber should take my family by the hand when the lion should lie down with the lamb and my family be on terms with mr micawber i said i thought so too
this at least is the light my dear mr copperfield pursued mrs micawber in which i view the subject
when i lived at home with my papa and mama my papa was accustomed to ask when any point was under discussion in our limited circle in what light does my emma view the subject that my papa was too partial i know still on such a point as the frigid coldness which has ever subsisted between mr micawber and my family i necessarily have formed an opinion delusive though it may be no doubt
of course you have maam said my aunt
precisely so assented mrs micawber
now i may be wrong in my conclusions it is very likely that i am but my individual impression is that the gulf between my family and mr micawber may be traced to an apprehension on the part of my family that mr micawber would require pecuniary accommodation
i cannot help thinking said mrs micawber with an air of deep sagacity that there are members of my family who have been apprehensive that mr micawber would solicit them for their namesi do not mean to be conferred in baptism upon our children but to be inscribed on bills of exchange and negotiated in the money market the look of penetration with which mrs micawber announced this discovery as if no one had ever thought of it before seemed rather to astonish my aunt who abruptly replied well maam upon the whole i shouldnt wonder if you were right mr
micawber being now on the eve of casting off the pecuniary shackles that have so long enthralled him said mrs micawber and of commencing a new career in a country where there is sufficient range for his abilitieswhich in my opinion is exceedingly important mr micawbers abilities peculiarly requiring spaceit seems to me that my family should signalize the occasion by coming forward
what i could wish to see would be a meeting between mr micawber and my family at a festive entertainment to be given at my familys expense where mr micawbers health and prosperity being proposed by some leading member of my family mr micawber might have an opportunity of developing his views my dear said mr micawber with some heat it may be better for me to state distinctly at once that if i were to develop my views to that assembled group they would possibly be found of an offensive nature my impression being that your family are in the aggregate impertinent snobs and in detail unmitigated ruffians micawber said mrs micawber shaking her head no
you have never understood them and they have never understood you mr micawber coughed
they have never understood you micawber said his wife
they may be incapable of it
if so that is their misfortune
i can pity their misfortune i am extremely sorry my dear emma said mr micawber relenting to have been betrayed into any expressions that might even remotely have the appearance of being strong expressions
all i would say is that i can go abroad without your family coming forward to favour mein short with a parting shove of their cold shoulders and that upon the whole i would rather leave england with such impetus as i possess than derive any acceleration of it from that quarter
at the same time my dear if they should condescend to reply to your communicationswhich our joint experience renders most improbablefar be it from me to be a barrier to your wishes the matter being thus amicably settled mr micawber gave mrs micawber his arm and glancing at the heap of books and papers lying before traddles on the table said they would leave us to ourselves which they ceremoniously did
my dear copperfield said traddles leaning back in his chair when they were gone and looking at me with an affection that made his eyes red and his hair all kinds of shapes i dont make any excuse for troubling you with business because i know you are deeply interested in it and it may divert your thoughts
my dear boy i hope you are not worn out i am quite myself said i after a pause
we have more cause to think of my aunt than of anyone
you know how much she has done surely surely answered traddles
who can forget it but even that is not all said i
during the last fortnight some new trouble has vexed her and she has been in and out of london every day
several times she has gone out early and been absent until evening
last night traddles with this journey before her it was almost midnight before she came home
you know what her consideration for others is
she will not tell me what has happened to distress her my aunt very pale and with deep lines in her face sat immovable until i had finished when some stray tears found their way to her cheeks and she put her hand on mine
its nothing trot its nothing
there will be no more of it
you shall know by and by
now agnes my dear let us attend to these affairs i must do mr micawber the justice to say traddles began that although he would appear not to have worked to any good account for himself he is a most untiring man when he works for other people
i never saw such a fellow
if he always goes on in the same way he must be virtually about two hundred years old at present
the heat into which he has been continually putting himself and the distracted and impetuous manner in which he has been diving day and night among papers and books to say nothing of the immense number of letters he has written me between this house and mr wickfields and often across the table when he has been sitting opposite and might much more easily have spoken is quite extraordinary letters cried my aunt
i believe he dreams in letters theres mr dick too said traddles has been doing wonders
as soon as he was released from overlooking uriah heep whom he kept in such charge as i never saw exceeded he began to devote himself to mr wickfield
and really his anxiety to be of use in the investigations we have been making and his real usefulness in extracting and copying and fetching and carrying have been quite stimulating to us dick is a very remarkable man exclaimed my aunt and i always said he was
trot you know it i am happy to say miss wickfield pursued traddles at once with great delicacy and with great earnestness that in your absence mr wickfield has considerably improved
relieved of the incubus that had fastened upon him for so long a time and of the dreadful apprehensions under which he had lived he is hardly the same person
at times even his impaired power of concentrating his memory and attention on particular points of business has recovered itself very much and he has been able to assist us in making some things clear that we should have found very difficult indeed if not hopeless without him
but what i have to do is to come to results which are short enough not to gossip on all the hopeful circumstances i have observed or i shall never have done his natural manner and agreeable simplicity made it transparent that he said this to put us in good heart and to enable agnes to hear her father mentioned with greater confidence but it was not the less pleasant for that
now let me see said traddles looking among the papers on the table
having counted our funds and reduced to order a great mass of unintentional confusion in the first place and of wilful confusion and falsification in the second we take it to be clear that mr wickfield might now wind up his business and his agencytrust and exhibit no deficiency or defalcation whatever oh thank heaven cried agnes fervently
but said traddles the surplus that would be left as his means of supportand i suppose the house to be sold even in saying thiswould be so small not exceeding in all probability some hundreds of pounds that perhaps miss wickfield it would be best to consider whether he might not retain his agency of the estate to which he has so long been receiver
his friends might advise him you know now he is free
you yourself miss wickfieldcopperfieldi i have considered it trotwood said agnes looking to me and i feel that it ought not to be and must not be even on the recommendation of a friend to whom i am so grateful and owe so much i will not say that i recommend it observed traddles
i think it right to suggest it
no more i am happy to hear you say so answered agnes steadily for it gives me hope almost assurance that we think alike
dear mr traddles and dear trotwood papa once free with honour what could i wish for
i have always aspired if i could have released him from the toils in which he was held to render back some little portion of the love and care i owe him and to devote my life to him
it has been for years the utmost height of my hopes
to take our future on myself will be the next great happinessthe next to his release from all trust and responsibilitythat i can know have you thought how agnes often
i am not afraid dear trotwood
i am certain of success
so many people know me here and think kindly of me that i am certain
dont mistrust me
our wants are not many
if i rent the dear old house and keep a school i shall be useful and happy the calm fervour of her cheerful voice brought back so vividly first the dear old house itself and then my solitary home that my heart was too full for speech
traddles pretended for a little while to be busily looking among the papers
next miss trotwood said traddles that property of yours well sir sighed my aunt
all i have got to say about it is that if its gone i can bear it and if its not gone i shall be glad to get it back it was originally i think eight thousand pounds consols said traddles
right replied my aunt
i cant account for more than five said traddles with an air of perplexity
thousand do you mean inquired my aunt with uncommon composure or pounds five thousand pounds said traddles
it was all there was returned my aunt
i sold three myself
one i paid for your articles trot my dear and the other two i have by me
when i lost the rest i thought it wise to say nothing about that sum but to keep it secretly for a rainy day
i wanted to see how you would come out of the trial trot and you came out noblypersevering selfreliant selfdenying
so did dick
dont speak to me for i find my nerves a little shaken nobody would have thought so to see her sitting upright with her arms folded but she had wonderful selfcommand
then i am delighted to say cried traddles beaming with joy that we have recovered the whole money dont congratulate me anybody exclaimed my aunt
how so sir you believed it had been misappropriated by mr wickfield said traddles
of course i did said my aunt and was therefore easily silenced
agnes not a word and indeed said traddles it was sold by virtue of the power of management he held from you but i neednt say by whom sold or on whose actual signature
it was afterwards pretended to mr wickfield by that rascaland proved too by figuresthat he had possessed himself of the money on general instructions he said to keep other deficiencies and difficulties from the light
mr wickfield being so weak and helpless in his hands as to pay you afterwards several sums of interest on a pretended principal which he knew did not exist made himself unhappily a party to the fraud and at last took the blame upon himself added my aunt and wrote me a mad letter charging himself with robbery and wrong unheard of
upon which i paid him a visit early one morning called for a candle burnt the letter and told him if he ever could right me and himself to do it and if he couldnt to keep his own counsel for his daughters sakeif anybody speaks to me ill leave the house we all remained quiet agnes covering her face
well my dear friend said my aunt after a pause and you have really extorted the money back from him why the fact is returned traddles mr
micawber had so completely hemmed him in and was always ready with so many new points if an old one failed that he could not escape from us
a most remarkable circumstance is that i really dont think he grasped this sum even so much for the gratification of his avarice which was inordinate as in the hatred he felt for copperfield
he said so to me plainly
he said he would even have spent as much to baulk or injure copperfield ha said my aunt knitting her brows thoughtfully and glancing at agnes
and whats become of him i dont know
he left here said traddles with his mother who had been clamouring and beseeching and disclosing the whole time
they went away by one of the london night coaches and i know no more about him except that his malevolence to me at parting was audacious
he seemed to consider himself hardly less indebted to me than to mr micawber which i consider as i told him quite a compliment do you suppose he has any money traddles i asked
oh dear yes i should think so he replied shaking his head seriously
i should say he must have pocketed a good deal in one way or other
but i think you would find copperfield if you had an opportunity of observing his course that money would never keep that man out of mischief
he is such an incarnate hypocrite that whatever object he pursues he must pursue crookedly
its his only compensation for the outward restraints he puts upon himself
always creeping along the ground to some small end or other he will always magnify every object in the way and consequently will hate and suspect everybody that comes in the most innocent manner between him and it
so the crooked courses will become crookeder at any moment for the least reason or for none
its only necessary to consider his history here said traddles to know that hes a monster of meanness said my aunt
really i dont know about that observed traddles thoughtfully
many people can be very mean when they give their minds to it and now touching mr micawber said my aunt
well really said traddles cheerfully i must once more give mr micawber high praise
but for his having been so patient and persevering for so long a time we never could have hoped to do anything worth speaking of
and i think we ought to consider that mr micawber did right for rights sake when we reflect what terms he might have made with uriah heep himself for his silence i think so too said i
now what would you give him inquired my aunt
oh
before you come to that said traddles a little disconcerted i am afraid i thought it discreet to omit not being able to carry everything before me two points in making this lawless adjustmentfor its perfectly lawless from beginning to endof a difficult affair
those ious and so forth which mr micawber gave him for the advances he had well
they must be paid said my aunt
yes but i dont know when they may be proceeded on or where they are rejoined traddles opening his eyes and i anticipate that between this time and his departure mr micawber will be constantly arrested or taken in execution then he must be constantly set free again and taken out of execution said my aunt
whats the amount altogether why mr micawber has entered the transactionshe calls them transactionswith great form in a book rejoined traddles smiling and he makes the amount a hundred and three pounds five now what shall we give him that sum included said my aunt
agnes my dear you and i can talk about division of it afterwards
what should it be
five hundred pounds upon this traddles and i both struck in at once
we both recommended a small sum in money and the payment without stipulation to mr micawber of the uriah claims as they came in
we proposed that the family should have their passage and their outfit and a hundred pounds and that mr micawbers arrangement for the repayment of the advances should be gravely entered into as it might be wholesome for him to suppose himself under that responsibility
to this i added the suggestion that i should give some explanation of his character and history to mr peggotty who i knew could be relied on and that to mr peggotty should be quietly entrusted the discretion of advancing another hundred
i further proposed to interest mr micawber in mr peggotty by confiding so much of mr peggottys story to him as i might feel justified in relating or might think expedient and to endeavour to bring each of them to bear upon the other for the common advantage
we all entered warmly into these views and i may mention at once that the principals themselves did so shortly afterwards with perfect good will and harmony
seeing that traddles now glanced anxiously at my aunt again i reminded him of the second and last point to which he had adverted
you and your aunt will excuse me copperfield if i touch upon a painful theme as i greatly fear i shall said traddles hesitating but i think it necessary to bring it to your recollection
on the day of mr micawbers memorable denunciation a threatening allusion was made by uriah heep to your auntshusband my aunt retaining her stiff position and apparent composure assented with a nod
perhaps observed traddles it was mere purposeless impertinence no returned my aunt
there waspardon mereally such a person and at all in his power hinted traddles
yes my good friend said my aunt
traddles with a perceptible lengthening of his face explained that he had not been able to approach this subject that it had shared the fate of mr micawbers liabilities in not being comprehended in the terms he had made that we were no longer of any authority with uriah heep and that if he could do us or any of us any injury or annoyance no doubt he would
my aunt remained quiet until again some stray tears found their way to her cheeks
you are quite right she said
it was very thoughtful to mention it can ior copperfielddo anything asked traddles gently
nothing said my aunt
i thank you many times
trot my dear a vain threat
let us have mr and mrs micawber back
and dont any of you speak to me with that she smoothed her dress and sat with her upright carriage looking at the door
well mr and mrs micawber said my aunt when they entered
we have been discussing your emigration with many apologies to you for keeping you out of the room so long and ill tell you what arrangements we propose these she explained to the unbounded satisfaction of the familychildren and all being then presentand so much to the awakening of mr micawbers punctual habits in the opening stage of all bill transactions that he could not be dissuaded from immediately rushing out in the highest spirits to buy the stamps for his notes of hand
but his joy received a sudden check for within five minutes he returned in the custody of a sheriff s officer informing us in a flood of tears that all was lost
we being quite prepared for this event which was of course a proceeding of uriah heeps soon paid the money and in five minutes more mr micawber was seated at the table filling up the stamps with an expression of perfect joy which only that congenial employment or the making of punch could impart in full completeness to his shining face
to see him at work on the stamps with the relish of an artist touching them like pictures looking at them sideways taking weighty notes of dates and amounts in his pocketbook and contemplating them when finished with a high sense of their precious value was a sight indeed
now the best thing you can do sir if youll allow me to advise you said my aunt after silently observing him is to abjure that occupation for evermore madam replied mr micawber it is my intention to register such a vow on the virgin page of the future
mrs micawber will attest it
i trust said mr micawber solemnly that my son wilkins will ever bear in mind that he had infinitely better put his fist in the fire than use it to handle the serpents that have poisoned the lifeblood of his unhappy parent deeply affected and changed in a moment to the image of despair mr micawber regarded the serpents with a look of gloomy abhorrence in which his late admiration of them was not quite subdued folded them up and put them in his pocket
this closed the proceedings of the evening
we were weary with sorrow and fatigue and my aunt and i were to return to london on the morrow
it was arranged that the micawbers should follow us after effecting a sale of their goods to a broker that mr wickfields affairs should be brought to a settlement with all convenient speed under the direction of traddles and that agnes should also come to london pending those arrangements
we passed the night at the old house which freed from the presence of the heeps seemed purged of a disease and i lay in my old room like a shipwrecked wanderer come home
we went back next day to my aunts housenot to mineand when she and i sat alone as of old before going to bed she said trot do you really wish to know what i have had upon my mind lately indeed i do aunt
if there ever was a time when i felt unwilling that you should have a sorrow or anxiety which i could not share it is now you have had sorrow enough child said my aunt affectionately without the addition of my little miseries
i could have no other motive trot in keeping anything from you i know that well said i
but tell me now would you ride with me a little way tomorrow morning asked my aunt
of course at nine said she
ill tell you then my dear at nine accordingly we went out in a little chariot and drove to london
we drove a long way through the streets until we came to one of the large hospitals
standing hard by the building was a plain hearse
the driver recognized my aunt and in obedience to a motion of her hand at the window drove slowly off we following
you understand it now trot said my aunt
he is gone did he die in the hospital yes she sat immovable beside me but again i saw the stray tears on her face
he was there once before said my aunt presently
he was ailing a long timea shattered broken man these many years
when he knew his state in this last illness he asked them to send for me
he was sorry then
very sorry you went i know aunt i went
i was with him a good deal afterwards he died the night before we went to canterbury said i
my aunt nodded
no one can harm him now she said
it was a vain threat we drove away out of town to the churchyard at hornsey
better here than in the streets said my aunt
he was born here we alighted and followed the plain coffin to a corner i remember well where the service was read consigning it to the dust
sixandthirty years ago this day my dear said my aunt as we walked back to the chariot i was married
god forgive us all we took our seats in silence and so she sat beside me for a long time holding my hand
at length she suddenly burst into tears and said he was a finelooking man when i married him trotand he was sadly changed it did not last long
after the relief of tears she soon became composed and even cheerful
her nerves were a little shaken she said or she would not have given way to it
god forgive us all
so we rode back to her little cottage at highgate where we found the following short note which had arrived by that mornings post from mr micawber canterbury friday
my dear madam and copperfield the fair land of promise lately looming on the horizon is again enveloped in impenetrable mists and for ever withdrawn from the eyes of a drifting wretch whose doom is sealed
another writ has been issued in his majestys high court of kings bench at westminster in another cause of heep v micawber and the defendant in that cause is the prey of the sheriff having legal jurisdiction in this bailiwick
nows the day and nows the hour see the front of battle lower see approach proud edwards power chains and slavery
consigned to which and to a speedy end for mental torture is not supportable beyond a certain point and that point i feel i have attained my course is run
bless you bless you
some future traveller visiting from motives of curiosity not unmingled let us hope with sympathy the place of confinement allotted to debtors in this city may and i trust will ponder as he traces on its wall inscribed with a rusty nail the obscure initials w
m ps
i reopen this to say that our common friend mr thomas traddles who has not yet left us and is looking extremely well has paid the debt and costs in the noble name of miss trotwood and that myself and family are at the height of earthly bliss i now approach an event in my life so indelible so awful so bound by an infinite variety of ties to all that has preceded it in these pages that from the beginning of my narrative i have seen it growing larger and larger as i advanced like a great tower in a plain and throwing its forecast shadow even on the incidents of my childish days
for years after it occurred i dreamed of it often
i have started up so vividly impressed by it that its fury has yet seemed raging in my quiet room in the still night
i dream of it sometimes though at lengthened and uncertain intervals to this hour
i have an association between it and a stormy wind or the lightest mention of a seashore as strong as any of which my mind is conscious
as plainly as i behold what happened i will try to write it down
i do not recall it but see it done for it happens again before me
the time drawing on rapidly for the sailing of the emigrantship my good old nurse almost brokenhearted for me when we first met came up to london
i was constantly with her and her brother and the micawbers they being very much together but emily i never saw
one evening when the time was close at hand i was alone with peggotty and her brother
our conversation turned on ham
she described to us how tenderly he had taken leave of her and how manfully and quietly he had borne himself
most of all of late when she believed he was most tried
it was a subject of which the affectionate creature never tired and our interest in hearing the many examples which she who was so much with him had to relate was equal to hers in relating them
my aunt and i were at that time vacating the two cottages at highgate i intending to go abroad and she to return to her house at dover
we had a temporary lodging in covent garden
as i walked home to it after this evenings conversation reflecting on what had passed between ham and myself when i was last at yarmouth i wavered in the original purpose i had formed of leaving a letter for emily when i should take leave of her uncle on board the ship and thought it would be better to write to her now
she might desire i thought after receiving my communication to send some parting word by me to her unhappy lover
i ought to give her the opportunity
i therefore sat down in my room before going to bed and wrote to her
i told her that i had seen him and that he had requested me to tell her what i have already written in its place in these sheets
i faithfully repeated it
i had no need to enlarge upon it if i had had the right
its deep fidelity and goodness were not to be adorned by me or any man
i left it out to be sent round in the morning with a line to mr peggotty requesting him to give it to her and went to bed at daybreak
i was weaker than i knew then and not falling asleep until the sun was up lay late and unrefreshed next day
i was roused by the silent presence of my aunt at my bedside
i felt it in my sleep as i suppose we all do feel such things
trot my dear she said when i opened my eyes i couldnt make up my mind to disturb you
mr peggotty is here shall he come up i replied yes and he soon appeared
masr davy he said when we had shaken hands i giv emly your letter sir and she writ this heer and begged of me fur to ask you to read it and if you see no hurt int to be so kind as take charge ont have you read it said i
he nodded sorrowfully
i opened it and read as follows i have got your message
oh what can i write to thank you for your good and blessed kindness to me
i have put the words close to my heart
i shall keep them till i die
they are sharp thorns but they are such comfort
i have prayed over them oh i have prayed so much
when i find what you are and what uncle is i think what god must be and can cry to him
goodbye for ever
now my dear my friend goodbye for ever in this world
in another world if i am forgiven i may wake a child and come to you
all thanks and blessings
farewell evermore this blotted with tears was the letter
may i tell her as you doent see no hurt int and as youll be so kind as take charge ont masr davy said mr peggotty when i had read it
unquestionably said ibut i am thinking yes masr davy i am thinking said i that ill go down again to yarmouth
theres time and to spare for me to go and come back before the ship sails
my mind is constantly running on him in his solitude to put this letter of her writing in his hand at this time and to enable you to tell her in the moment of parting that he has got it will be a kindness to both of them
i solemnly accepted his commission dear good fellow and cannot discharge it too completely
the journey is nothing to me
i am restless and shall be better in motion
ill go down tonight though he anxiously endeavoured to dissuade me i saw that he was of my mind and this if i had required to be confirmed in my intention would have had the effect
he went round to the coach office at my request and took the boxseat for me on the mail
in the evening i started by that conveyance down the road i had traversed under so many vicissitudes
dont you think that i asked the coachman in the first stage out of london a very remarkable sky
i dont remember to have seen one like it nor inot equal to it he replied
thats wind sir
therell be mischief done at sea i expect before long it was a murky confusionhere and there blotted with a colour like the colour of the smoke from damp fuelof flying clouds tossed up into most remarkable heaps suggesting greater heights in the clouds than there were depths below them to the bottom of the deepest hollows in the earth through which the wild moon seemed to plunge headlong as if in a dread disturbance of the laws of nature she had lost her way and were frightened
there had been a wind all day and it was rising then with an extraordinary great sound
in another hour it had much increased and the sky was more overcast and blew hard
but as the night advanced the clouds closing in and densely overspreading the whole sky then very dark it came on to blow harder and harder
it still increased until our horses could scarcely face the wind
many times in the dark part of the night it was then late in september when the nights were not short the leaders turned about or came to a dead stop and we were often in serious apprehension that the coach would be blown over
sweeping gusts of rain came up before this storm like showers of steel and at those times when there was any shelter of trees or lee walls to be got we were fain to stop in a sheer impossibility of continuing the struggle
when the day broke it blew harder and harder
i had been in yarmouth when the seamen said it blew great guns but i had never known the like of this or anything approaching to it
we came to ipswichvery late having had to fight every inch of ground since we were ten miles out of london and found a cluster of people in the marketplace who had risen from their beds in the night fearful of falling chimneys
some of these congregating about the innyard while we changed horses told us of great sheets of lead having been ripped off a high churchtower and flung into a bystreet which they then blocked up
others had to tell of country people coming in from neighbouring villages who had seen great trees lying torn out of the earth and whole ricks scattered about the roads and fields
still there was no abatement in the storm but it blew harder
as we struggled on nearer and nearer to the sea from which this mighty wind was blowing dead on shore its force became more and more terrific
long before we saw the sea its spray was on our lips and showered salt rain upon us
the water was out over miles and miles of the flat country adjacent to yarmouth and every sheet and puddle lashed its banks and had its stress of little breakers setting heavily towards us
when we came within sight of the sea the waves on the horizon caught at intervals above the rolling abyss were like glimpses of another shore with towers and buildings
when at last we got into the town the people came out to their doors all aslant and with streaming hair making a wonder of the mail that had come through such a night
i put up at the old inn and went down to look at the sea staggering along the street which was strewn with sand and seaweed and with flying blotches of seafoam afraid of falling slates and tiles and holding by people i met at angry corners
coming near the beach i saw not only the boatmen but half the people of the town lurking behind buildings some now and then braving the fury of the storm to look away to sea and blown sheer out of their course in trying to get zigzag back
joining these groups i found bewailing women whose husbands were away in herring or oyster boats which there was too much reason to think might have foundered before they could run in anywhere for safety
grizzled old sailors were among the people shaking their heads as they looked from water to sky and muttering to one another shipowners excited and uneasy children huddling together and peering into older faces even stout mariners disturbed and anxious levelling their glasses at the sea from behind places of shelter as if they were surveying an enemy
the tremendous sea itself when i could find sufficient pause to look at it in the agitation of the blinding wind the flying stones and sand and the awful noise confounded me
as the high watery walls came rolling in and at their highest tumbled into surf they looked as if the least would engulf the town
as the receding wave swept back with a hoarse roar it seemed to scoop out deep caves in the beach as if its purpose were to undermine the earth
when some whiteheaded billows thundered on and dashed themselves to pieces before they reached the land every fragment of the late whole seemed possessed by the full might of its wrath rushing to be gathered to the composition of another monster
undulating hills were changed to valleys undulating valleys with a solitary stormbird sometimes skimming through them were lifted up to hills masses of water shivered and shook the beach with a booming sound every shape tumultuously rolled on as soon as made to change its shape and place and beat another shape and place away the ideal shore on the horizon with its towers and buildings rose and fell the clouds fell fast and thick i seemed to see a rending and upheaving of all nature
not finding ham among the people whom this memorable windfor it is still remembered down there as the greatest ever known to blow upon that coasthad brought together i made my way to his house
it was shut and as no one answered to my knocking i went by back ways and bylanes to the yard where he worked
i learned there that he had gone to lowestoft to meet some sudden exigency of shiprepairing in which his skill was required but that he would be back tomorrow morning in good time
i went back to the inn and when i had washed and dressed and tried to sleep but in vain it was five oclock in the afternoon
i had not sat five minutes by the coffeeroom fire when the waiter coming to stir it as an excuse for talking told me that two colliers had gone down with all hands a few miles away and that some other ships had been seen labouring hard in the roads and trying in great distress to keep off shore
mercy on them and on all poor sailors said he if we had another night like the last
i was very much depressed in spirits very solitary and felt an uneasiness in hams not being there disproportionate to the occasion
i was seriously affected without knowing how much by late events and my long exposure to the fierce wind had confused me
there was that jumble in my thoughts and recollections that i had lost the clear arrangement of time and distance
thus if i had gone out into the town i should not have been surprised i think to encounter someone who i knew must be then in london
so to speak there was in these respects a curious inattention in my mind
yet it was busy too with all the remembrances the place naturally awakened and they were particularly distinct and vivid
in this state the waiters dismal intelligence about the ships immediately connected itself without any effort of my volition with my uneasiness about ham
i was persuaded that i had an apprehension of his returning from lowestoft by sea and being lost
this grew so strong with me that i resolved to go back to the yard before i took my dinner and ask the boatbuilder if he thought his attempting to return by sea at all likely
if he gave me the least reason to think so i would go over to lowestoft and prevent it by bringing him with me
i hastily ordered my dinner and went back to the yard
i was none too soon for the boatbuilder with a lantern in his hand was locking the yardgate
he quite laughed when i asked him the question and said there was no fear no man in his senses or out of them would put off in such a gale of wind least of all ham peggotty who had been born to seafaring
so sensible of this beforehand that i had really felt ashamed of doing what i was nevertheless impelled to do i went back to the inn
if such a wind could rise i think it was rising
the howl and roar the rattling of the doors and windows the rumbling in the chimneys the apparent rocking of the very house that sheltered me and the prodigious tumult of the sea were more fearful than in the morning
but there was now a great darkness besides and that invested the storm with new terrors real and fanciful
i could not eat i could not sit still i could not continue steadfast to anything
something within me faintly answering to the storm without tossed up the depths of my memory and made a tumult in them
yet in all the hurry of my thoughts wild running with the thundering seathe storm and my uneasiness regarding ham were always in the foreground
my dinner went away almost untasted and i tried to refresh myself with a glass or two of wine
in vain
i fell into a dull slumber before the fire without losing my consciousness either of the uproar out of doors or of the place in which i was
both became overshadowed by a new and indefinable horror and when i awokeor rather when i shook off the lethargy that bound me in my chairmy whole frame thrilled with objectless and unintelligible fear
i walked to and fro tried to read an old gazetteer listened to the awful noises looked at faces scenes and figures in the fire
at length the steady ticking of the undisturbed clock on the wall tormented me to that degree that i resolved to go to bed
it was reassuring on such a night to be told that some of the innservants had agreed together to sit up until morning
i went to bed exceedingly weary and heavy but on my lying down all such sensations vanished as if by magic and i was broad awake with every sense refined
for hours i lay there listening to the wind and water imagining now that i heard shrieks out at sea now that i distinctly heard the firing of signal guns and now the fall of houses in the town
i got up several times and looked out but could see nothing except the reflection in the windowpanes of the faint candle i had left burning and of my own haggard face looking in at me from the black void
at length my restlessness attained to such a pitch that i hurried on my clothes and went downstairs
in the large kitchen where i dimly saw bacon and ropes of onions hanging from the beams the watchers were clustered together in various attitudes about a table purposely moved away from the great chimney and brought near the door
a pretty girl who had her ears stopped with her apron and her eyes upon the door screamed when i appeared supposing me to be a spirit but the others had more presence of mind and were glad of an addition to their company
one man referring to the topic they had been discussing asked me whether i thought the souls of the colliercrews who had gone down were out in the storm
i remained there i dare say two hours
once i opened the yardgate and looked into the empty street
the sand the seaweed and the flakes of foam were driving by and i was obliged to call for assistance before i could shut the gate again and make it fast against the wind
there was a dark gloom in my solitary chamber when i at length returned to it but i was tired now and getting into bed again felloff a tower and down a precipiceinto the depths of sleep
i have an impression that for a long time though i dreamed of being elsewhere and in a variety of scenes it was always blowing in my dream
at length i lost that feeble hold upon reality and was engaged with two dear friends but who they were i dont know at the siege of some town in a roar of cannonading
the thunder of the cannon was so loud and incessant that i could not hear something i much desired to hear until i made a great exertion and awoke
it was broad dayeight or nine oclock the storm raging in lieu of the batteries and someone knocking and calling at my door
what is the matter i cried
a wreck
close by i sprung out of bed and asked what wreck
a schooner from spain or portugal laden with fruit and wine
make haste sir if you want to see her
its thought down on the beach shell go to pieces every moment the excited voice went clamouring along the staircase and i wrapped myself in my clothes as quickly as i could and ran into the street
numbers of people were there before me all running in one direction to the beach
i ran the same way outstripping a good many and soon came facing the wild sea
the wind might by this time have lulled a little though not more sensibly than if the cannonading i had dreamed of had been diminished by the silencing of halfadozen guns out of hundreds
but the sea having upon it the additional agitation of the whole night was infinitely more terrific than when i had seen it last
every appearance it had then presented bore the expression of being swelled and the height to which the breakers rose and looking over one another bore one another down and rolled in in interminable hosts was most appalling
in the difficulty of hearing anything but wind and waves and in the crowd and the unspeakable confusion and my first breathless efforts to stand against the weather i was so confused that i looked out to sea for the wreck and saw nothing but the foaming heads of the great waves
a halfdressed boatman standing next me pointed with his bare arm a tattood arrow on it pointing in the same direction to the left
then o great heaven i saw it close in upon us
one mast was broken short off six or eight feet from the deck and lay over the side entangled in a maze of sail and rigging and all that ruin as the ship rolled and beatwhich she did without a moments pause and with a violence quite inconceivablebeat the side as if it would stave it in
some efforts were even then being made to cut this portion of the wreck away for as the ship which was broadside on turned towards us in her rolling i plainly descried her people at work with axes especially one active figure with long curling hair conspicuous among the rest
but a great cry which was audible even above the wind and water rose from the shore at this moment the sea sweeping over the rolling wreck made a clean breach and carried men spars casks planks bulwarks heaps of such toys into the boiling surge
the second mast was yet standing with the rags of a rent sail and a wild confusion of broken cordage flapping to and fro
the ship had struck once the same boatman hoarsely said in my ear and then lifted in and struck again
i understood him to add that she was parting amidships and i could readily suppose so for the rolling and beating were too tremendous for any human work to suffer long
as he spoke there was another great cry of pity from the beach four men arose with the wreck out of the deep clinging to the rigging of the remaining mast uppermost the active figure with the curling hair
there was a bell on board and as the ship rolled and dashed like a desperate creature driven mad now showing us the whole sweep of her deck as she turned on her beamends towards the shore now nothing but her keel as she sprung wildly over and turned towards the sea the bell rang and its sound the knell of those unhappy men was borne towards us on the wind
again we lost her and again she rose
two men were gone
the agony on the shore increased
men groaned and clasped their hands women shrieked and turned away their faces
some ran wildly up and down along the beach crying for help where no help could be
i found myself one of these frantically imploring a knot of sailors whom i knew not to let those two lost creatures perish before our eyes
they were making out to me in an agitated wayi dont know how for the little i could hear i was scarcely composed enough to understandthat the lifeboat had been bravely manned an hour ago and could do nothing and that as no man would be so desperate as to attempt to wade off with a rope and establish a communication with the shore there was nothing left to try when i noticed that some new sensation moved the people on the beach and saw them part and ham come breaking through them to the front
i ran to himas well as i know to repeat my appeal for help
but distracted though i was by a sight so new to me and terrible the determination in his face and his look out to seaexactly the same look as i remembered in connexion with the morning after emilys flightawoke me to a knowledge of his danger
i held him back with both arms and implored the men with whom i had been speaking not to listen to him not to do murder not to let him stir from off that sand
another cry arose on shore and looking to the wreck we saw the cruel sail with blow on blow beat off the lower of the two men and fly up in triumph round the active figure left alone upon the mast
against such a sight and against such determination as that of the calmly desperate man who was already accustomed to lead half the people present i might as hopefully have entreated the wind
masr davy he said cheerily grasping me by both hands if my time is come tis come
if tant ill bide it
lord above bless you and bless all
mates make me ready
im agoing off i was swept away but not unkindly to some distance where the people around me made me stay urging as i confusedly perceived that he was bent on going with help or without and that i should endanger the precautions for his safety by troubling those with whom they rested
i dont know what i answered or what they rejoined but i saw hurry on the beach and men running with ropes from a capstan that was there and penetrating into a circle of figures that hid him from me
then i saw him standing alone in a seamans frock and trousers a rope in his hand or slung to his wrist another round his body and several of the best men holding at a little distance to the latter which he laid out himself slack upon the shore at his feet
the wreck even to my unpractised eye was breaking up
i saw that she was parting in the middle and that the life of the solitary man upon the mast hung by a thread
still he clung to it
he had a singular red cap onnot like a sailors cap but of a finer colour and as the few yielding planks between him and destruction rolled and bulged and his anticipative deathknell rung he was seen by all of us to wave it
i saw him do it now and thought i was going distracted when his action brought an old remembrance to my mind of a once dear friend
ham watched the sea standing alone with the silence of suspended breath behind him and the storm before until there was a great retiring wave when with a backward glance at those who held the rope which was made fast round his body he dashed in after it and in a moment was buffeting with the water rising with the hills falling with the valleys lost beneath the foam then drawn again to land
they hauled in hastily
he was hurt
i saw blood on his face from where i stood but he took no thought of that
he seemed hurriedly to give them some directions for leaving him more freeor so i judged from the motion of his armand was gone as before
and now he made for the wreck rising with the hills falling with the valleys lost beneath the rugged foam borne in towards the shore borne on towards the ship striving hard and valiantly
the distance was nothing but the power of the sea and wind made the strife deadly
at length he neared the wreck
he was so near that with one more of his vigorous strokes he would be clinging to itwhen a high green vast hillside of water moving on shoreward from beyond the ship he seemed to leap up into it with a mighty bound and the ship was gone
some eddying fragments i saw in the sea as if a mere cask had been broken in running to the spot where they were hauling in
consternation was in every face
they drew him to my very feetinsensibledead
he was carried to the nearest house and no one preventing me now i remained near him busy while every means of restoration were tried but he had been beaten to death by the great wave and his generous heart was stilled for ever
as i sat beside the bed when hope was abandoned and all was done a fisherman who had known me when emily and i were children and ever since whispered my name at the door
sir said he with tears starting to his weatherbeaten face which with his trembling lips was ashy pale will you come over yonder the old remembrance that had been recalled to me was in his look
i asked him terrorstricken leaning on the arm he held out to support me has a body come ashore he said yes do i know it i asked then
he answered nothing
but he led me to the shore
and on that part of it where she and i had looked for shells two childrenon that part of it where some lighter fragments of the old boat blown down last night had been scattered by the windamong the ruins of the home he had wrongedi saw him lying with his head upon his arm as i had often seen him lie at school
no need o steerforth to have said when we last spoke together in that hour which i so little deemed to be our partinghourno need to have said think of me at my best i had done that ever and could i change now looking on this sight
they brought a handbier and laid him on it and covered him with a flag and took him up and bore him on towards the houses
all the men who carried him had known him and gone sailing with him and seen him merry and bold
they carried him through the wild roar a hush in the midst of all the tumult and took him to the cottage where death was already
but when they set the bier down on the threshold they looked at one another and at me and whispered
i knew why
they felt as if it were not right to lay him down in the same quiet room
we went into the town and took our burden to the inn
so soon as i could at all collect my thoughts i sent for joram and begged him to provide me a conveyance in which it could be got to london in the night
i knew that the care of it and the hard duty of preparing his mother to receive it could only rest with me and i was anxious to discharge that duty as faithfully as i could
i chose the night for the journey that there might be less curiosity when i left the town
but although it was nearly midnight when i came out of the yard in a chaise followed by what i had in charge there were many people waiting
at intervals along the town and even a little way out upon the road i saw more but at length only the bleak night and the open country were around me and the ashes of my youthful friendship
upon a mellow autumn day about noon when the ground was perfumed by fallen leaves and many more in beautiful tints of yellow red and brown yet hung upon the trees through which the sun was shining i arrived at highgate
i walked the last mile thinking as i went along of what i had to do and left the carriage that had followed me all through the night awaiting orders to advance
the house when i came up to it looked just the same
not a blind was raised no sign of life was in the dull paved court with its covered way leading to the disused door
the wind had quite gone down and nothing moved
i had not at first the courage to ring at the gate and when i did ring my errand seemed to me to be expressed in the very sound of the bell
the little parlourmaid came out with the key in her hand and looking earnestly at me as she unlocked the gate said i beg your pardon sir
are you ill i have been much agitated and am fatigued is anything the matter sirmr
james hush said i
yes something has happened that i have to break to mrs steerforth
she is at home the girl anxiously replied that her mistress was very seldom out now even in a carriage that she kept her room that she saw no company but would see me
her mistress was up she said and miss dartle was with her
what message should she take upstairs
giving her a strict charge to be careful of her manner and only to carry in my card and say i waited i sat down in the drawingroom which we had now reached until she should come back
its former pleasant air of occupation was gone and the shutters were half closed
the harp had not been used for many and many a day
his picture as a boy was there
the cabinet in which his mother had kept his letters was there
i wondered if she ever read them now if she would ever read them more
the house was so still that i heard the girls light step upstairs
on her return she brought a message to the effect that mrs steerforth was an invalid and could not come down but that if i would excuse her being in her chamber she would be glad to see me
in a few moments i stood before her
she was in his room not in her own
i felt of course that she had taken to occupy it in remembrance of him and that the many tokens of his old sports and accomplishments by which she was surrounded remained there just as he had left them for the same reason
she murmured however even in her reception of me that she was out of her own chamber because its aspect was unsuited to her infirmity and with her stately look repelled the least suspicion of the truth
at her chair as usual was rosa dartle
from the first moment of her dark eyes resting on me i saw she knew i was the bearer of evil tidings
the scar sprung into view that instant
she withdrew herself a step behind the chair to keep her own face out of mrs steerforths observation and scrutinized me with a piercing gaze that never faltered never shrunk
i am sorry to observe you are in mourning sir said mrs steerforth
i am unhappily a widower said i
you are very young to know so great a loss she returned
i am grieved to hear it
i am grieved to hear it
i hope time will be good to you i hope time said i looking at her will be good to all of us
dear mrs steerforth we must all trust to that in our heaviest misfortunes the earnestness of my manner and the tears in my eyes alarmed her
the whole course of her thoughts appeared to stop and change
i tried to command my voice in gently saying his name but it trembled
she repeated it to herself two or three times in a low tone
then addressing me she said with enforced calmness my son is ill very ill you have seen him i have are you reconciled i could not say yes i could not say no
she slightly turned her head towards the spot where rosa dartle had been standing at her elbow and in that moment i said by the motion of my lips to rosa dead that mrs steerforth might not be induced to look behind her and read plainly written what she was not yet prepared to know i met her look quickly but i had seen rosa dartle throw her hands up in the air with vehemence of despair and horror and then clasp them on her face
the handsome ladyso like oh so likeregarded me with a fixed look and put her hand to her forehead
i besought her to be calm and prepare herself to bear what i had to tell but i should rather have entreated her to weep for she sat like a stone figure
when i was last here i faltered miss dartle told me he was sailing here and there
the night before last was a dreadful one at sea
if he were at sea that night and near a dangerous coast as it is said he was and if the vessel that was seen should really be the ship which rosa said mrs steerforth come to me she came but with no sympathy or gentleness
her eyes gleamed like fire as she confronted his mother and broke into a frightful laugh
now she said is your pride appeased you madwoman
now has he made atonement to youwith his life
do you hearhis life mrs steerforth fallen back stiffly in her chair and making no sound but a moan cast her eyes upon her with a wide stare
aye cried rosa smiting herself passionately on the breast look at me
moan and groan and look at me
look here striking the scar at your dead childs handiwork the moan the mother uttered from time to time went to my heart
always the same
always inarticulate and stifled
always accompanied with an incapable motion of the head but with no change of face
always proceeding from a rigid mouth and closed teeth as if the jaw were locked and the face frozen up in pain
do you remember when he did this she proceeded
do you remember when in his inheritance of your nature and in your pampering of his pride and passion he did this and disfigured me for life
look at me marked until i die with his high displeasure and moan and groan for what you made him miss dartle i entreated her
for heavens sake i will speak she said turning on me with her lightning eyes
be silent you
look at me i say proud mother of a proud false son
moan for your nurture of him moan for your corruption of him moan for your loss of him moan for mine she clenched her hand and trembled through her spare worn figure as if her passion were killing her by inches
you resent his selfwill she exclaimed
you injured by his haughty temper
you who opposed to both when your hair was grey the qualities which made both when you gave him birth
you who from his cradle reared him to be what he was and stunted what he should have been
are you rewarded now for your years of trouble oh miss dartle shame
oh cruel i tell you she returned i will speak to her
no power on earth should stop me while i was standing here
have i been silent all these years and shall i not speak now
i loved him better than you ever loved him turning on her fiercely
i could have loved him and asked no return
if i had been his wife i could have been the slave of his caprices for a word of love a year
i should have been
who knows it better than i
you were exacting proud punctilious selfish
my love would have been devotedwould have trod your paltry whimpering under foot with flashing eyes she stamped upon the ground as if she actually did it
look here she said striking the scar again with a relentless hand
when he grew into the better understanding of what he had done he saw it and repented of it
i could sing to him and talk to him and show the ardour that i felt in all he did and attain with labour to such knowledge as most interested him and i attracted him
when he was freshest and truest he loved me
yes he did
many a time when you were put off with a slight word he has taken me to his heart she said it with a taunting pride in the midst of her frenzyfor it was little lessyet with an eager remembrance of it in which the smouldering embers of a gentler feeling kindled for the moment
i descendedas i might have known i should but that he fascinated me with his boyish courtshipinto a doll a trifle for the occupation of an idle hour to be dropped and taken up and trifled with as the inconstant humour took him
when he grew weary i grew weary
as his fancy died out i would no more have tried to strengthen any power i had than i would have married him on his being forced to take me for his wife
we fell away from one another without a word
perhaps you saw it and were not sorry
since then i have been a mere disfigured piece of furniture between you both having no eyes no ears no feelings no remembrances
moan
moan for what you made him not for your love
i tell you that the time was when i loved him better than you ever did she stood with her bright angry eyes confronting the wide stare and the set face and softened no more when the moaning was repeated than if the face had been a picture
miss dartle said i if you can be so obdurate as not to feel for this afflicted mother who feels for me she sharply retorted
she has sown this
let her moan for the harvest that she reaps today and if his faults i began
faults she cried bursting into passionate tears
who dares malign him
he had a soul worth millions of the friends to whom he stooped no one can have loved him better no one can hold him in dearer remembrance than i i replied
i meant to say if you have no compassion for his mother or if his faultsyou have been bitter on them its false she cried tearing her black hair i loved him if his faults cannot i went on be banished from your remembrance in such an hour look at that figure even as one you have never seen before and render it some help all this time the figure was unchanged and looked unchangeable
motionless rigid staring moaning in the same dumb way from time to time with the same helpless motion of the head but giving no other sign of life
miss dartle suddenly kneeled down before it and began to loosen the dress
a curse upon you she said looking round at me with a mingled expression of rage and grief
it was in an evil hour that you ever came here
a curse upon you
go after passing out of the room i hurried back to ring the bell the sooner to alarm the servants
she had then taken the impassive figure in her arms and still upon her knees was weeping over it kissing it calling to it rocking it to and fro upon her bosom like a child and trying every tender means to rouse the dormant senses
no longer afraid of leaving her i noiselessly turned back again and alarmed the house as i went out
later in the day i returned and we laid him in his mothers room
she was just the same they told me miss dartle never left her doctors were in attendance many things had been tried but she lay like a statue except for the low sound now and then
i went through the dreary house and darkened the windows
the windows of the chamber where he lay i darkened last
i lifted up the leaden hand and held it to my heart and all the world seemed death and silence broken only by his mothers moaning
one thing more i had to do before yielding myself to the shock of these emotions
it was to conceal what had occurred from those who were going away and to dismiss them on their voyage in happy ignorance
in this no time was to be lost
i took mr micawber aside that same night and confided to him the task of standing between mr peggotty and intelligence of the late catastrophe
he zealously undertook to do so and to intercept any newspaper through which it might without such precautions reach him
if it penetrates to him sir said mr micawber striking himself on the breast it shall first pass through this body mr micawber i must observe in his adaptation of himself to a new state of society had acquired a bold buccaneering air not absolutely lawless but defensive and prompt
one might have supposed him a child of the wilderness long accustomed to live out of the confines of civilization and about to return to his native wilds
he had provided himself among other things with a complete suit of oilskin and a straw hat with a very low crown pitched or caulked on the outside
in this rough clothing with a common mariners telescope under his arm and a shrewd trick of casting up his eye at the sky as looking out for dirty weather he was far more nautical after his manner than mr peggotty
his whole family if i may so express it were cleared for action
i found mrs micawber in the closest and most uncompromising of bonnets made fast under the chin and in a shawl which tied her up as i had been tied up when my aunt first received me like a bundle and was secured behind at the waist in a strong knot
miss micawber i found made snug for stormy weather in the same manner with nothing superfluous about her
master micawber was hardly visible in a guernsey shirt and the shaggiest suit of slops i ever saw and the children were done up like preserved meats in impervious cases
both mr micawber and his eldest son wore their sleeves loosely turned back at the wrists as being ready to lend a hand in any direction and to tumble up or sing out yeoheaveyeo on the shortest notice
thus traddles and i found them at nightfall assembled on the wooden steps at that time known as hungerford stairs watching the departure of a boat with some of their property on board
i had told traddles of the terrible event and it had greatly shocked him but there could be no doubt of the kindness of keeping it a secret and he had come to help me in this last service
it was here that i took mr micawber aside and received his promise
the micawber family were lodged in a little dirty tumbledown publichouse which in those days was close to the stairs and whose protruding wooden rooms overhung the river
the family as emigrants being objects of some interest in and about hungerford attracted so many beholders that we were glad to take refuge in their room
it was one of the wooden chambers upstairs with the tide flowing underneath
my aunt and agnes were there busily making some little extra comforts in the way of dress for the children
peggotty was quietly assisting with the old insensible workbox yardmeasure and bit of waxcandle before her that had now outlived so much
it was not easy to answer her inquiries still less to whisper mr peggotty when mr micawber brought him in that i had given the letter and all was well
but i did both and made them happy
if i showed any trace of what i felt my own sorrows were sufficient to account for it
and when does the ship sail mr micawber asked my aunt
mr micawber considered it necessary to prepare either my aunt or his wife by degrees and said sooner than he had expected yesterday
the boat brought you word i suppose said my aunt
it did maam he returned
well said my aunt
and she sails madam he replied i am informed that we must positively be on board before seven tomorrow morning heyday said my aunt thats soon
is it a seagoing fact mr peggotty tis so maam
shell drop down the river with that theer tide
if masr davy and my sister comes aboard at gravesen arternoon o next day theyll see the last on us and that we shall do said i be sure until then and until we are at sea observed mr micawber with a glance of intelligence at me mr
peggotty and myself will constantly keep a double lookout together on our goods and chattels
emma my love said mr micawber clearing his throat in his magnificent way my friend mr thomas traddles is so obliging as to solicit in my ear that he should have the privilege of ordering the ingredients necessary to the composition of a moderate portion of that beverage which is peculiarly associated in our minds with the roast beef of old england
i allude toin short punch
under ordinary circumstances i should scruple to entreat the indulgence of miss trotwood and miss wickfield but i can only say for myself said my aunt that i will drink all happiness and success to you mr micawber with the utmost pleasure and i too said agnes with a smile
mr micawber immediately descended to the bar where he appeared to be quite at home and in due time returned with a steaming jug
i could not but observe that he had been peeling the lemons with his own claspknife which as became the knife of a practical settler was about a foot long and which he wiped not wholly without ostentation on the sleeve of his coat
mrs micawber and the two elder members of the family i now found to be provided with similar formidable instruments while every child had its own wooden spoon attached to its body by a strong line
in a similar anticipation of life afloat and in the bush mr micawber instead of helping mrs micawber and his eldest son and daughter to punch in wineglasses which he might easily have done for there was a shelffull in the room served it out to them in a series of villainous little tin pots and i never saw him enjoy anything so much as drinking out of his own particular pint pot and putting it in his pocket at the close of the evening
the luxuries of the old country said mr micawber with an intense satisfaction in their renouncement we abandon
the denizens of the forest cannot of course expect to participate in the refinements of the land of the free here a boy came in to say that mr micawber was wanted downstairs
i have a presentiment said mrs micawber setting down her tin pot that it is a member of my family if so my dear observed mr micawber with his usual suddenness of warmth on that subject as the member of your familywhoever he she or it may behas kept us waiting for a considerable period perhaps the member may now wait my convenience micawber said his wife in a low tone at such a time as this it is not meet said mr micawber rising that every nice offence should bear its comment emma i stand reproved the loss micawber observed his wife has been my familys not yours
if my family are at length sensible of the deprivation to which their own conduct has in the past exposed them and now desire to extend the hand of fellowship let it not be repulsed my dear he returned so be it if not for their sakes for mine micawber said his wife
emma he returned that view of the question is at such a moment irresistible
i cannot even now distinctly pledge myself to fall upon your familys neck but the member of your family who is now in attendance shall have no genial warmth frozen by me mr micawber withdrew and was absent some little time in the course of which mrs micawber was not wholly free from an apprehension that words might have arisen between him and the member
at length the same boy reappeared and presented me with a note written in pencil and headed in a legal manner heep v micawber
from this document i learned that mr micawber being again arrested was in a final paroxysm of despair and that he begged me to send him his knife and pint pot by bearer as they might prove serviceable during the brief remainder of his existence in jail
he also requested as a last act of friendship that i would see his family to the parish workhouse and forget that such a being ever lived
of course i answered this note by going down with the boy to pay the money where i found mr micawber sitting in a corner looking darkly at the sheriff s officer who had effected the capture
on his release he embraced me with the utmost fervour and made an entry of the transaction in his pocketbookbeing very particular i recollect about a halfpenny i inadvertently omitted from my statement of the total
this momentous pocketbook was a timely reminder to him of another transaction
on our return to the room upstairs where he accounted for his absence by saying that it had been occasioned by circumstances over which he had no control he took out of it a large sheet of paper folded small and quite covered with long sums carefully worked
from the glimpse i had of them i should say that i never saw such sums out of a school cipheringbook
these it seemed were calculations of compound interest on what he called the principal amount of fortyone ten eleven and a half for various periods
after a careful consideration of these and an elaborate estimate of his resources he had come to the conclusion to select that sum which represented the amount with compound interest to two years fifteen calendar months and fourteen days from that date
for this he had drawn a noteofhand with great neatness which he handed over to traddles on the spot a discharge of his debt in full as between man and man with many acknowledgements
i have still a presentiment said mrs micawber pensively shaking her head that my family will appear on board before we finally depart mr micawber evidently had his presentiment on the subject too but he put it in his tin pot and swallowed it
if you have any opportunity of sending letters home on your passage mrs micawber said my aunt you must let us hear from you you know my dear miss trotwood she replied i shall only be too happy to think that anyone expects to hear from us
i shall not fail to correspond
mr copperfield i trust as an old and familiar friend will not object to receive occasional intelligence himself from one who knew him when the twins were yet unconscious i said that i should hope to hear whenever she had an opportunity of writing
please heaven there will be many such opportunities said mr micawber
the ocean in these times is a perfect fleet of ships and we can hardly fail to encounter many in running over
it is merely crossing said mr micawber trifling with his eyeglass merely crossing
the distance is quite imaginary i think now how odd it was but how wonderfully like mr micawber that when he went from london to canterbury he should have talked as if he were going to the farthest limits of the earth and when he went from england to australia as if he were going for a little trip across the channel
on the voyage i shall endeavour said mr micawber occasionally to spin them a yarn and the melody of my son wilkins will i trust be acceptable at the galleyfire
when mrs micawber has her sealegs onan expression in which i hope there is no conventional improprietyshe will give them i dare say little tafflin
porpoises and dolphins i believe will be frequently observed athwart our bows and either on the starboard or the larboard quarter objects of interest will be continually descried
in short said mr micawber with the old genteel air the probability is all will be found so exciting alow and aloft that when the lookout stationed in the maintop cries landoh
we shall be very considerably astonished with that he flourished off the contents of his little tin pot as if he had made the voyage and had passed a firstclass examination before the highest naval authorities
what i chiefly hope my dear mr copperfield said mrs micawber is that in some branches of our family we may live again in the old country
do not frown micawber
i do not now refer to my own family but to our childrens children
however vigorous the sapling said mrs micawber shaking her head i cannot forget the parenttree and when our race attains to eminence and fortune i own i should wish that fortune to flow into the coffers of britannia my dear said mr micawber britannia must take her chance
i am bound to say that she has never done much for me and that i have no particular wish upon the subject micawber returned mrs micawber there you are wrong
you are going out micawber to this distant clime to strengthen not to weaken the connexion between yourself and albion the connexion in question my love rejoined mr micawber has not laid me i repeat under that load of personal obligation that i am at all sensitive as to the formation of another connexion micawber returned mrs micawber
there i again say you are wrong
you do not know your power micawber
it is that which will strengthen even in this step you are about to take the connexion between yourself and albion mr micawber sat in his elbowchair with his eyebrows raised half receiving and half repudiating mrs micawbers views as they were stated but very sensible of their foresight
my dear mr copperfield said mrs micawber i wish mr micawber to feel his position
it appears to me highly important that mr micawber should from the hour of his embarkation feel his position
your old knowledge of me my dear mr copperfield will have told you that i have not the sanguine disposition of mr micawber
my disposition is if i may say so eminently practical
i know that this is a long voyage
i know that it will involve many privations and inconveniences
i cannot shut my eyes to those facts
but i also know what mr micawber is
i know the latent power of mr micawber
and therefore i consider it vitally important that mr micawber should feel his position my love he observed perhaps you will allow me to remark that it is barely possible that i do feel my position at the present moment i think not micawber she rejoined
not fully
my dear mr copperfield mr micawbers is not a common case
mr micawber is going to a distant country expressly in order that he may be fully understood and appreciated for the first time
i wish mr micawber to take his stand upon that vessels prow and firmly say this country i am come to conquer
have you honours
have you riches
have you posts of profitable pecuniary emolument
let them be brought forward
they are mine mr micawber glancing at us all seemed to think there was a good deal in this idea
i wish mr micawber if i make myself understood said mrs micawber in her argumentative tone to be the caesar of his own fortunes
that my dear mr copperfield appears to me to be his true position
from the first moment of this voyage i wish mr micawber to stand upon that vessels prow and say enough of delay enough of disappointment enough of limited means
that was in the old country
this is the new
produce your reparation
bring it forward mr micawber folded his arms in a resolute manner as if he were then stationed on the figurehead
and doing that said mrs micawber feeling his positionam i not right in saying that mr micawber will strengthen and not weaken his connexion with britain
an important public character arising in that hemisphere shall i be told that its influence will not be felt at home
can i be so weak as to imagine that mr micawber wielding the rod of talent and of power in australia will be nothing in england
i am but a woman but i should be unworthy of myself and of my papa if i were guilty of such absurd weakness mrs micawbers conviction that her arguments were unanswerable gave a moral elevation to her tone which i think i had never heard in it before
and therefore it is said mrs micawber that i the more wish that at a future period we may live again on the parent soil
mr micawber may bei cannot disguise from myself that the probability is mr micawber will bea page of history and he ought then to be represented in the country which gave him birth and did not give him employment my love observed mr micawber it is impossible for me not to be touched by your affection
i am always willing to defer to your good sense
what will bewill be
heaven forbid that i should grudge my native country any portion of the wealth that may be accumulated by our descendants thats well said my aunt nodding towards mr peggotty and i drink my love to you all and every blessing and success attend you mr peggotty put down the two children he had been nursing one on each knee to join mr and mrs micawber in drinking to all of us in return and when he and the micawbers cordially shook hands as comrades and his brown face brightened with a smile i felt that he would make his way establish a good name and be beloved go where he would
even the children were instructed each to dip a wooden spoon into mr micawbers pot and pledge us in its contents
when this was done my aunt and agnes rose and parted from the emigrants
it was a sorrowful farewell
they were all crying the children hung about agnes to the last and we left poor mrs micawber in a very distressed condition sobbing and weeping by a dim candle that must have made the room look from the river like a miserable lighthouse
i went down again next morning to see that they were away
they had departed in a boat as early as five oclock
it was a wonderful instance to me of the gap such partings make that although my association of them with the tumbledown publichouse and the wooden stairs dated only from last night both seemed dreary and deserted now that they were gone
in the afternoon of the next day my old nurse and i went down to gravesend
we found the ship in the river surrounded by a crowd of boats a favourable wind blowing the signal for sailing at her masthead
i hired a boat directly and we put off to her and getting through the little vortex of confusion of which she was the centre went on board
mr peggotty was waiting for us on deck
he told me that mr micawber had just now been arrested again and for the last time at the suit of heep and that in compliance with a request i had made to him he had paid the money which i repaid him
he then took us down between decks and there any lingering fears i had of his having heard any rumours of what had happened were dispelled by mr micawbers coming out of the gloom taking his arm with an air of friendship and protection and telling me that they had scarcely been asunder for a moment since the night before last
it was such a strange scene to me and so confined and dark that at first i could make out hardly anything but by degrees it cleared as my eyes became more accustomed to the gloom and i seemed to stand in a picture by ostade
among the great beams bulks and ringbolts of the ship and the emigrantberths and chests and bundles and barrels and heaps of miscellaneous baggagelighted up here and there by dangling lanterns and elsewhere by the yellow daylight straying down a windsail or a hatchwaywere crowded groups of people making new friendships taking leave of one another talking laughing crying eating and drinking some already settled down into the possession of their few feet of space with their little households arranged and tiny children established on stools or in dwarf elbowchairs others despairing of a restingplace and wandering disconsolately
from babies who had but a week or two of life behind them to crooked old men and women who seemed to have but a week or two of life before them and from ploughmen bodily carrying out soil of england on their boots to smiths taking away samples of its soot and smoke upon their skins every age and occupation appeared to be crammed into the narrow compass of the tween decks
as my eye glanced round this place i thought i saw sitting by an open port with one of the micawber children near her a figure like emilys it first attracted my attention by another figure parting from it with a kiss and as it glided calmly away through the disorder reminding me ofagnes
but in the rapid motion and confusion and in the unsettlement of my own thoughts i lost it again and only knew that the time was come when all visitors were being warned to leave the ship that my nurse was crying on a chest beside me and that mrs gummidge assisted by some younger stooping woman in black was busily arranging mr peggottys goods
is there any last wured masr davy said he
is there any one forgotten thing afore we parts one thing said i
martha he touched the younger woman i have mentioned on the shoulder and martha stood before me
heaven bless you you good man cried i
you take her with you she answered for him with a burst of tears
i could speak no more at that time but i wrung his hand and if ever i have loved and honoured any man i loved and honoured that man in my soul
the ship was clearing fast of strangers
the greatest trial that i had remained
i told him what the noble spirit that was gone had given me in charge to say at parting
it moved him deeply
but when he charged me in return with many messages of affection and regret for those deaf ears he moved me more
the time was come
i embraced him took my weeping nurse upon my arm and hurried away
on deck i took leave of poor mrs micawber
she was looking distractedly about for her family even then and her last words to me were that she never would desert mr micawber
we went over the side into our boat and lay at a little distance to see the ship wafted on her course
it was then calm radiant sunset
she lay between us and the red light and every taper line and spar was visible against the glow
a sight at once so beautiful so mournful and so hopeful as the glorious ship lying still on the flushed water with all the life on board her crowded at the bulwarks and there clustering for a moment bareheaded and silent i never saw
silent only for a moment
as the sails rose to the wind and the ship began to move there broke from all the boats three resounding cheers which those on board took up and echoed back and which were echoed and reechoed
my heart burst out when i heard the sound and beheld the waving of the hats and handkerchiefsand then i saw her
then i saw her at her uncles side and trembling on his shoulder
he pointed to us with an eager hand and she saw us and waved her last goodbye to me
aye emily beautiful and drooping cling to him with the utmost trust of thy bruised heart for he has clung to thee with all the might of his great love
surrounded by the rosy light and standing high upon the deck apart together she clinging to him and he holding her they solemnly passed away
the night had fallen on the kentish hills when we were rowed ashoreand fallen darkly upon me
it was a long and gloomy night that gathered on me haunted by the ghosts of many hopes of many dear remembrances many errors many unavailing sorrows and regrets
i went away from england not knowing even then how great the shock was that i had to bear
i left all who were dear to me and went away and believed that i had borne it and it was past
as a man upon a field of battle will receive a mortal hurt and scarcely know that he is struck so i when i was left alone with my undisciplined heart had no conception of the wound with which it had to strive
the knowledge came upon me not quickly but little by little and grain by grain
the desolate feeling with which i went abroad deepened and widened hourly
at first it was a heavy sense of loss and sorrow wherein i could distinguish little else
by imperceptible degrees it became a hopeless consciousness of all that i had lostlove friendship interest of all that had been shatteredmy first trust my first affection the whole airy castle of my life of all that remaineda ruined blank and waste lying wide around me unbroken to the dark horizon
if my grief were selfish i did not know it to be so
i mourned for my childwife taken from her blooming world so young
i mourned for him who might have won the love and admiration of thousands as he had won mine long ago
i mourned for the broken heart that had found rest in the stormy sea and for the wandering remnants of the simple home where i had heard the nightwind blowing when i was a child
from the accumulated sadness into which i fell i had at length no hope of ever issuing again
i roamed from place to place carrying my burden with me everywhere
i felt its whole weight now and i drooped beneath it and i said in my heart that it could never be lightened
when this despondency was at its worst i believed that i should die
sometimes i thought that i would like to die at home and actually turned back on my road that i might get there soon
at other times i passed on farther awayfrom city to city seeking i know not what and trying to leave i know not what behind
it is not in my power to retrace one by one all the weary phases of distress of mind through which i passed
there are some dreams that can only be imperfectly and vaguely described and when i oblige myself to look back on this time of my life i seem to be recalling such a dream
i see myself passing on among the novelties of foreign towns palaces cathedrals temples pictures castles tombs fantastic streetsthe old abiding places of history and fancyas a dreamer might bearing my painful load through all and hardly conscious of the objects as they fade before me
listlessness to everything but brooding sorrow was the night that fell on my undisciplined heart
let me look up from itas at last i did thank heavenand from its long sad wretched dream to dawn
for many months i travelled with this everdarkening cloud upon my mind
some blind reasons that i had for not returning homereasons then struggling within me vainly for more distinct expressionkept me on my pilgrimage
sometimes i had proceeded restlessly from place to place stopping nowhere sometimes i had lingered long in one spot
i had had no purpose no sustaining soul within me anywhere
i was in switzerland
i had come out of italy over one of the great passes of the alps and had since wandered with a guide among the byways of the mountains
if those awful solitudes had spoken to my heart i did not know it
i had found sublimity and wonder in the dread heights and precipices in the roaring torrents and the wastes of ice and snow but as yet they had taught me nothing else
i came one evening before sunset down into a valley where i was to rest
in the course of my descent to it by the winding track along the mountainside from which i saw it shining far below i think some longunwonted sense of beauty and tranquillity some softening influence awakened by its peace moved faintly in my breast
i remember pausing once with a kind of sorrow that was not all oppressive not quite despairing
i remember almost hoping that some better change was possible within me
i came into the valley as the evening sun was shining on the remote heights of snow that closed it in like eternal clouds
the bases of the mountains forming the gorge in which the little village lay were richly green and high above this gentler vegetation grew forests of dark fir cleaving the wintry snowdrift wedgelike and stemming the avalanche
above these were range upon range of craggy steeps grey rock bright ice and smooth verdurespecks of pasture all gradually blending with the crowning snow
dotted here and there on the mountainsside each tiny dot a home were lonely wooden cottages so dwarfed by the towering heights that they appeared too small for toys
so did even the clustered village in the valley with its wooden bridge across the stream where the stream tumbled over broken rocks and roared away among the trees
in the quiet air there was a sound of distant singingshepherd voices but as one bright evening cloud floated midway along the mountainsside i could almost have believed it came from there and was not earthly music
all at once in this serenity great nature spoke to me and soothed me to lay down my weary head upon the grass and weep as i had not wept yet since dora died
i had found a packet of letters awaiting me but a few minutes before and had strolled out of the village to read them while my supper was making ready
other packets had missed me and i had received none for a long time
beyond a line or two to say that i was well and had arrived at such a place i had not had fortitude or constancy to write a letter since i left home
the packet was in my hand
i opened it and read the writing of agnes
she was happy and useful was prospering as she had hoped
that was all she told me of herself
the rest referred to me
she gave me no advice she urged no duty on me she only told me in her own fervent manner what her trust in me was
she knew she said how such a nature as mine would turn affliction to good
she knew how trial and emotion would exalt and strengthen it
she was sure that in my every purpose i should gain a firmer and a higher tendency through the grief i had undergone
she who so gloried in my fame and so looked forward to its augmentation well knew that i would labour on
she knew that in me sorrow could not be weakness but must be strength
as the endurance of my childish days had done its part to make me what i was so greater calamities would nerve me on to be yet better than i was and so as they had taught me would i teach others
she commended me to god who had taken my innocent darling to his rest and in her sisterly affection cherished me always and was always at my side go where i would proud of what i had done but infinitely prouder yet of what i was reserved to do
i put the letter in my breast and thought what had i been an hour ago
when i heard the voices die away and saw the quiet evening cloud grow dim and all the colours in the valley fade and the golden snow upon the mountaintops become a remote part of the pale night sky yet felt that the night was passing from my mind and all its shadows clearing there was no name for the love i bore her dearer to me henceforward than ever until then
i read her letter many times
i wrote to her before i slept
i told her that i had been in sore need of her help that without her i was not and i never had been what she thought me but that she inspired me to be that and i would try
i did try
in three months more a year would have passed since the beginning of my sorrow
i determined to make no resolutions until the expiration of those three months but to try
i lived in that valley and its neighbourhood all the time
the three months gone i resolved to remain away from home for some time longer to settle myself for the present in switzerland which was growing dear to me in the remembrance of that evening to resume my pen to work
i resorted humbly whither agnes had commended me i sought out nature never sought in vain and i admitted to my breast the human interest i had lately shrunk from
it was not long before i had almost as many friends in the valley as in yarmouth and when i left it before the winter set in for geneva and came back in the spring their cordial greetings had a homely sound to me although they were not conveyed in english words
i worked early and late patiently and hard
i wrote a story with a purpose growing not remotely out of my experience and sent it to traddles and he arranged for its publication very advantageously for me and the tidings of my growing reputation began to reach me from travellers whom i encountered by chance
after some rest and change i fell to work in my old ardent way on a new fancy which took strong possession of me
as i advanced in the execution of this task i felt it more and more and roused my utmost energies to do it well
this was my third work of fiction
it was not half written when in an interval of rest i thought of returning home
for a long time though studying and working patiently i had accustomed myself to robust exercise
my health severely impaired when i left england was quite restored
i had seen much
i had been in many countries and i hope i had improved my store of knowledge
i have now recalled all that i think it needful to recall here of this term of absencewith one reservation
i have made it thus far with no purpose of suppressing any of my thoughts for as i have elsewhere said this narrative is my written memory
i have desired to keep the most secret current of my mind apart and to the last
i enter on it now
i cannot so completely penetrate the mystery of my own heart as to know when i began to think that i might have set its earliest and brightest hopes on agnes
i cannot say at what stage of my grief it first became associated with the reflection that in my wayward boyhood i had thrown away the treasure of her love
i believe i may have heard some whisper of that distant thought in the old unhappy loss or want of something never to be realized of which i had been sensible
but the thought came into my mind as a new reproach and new regret when i was left so sad and lonely in the world
if at that time i had been much with her i should in the weakness of my desolation have betrayed this
it was what i remotely dreaded when i was first impelled to stay away from england
i could not have borne to lose the smallest portion of her sisterly affection yet in that betrayal i should have set a constraint between us hitherto unknown
i could not forget that the feeling with which she now regarded me had grown up in my own free choice and course
that if she had ever loved me with another loveand i sometimes thought the time was when she might have done soi had cast it away
it was nothing now that i had accustomed myself to think of her when we were both mere children as one who was far removed from my wild fancies
i had bestowed my passionate tenderness upon another object and what i might have done i had not done and what agnes was to me i and her own noble heart had made her
in the beginning of the change that gradually worked in me when i tried to get a better understanding of myself and be a better man i did glance through some indefinite probation to a period when i might possibly hope to cancel the mistaken past and to be so blessed as to marry her
but as time wore on this shadowy prospect faded and departed from me
if she had ever loved me then i should hold her the more sacred remembering the confidences i had reposed in her her knowledge of my errant heart the sacrifice she must have made to be my friend and sister and the victory she had won
if she had never loved me could i believe that she would love me now
i had always felt my weakness in comparison with her constancy and fortitude and now i felt it more and more
whatever i might have been to her or she to me if i had been more worthy of her long ago i was not now and she was not
the time was past
i had let it go by and had deservedly lost her
that i suffered much in these contentions that they filled me with unhappiness and remorse and yet that i had a sustaining sense that it was required of me in right and honour to keep away from myself with shame the thought of turning to the dear girl in the withering of my hopes from whom i had frivolously turned when they were bright and freshwhich consideration was at the root of every thought i had concerning heris all equally true
i made no effort to conceal from myself now that i loved her that i was devoted to her but i brought the assurance home to myself that it was now too late and that our longsubsisting relation must be undisturbed
i had thought much and often of my doras shadowing out to me what might have happened in those years that were destined not to try us i had considered how the things that never happen are often as much realities to us in their effects as those that are accomplished
the very years she spoke of were realities now for my correction and would have been one day a little later perhaps though we had parted in our earliest folly
i endeavoured to convert what might have been between myself and agnes into a means of making me more selfdenying more resolved more conscious of myself and my defects and errors
thus through the reflection that it might have been i arrived at the conviction that it could never be
these with their perplexities and inconsistencies were the shifting quicksands of my mind from the time of my departure to the time of my return home three years afterwards
three years had elapsed since the sailing of the emigrant ship when at that same hour of sunset and in the same place i stood on the deck of the packet vessel that brought me home looking on the rosy water where i had seen the image of that ship reflected
three years
long in the aggregate though short as they went by
and home was very dear to me and agnes toobut she was not mineshe was never to be mine
she might have been but that was past
i landed in london on a wintry autumn evening
it was dark and raining and i saw more fog and mud in a minute than i had seen in a year
i walked from the custom house to the monument before i found a coach and although the very housefronts looking on the swollen gutters were like old friends to me i could not but admit that they were very dingy friends
i have often remarkedi suppose everybody hasthat ones going away from a familiar place would seem to be the signal for change in it
as i looked out of the coach window and observed that an old house on fishstreet hill which had stood untouched by painter carpenter or bricklayer for a century had been pulled down in my absence and that a neighbouring street of timehonoured insalubrity and inconvenience was being drained and widened i half expected to find st pauls cathedral looking older
for some changes in the fortunes of my friends i was prepared
my aunt had long been reestablished at dover and traddles had begun to get into some little practice at the bar in the very first term after my departure
he had chambers in grays inn now and had told me in his last letters that he was not without hopes of being soon united to the dearest girl in the world
they expected me home before christmas but had no idea of my returning so soon
i had purposely misled them that i might have the pleasure of taking them by surprise
and yet i was perverse enough to feel a chill and disappointment in receiving no welcome and rattling alone and silent through the misty streets
the wellknown shops however with their cheerful lights did something for me and when i alighted at the door of the grays inn coffeehouse i had recovered my spirits
it recalled at first that sodifferent time when i had put up at the golden cross and reminded me of the changes that had come to pass since then but that was natural
do you know where mr traddles lives in the inn i asked the waiter as i warmed myself by the coffeeroom fire
holborn court sir
number two mr
traddles has a rising reputation among the lawyers i believe said i
well sir returned the waiter probably he has sir but i am not aware of it myself this waiter who was middleaged and spare looked for help to a waiter of more authoritya stout potential old man with a double chin in black breeches and stockings who came out of a place like a churchwardens pew at the end of the coffeeroom where he kept company with a cashbox a directory a lawlist and other books and papers
mr
traddles said the spare waiter
number two in the court the potential waiter waved him away and turned gravely to me
i was inquiring said i whether mr traddles at number two in the court has not a rising reputation among the lawyers never heard his name said the waiter in a rich husky voice
i felt quite apologetic for traddles
hes a young man sure said the portentous waiter fixing his eyes severely on me
how long has he been in the inn not above three years said i
the waiter who i supposed had lived in his churchwardens pew for forty years could not pursue such an insignificant subject
he asked me what i would have for dinner
i felt i was in england again and really was quite cast down on traddless account
there seemed to be no hope for him
i meekly ordered a bit of fish and a steak and stood before the fire musing on his obscurity
as i followed the chief waiter with my eyes i could not help thinking that the garden in which he had gradually blown to be the flower he was was an arduous place to rise in
it had such a prescriptive stiffnecked longestablished solemn elderly air
i glanced about the room which had had its sanded floor sanded no doubt in exactly the same manner when the chief waiter was a boyif he ever was a boy which appeared improbable and at the shining tables where i saw myself reflected in unruffled depths of old mahogany and at the lamps without a flaw in their trimming or cleaning and at the comfortable green curtains with their pure brass rods snugly enclosing the boxes and at the two large coal fires brightly burning and at the rows of decanters burly as if with the consciousness of pipes of expensive old port wine below and both england and the law appeared to me to be very difficult indeed to be taken by storm
i went up to my bedroom to change my wet clothes and the vast extent of that old wainscoted apartment which was over the archway leading to the inn i remember and the sedate immensity of the fourpost bedstead and the indomitable gravity of the chests of drawers all seemed to unite in sternly frowning on the fortunes of traddles or on any such daring youth
i came down again to my dinner and even the slow comfort of the meal and the orderly silence of the placewhich was bare of guests the long vacation not yet being overwere eloquent on the audacity of traddles and his small hopes of a livelihood for twenty years to come
i had seen nothing like this since i went away and it quite dashed my hopes for my friend
the chief waiter had had enough of me
he came near me no more but devoted himself to an old gentleman in long gaiters to meet whom a pint of special port seemed to come out of the cellar of its own accord for he gave no order
the second waiter informed me in a whisper that this old gentleman was a retired conveyancer living in the square and worth a mint of money which it was expected he would leave to his laundresss daughter likewise that it was rumoured that he had a service of plate in a bureau all tarnished with lying by though more than one spoon and a fork had never yet been beheld in his chambers by mortal vision
by this time i quite gave traddles up for lost and settled in my own mind that there was no hope for him
being very anxious to see the dear old fellow nevertheless i dispatched my dinner in a manner not at all calculated to raise me in the opinion of the chief waiter and hurried out by the back way
number two in the court was soon reached and an inscription on the doorpost informing me that mr traddles occupied a set of chambers on the top storey i ascended the staircase
a crazy old staircase i found it to be feebly lighted on each landing by a clubheaded little oil wick dying away in a little dungeon of dirty glass
in the course of my stumbling upstairs i fancied i heard a pleasant sound of laughter and not the laughter of an attorney or barrister or attorneys clerk or barristers clerk but of two or three merry girls
happening however as i stopped to listen to put my foot in a hole where the honourable society of grays inn had left a plank deficient i fell down with some noise and when i recovered my footing all was silent
groping my way more carefully for the rest of the journey my heart beat high when i found the outer door which had mr traddles painted on it open
i knocked
a considerable scuffling within ensued but nothing else
i therefore knocked again
a small sharplooking lad halffootboy and halfclerk who was very much out of breath but who looked at me as if he defied me to prove it legally presented himself
is mr traddles within i said
yes sir but hes engaged i want to see him after a moments survey of me the sharplooking lad decided to let me in and opening the door wider for that purpose admitted me first into a little closet of a hall and next into a little sittingroom where i came into the presence of my old friend also out of breath seated at a table and bending over papers
good god cried traddles looking up
its copperfield and rushed into my arms where i held him tight
all well my dear traddles all well my dear dear copperfield and nothing but good news we cried with pleasure both of us
my dear fellow said traddles rumpling his hair in his excitement which was a most unnecessary operation my dearest copperfield my longlost and most welcome friend how glad i am to see you
how brown you are
how glad i am
upon my life and honour i never was so rejoiced my beloved copperfield never i was equally at a loss to express my emotions
i was quite unable to speak at first
my dear fellow said traddles
and grown so famous
my glorious copperfield
good gracious me when did you come where have you come from what have you been doing never pausing for an answer to anything he said traddles who had clapped me into an easychair by the fire all this time impetuously stirred the fire with one hand and pulled at my neckkerchief with the other under some wild delusion that it was a greatcoat
without putting down the poker he now hugged me again and i hugged him and both laughing and both wiping our eyes we both sat down and shook hands across the hearth
to think said traddles that you should have been so nearly coming home as you must have been my dear old boy and not at the ceremony what ceremony my dear traddles good gracious me cried traddles opening his eyes in his old way
didnt you get my last letter certainly not if it referred to any ceremony why my dear copperfield said traddles sticking his hair upright with both hands and then putting his hands on my knees i am married married i cried joyfully
lord bless me yes said traddlesby the reverend horaceto sophydown in devonshire
why my dear boy shes behind the window curtain
look here to my amazement the dearest girl in the world came at that same instant laughing and blushing from her place of concealment
and a more cheerful amiable honest happy brightlooking bride i believe as i could not help saying on the spot the world never saw
i kissed her as an old acquaintance should and wished them joy with all my might of heart
dear me said traddles what a delightful reunion this is
you are so extremely brown my dear copperfield
god bless my soul how happy i am and so am i said i
and i am sure i am said the blushing and laughing sophy
we are all as happy as possible said traddles
even the girls are happy
dear me i declare i forgot them forgot said i
the girls said traddles
sophys sisters
they are staying with us
they have come to have a peep at london
the fact is whenwas it you that tumbled upstairs copperfield it was said i laughing
well then when you tumbled upstairs said traddles i was romping with the girls
in point of fact we were playing at puss in the corner
but as that wouldnt do in westminster hall and as it wouldnt look quite professional if they were seen by a client they decamped
and they are nowlistening i have no doubt said traddles glancing at the door of another room
i am sorry said i laughing afresh to have occasioned such a dispersion upon my word rejoined traddles greatly delighted if you had seen them running away and running back again after you had knocked to pick up the combs they had dropped out of their hair and going on in the maddest manner you wouldnt have said so
my love will you fetch the girls sophy tripped away and we heard her received in the adjoining room with a peal of laughter
really musical isnt it my dear copperfield said traddles
its very agreeable to hear
it quite lights up these old rooms
to an unfortunate bachelor of a fellow who has lived alone all his life you know its positively delicious
its charming
poor things they have had a great loss in sophywho i do assure you copperfield is and ever was the dearest girland it gratifies me beyond expression to find them in such good spirits
the society of girls is a very delightful thing copperfield
its not professional but its very delightful observing that he slightly faltered and comprehending that in the goodness of his heart he was fearful of giving me some pain by what he had said i expressed my concurrence with a heartiness that evidently relieved and pleased him greatly
but then said traddles our domestic arrangements are to say the truth quite unprofessional altogether my dear copperfield
even sophys being here is unprofessional
and we have no other place of abode
we have put to sea in a cockboat but we are quite prepared to rough it
and sophys an extraordinary manager
youll be surprised how those girls are stowed away
i am sure i hardly know how its done are many of the young ladies with you i inquired
the eldest the beauty is here said traddles in a low confidential voice caroline
and sarahs herethe one i mentioned to you as having something the matter with her spine you know
immensely better
and the two youngest that sophy educated are with us
and louisas here indeed cried i
yes said traddles
now the whole seti mean the chambersis only three rooms but sophy arranges for the girls in the most wonderful way and they sleep as comfortably as possible
three in that room said traddles pointing
two in that i could not help glancing round in search of the accommodation remaining for mr and mrs traddles
traddles understood me
well said traddles we are prepared to rough it as i said just now and we did improvise a bed last week upon the floor here
but theres a little room in the roofa very nice room when youre up therewhich sophy papered herself to surprise me and thats our room at present
its a capital little gipsy sort of place
theres quite a view from it and you are happily married at last my dear traddles said i
how rejoiced i am thank you my dear copperfield said traddles as we shook hands once more
yes i am as happy as its possible to be
theres your old friend you see said traddles nodding triumphantly at the flowerpot and stand and theres the table with the marble top
all the other furniture is plain and serviceable you perceive
and as to plate lord bless you we havent so much as a teaspoon all to be earned said i cheerfully
exactly so replied traddles all to be earned
of course we have something in the shape of teaspoons because we stir our tea
but theyre britannia metal the silver will be the brighter when it comes said i
the very thing we say cried traddles
you see my dear copperfield falling again into the low confidential tone after i had delivered my argument in doe dem
jipes versus wigziell which did me great service with the profession i went down into devonshire and had some serious conversation in private with the reverend horace
i dwelt upon the fact that sophywho i do assure you copperfield is the dearest girl i am certain she is said i
she is indeed rejoined traddles
but i am afraid i am wandering from the subject
did i mention the reverend horace you said that you dwelt upon the fact true
upon the fact that sophy and i had been engaged for a long period and that sophy with the permission of her parents was more than content to take mein short said traddles with his old frank smile on our present britanniametal footing
very well
i then proposed to the reverend horacewho is a most excellent clergyman copperfield and ought to be a bishop or at least ought to have enough to live upon without pinching himselfthat if i could turn the corner say of two hundred and fifty pounds in one year and could see my way pretty clearly to that or something better next year and could plainly furnish a little place like this besides then and in that case sophy and i should be united
i took the liberty of representing that we had been patient for a good many years and that the circumstance of sophys being extraordinarily useful at home ought not to operate with her affectionate parents against her establishment in lifedont you see certainly it ought not said i
i am glad you think so copperfield rejoined traddles because without any imputation on the reverend horace i do think parents and brothers and so forth are sometimes rather selfish in such cases
well
i also pointed out that my most earnest desire was to be useful to the family and that if i got on in the world and anything should happen to himi refer to the reverend horace i understand said i
or to mrs crewlerit would be the utmost gratification of my wishes to be a parent to the girls
he replied in a most admirable manner exceedingly flattering to my feelings and undertook to obtain the consent of mrs crewler to this arrangement
they had a dreadful time of it with her
it mounted from her legs into her chest and then into her head what mounted i asked
her grief replied traddles with a serious look
her feelings generally
as i mentioned on a former occasion she is a very superior woman but has lost the use of her limbs
whatever occurs to harass her usually settles in her legs but on this occasion it mounted to the chest and then to the head and in short pervaded the whole system in a most alarming manner
however they brought her through it by unremitting and affectionate attention and we were married yesterday six weeks
you have no idea what a monster i felt copperfield when i saw the whole family crying and fainting away in every direction
mrs crewler couldnt see me before we leftcouldnt forgive me then for depriving her of her childbut she is a good creature and has done so since
i had a delightful letter from her only this morning and in short my dear friend said i you feel as blest as you deserve to feel oh
thats your partiality laughed traddles
but indeed i am in a most enviable state
i work hard and read law insatiably
i get up at five every morning and dont mind it at all
i hide the girls in the daytime and make merry with them in the evening
and i assure you i am quite sorry that they are going home on tuesday which is the day before the first day of michaelmas term
but here said traddles breaking off in his confidence and speaking aloud are the girls
mr copperfield miss crewlermiss sarahmiss louisamargaret and lucy they were a perfect nest of roses they looked so wholesome and fresh
they were all pretty and miss caroline was very handsome but there was a loving cheerful fireside quality in sophys bright looks which was better than that and which assured me that my friend had chosen well
we all sat round the fire while the sharp boy who i now divined had lost his breath in putting the papers out cleared them away again and produced the teathings
after that he retired for the night shutting the outer door upon us with a bang
mrs traddles with perfect pleasure and composure beaming from her household eyes having made the tea then quietly made the toast as she sat in a corner by the fire
she had seen agnes she told me while she was toasting
tom had taken her down into kent for a wedding trip and there she had seen my aunt too and both my aunt and agnes were well and they had all talked of nothing but me
tom had never had me out of his thoughts she really believed all the time i had been away
tom was the authority for everything
tom was evidently the idol of her life never to be shaken on his pedestal by any commotion always to be believed in and done homage to with the whole faith of her heart come what might
the deference which both she and traddles showed towards the beauty pleased me very much
i dont know that i thought it very reasonable but i thought it very delightful and essentially a part of their character
if traddles ever for an instant missed the teaspoons that were still to be won i have no doubt it was when he handed the beauty her tea
if his sweettempered wife could have got up any selfassertion against anyone i am satisfied it could only have been because she was the beautys sister
a few slight indications of a rather petted and capricious manner which i observed in the beauty were manifestly considered by traddles and his wife as her birthright and natural endowment
if she had been born a queen bee and they labouring bees they could not have been more satisfied of that
but their selfforgetfulness charmed me
their pride in these girls and their submission of themselves to all their whims was the pleasantest little testimony to their own worth i could have desired to see
if traddles were addressed as a darling once in the course of that evening and besought to bring something here or carry something there or take something up or put something down or find something or fetch something he was so addressed by one or other of his sistersinlaw at least twelve times in an hour
neither could they do anything without sophy
somebodys hair fell down and nobody but sophy could put it up
somebody forgot how a particular tune went and nobody but sophy could hum that tune right
somebody wanted to recall the name of a place in devonshire and only sophy knew it
something was wanted to be written home and sophy alone could be trusted to write before breakfast in the morning
somebody broke down in a piece of knitting and no one but sophy was able to put the defaulter in the right direction
they were entire mistresses of the place and sophy and traddles waited on them
how many children sophy could have taken care of in her time i cant imagine but she seemed to be famous for knowing every sort of song that ever was addressed to a child in the english tongue and she sang dozens to order with the clearest little voice in the world one after another every sister issuing directions for a different tune and the beauty generally striking in last so that i was quite fascinated
the best of all was that in the midst of their exactions all the sisters had a great tenderness and respect both for sophy and traddles
i am sure when i took my leave and traddles was coming out to walk with me to the coffeehouse i thought i had never seen an obstinate head of hair or any other head of hair rolling about in such a shower of kisses
altogether it was a scene i could not help dwelling on with pleasure for a long time after i got back and had wished traddles good night
if i had beheld a thousand roses blowing in a top set of chambers in that withered grays inn they could not have brightened it half so much
the idea of those devonshire girls among the dry lawstationers and the attorneys offices and of the tea and toast and childrens songs in that grim atmosphere of pounce and parchment redtape dusty wafers inkjars brief and draft paper law reports writs declarations and bills of costs seemed almost as pleasantly fanciful as if i had dreamed that the sultans famous family had been admitted on the roll of attorneys and had brought the talking bird the singing tree and the golden water into grays inn hall
somehow i found that i had taken leave of traddles for the night and come back to the coffeehouse with a great change in my despondency about him
i began to think he would get on in spite of all the many orders of chief waiters in england
drawing a chair before one of the coffeeroom fires to think about him at my leisure i gradually fell from the consideration of his happiness to tracing prospects in the livecoals and to thinking as they broke and changed of the principal vicissitudes and separations that had marked my life
i had not seen a coal fire since i had left england three years ago though many a wood fire had i watched as it crumbled into hoary ashes and mingled with the feathery heap upon the hearth which not inaptly figured to me in my despondency my own dead hopes
i could think of the past now gravely but not bitterly and could contemplate the future in a brave spirit
home in its best sense was for me no more
she in whom i might have inspired a dearer love i had taught to be my sister
she would marry and would have new claimants on her tenderness and in doing it would never know the love for her that had grown up in my heart
it was right that i should pay the forfeit of my headlong passion
what i reaped i had sown
i was thinking
and had i truly disciplined my heart to this and could i resolutely bear it and calmly hold the place in her home which she had calmly held in minewhen i found my eyes resting on a countenance that might have arisen out of the fire in its association with my early remembrances
little mr chillip the doctor to whose good offices i was indebted in the very first chapter of this history sat reading a newspaper in the shadow of an opposite corner
he was tolerably stricken in years by this time but being a mild meek calm little man had worn so easily that i thought he looked at that moment just as he might have looked when he sat in our parlour waiting for me to be born
mr chillip had left blunderstone six or seven years ago and i had never seen him since
he sat placidly perusing the newspaper with his little head on one side and a glass of warm sherry negus at his elbow
he was so extremely conciliatory in his manner that he seemed to apologize to the very newspaper for taking the liberty of reading it
i walked up to where he was sitting and said how do you do mr chillip he was greatly fluttered by this unexpected address from a stranger and replied in his slow way i thank you sir you are very good
thank you sir
i hope you are well you dont remember me said i
well sir returned mr chillip smiling very meekly and shaking his head as he surveyed me i have a kind of an impression that something in your countenance is familiar to me sir but i couldnt lay my hand upon your name really and yet you knew it long before i knew it myself i returned
did i indeed sir said mr chillip
is it possible that i had the honour sir of officiating when yes said i
dear me cried mr chillip
but no doubt you are a good deal changed since then sir probably said i
well sir observed mr chillip i hope youll excuse me if i am compelled to ask the favour of your name on my telling him my name he was really moved
he quite shook hands with mewhich was a violent proceeding for him his usual course being to slide a tepid little fishslice an inch or two in advance of his hip and evince the greatest discomposure when anybody grappled with it
even now he put his hand in his coatpocket as soon as he could disengage it and seemed relieved when he had got it safe back
dear me sir said mr chillip surveying me with his head on one side
and its mr copperfield is it
well sir i think i should have known you if i had taken the liberty of looking more closely at you
theres a strong resemblance between you and your poor father sir i never had the happiness of seeing my father i observed
very true sir said mr chillip in a soothing tone
and very much to be deplored it was on all accounts
we are not ignorant sir said mr chillip slowly shaking his little head again down in our part of the country of your fame
there must be great excitement here sir said mr chillip tapping himself on the forehead with his forefinger
you must find it a trying occupation sir what is your part of the country now i asked seating myself near him
i am established within a few miles of bury st edmunds sir said mr chillip
mrs
chillip coming into a little property in that neighbourhood under her fathers will i bought a practice down there in which you will be glad to hear i am doing well
my daughter is growing quite a tall lass now sir said mr chillip giving his little head another little shake
her mother let down two tucks in her frocks only last week
such is time you see sir as the little man put his now empty glass to his lips when he made this reflection i proposed to him to have it refilled and i would keep him company with another
well sir he returned in his slow way its more than i am accustomed to but i cant deny myself the pleasure of your conversation
it seems but yesterday that i had the honour of attending you in the measles
you came through them charmingly sir i acknowledged this compliment and ordered the negus which was soon produced
quite an uncommon dissipation said mr chillip stirring it but i cant resist so extraordinary an occasion
you have no family sir i shook my head
i was aware that you sustained a bereavement sir some time ago said mr chillip
i heard it from your fatherinlaws sister
very decided character there sir why yes said i decided enough
where did you see her mr chillip are you not aware sir returned mr chillip with his placidest smile that your fatherinlaw is again a neighbour of mine no said i
he is indeed sir said mr chillip
married a young lady of that part with a very good little property poor thingand this action of the brain now sir
dont you find it fatigue you said mr chillip looking at me like an admiring robin
i waived that question and returned to the murdstones
i was aware of his being married again
do you attend the family i asked
not regularly
i have been called in he replied
strong phrenological developments of the organ of firmness in mr murdstone and his sister sir i replied with such an expressive look that mr chillip was emboldened by that and the negus together to give his head several short shakes and thoughtfully exclaim ah dear me
we remember old times mr copperfield and the brother and sister are pursuing their old course are they said i
well sir replied mr chillip a medical man being so much in families ought to have neither eyes nor ears for anything but his profession
still i must say they are very severe sir both as to this life and the next the next will be regulated without much reference to them i dare say i returned what are they doing as to this mr chillip shook his head stirred his negus and sipped it
she was a charming woman sir he observed in a plaintive manner
the present mrs murdstone a charming woman indeed sir said mr chillip as amiable i am sure as it was possible to be
mrs chillips opinion is that her spirit has been entirely broken since her marriage and that she is all but melancholy mad
and the ladies observed mr chillip timorously are great observers sir i suppose she was to be subdued and broken to their detestable mould heaven help her said i
and she has been well sir there were violent quarrels at first i assure you said mr chillip but she is quite a shadow now
would it be considered forward if i was to say to you sir in confidence that since the sister came to help the brother and sister between them have nearly reduced her to a state of imbecility i told him i could easily believe it
i have no hesitation in saying said mr chillip fortifying himself with another sip of negus between you and me sir that her mother died of itor that tyranny gloom and worry have made mrs murdstone nearly imbecile
she was a lively young woman sir before marriage and their gloom and austerity destroyed her
they go about with her now more like her keepers than her husband and sisterinlaw
that was mrs chillips remark to me only last week
and i assure you sir the ladies are great observers
mrs chillip herself is a great observer does he gloomily profess to be i am ashamed to use the word in such association religious still i inquired
you anticipate sir said mr chillip his eyelids getting quite red with the unwonted stimulus in which he was indulging
one of mrs chillips most impressive remarks
mrs chillip he proceeded in the calmest and slowest manner quite electrified me by pointing out that mr murdstone sets up an image of himself and calls it the divine nature
you might have knocked me down on the flat of my back sir with the feather of a pen i assure you when mrs chillip said so
the ladies are great observers sir intuitively said i to his extreme delight
i am very happy to receive such support in my opinion sir he rejoined
it is not often that i venture to give a nonmedical opinion i assure you
mr murdstone delivers public addresses sometimes and it is saidin short sir it is said by mrs chillipthat the darker tyrant he has lately been the more ferocious is his doctrine i believe mrs chillip to be perfectly right said i
mrs
chillip does go so far as to say pursued the meekest of little men much encouraged that what such people miscall their religion is a vent for their bad humours and arrogance
and do you know i must say sir he continued mildly laying his head on one side that i dont find authority for mr and miss murdstone in the new testament i never found it either said i
in the meantime sir said mr chillip they are much disliked and as they are very free in consigning everybody who dislikes them to perdition we really have a good deal of perdition going on in our neighbourhood
however as mrs chillip says sir they undergo a continual punishment for they are turned inward to feed upon their own hearts and their own hearts are very bad feeding
now sir about that brain of yours if youll excuse my returning to it
dont you expose it to a good deal of excitement sir i found it not difficult in the excitement of mr chillips own brain under his potations of negus to divert his attention from this topic to his own affairs on which for the next halfhour he was quite loquacious giving me to understand among other pieces of information that he was then at the grays inn coffeehouse to lay his professional evidence before a commission of lunacy touching the state of mind of a patient who had become deranged from excessive drinking
and i assure you sir he said i am extremely nervous on such occasions
i could not support being what is called bullied sir
it would quite unman me
do you know it was some time before i recovered the conduct of that alarming lady on the night of your birth mr copperfield i told him that i was going down to my aunt the dragon of that night early in the morning and that she was one of the most tenderhearted and excellent of women as he would know full well if he knew her better
the mere notion of the possibility of his ever seeing her again appeared to terrify him
he replied with a small pale smile is she so indeed sir
really and almost immediately called for a candle and went to bed as if he were not quite safe anywhere else
he did not actually stagger under the negus but i should think his placid little pulse must have made two or three more beats in a minute than it had done since the great night of my aunts disappointment when she struck at him with her bonnet
thoroughly tired i went to bed too at midnight passed the next day on the dover coach burst safe and sound into my aunts old parlour while she was at tea she wore spectacles now and was received by her and mr dick and dear old peggotty who acted as housekeeper with open arms and tears of joy
my aunt was mightily amused when we began to talk composedly by my account of my meeting with mr chillip and of his holding her in such dread remembrance and both she and peggotty had a great deal to say about my poor mothers second husband and that murdering woman of a sisteron whom i think no pain or penalty would have induced my aunt to bestow any christian or proper name or any other designation
my aunt and i when we were left alone talked far into the night
how the emigrants never wrote home otherwise than cheerfully and hopefully how mr micawber had actually remitted divers small sums of money on account of those pecuniary liabilities in reference to which he had been so businesslike as between man and man how janet returning into my aunts service when she came back to dover had finally carried out her renunciation of mankind by entering into wedlock with a thriving tavernkeeper and how my aunt had finally set her seal on the same great principle by aiding and abetting the bride and crowning the marriageceremony with her presence were among our topicsalready more or less familiar to me through the letters i had had
mr dick as usual was not forgotten
my aunt informed me how he incessantly occupied himself in copying everything he could lay his hands on and kept king charles the first at a respectful distance by that semblance of employment how it was one of the main joys and rewards of her life that he was free and happy instead of pining in monotonous restraint and how as a novel general conclusion nobody but she could ever fully know what he was
and when trot said my aunt patting the back of my hand as we sat in our old way before the fire when are you going over to canterbury i shall get a horse and ride over tomorrow morning aunt unless you will go with me no said my aunt in her short abrupt way
i mean to stay where i am then i should ride i said
i could not have come through canterbury today without stopping if i had been coming to anyone but her
she was pleased but answered tut trot my old bones would have kept till tomorrow and softly patted my hand again as i sat looking thoughtfully at the fire
thoughtfully for i could not be here once more and so near agnes without the revival of those regrets with which i had so long been occupied
softened regrets they might be teaching me what i had failed to learn when my younger life was all before me but not the less regrets
oh trot i seemed to hear my aunt say once more and i understood her better nowblind blind blind we both kept silence for some minutes
when i raised my eyes i found that she was steadily observant of me
perhaps she had followed the current of my mind for it seemed to me an easy one to track now wilful as it had been once
you will find her father a whitehaired old man said my aunt though a better man in all other respectsa reclaimed man
neither will you find him measuring all human interests and joys and sorrows with his one poor little inchrule now
trust me child such things must shrink very much before they can be measured off in that way indeed they must said i
you will find her pursued my aunt as good as beautiful as earnest as disinterested as she has always been
if i knew higher praise trot i would bestow it on her there was no higher praise for her no higher reproach for me
oh how had i strayed so far away
if she trains the young girls whom she has about her to be like herself said my aunt earnest even to the filling of her eyes with tears heaven knows her life will be well employed
useful and happy as she said that day
how could she be otherwise than useful and happy has agnes any i was thinking aloud rather than speaking
well
hey
any what said my aunt sharply
any lover said i
a score cried my aunt with a kind of indignant pride
she might have married twenty times my dear since you have been gone no doubt said i
no doubt
but has she any lover who is worthy of her
agnes could care for no other my aunt sat musing for a little while with her chin upon her hand
slowly raising her eyes to mine she said i suspect she has an attachment trot a prosperous one said i
trot returned my aunt gravely i cant say
i have no right to tell you even so much
she has never confided it to me but i suspect it she looked so attentively and anxiously at me i even saw her tremble that i felt now more than ever that she had followed my late thoughts
i summoned all the resolutions i had made in all those many days and nights and all those many conflicts of my heart
if it should be so i began and i hope it is i dont know that it is said my aunt curtly
you must not be ruled by my suspicions
you must keep them secret
they are very slight perhaps
i have no right to speak if it should be so i repeated agnes will tell me at her own good time
a sister to whom i have confided so much aunt will not be reluctant to confide in me my aunt withdrew her eyes from mine as slowly as she had turned them upon me and covered them thoughtfully with her hand
by and by she put her other hand on my shoulder and so we both sat looking into the past without saying another word until we parted for the night
i rode away early in the morning for the scene of my old schooldays
i cannot say that i was yet quite happy in the hope that i was gaining a victory over myself even in the prospect of so soon looking on her face again
the wellremembered ground was soon traversed and i came into the quiet streets where every stone was a boys book to me
i went on foot to the old house and went away with a heart too full to enter
i returned and looking as i passed through the low window of the turretroom where first uriah heep and afterwards mr micawber had been wont to sit saw that it was a little parlour now and that there was no office
otherwise the staid old house was as to its cleanliness and order still just as it had been when i first saw it
i requested the new maid who admitted me to tell miss wickfield that a gentleman who waited on her from a friend abroad was there and i was shown up the grave old staircase cautioned of the steps i knew so well into the unchanged drawingroom
the books that agnes and i had read together were on their shelves and the desk where i had laboured at my lessons many a night stood yet at the same old corner of the table
all the little changes that had crept in when the heeps were there were changed again
everything was as it used to be in the happy time
i stood in a window and looked across the ancient street at the opposite houses recalling how i had watched them on wet afternoons when i first came there and how i had used to speculate about the people who appeared at any of the windows and had followed them with my eyes up and down stairs while women went clicking along the pavement in pattens and the dull rain fell in slanting lines and poured out of the waterspout yonder and flowed into the road
the feeling with which i used to watch the tramps as they came into the town on those wet evenings at dusk and limped past with their bundles drooping over their shoulders at the ends of sticks came freshly back to me fraught as then with the smell of damp earth and wet leaves and briar and the sensation of the very airs that blew upon me in my own toilsome journey
the opening of the little door in the panelled wall made me start and turn
her beautiful serene eyes met mine as she came towards me
she stopped and laid her hand upon her bosom and i caught her in my arms
agnes
my dear girl
i have come too suddenly upon you no no
i am so rejoiced to see you trotwood dear agnes the happiness it is to me to see you once again i folded her to my heart and for a little while we were both silent
presently we sat down side by side and her angelface was turned upon me with the welcome i had dreamed of waking and sleeping for whole years
she was so true she was so beautiful she was so goodi owed her so much gratitude she was so dear to me that i could find no utterance for what i felt
i tried to bless her tried to thank her tried to tell her as i had often done in letters what an influence she had upon me but all my efforts were in vain
my love and joy were dumb
with her own sweet tranquillity she calmed my agitation led me back to the time of our parting spoke to me of emily whom she had visited in secret many times spoke to me tenderly of doras grave
with the unerring instinct of her noble heart she touched the chords of my memory so softly and harmoniously that not one jarred within me i could listen to the sorrowful distant music and desire to shrink from nothing it awoke
how could i when blended with it all was her dear self the better angel of my life
and you agnes i said by and by
tell me of yourself
you have hardly ever told me of your own life in all this lapse of time what should i tell she answered with her radiant smile
papa is well
you see us here quiet in our own home our anxieties set at rest our home restored to us and knowing that dear trotwood you know all all agnes said i
she looked at me with some fluttering wonder in her face
is there nothing else sister i said
her colour which had just now faded returned and faded again
she smiled with a quiet sadness i thought and shook her head
i had sought to lead her to what my aunt had hinted at for sharply painful to me as it must be to receive that confidence i was to discipline my heart and do my duty to her
i saw however that she was uneasy and i let it pass
you have much to do dear agnes with my school said she looking up again in all her bright composure
yes
it is laborious is it not the labour is so pleasant she returned that it is scarcely grateful in me to call it by that name nothing good is difficult to you said i
her colour came and went once more and once more as she bent her head i saw the same sad smile
you will wait and see papa said agnes cheerfully and pass the day with us
perhaps you will sleep in your own room
we always call it yours i could not do that having promised to ride back to my aunts at night but i would pass the day there joyfully
i must be a prisoner for a little while said agnes but here are the old books trotwood and the old music even the old flowers are here said i looking round or the old kinds i have found a pleasure returned agnes smiling while you have been absent in keeping everything as it used to be when we were children
for we were very happy then i think heaven knows we were said i
and every little thing that has reminded me of my brother said agnes with her cordial eyes turned cheerfully upon me has been a welcome companion
even this showing me the baskettrifle full of keys still hanging at her side seems to jingle a kind of old tune she smiled again and went out at the door by which she had come
it was for me to guard this sisterly affection with religious care
it was all that i had left myself and it was a treasure
if i once shook the foundations of the sacred confidence and usage in virtue of which it was given to me it was lost and could never be recovered
i set this steadily before myself
the better i loved her the more it behoved me never to forget it
i walked through the streets and once more seeing my old adversary the butchernow a constable with his staff hanging up in the shopwent down to look at the place where i had fought him and there meditated on miss shepherd and the eldest miss larkins and all the idle loves and likings and dislikings of that time
nothing seemed to have survived that time but agnes and she ever a star above me was brighter and higher
when i returned mr wickfield had come home from a garden he had a couple of miles or so out of town where he now employed himself almost every day
i found him as my aunt had described him
we sat down to dinner with some halfdozen little girls and he seemed but the shadow of his handsome picture on the wall
the tranquillity and peace belonging of old to that quiet ground in my memory pervaded it again
when dinner was done mr wickfield taking no wine and i desiring none we went upstairs where agnes and her little charges sang and played and worked
after tea the children left us and we three sat together talking of the bygone days
my part in them said mr wickfield shaking his white head has much matter for regretfor deep regret and deep contrition trotwood you well know
but i would not cancel it if it were in my power i could readily believe that looking at the face beside him
i should cancel with it he pursued such patience and devotion such fidelity such a childs love as i must not forget no
even to forget myself i understand you sir i softly said
i hold iti have always held itin veneration but no one knows not even you he returned how much she has done how much she has undergone how hard she has striven
dear agnes she had put her hand entreatingly on his arm to stop him and was very very pale
well well he said with a sigh dismissing as i then saw some trial she had borne or was yet to bear in connexion with what my aunt had told me
well
i have never told you trotwood of her mother
has anyone never sir its not muchthough it was much to suffer
she married me in opposition to her fathers wish and he renounced her
she prayed him to forgive her before my agnes came into this world
he was a very hard man and her mother had long been dead
he repulsed her
he broke her heart agnes leaned upon his shoulder and stole her arm about his neck
she had an affectionate and gentle heart he said and it was broken
i knew its tender nature very well
no one could if i did not
she loved me dearly but was never happy
she was always labouring in secret under this distress and being delicate and downcast at the time of his last repulsefor it was not the first by manypined away and died
she left me agnes two weeks old and the grey hair that you recollect me with when you first came he kissed agnes on her cheek
my love for my dear child was a diseased love but my mind was all unhealthy then
i say no more of that
i am not speaking of myself trotwood but of her mother and of her
if i give you any clue to what i am or to what i have been you will unravel it i know
what agnes is i need not say
i have always read something of her poor mothers story in her character and so i tell it you tonight when we three are again together after such great changes
i have told it all his bowed head and her angelface and filial duty derived a more pathetic meaning from it than they had had before
if i had wanted anything by which to mark this night of our reunion i should have found it in this
agnes rose up from her fathers side before long and going softly to her piano played some of the old airs to which we had often listened in that place
have you any intention of going away again agnes asked me as i was standing by
what does my sister say to that i hope not then i have no such intention agnes i think you ought not trotwood since you ask me she said mildly
your growing reputation and success enlarge your power of doing good and if i could spare my brother with her eyes upon me perhaps the time could not what i am you have made me agnes
you should know best i made you trotwood yes
agnes my dear girl i said bending over her
i tried to tell you when we met today something that has been in my thoughts since dora died
you remember when you came down to me in our little roompointing upward agnes oh trotwood she returned her eyes filled with tears
so loving so confiding and so young
can i ever forget as you were then my sister i have often thought since you have ever been to me
ever pointing upward agnes ever leading me to something better ever directing me to higher things she only shook her head through her tears i saw the same sad quiet smile
and i am so grateful to you for it agnes so bound to you that there is no name for the affection of my heart
i want you to know yet dont know how to tell you that all my life long i shall look up to you and be guided by you as i have been through the darkness that is past
whatever betides whatever new ties you may form whatever changes may come between us i shall always look to you and love you as i do now and have always done
you will always be my solace and resource as you have always been
until i die my dearest sister i shall see you always before me pointing upward she put her hand in mine and told me she was proud of me and of what i said although i praised her very far beyond her worth
then she went on softly playing but without removing her eyes from me
do you know what i have heard tonight agnes said i strangely seems to be a part of the feeling with which i regarded you when i saw you firstwith which i sat beside you in my rough schooldays you knew i had no mother she replied with a smile and felt kindly towards me more than that agnes i knew almost as if i had known this story that there was something inexplicably gentle and softened surrounding you something that might have been sorrowful in someone else as i can now understand it was but was not so in you she softly played on looking at me still
will you laugh at my cherishing such fancies agnes no or at my saying that i really believe i felt even then that you could be faithfully affectionate against all discouragement and never cease to be so until you ceased to livewill you laugh at such a dream oh no
oh no for an instant a distressful shadow crossed her face but even in the start it gave me it was gone and she was playing on and looking at me with her own calm smile
as i rode back in the lonely night the wind going by me like a restless memory i thought of this and feared she was not happy
i was not happy but thus far i had faithfully set the seal upon the past and thinking of her pointing upward thought of her as pointing to that sky above me where in the mystery to come i might yet love her with a love unknown on earth and tell her what the strife had been within me when i loved her here
for a timeat all events until my book should be completed which would be the work of several monthsi took up my abode in my aunts house at dover and there sitting in the window from which i had looked out at the moon upon the sea when that roof first gave me shelter i quietly pursued my task
in pursuance of my intention of referring to my own fictions only when their course should incidentally connect itself with the progress of my story i do not enter on the aspirations the delights anxieties and triumphs of my art
that i truly devoted myself to it with my strongest earnestness and bestowed upon it every energy of my soul i have already said
if the books i have written be of any worth they will supply the rest
i shall otherwise have written to poor purpose and the rest will be of interest to no one
occasionally i went to london to lose myself in the swarm of life there or to consult with traddles on some business point
he had managed for me in my absence with the soundest judgement and my worldly affairs were prospering
as my notoriety began to bring upon me an enormous quantity of letters from people of whom i had no knowledgechiefly about nothing and extremely difficult to answeri agreed with traddles to have my name painted up on his door
there the devoted postman on that beat delivered bushels of letters for me and there at intervals i laboured through them like a home secretary of state without the salary
among this correspondence there dropped in every now and then an obliging proposal from one of the numerous outsiders always lurking about the commons to practise under cover of my name if i would take the necessary steps remaining to make a proctor of myself and pay me a percentage on the profits
but i declined these offers being already aware that there were plenty of such covert practitioners in existence and considering the commons quite bad enough without my doing anything to make it worse
the girls had gone home when my name burst into bloom on traddless door and the sharp boy looked all day as if he had never heard of sophy shut up in a back room glancing down from her work into a sooty little strip of garden with a pump in it
but there i always found her the same bright housewife often humming her devonshire ballads when no strange foot was coming up the stairs and blunting the sharp boy in his official closet with melody
i wondered at first why i so often found sophy writing in a copybook and why she always shut it up when i appeared and hurried it into the tabledrawer
but the secret soon came out
one day traddles who had just come home through the drizzling sleet from court took a paper out of his desk and asked me what i thought of that handwriting
oh dont tom cried sophy who was warming his slippers before the fire
my dear returned tom in a delighted state why not
what do you say to that writing copperfield its extraordinarily legal and formal said i
i dont think i ever saw such a stiff hand not like a ladys hand is it said traddles
a ladys i repeated
bricks and mortar are more like a ladys hand traddles broke into a rapturous laugh and informed me that it was sophys writing that sophy had vowed and declared he would need a copyingclerk soon and she would be that clerk that she had acquired this hand from a pattern and that she could throw offi forget how many folios an hour
sophy was very much confused by my being told all this and said that when tom was made a judge he wouldnt be so ready to proclaim it
which tom denied averring that he should always be equally proud of it under all circumstances
what a thoroughly good and charming wife she is my dear traddles said i when she had gone away laughing
my dear copperfield returned traddles she is without any exception the dearest girl
the way she manages this place her punctuality domestic knowledge economy and order her cheerfulness copperfield indeed you have reason to commend her i returned
you are a happy fellow
i believe you make yourselves and each other two of the happiest people in the world i am sure we are two of the happiest people returned traddles
i admit that at all events
bless my soul when i see her getting up by candlelight on these dark mornings busying herself in the days arrangements going out to market before the clerks come into the inn caring for no weather devising the most capital little dinners out of the plainest materials making puddings and pies keeping everything in its right place always so neat and ornamental herself sitting up at night with me if its ever so late sweettempered and encouraging always and all for me i positively sometimes cant believe it copperfield he was tender of the very slippers she had been warming as he put them on and stretched his feet enjoyingly upon the fender
i positively sometimes cant believe it said traddles
then our pleasures
dear me they are inexpensive but they are quite wonderful
when we are at home here of an evening and shut the outer door and draw those curtainswhich she madewhere could we be more snug
when its fine and we go out for a walk in the evening the streets abound in enjoyment for us
we look into the glittering windows of the jewellers shops and i show sophy which of the diamondeyed serpents coiled up on white satin rising grounds i would give her if i could afford it and sophy shows me which of the gold watches that are capped and jewelled and engineturned and possessed of the horizontal leverescapemovement and all sorts of things she would buy for me if she could afford it and we pick out the spoons and forks fishslices butterknives and sugartongs we should both prefer if we could both afford it and really we go away as if we had got them
then when we stroll into the squares and great streets and see a house to let sometimes we look up at it and say how would that do if i was made a judge
and we parcel it outsuch a room for us such rooms for the girls and so forth until we settle to our satisfaction that it would do or it wouldnt do as the case may be
sometimes we go at halfprice to the pit of the theatrethe very smell of which is cheap in my opinion at the moneyand there we thoroughly enjoy the play which sophy believes every word of and so do i
in walking home perhaps we buy a little bit of something at a cooksshop or a little lobster at the fishmongers and bring it here and make a splendid supper chatting about what we have seen
now you know copperfield if i was lord chancellor we couldnt do this you would do something whatever you were my dear traddles thought i that would be pleasant and amiable
and by the way i said aloud i suppose you never draw any skeletons now really replied traddles laughing and reddening i cant wholly deny that i do my dear copperfield
for being in one of the back rows of the kings bench the other day with a pen in my hand the fancy came into my head to try how i had preserved that accomplishment
and i am afraid theres a skeletonin a wigon the ledge of the desk after we had both laughed heartily traddles wound up by looking with a smile at the fire and saying in his forgiving way old creakle i have a letter from that oldrascal here said i
for i never was less disposed to forgive him the way he used to batter traddles than when i saw traddles so ready to forgive him himself
from creakle the schoolmaster exclaimed traddles
no among the persons who are attracted to me in my rising fame and fortune said i looking over my letters and who discover that they were always much attached to me is the selfsame creakle
he is not a schoolmaster now traddles
he is retired
he is a middlesex magistrate i thought traddles might be surprised to hear it but he was not so at all
how do you suppose he comes to be a middlesex magistrate said i
oh dear me replied traddles it would be very difficult to answer that question
perhaps he voted for somebody or lent money to somebody or bought something of somebody or otherwise obliged somebody or jobbed for somebody who knew somebody who got the lieutenant of the county to nominate him for the commission on the commission he is at any rate said i
and he writes to me here that he will be glad to show me in operation the only true system of prison discipline the only unchallengeable way of making sincere and lasting converts and penitentswhich you know is by solitary confinement
what do you say to the system inquired traddles looking grave
no
to my accepting the offer and your going with me i dont object said traddles
then ill write to say so
you remember to say nothing of our treatment this same creakle turning his son out of doors i suppose and the life he used to lead his wife and daughter perfectly said traddles
yet if youll read his letter youll find he is the tenderest of men to prisoners convicted of the whole calendar of felonies said i though i cant find that his tenderness extends to any other class of created beings traddles shrugged his shoulders and was not at all surprised
i had not expected him to be and was not surprised myself or my observation of similar practical satires would have been but scanty
we arranged the time of our visit and i wrote accordingly to mr creakle that evening
on the appointed dayi think it was the next day but no mattertraddles and i repaired to the prison where mr creakle was powerful
it was an immense and solid building erected at a vast expense
i could not help thinking as we approached the gate what an uproar would have been made in the country if any deluded man had proposed to spend one half the money it had cost on the erection of an industrial school for the young or a house of refuge for the deserving old
in an office that might have been on the groundfloor of the tower of babel it was so massively constructed we were presented to our old schoolmaster who was one of a group composed of two or three of the busier sort of magistrates and some visitors they had brought
he received me like a man who had formed my mind in bygone years and had always loved me tenderly
on my introducing traddles mr creakle expressed in like manner but in an inferior degree that he had always been traddless guide philosopher and friend
our venerable instructor was a great deal older and not improved in appearance
his face was as fiery as ever his eyes were as small and rather deeper set
the scanty wetlooking grey hair by which i remembered him was almost gone and the thick veins in his bald head were none the more agreeable to look at
after some conversation among these gentlemen from which i might have supposed that there was nothing in the world to be legitimately taken into account but the supreme comfort of prisoners at any expense and nothing on the wide earth to be done outside prisondoors we began our inspection
it being then just dinnertime we went first into the great kitchen where every prisoners dinner was in course of being set out separately to be handed to him in his cell with the regularity and precision of clockwork
i said aside to traddles that i wondered whether it occurred to anybody that there was a striking contrast between these plentiful repasts of choice quality and the dinners not to say of paupers but of soldiers sailors labourers the great bulk of the honest working community of whom not one man in five hundred ever dined half so well
but i learned that the system required high living and in short to dispose of the system once for all i found that on that head and on all others the system put an end to all doubts and disposed of all anomalies
nobody appeared to have the least idea that there was any other system but the system to be considered
as we were going through some of the magnificent passages i inquired of mr creakle and his friends what were supposed to be the main advantages of this allgoverning and universally overriding system
i found them to be the perfect isolation of prisonersso that no one man in confinement there knew anything about another and the reduction of prisoners to a wholesome state of mind leading to sincere contrition and repentance
now it struck me when we began to visit individuals in their cells and to traverse the passages in which those cells were and to have the manner of the going to chapel and so forth explained to us that there was a strong probability of the prisoners knowing a good deal about each other and of their carrying on a pretty complete system of intercourse
this at the time i write has been proved i believe to be the case but as it would have been flat blasphemy against the system to have hinted such a doubt then i looked out for the penitence as diligently as i could
and here again i had great misgivings
i found as prevalent a fashion in the form of the penitence as i had left outside in the forms of the coats and waistcoats in the windows of the tailors shops
i found a vast amount of profession varying very little in character varying very little which i thought exceedingly suspicious even in words
i found a great many foxes disparaging whole vineyards of inaccessible grapes but i found very few foxes whom i would have trusted within reach of a bunch
above all i found that the most professing men were the greatest objects of interest and that their conceit their vanity their want of excitement and their love of deception which many of them possessed to an almost incredible extent as their histories showed all prompted to these professions and were all gratified by them
however i heard so repeatedly in the course of our goings to and fro of a certain number twenty seven who was the favourite and who really appeared to be a model prisoner that i resolved to suspend my judgement until i should see twenty seven
twenty eight i understood was also a bright particular star but it was his misfortune to have his glory a little dimmed by the extraordinary lustre of twenty seven
i heard so much of twenty seven of his pious admonitions to everybody around him and of the beautiful letters he constantly wrote to his mother whom he seemed to consider in a very bad way that i became quite impatient to see him
i had to restrain my impatience for some time on account of twenty seven being reserved for a concluding effect
but at last we came to the door of his cell and mr creakle looking through a little hole in it reported to us in a state of the greatest admiration that he was reading a hymn book
there was such a rush of heads immediately to see number twenty seven reading his hymn book that the little hole was blocked up six or seven heads deep
to remedy this inconvenience and give us an opportunity of conversing with twenty seven in all his purity mr creakle directed the door of the cell to be unlocked and twenty seven to be invited out into the passage
this was done and whom should traddles and i then behold to our amazement in this converted number twenty seven but uriah heep
he knew us directly and said as he came outwith the old writhe how do you do mr copperfield
how do you do mr traddles this recognition caused a general admiration in the party
i rather thought that everyone was struck by his not being proud and taking notice of us
well twenty seven said mr creakle mournfully admiring him
how do you find yourself today i am very umble sir replied uriah heep
you are always so twenty seven said mr creakle
here another gentleman asked with extreme anxiety are you quite comfortable yes i thank you sir said uriah heep looking in that direction
far more comfortable here than ever i was outside
i see my follies now sir
thats what makes me comfortable several gentlemen were much affected and a third questioner forcing himself to the front inquired with extreme feeling how do you find the beef thank you sir replied uriah glancing in the new direction of this voice it was tougher yesterday than i could wish but its my duty to bear
i have committed follies gentlemen said uriah looking round with a meek smile and i ought to bear the consequences without repining a murmur partly of gratification at twenty sevens celestial state of mind and partly of indignation against the contractor who had given him any cause of complaint a note of which was immediately made by mr creakle having subsided twenty seven stood in the midst of us as if he felt himself the principal object of merit in a highly meritorious museum
that we the neophytes might have an excess of light shining upon us all at once orders were given to let out twenty eight
i had been so much astonished already that i only felt a kind of resigned wonder when mr littimer walked forth reading a good book
twenty eight said a gentleman in spectacles who had not yet spoken you complained last week my good fellow of the cocoa
how has it been since i thank you sir said mr littimer it has been better made
if i might take the liberty of saying so sir i dont think the milk which is boiled with it is quite genuine but i am aware sir that there is a great adulteration of milk in london and that the article in a pure state is difficult to be obtained it appeared to me that the gentleman in spectacles backed his twenty eight against mr creakles twenty seven for each of them took his own man in hand
what is your state of mind twenty eight said the questioner in spectacles
i thank you sir returned mr littimer i see my follies now sir
i am a good deal troubled when i think of the sins of my former companions sir but i trust they may find forgiveness you are quite happy yourself said the questioner nodding encouragement
i am much obliged to you sir returned mr littimer
perfectly so is there anything at all on your mind now said the questioner
if so mention it twenty eight sir said mr littimer without looking up if my eyes have not deceived me there is a gentleman present who was acquainted with me in my former life
it may be profitable to that gentleman to know sir that i attribute my past follies entirely to having lived a thoughtless life in the service of young men and to having allowed myself to be led by them into weaknesses which i had not the strength to resist
i hope that gentleman will take warning sir and will not be offended at my freedom
it is for his good
i am conscious of my own past follies
i hope he may repent of all the wickedness and sin to which he has been a party i observed that several gentlemen were shading their eyes each with one hand as if they had just come into church
this does you credit twenty eight returned the questioner
i should have expected it of you
is there anything else sir returned mr littimer slightly lifting up his eyebrows but not his eyes there was a young woman who fell into dissolute courses that i endeavoured to save sir but could not rescue
i beg that gentleman if he has it in his power to inform that young woman from me that i forgive her her bad conduct towards myself and that i call her to repentanceif he will be so good i have no doubt twenty eight returned the questioner that the gentleman you refer to feels very stronglyas we all mustwhat you have so properly said
we will not detain you i thank you sir said mr littimer
gentlemen i wish you a good day and hoping you and your families will also see your wickedness and amend with this number twenty eight retired after a glance between him and uriah as if they were not altogether unknown to each other through some medium of communication and a murmur went round the group as his door shut upon him that he was a most respectable man and a beautiful case
now twenty seven said mr creakle entering on a clear stage with his man is there anything that anyone can do for you
if so mention it i would umbly ask sir returned uriah with a jerk of his malevolent head for leave to write again to mother it shall certainly be granted said mr creakle
thank you sir
i am anxious about mother
i am afraid she aint safe somebody incautiously asked what from
but there was a scandalized whisper of hush immortally safe sir returned uriah writhing in the direction of the voice
i should wish mother to be got into my state
i never should have been got into my present state if i hadnt come here
i wish mother had come here
it would be better for everybody if they got took up and was brought here this sentiment gave unbounded satisfactiongreater satisfaction i think than anything that had passed yet
before i come here said uriah stealing a look at us as if he would have blighted the outer world to which we belonged if he could i was given to follies but now i am sensible of my follies
theres a deal of sin outside
theres a deal of sin in mother
theres nothing but sin everywhereexcept here you are quite changed said mr creakle
oh dear yes sir cried this hopeful penitent
you wouldnt relapse if you were going out asked somebody else
oh dear no sir well said mr creakle this is very gratifying
you have addressed mr copperfield twenty seven
do you wish to say anything further to him you knew me a long time before i came here and was changed mr copperfield said uriah looking at me and a more villainous look i never saw even on his visage
you knew me when in spite of my follies i was umble among them that was proud and meek among them that was violentyou was violent to me yourself mr copperfield
once you struck me a blow in the face you know general commiseration
several indignant glances directed at me
but i forgive you mr copperfield said uriah making his forgiving nature the subject of a most impious and awful parallel which i shall not record
i forgive everybody
it would ill become me to bear malice
i freely forgive you and i hope youll curb your passions in future
i hope mr w will repent and miss w and all of that sinful lot
youve been visited with affliction and i hope it may do you good but youd better have come here
mr w had better have come here and miss w too
the best wish i could give you mr copperfield and give all of you gentlemen is that you could be took up and brought here
when i think of my past follies and my present state i am sure it would be best for you
i pity all who aint brought here he sneaked back into his cell amidst a little chorus of approbation and both traddles and i experienced a great relief when he was locked in
it was a characteristic feature in this repentance that i was fain to ask what these two men had done to be there at all
that appeared to be the last thing about which they had anything to say
i addressed myself to one of the two warders who i suspected from certain latent indications in their faces knew pretty well what all this stir was worth
do you know said i as we walked along the passage what felony was number twenty sevens last folly the answer was that it was a bank case
a fraud on the bank of england i asked
yes sir
fraud forgery and conspiracy
he and some others
he set the others on
it was a deep plot for a large sum
sentence transportation for life
twenty seven was the knowingest bird of the lot and had very nearly kept himself safe but not quite
the bank was just able to put salt upon his tailand only just do you know twenty eights offence twenty eight returned my informant speaking throughout in a low tone and looking over his shoulder as we walked along the passage to guard himself from being overheard in such an unlawful reference to these immaculates by creakle and the rest twenty eight also transportation got a place and robbed a young master of a matter of two hundred and fifty pounds in money and valuables the night before they were going abroad
i particularly recollect his case from his being took by a dwarf a what a little woman
i have forgot her name not mowcher thats it
he had eluded pursuit and was going to america in a flaxen wig and whiskers and such a complete disguise as never you see in all your born days when the little woman being in southampton met him walking along the streetpicked him out with her sharp eye in a momentran betwixt his legs to upset himand held on to him like grim death excellent miss mowcher cried i
youd have said so if you had seen her standing on a chair in the witnessbox at the trial as i did said my friend
he cut her face right open and pounded her in the most brutal manner when she took him but she never loosed her hold till he was locked up
she held so tight to him in fact that the officers were obliged to take em both together
she gave her evidence in the gamest way and was highly complimented by the bench and cheered right home to her lodgings
she said in court that shed have took him singlehanded on account of what she knew concerning him if he had been samson
and its my belief she would it was mine too and i highly respected miss mowcher for it
we had now seen all there was to see
it would have been in vain to represent to such a man as the worshipful mr creakle that twenty seven and twenty eight were perfectly consistent and unchanged that exactly what they were then they had always been that the hypocritical knaves were just the subjects to make that sort of profession in such a place that they knew its marketvalue at least as well as we did in the immediate service it would do them when they were expatriated in a word that it was a rotten hollow painfully suggestive piece of business altogether
we left them to their system and themselves and went home wondering
perhaps its a good thing traddles said i to have an unsound hobby ridden hard for its the sooner ridden to death i hope so replied traddles
the year came round to christmastime and i had been at home above two months
i had seen agnes frequently
however loud the general voice might be in giving me encouragement and however fervent the emotions and endeavours to which it roused me i heard her lightest word of praise as i heard nothing else
at least once a week and sometimes oftener i rode over there and passed the evening
i usually rode back at night for the old unhappy sense was always hovering about me nowmost sorrowfully when i left herand i was glad to be up and out rather than wandering over the past in weary wakefulness or miserable dreams
i wore away the longest part of many wild sad nights in those rides reviving as i went the thoughts that had occupied me in my long absence
or if i were to say rather that i listened to the echoes of those thoughts i should better express the truth
they spoke to me from afar off
i had put them at a distance and accepted my inevitable place
when i read to agnes what i wrote when i saw her listening face moved her to smiles or tears and heard her cordial voice so earnest on the shadowy events of that imaginative world in which i lived i thought what a fate mine might have beenbut only thought so as i had thought after i was married to dora what i could have wished my wife to be
my duty to agnes who loved me with a love which if i disquieted i wronged most selfishly and poorly and could never restore my matured assurance that i who had worked out my own destiny and won what i had impetuously set my heart on had no right to murmur and must bear comprised what i felt and what i had learned
but i loved her and now it even became some consolation to me vaguely to conceive a distant day when i might blamelessly avow it when all this should be over when i could say agnes so it was when i came home and now i am old and i never have loved since she did not once show me any change in herself
what she always had been to me she still was wholly unaltered
between my aunt and me there had been something in this connexion since the night of my return which i cannot call a restraint or an avoidance of the subject so much as an implied understanding that we thought of it together but did not shape our thoughts into words
when according to our old custom we sat before the fire at night we often fell into this train as naturally and as consciously to each other as if we had unreservedly said so
but we preserved an unbroken silence
i believed that she had read or partly read my thoughts that night and that she fully comprehended why i gave mine no more distinct expression
this christmastime being come and agnes having reposed no new confidence in me a doubt that had several times arisen in my mindwhether she could have that perception of the true state of my breast which restrained her with the apprehension of giving me painbegan to oppress me heavily
if that were so my sacrifice was nothing my plainest obligation to her unfulfilled and every poor action i had shrunk from i was hourly doing
i resolved to set this right beyond all doubtif such a barrier were between us to break it down at once with a determined hand
it waswhat lasting reason have i to remember ita cold harsh winter day
there had been snow some hours before and it lay not deep but hardfrozen on the ground
out at sea beyond my window the wind blew ruggedly from the north
i had been thinking of it sweeping over those mountain wastes of snow in switzerland then inaccessible to any human foot and had been speculating which was the lonelier those solitary regions or a deserted ocean
riding today trot said my aunt putting her head in at the door
yes said i i am going over to canterbury
its a good day for a ride i hope your horse may think so too said my aunt but at present he is holding down his head and his ears standing before the door there as if he thought his stable preferable my aunt i may observe allowed my horse on the forbidden ground but had not at all relented towards the donkeys
he will be fresh enough presently said i
the ride will do his master good at all events observed my aunt glancing at the papers on my table
ah child you pass a good many hours here
i never thought when i used to read books what work it was to write them its work enough to read them sometimes i returned
as to the writing it has its own charms aunt ah
i see said my aunt
ambition love of approbation sympathy and much more i suppose
well go along with you do you know anything more said i standing composedly before hershe had patted me on the shoulder and sat down in my chairof that attachment of agnes she looked up in my face a little while before replying i think i do trot are you confirmed in your impression i inquired
i think i am trot she looked so steadfastly at me with a kind of doubt or pity or suspense in her affection that i summoned the stronger determination to show her a perfectly cheerful face
and what is more trot said my aunt
yes i think agnes is going to be married god bless her said i cheerfully
god bless her said my aunt and her husband too i echoed it parted from my aunt and went lightly downstairs mounted and rode away
there was greater reason than before to do what i had resolved to do
how well i recollect the wintry ride
the frozen particles of ice brushed from the blades of grass by the wind and borne across my face the hard clatter of the horses hoofs beating a tune upon the ground the stifftilled soil the snowdrift lightly eddying in the chalkpit as the breeze ruffled it the smoking team with the waggon of old hay stopping to breathe on the hilltop and shaking their bells musically the whitened slopes and sweeps of downland lying against the dark sky as if they were drawn on a huge slate
i found agnes alone
the little girls had gone to their own homes now and she was alone by the fire reading
she put down her book on seeing me come in and having welcomed me as usual took her workbasket and sat in one of the oldfashioned windows
i sat beside her on the windowseat and we talked of what i was doing and when it would be done and of the progress i had made since my last visit
agnes was very cheerful and laughingly predicted that i should soon become too famous to be talked to on such subjects
so i make the most of the present time you see said agnes and talk to you while i may as i looked at her beautiful face observant of her work she raised her mild clear eyes and saw that i was looking at her
you are thoughtful today trotwood agnes shall i tell you what about
i came to tell you she put aside her work as she was used to do when we were seriously discussing anything and gave me her whole attention
my dear agnes do you doubt my being true to you no she answered with a look of astonishment
do you doubt my being what i always have been to you no she answered as before
do you remember that i tried to tell you when i came home what a debt of gratitude i owed you dearest agnes and how fervently i felt towards you i remember it she said gently very well you have a secret said i
let me share it agnes she cast down her eyes and trembled
i could hardly fail to know even if i had not heardbut from other lips than yours agnes which seems strangethat there is someone upon whom you have bestowed the treasure of your love
do not shut me out of what concerns your happiness so nearly
if you can trust me as you say you can and as i know you may let me be your friend your brother in this matter of all others with an appealing almost a reproachful glance she rose from the window and hurrying across the room as if without knowing where put her hands before her face and burst into such tears as smote me to the heart
and yet they awakened something in me bringing promise to my heart
without my knowing why these tears allied themselves with the quietly sad smile which was so fixed in my remembrance and shook me more with hope than fear or sorrow
agnes
sister
dearest
what have i done let me go away trotwood
i am not well
i am not myself
i will speak to you by and byanother time
i will write to you
dont speak to me now
dont
dont i sought to recollect what she had said when i had spoken to her on that former night of her affection needing no return
it seemed a very world that i must search through in a moment
agnes i cannot bear to see you so and think that i have been the cause
my dearest girl dearer to me than anything in life if you are unhappy let me share your unhappiness
if you are in need of help or counsel let me try to give it to you
if you have indeed a burden on your heart let me try to lighten it
for whom do i live now agnes if it is not for you oh spare me
i am not myself
another time was all i could distinguish
was it a selfish error that was leading me away
or having once a clue to hope was there something opening to me that i had not dared to think of
i must say more
i cannot let you leave me so
for heavens sake agnes let us not mistake each other after all these years and all that has come and gone with them
i must speak plainly
if you have any lingering thought that i could envy the happiness you will confer that i could not resign you to a dearer protector of your own choosing that i could not from my removed place be a contented witness of your joy dismiss it for i dont deserve it
i have not suffered quite in vain
you have not taught me quite in vain
there is no alloy of self in what i feel for you she was quiet now
in a little time she turned her pale face towards me and said in a low voice broken here and there but very clear i owe it to your pure friendship for me trotwoodwhich indeed i do not doubtto tell you you are mistaken
i can do no more
if i have sometimes in the course of years wanted help and counsel they have come to me
if i have sometimes been unhappy the feeling has passed away
if i have ever had a burden on my heart it has been lightened for me
if i have any secret it isno new one and isnot what you suppose
i cannot reveal it or divide it
it has long been mine and must remain mine agnes
stay
a moment she was going away but i detained her
i clasped my arm about her waist
in the course of years it is not a new one new thoughts and hopes were whirling through my mind and all the colours of my life were changing
dearest agnes
whom i so respect and honourwhom i so devotedly love
when i came here today i thought that nothing could have wrested this confession from me
i thought i could have kept it in my bosom all our lives till we were old
but agnes if i have indeed any newborn hope that i may ever call you something more than sister widely different from sister her tears fell fast but they were not like those she had lately shed and i saw my hope brighten in them
agnes
ever my guide and best support
if you had been more mindful of yourself and less of me when we grew up here together i think my heedless fancy never would have wandered from you
but you were so much better than i so necessary to me in every boyish hope and disappointment that to have you to confide in and rely upon in everything became a second nature supplanting for the time the first and greater one of loving you as i do still weeping but not sadlyjoyfully
and clasped in my arms as she had never been as i had thought she never was to be
when i loved dorafondly agnes as you know yes she cried earnestly
i am glad to know it when i loved hereven then my love would have been incomplete without your sympathy
i had it and it was perfected
and when i lost her agnes what should i have been without you still closer in my arms nearer to my heart her trembling hand upon my shoulder her sweet eyes shining through her tears on mine
i went away dear agnes loving you
i stayed away loving you
i returned home loving you and now i tried to tell her of the struggle i had had and the conclusion i had come to
i tried to lay my mind before her truly and entirely
i tried to show her how i had hoped i had come into the better knowledge of myself and of her how i had resigned myself to what that better knowledge brought and how i had come there even that day in my fidelity to this
if she did so love me i said that she could take me for her husband she could do so on no deserving of mine except upon the truth of my love for her and the trouble in which it had ripened to be what it was and hence it was that i revealed it
and o agnes even out of thy true eyes in that same time the spirit of my childwife looked upon me saying it was well and winning me through thee to tenderest recollections of the blossom that had withered in its bloom
i am so blest trotwoodmy heart is so overchargedbut there is one thing i must say dearest what she laid her gentle hands upon my shoulders and looked calmly in my face
do you know yet what it is i am afraid to speculate on what it is
tell me my dear i have loved you all my life o we were happy we were happy
our tears were not for the trials hers so much the greater through which we had come to be thus but for the rapture of being thus never to be divided more
we walked that winter evening in the fields together and the blessed calm within us seemed to be partaken by the frosty air
the early stars began to shine while we were lingering on and looking up to them we thanked our god for having guided us to this tranquillity
we stood together in the same oldfashioned window at night when the moon was shining agnes with her quiet eyes raised up to it i following her glance
long miles of road then opened out before my mind and toiling on i saw a ragged wayworn boy forsaken and neglected who should come to call even the heart now beating against mine his own
it was nearly dinnertime next day when we appeared before my aunt
she was up in my study peggotty said which it was her pride to keep in readiness and order for me
we found her in her spectacles sitting by the fire
goodness me said my aunt peering through the dusk whos this youre bringing home agnes said i
as we had arranged to say nothing at first my aunt was not a little discomfited
she darted a hopeful glance at me when i said agnes but seeing that i looked as usual she took off her spectacles in despair and rubbed her nose with them
she greeted agnes heartily nevertheless and we were soon in the lighted parlour downstairs at dinner
my aunt put on her spectacles twice or thrice to take another look at me but as often took them off again disappointed and rubbed her nose with them
much to the discomfiture of mr dick who knew this to be a bad symptom
by the by aunt said i after dinner i have been speaking to agnes about what you told me then trot said my aunt turning scarlet you did wrong and broke your promise you are not angry aunt i trust
i am sure you wont be when you learn that agnes is not unhappy in any attachment stuff and nonsense said my aunt
as my aunt appeared to be annoyed i thought the best way was to cut her annoyance short
i took agnes in my arm to the back of her chair and we both leaned over her
my aunt with one clap of her hands and one look through her spectacles immediately went into hysterics for the first and only time in all my knowledge of her
the hysterics called up peggotty
the moment my aunt was restored she flew at peggotty and calling her a silly old creature hugged her with all her might
after that she hugged mr dick who was highly honoured but a good deal surprised and after that told them why
then we were all happy together
i could not discover whether my aunt in her last short conversation with me had fallen on a pious fraud or had really mistaken the state of my mind
it was quite enough she said that she had told me agnes was going to be married and that i now knew better than anyone how true it was
we were married within a fortnight
traddles and sophy and doctor and mrs strong were the only guests at our quiet wedding
we left them full of joy and drove away together
clasped in my embrace i held the source of every worthy aspiration i had ever had the centre of myself the circle of my life my own my wife my love of whom was founded on a rock
dearest husband said agnes
now that i may call you by that name i have one thing more to tell you let me hear it love it grows out of the night when dora died
she sent you for me she did she told me that she left me something
can you think what it was i believed i could
i drew the wife who had so long loved me closer to my side
she told me that she made a last request to me and left me a last charge and it was that only i would occupy this vacant place and agnes laid her head upon my breast and wept and i wept with her though we were so happy
what i have purposed to record is nearly finished but there is yet an incident conspicuous in my memory on which it often rests with delight and without which one thread in the web i have spun would have a ravelled end
i had advanced in fame and fortune my domestic joy was perfect i had been married ten happy years
agnes and i were sitting by the fire in our house in london one night in spring and three of our children were playing in the room when i was told that a stranger wished to see me
he had been asked if he came on business and had answered no he had come for the pleasure of seeing me and had come a long way
he was an old man my servant said and looked like a farmer
as this sounded mysterious to the children and moreover was like the beginning of a favourite story agnes used to tell them introductory to the arrival of a wicked old fairy in a cloak who hated everybody it produced some commotion
one of our boys laid his head in his mothers lap to be out of harms way and little agnes our eldest child left her doll in a chair to represent her and thrust out her little heap of golden curls from between the windowcurtains to see what happened next
let him come in here said i
there soon appeared pausing in the dark doorway as he entered a hale greyhaired old man
little agnes attracted by his looks had run to bring him in and i had not yet clearly seen his face when my wife starting up cried out to me in a pleased and agitated voice that it was mr peggotty
it was mr peggotty
an old man now but in a ruddy hearty strong old age
when our first emotion was over and he sat before the fire with the children on his knees and the blaze shining on his face he looked to me as vigorous and robust withal as handsome an old man as ever i had seen
masr davy said he
and the old name in the old tone fell so naturally on my ear
masr davy tis a joyful hour as i see you once more long with your own trew wife a joyful hour indeed old friend cried i
and these heer pretty ones said mr peggotty
to look at these heer flowers
why masr davy you was but the heighth of the littlest of these when i first see you
when emly warnt no bigger and our poor lad were but a lad time has changed me more than it has changed you since then said i
but let these dear rogues go to bed and as no house in england but this must hold you tell me where to send for your luggage is the old black bag among it that went so far i wonder
and then over a glass of yarmouth grog we will have the tidings of ten years are you alone asked agnes
yes maam he said kissing her hand quite alone we sat him between us not knowing how to give him welcome enough and as i began to listen to his old familiar voice i could have fancied he was still pursuing his long journey in search of his darling niece
its a mort of water said mr peggotty fur to come across and ony stay a matter of fower weeks
but water specially when tis salt comes natral to me and friends is dear and i am heer
which is verse said mr peggotty surprised to find it out though i hadnt such intentions are you going back those many thousand miles so soon asked agnes
yes maam he returned
i giv the promise to emly afore i come away
you see i doent grow younger as the years comes round and if i hadnt sailed as twas most like i shouldnt never have done t
and its allus been on my mind as i must come and see masr davy and your own sweet blooming self in your wedded happiness afore i got to be too old he looked at us as if he could never feast his eyes on us sufficiently
agnes laughingly put back some scattered locks of his grey hair that he might see us better
and now tell us said i everything relating to your fortunes our fortuns masr davy he rejoined is soon told
we havent fared nohows but fared to thrive
weve allus thrived
weve worked as we ought to t and maybe we lived a leetle hard at first or so but we have allus thrived
what with sheepfarming and what with stockfarming and what with one thing and what with tother we are as well to do as well could be
theers been kiender a blessing fell upon us said mr peggotty reverentially inclining his head and weve done nowt but prosper
that is in the long run
if not yesterday why then today
if not today why then tomorrow and emily said agnes and i both together
emly said he arter you left her maamand i never heerd her saying of her prayers at night tother side the canvas screen when we was settled in the bush but what i heerd your nameand arter she and me lost sight of masr davy that theer shining sundownwas that low at first that if she had knowd then what masr davy kep from us so kind and thowtful tis my opinion shed have drooped away
but theer was some poor folks aboard as had illness among em and she took care of them and theer was the children in our company and she took care of them and so she got to be busy and to be doing good and that helped her when did she first hear of it i asked
i kep it from her arter i heerd on t said mr peggotty going on nigh a year
we was living then in a solitary place but among the beautifullest trees and with the roses acovering our beein to the roof
theer come along one day when i was out aworking on the land a traveller from our own norfolk or suffolk in england i doent rightly mind which and of course we took him in and giv him to eat and drink and made him welcome
we all do that all the colony over
hed got an old newspaper with him and some other account in print of the storm
thats how she knowd it
when i came home at night i found she knowd it he dropped his voice as he said these words and the gravity i so well remembered overspread his face
did it change her much we asked
aye for a good long time he said shaking his head if not to this present hour
but i think the solitoode done her good
and she had a deal to mind in the way of poultry and the like and minded of it and come through
i wonder he said thoughtfully if you could see my emly now masr davy whether youd know her is she so altered i inquired
i doent know
i see her evry day and doent know but oddtimes i have thowt so
a slight figure said mr peggotty looking at the fire kiender worn soft sorrowful blue eyes a delicate face a pritty head leaning a little down a quiet voice and waytimid amost
thats emly we silently observed him as he sat still looking at the fire
some thinks he said as her affection was illbestowed some as her marriage was broken off by death
no one knows how tis
she might have married well a mort of times but uncle she says to me thats gone for ever cheerful along with me retired when others is by fond of going any distance fur to teach a child or fur to tend a sick person or fur to do some kindness towrds a young girls wedding and shes done a many but has never seen one fondly loving of her uncle patient liked by young and old sowt out by all that has any trouble
thats emly he drew his hand across his face and with a halfsuppressed sigh looked up from the fire
is martha with you yet i asked
martha he replied got married masr davy in the second year
a young man a farmlabourer as come by us on his way to market with his masrs draysa journey of over five hundred mile theer and backmade offers fur to take her fur his wife wives is very scarce theer and then to set up fur their two selves in the bush
she spoke to me fur to tell him her trew story
i did
they was married and they live fower hundred mile away from any voices but their own and the singing birds mrs
gummidge i suggested
it was a pleasant key to touch for mr peggotty suddenly burst into a roar of laughter and rubbed his hands up and down his legs as he had been accustomed to do when he enjoyed himself in the longshipwrecked boat
would you believe it he said
why someun even made offer fur to marry her
if a ships cook that was turning settler masr davy didnt make offers fur to marry missis gummidge im gormedand i cant say no fairer than that i never saw agnes laugh so
this sudden ecstasy on the part of mr peggotty was so delightful to her that she could not leave off laughing and the more she laughed the more she made me laugh and the greater mr peggottys ecstasy became and the more he rubbed his legs
and what did mrs gummidge say i asked when i was grave enough
if youll believe me returned mr peggotty missis gummidge stead of saying thank you im much obleeged to you i aint agoing fur to change my condition at my time of life upd with a bucket as was standing by and laid it over that theer ships cooks head till he sung out fur help and i went in and reskied of him mr peggotty burst into a great roar of laughter and agnes and i both kept him company
but i must say this for the good creetur he resumed wiping his face when we were quite exhausted she has been all she said shed be to us and more
shes the willingest the trewest the honestesthelping woman masr davy as ever drawd the breath of life
i have never knowd her to be lone and lorn for a single minute not even when the colony was all afore us and we was new to it
and thinking of the old un is a thing she never done i do assure you since she left england now last not least mr micawber said i
he has paid off every obligation he incurred hereeven to traddless bill you remember my dear agnesand therefore we may take it for granted that he is doing well
but what is the latest news of him mr peggotty with a smile put his hand in his breastpocket and produced a flatfolded paper parcel from which he took out with much care a little oddlooking newspaper
you are to understan masr davy said he as we have left the bush now being so well to do and have gone right away round to port middlebay harbour wheer theers what we call a town mr
micawber was in the bush near you said i
bless you yes said mr peggotty and turned to with a will
i never wish to meet a better genlman for turning to with a will
ive seen that theer bald head of his a perspiring in the sun masr davy till i amost thowt it would have melted away
and now hes a magistrate a magistrate eh said i mr peggotty pointed to a certain paragraph in the newspaper where i read aloud as follows from the port middlebay times the public dinner to our distinguished fellowcolonist and townsman wilkins micawber esquire port middlebay district magistrate came off yesterday in the large room of the hotel which was crowded to suffocation
it is estimated that not fewer than fortyseven persons must have been accommodated with dinner at one time exclusive of the company in the passage and on the stairs
the beauty fashion and exclusiveness of port middlebay flocked to do honour to one so deservedly esteemed so highly talented and so widely popular
doctor mell of colonial salemhouse grammar school port middlebay presided and on his right sat the distinguished guest
after the removal of the cloth and the singing of non nobis beautifully executed and in which we were at no loss to distinguish the belllike notes of that gifted amateur wilkins micawber esquire junior the usual loyal and patriotic toasts were severally given and rapturously received
doctor mell in a speech replete with feeling then proposed our distinguished guest the ornament of our town
may he never leave us but to better himself and may his success among us be such as to render his bettering himself impossible the cheering with which the toast was received defies description
again and again it rose and fell like the waves of ocean
at length all was hushed and wilkins micawber esquire presented himself to return thanks
far be it from us in the present comparatively imperfect state of the resources of our establishment to endeavour to follow our distinguished townsman through the smoothlyflowing periods of his polished and highlyornate address
suffice it to observe that it was a masterpiece of eloquence and that those passages in which he more particularly traced his own successful career to its source and warned the younger portion of his auditory from the shoals of ever incurring pecuniary liabilities which they were unable to liquidate brought a tear into the manliest eye present
the remaining toasts were doctor mell mrs micawber who gracefully bowed her acknowledgements from the sidedoor where a galaxy of beauty was elevated on chairs at once to witness and adorn the gratifying scene mrs ridger begs late miss micawber mrs mell wilkins micawber esquire junior who convulsed the assembly by humorously remarking that he found himself unable to return thanks in a speech but would do so with their permission in a song mrs micawbers family well known it is needless to remark in the mothercountry c c c at the conclusion of the proceedings the tables were cleared as if by artmagic for dancing
among the votaries of terpsichore who disported themselves until sol gave warning for departure wilkins micawber esquire junior and the lovely and accomplished miss helena fourth daughter of doctor mell were particularly remarkable i was looking back to the name of doctor mell pleased to have discovered in these happier circumstances mr mell formerly poor pinched usher to my middlesex magistrate when mr peggotty pointing to another part of the paper my eyes rested on my own name and i read thus to david copperfield esquire the eminent author
my dear sir years have elapsed since i had an opportunity of ocularly perusing the lineaments now familiar to the imaginations of a considerable portion of the civilized world
but my dear sir though estranged by the force of circumstances over which i have had no control from the personal society of the friend and companion of my youth i have not been unmindful of his soaring flight
nor have i been debarred though seas between us braid ha roared burns from participating in the intellectual feasts he has spread before us
i cannot therefore allow of the departure from this place of an individual whom we mutually respect and esteem without my dear sir taking this public opportunity of thanking you on my own behalf and i may undertake to add on that of the whole of the inhabitants of port middlebay for the gratification of which you are the ministering agent
go on my dear sir
you are not unknown here you are not unappreciated
though remote we are neither unfriended melancholy nor i may add slow
go on my dear sir in your eagle course
the inhabitants of port middlebay may at least aspire to watch it with delight with entertainment with instruction
among the eyes elevated towards you from this portion of the globe will ever be found while it has light and life the eye appertaining to wilkins micawber magistrate i found on glancing at the remaining contents of the newspaper that mr micawber was a diligent and esteemed correspondent of that journal
there was another letter from him in the same paper touching a bridge there was an advertisement of a collection of similar letters by him to be shortly republished in a neat volume with considerable additions and unless i am very much mistaken the leading article was his also
we talked much of mr micawber on many other evenings while mr peggotty remained with us
he lived with us during the whole term of his staywhich i think was something less than a monthand his sister and my aunt came to london to see him
agnes and i parted from him aboardship when he sailed and we shall never part from him more on earth
but before he left he went with me to yarmouth to see a little tablet i had put up in the churchyard to the memory of ham
while i was copying the plain inscription for him at his request i saw him stoop and gather a tuft of grass from the grave and a little earth
for emly he said as he put it in his breast
i promised masr davy and now my written story ends
i look back once morefor the last timebefore i close these leaves
i see myself with agnes at my side journeying along the road of life
i see our children and our friends around us and i hear the roar of many voices not indifferent to me as i travel on
what faces are the most distinct to me in the fleeting crowd
lo these all turning to me as i ask my thoughts the question
here is my aunt in stronger spectacles an old woman of fourscore years and more but upright yet and a steady walker of six miles at a stretch in winter weather
always with her here comes peggotty my good old nurse likewise in spectacles accustomed to do needlework at night very close to the lamp but never sitting down to it without a bit of wax candle a yardmeasure in a little house and a workbox with a picture of st pauls upon the lid
the cheeks and arms of peggotty so hard and red in my childish days when i wondered why the birds didnt peck her in preference to apples are shrivelled now and her eyes that used to darken their whole neighbourhood in her face are fainter though they glitter still but her rough forefinger which i once associated with a pocket nutmeggrater is just the same and when i see my least child catching at it as it totters from my aunt to her i think of our little parlour at home when i could scarcely walk
my aunts old disappointment is set right now
she is godmother to a real living betsey trotwood and dora the next in order says she spoils her
there is something bulky in peggottys pocket
it is nothing smaller than the crocodile book which is in rather a dilapidated condition by this time with divers of the leaves torn and stitched across but which peggotty exhibits to the children as a precious relic
i find it very curious to see my own infant face looking up at me from the crocodile stories and to be reminded by it of my old acquaintance brooks of sheffield
among my boys this summer holiday time i see an old man making giant kites and gazing at them in the air with a delight for which there are no words
he greets me rapturously and whispers with many nods and winks trotwood you will be glad to hear that i shall finish the memorial when i have nothing else to do and that your aunts the most extraordinary woman in the world sir who is this bent lady supporting herself by a stick and showing me a countenance in which there are some traces of old pride and beauty feebly contending with a querulous imbecile fretful wandering of the mind
she is in a garden and near her stands a sharp dark withered woman with a white scar on her lip
let me hear what they say
rosa i have forgotten this gentlemans name rosa bends over her and calls to her mr
copperfield i am glad to see you sir
i am sorry to observe you are in mourning
i hope time will be good to you her impatient attendant scolds her tells her i am not in mourning bids her look again tries to rouse her
you have seen my son sir says the elder lady
are you reconciled looking fixedly at me she puts her hand to her forehead and moans
suddenly she cries in a terrible voice rosa come to me
he is dead rosa kneeling at her feet by turns caresses her and quarrels with her now fiercely telling her i loved him better than you ever didnow soothing her to sleep on her breast like a sick child
thus i leave them thus i always find them thus they wear their time away from year to year
what ship comes sailing home from india and what english lady is this married to a growling old scotch croesus with great flaps of ears
can this be julia mills
indeed it is julia mills peevish and fine with a black man to carry cards and letters to her on a golden salver and a coppercoloured woman in linen with a bright handkerchief round her head to serve her tiffin in her dressingroom
but julia keeps no diary in these days never sings affections dirge eternally quarrels with the old scotch croesus who is a sort of yellow bear with a tanned hide
julia is steeped in money to the throat and talks and thinks of nothing else
i liked her better in the desert of sahara
or perhaps this is the desert of sahara
for though julia has a stately house and mighty company and sumptuous dinners every day i see no green growth near her nothing that can ever come to fruit or flower
what julia calls society i see among it mr jack maldon from his patent place sneering at the hand that gave it him and speaking to me of the doctor as so charmingly antique
but when society is the name for such hollow gentlemen and ladies julia and when its breeding is professed indifference to everything that can advance or can retard mankind i think we must have lost ourselves in that same desert of sahara and had better find the way out
and lo the doctor always our good friend labouring at his dictionary somewhere about the letter d and happy in his home and wife
also the old soldier on a considerably reduced footing and by no means so influential as in days of yore
working at his chambers in the temple with a busy aspect and his hair where he is not bald made more rebellious than ever by the constant friction of his lawyerswig i come in a later time upon my dear old traddles
his table is covered with thick piles of papers and i say as i look around me if sophy were your clerk now traddles she would have enough to do you may say that my dear copperfield
but those were capital days too in holborn court
were they not when she told you you would be a judge
but it was not the town talk then at all events says traddles if i ever am one why you know you will be well my dear copperfield when i am one i shall tell the story as i said i would we walk away arm in arm
i am going to have a family dinner with traddles
it is sophys birthday and on our road traddles discourses to me of the good fortune he has enjoyed
i really have been able my dear copperfield to do all that i had most at heart
theres the reverend horace promoted to that living at four hundred and fifty pounds a year there are our two boys receiving the very best education and distinguishing themselves as steady scholars and good fellows there are three of the girls married very comfortably there are three more living with us there are three more keeping house for the reverend horace since mrs crewlers decease and all of them happy except i suggest
except the beauty says traddles
yes
it was very unfortunate that she should marry such a vagabond
but there was a certain dash and glare about him that caught her
however now we have got her safe at our house and got rid of him we must cheer her up again traddless house is one of the very housesor it easily may have beenwhich he and sophy used to parcel out in their evening walks
it is a large house but traddles keeps his papers in his dressingroom and his boots with his papers and he and sophy squeeze themselves into upper rooms reserving the best bedrooms for the beauty and the girls
there is no room to spare in the house for more of the girls are here and always are here by some accident or other than i know how to count
here when we go in is a crowd of them running down to the door and handing traddles about to be kissed until he is out of breath
here established in perpetuity is the poor beauty a widow with a little girl here at dinner on sophys birthday are the three married girls with their three husbands and one of the husbands brothers and another husbands cousin and another husbands sister who appears to me to be engaged to the cousin
traddles exactly the same simple unaffected fellow as he ever was sits at the foot of the large table like a patriarch and sophy beams upon him from the head across a cheerful space that is certainly not glittering with britannia metal
and now as i close my task subduing my desire to linger yet these faces fade away
but one face shining on me like a heavenly light by which i see all other objects is above them and beyond them all
and that remains
i turn my head and see it in its beautiful serenity beside me
my lamp burns low and i have written far into the night but the dear presence without which i were nothing bears me company
o agnes o my soul so may thy face be by me when i close my life indeed so may i when realities are melting from me like the shadows which i now dismiss still find thee near me pointing upward

illustration chapter i
my fathers family name being pirrip and my christian name philip my infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit than pip
so i called myself pip and came to be called pip
i give pirrip as my fathers family name on the authority of his tombstone and my sistermrs
joe gargery who married the blacksmith
as i never saw my father or my mother and never saw any likeness of either of them for their days were long before the days of photographs my first fancies regarding what they were like were unreasonably derived from their tombstones
the shape of the letters on my fathers gave me an odd idea that he was a square stout dark man with curly black hair
from the character and turn of the inscription also georgiana wife of the above i drew a childish conclusion that my mother was freckled and sickly
to five little stone lozenges each about a foot and a half long which were arranged in a neat row beside their grave and were sacred to the memory of five little brothers of minewho gave up trying to get a living exceedingly early in that universal strugglei am indebted for a belief i religiously entertained that they had all been born on their backs with their hands in their trouserspockets and had never taken them out in this state of existence
ours was the marsh country down by the river within as the river wound twenty miles of the sea
my first most vivid and broad impression of the identity of things seems to me to have been gained on a memorable raw afternoon towards evening
at such a time i found out for certain that this bleak place overgrown with nettles was the churchyard and that philip pirrip late of this parish and also georgiana wife of the above were dead and buried and that alexander bartholomew abraham tobias and roger infant children of the aforesaid were also dead and buried and that the dark flat wilderness beyond the churchyard intersected with dikes and mounds and gates with scattered cattle feeding on it was the marshes and that the low leaden line beyond was the river and that the distant savage lair from which the wind was rushing was the sea and that the small bundle of shivers growing afraid of it all and beginning to cry was pip
hold your noise cried a terrible voice as a man started up from among the graves at the side of the church porch
keep still you little devil or ill cut your throat a fearful man all in coarse grey with a great iron on his leg
a man with no hat and with broken shoes and with an old rag tied round his head
a man who had been soaked in water and smothered in mud and lamed by stones and cut by flints and stung by nettles and torn by briars who limped and shivered and glared and growled and whose teeth chattered in his head as he seized me by the chin
oh
dont cut my throat sir i pleaded in terror
pray dont do it sir tell us your name said the man
quick pip sir once more said the man staring at me
give it mouth pip
pip sir show us where you live said the man
pint out the place i pointed to where our village lay on the flat inshore among the aldertrees and pollards a mile or more from the church
the man after looking at me for a moment turned me upside down and emptied my pockets
there was nothing in them but a piece of bread
when the church came to itselffor he was so sudden and strong that he made it go head over heels before me and i saw the steeple under my feetwhen the church came to itself i say i was seated on a high tombstone trembling while he ate the bread ravenously
illustration you young dog said the man licking his lips what fat cheeks you ha got i believe they were fat though i was at that time undersized for my years and not strong
darn me if i couldnt eat em said the man with a threatening shake of his head and if i hant half a mind tot i earnestly expressed my hope that he wouldnt and held tighter to the tombstone on which he had put me partly to keep myself upon it partly to keep myself from crying
now lookee here said the man
wheres your mother there sir said i
he started made a short run and stopped and looked over his shoulder
there sir i timidly explained
also georgiana
thats my mother oh said he coming back
and is that your father alonger your mother yes sir said i him too late of this parish ha he muttered then considering
who dye live withsupposin youre kindly let to live which i hant made up my mind about my sister sirmrs
joe gargerywife of joe gargery the blacksmith sir blacksmith eh said he
and looked down at his leg
after darkly looking at his leg and me several times he came closer to my tombstone took me by both arms and tilted me back as far as he could hold me so that his eyes looked most powerfully down into mine and mine looked most helplessly up into his
now lookee here he said the question being whether youre to be let to live
you know what a file is yes sir and you know what wittles is yes sir after each question he tilted me over a little more so as to give me a greater sense of helplessness and danger
you get me a file he tilted me again
and you get me wittles he tilted me again
you bring em both to me he tilted me again
or ill have your heart and liver out he tilted me again
i was dreadfully frightened and so giddy that i clung to him with both hands and said if you would kindly please to let me keep upright sir perhaps i shouldnt be sick and perhaps i could attend more he gave me a most tremendous dip and roll so that the church jumped over its own weathercock
then he held me by the arms in an upright position on the top of the stone and went on in these fearful terms you bring me tomorrow morning early that file and them wittles
you bring the lot to me at that old battery over yonder
you do it and you never dare to say a word or dare to make a sign concerning your having seen such a person as me or any person sumever and you shall be let to live
you fail or you go from my words in any partickler no matter how small it is and your heart and your liver shall be tore out roasted and ate
now i aint alone as you may think i am
theres a young man hid with me in comparison with which young man i am a angel
that young man hears the words i speak
that young man has a secret way pecooliar to himself of getting at a boy and at his heart and at his liver
it is in wain for a boy to attempt to hide himself from that young man
a boy may lock his door may be warm in bed may tuck himself up may draw the clothes over his head may think himself comfortable and safe but that young man will softly creep and creep his way to him and tear him open
i am a keeping that young man from harming of you at the present moment with great difficulty
i find it wery hard to hold that young man off of your inside
now what do you say i said that i would get him the file and i would get him what broken bits of food i could and i would come to him at the battery early in the morning
say lord strike you dead if you dont said the man
i said so and he took me down
now he pursued you remember what youve undertook and you remember that young man and you get home googood night sir i faltered
much of that said he glancing about him over the cold wet flat
i wish i was a frog
or a eel at the same time he hugged his shuddering body in both his armsclasping himself as if to hold himself togetherand limped towards the low church wall
as i saw him go picking his way among the nettles and among the brambles that bound the green mounds he looked in my young eyes as if he were eluding the hands of the dead people stretching up cautiously out of their graves to get a twist upon his ankle and pull him in
when he came to the low church wall he got over it like a man whose legs were numbed and stiff and then turned round to look for me
when i saw him turning i set my face towards home and made the best use of my legs
but presently i looked over my shoulder and saw him going on again towards the river still hugging himself in both arms and picking his way with his sore feet among the great stones dropped into the marshes here and there for steppingplaces when the rains were heavy or the tide was in
the marshes were just a long black horizontal line then as i stopped to look after him and the river was just another horizontal line not nearly so broad nor yet so black and the sky was just a row of long angry red lines and dense black lines intermixed
on the edge of the river i could faintly make out the only two black things in all the prospect that seemed to be standing upright one of these was the beacon by which the sailors steeredlike an unhooped cask upon a polean ugly thing when you were near it the other a gibbet with some chains hanging to it which had once held a pirate
the man was limping on towards this latter as if he were the pirate come to life and come down and going back to hook himself up again
it gave me a terrible turn when i thought so and as i saw the cattle lifting their heads to gaze after him i wondered whether they thought so too
i looked all round for the horrible young man and could see no signs of him
but now i was frightened again and ran home without stopping
chapter ii
my sister mrs joe gargery was more than twenty years older than i and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbours because she had brought me up by hand having at that time to find out for myself what the expression meant and knowing her to have a hard and heavy hand and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as well as upon me i supposed that joe gargery and i were both brought up by hand
she was not a goodlooking woman my sister and i had a general impression that she must have made joe gargery marry her by hand
joe was a fair man with curls of flaxen hair on each side of his smooth face and with eyes of such a very undecided blue that they seemed to have somehow got mixed with their own whites
he was a mild goodnatured sweettempered easygoing foolish dear fellowa sort of hercules in strength and also in weakness
my sister mrs joe with black hair and eyes had such a prevailing redness of skin that i sometimes used to wonder whether it was possible she washed herself with a nutmeggrater instead of soap
she was tall and bony and almost always wore a coarse apron fastened over her figure behind with two loops and having a square impregnable bib in front that was stuck full of pins and needles
she made it a powerful merit in herself and a strong reproach against joe that she wore this apron so much
though i really see no reason why she should have worn it at all or why if she did wear it at all she should not have taken it off every day of her life
joes forge adjoined our house which was a wooden house as many of the dwellings in our country weremost of them at that time
when i ran home from the churchyard the forge was shut up and joe was sitting alone in the kitchen
joe and i being fellowsufferers and having confidences as such joe imparted a confidence to me the moment i raised the latch of the door and peeped in at him opposite to it sitting in the chimney corner
mrs
joe has been out a dozen times looking for you pip
and shes out now making it a bakers dozen is she yes pip said joe and whats worse shes got tickler with her at this dismal intelligence i twisted the only button on my waistcoat round and round and looked in great depression at the fire
tickler was a waxended piece of cane worn smooth by collision with my tickled frame
she sot down said joe and she got up and she made a grab at tickler and she rampaged out
thats what she did said joe slowly clearing the fire between the lower bars with the poker and looking at it she rampaged out pip has she been gone long joe i always treated him as a larger species of child and as no more than my equal
well said joe glancing up at the dutch clock shes been on the rampage this last spell about five minutes pip
shes acoming
get behind the door old chap and have the jacktowel betwixt you i took the advice
my sister mrs joe throwing the door wide open and finding an obstruction behind it immediately divined the cause and applied tickler to its further investigation
she concluded by throwing mei often served as a connubial missileat joe who glad to get hold of me on any terms passed me on into the chimney and quietly fenced me up there with his great leg
where have you been you young monkey said mrs joe stamping her foot
tell me directly what youve been doing to wear me away with fret and fright and worrit or id have you out of that corner if you was fifty pips and he was five hundred gargerys i have only been to the churchyard said i from my stool crying and rubbing myself
churchyard repeated my sister
if it warnt for me youd have been to the churchyard long ago and stayed there
who brought you up by hand you did said i
and why did i do it i should like to know exclaimed my sister
i whimpered i dont know i dont said my sister
id never do it again
i know that
i may truly say ive never had this apron of mine off since born you were
its bad enough to be a blacksmiths wife and him a gargery without being your mother my thoughts strayed from that question as i looked disconsolately at the fire
for the fugitive out on the marshes with the ironed leg the mysterious young man the file the food and the dreadful pledge i was under to commit a larceny on those sheltering premises rose before me in the avenging coals
hah said mrs joe restoring tickler to his station
churchyard indeed
you may well say churchyard you two one of us by the by had not said it at all
youll drive me to the churchyard betwixt you one of these days and o a prrrecious pair youd be without me as she applied herself to set the teathings joe peeped down at me over his leg as if he were mentally casting me and himself up and calculating what kind of pair we practically should make under the grievous circumstances foreshadowed
after that he sat feeling his rightside flaxen curls and whisker and following mrs joe about with his blue eyes as his manner always was at squally times
my sister had a trenchant way of cutting our bread and butter for us that never varied
first with her left hand she jammed the loaf hard and fast against her bibwhere it sometimes got a pin into it and sometimes a needle which we afterwards got into our mouths
then she took some butter not too much on a knife and spread it on the loaf in an apothecary kind of way as if she were making a plasterusing both sides of the knife with a slapping dexterity and trimming and moulding the butter off round the crust
then she gave the knife a final smart wipe on the edge of the plaster and then sawed a very thick round off the loaf which she finally before separating from the loaf hewed into two halves of which joe got one and i the other
on the present occasion though i was hungry i dared not eat my slice
i felt that i must have something in reserve for my dreadful acquaintance and his ally the still more dreadful young man
i knew mrs joes housekeeping to be of the strictest kind and that my larcenous researches might find nothing available in the safe
therefore i resolved to put my hunk of bread and butter down the leg of my trousers
the effort of resolution necessary to the achievement of this purpose i found to be quite awful
it was as if i had to make up my mind to leap from the top of a high house or plunge into a great depth of water
and it was made the more difficult by the unconscious joe
in our alreadymentioned freemasonry as fellowsufferers and in his goodnatured companionship with me it was our evening habit to compare the way we bit through our slices by silently holding them up to each others admiration now and thenwhich stimulated us to new exertions
tonight joe several times invited me by the display of his fast diminishing slice to enter upon our usual friendly competition but he found me each time with my yellow mug of tea on one knee and my untouched bread and butter on the other
at last i desperately considered that the thing i contemplated must be done and that it had best be done in the least improbable manner consistent with the circumstances
i took advantage of a moment when joe had just looked at me and got my bread and butter down my leg
joe was evidently made uncomfortable by what he supposed to be my loss of appetite and took a thoughtful bite out of his slice which he didnt seem to enjoy
he turned it about in his mouth much longer than usual pondering over it a good deal and after all gulped it down like a pill
he was about to take another bite and had just got his head on one side for a good purchase on it when his eye fell on me and he saw that my bread and butter was gone
the wonder and consternation with which joe stopped on the threshold of his bite and stared at me were too evident to escape my sisters observation
whats the matter now said she smartly as she put down her cup
i say you know muttered joe shaking his head at me in very serious remonstrance
pip old chap
youll do yourself a mischief
itll stick somewhere
you cant have chawed it pip whats the matter now repeated my sister more sharply than before
if you can cough any trifle on it up pip id recommend you to do it said joe all aghast
manners is manners but still your elths your elth by this time my sister was quite desperate so she pounced on joe and taking him by the two whiskers knocked his head for a little while against the wall behind him while i sat in the corner looking guiltily on
now perhaps youll mention whats the matter said my sister out of breath you staring great stuck pig joe looked at her in a helpless way then took a helpless bite and looked at me again
you know pip said joe solemnly with his last bite in his cheek and speaking in a confidential voice as if we two were quite alone you and me is always friends and id be the last to tell upon you any time
but such a he moved his chair and looked about the floor between us and then again at mesuch a most oncommon bolt as that been bolting his food has he cried my sister
you know old chap said joe looking at me and not at mrs joe with his bite still in his cheek i bolted myself when i was your agefrequentand as a boy ive been among a many bolters but i never see your bolting equal yet pip and its a mercy you aint bolted dead my sister made a dive at me and fished me up by the hair saying nothing more than the awful words you come along and be dosed some medical beast had revived tarwater in those days as a fine medicine and mrs joe always kept a supply of it in the cupboard having a belief in its virtues correspondent to its nastiness
at the best of times so much of this elixir was administered to me as a choice restorative that i was conscious of going about smelling like a new fence
on this particular evening the urgency of my case demanded a pint of this mixture which was poured down my throat for my greater comfort while mrs joe held my head under her arm as a boot would be held in a bootjack
joe got off with half a pint but was made to swallow that much to his disturbance as he sat slowly munching and meditating before the fire because he had had a turn judging from myself i should say he certainly had a turn afterwards if he had had none before
conscience is a dreadful thing when it accuses man or boy but when in the case of a boy that secret burden cooperates with another secret burden down the leg of his trousers it is as i can testify a great punishment
the guilty knowledge that i was going to rob mrs joei never thought i was going to rob joe for i never thought of any of the housekeeping property as hisunited to the necessity of always keeping one hand on my bread and butter as i sat or when i was ordered about the kitchen on any small errand almost drove me out of my mind
then as the marsh winds made the fire glow and flare i thought i heard the voice outside of the man with the iron on his leg who had sworn me to secrecy declaring that he couldnt and wouldnt starve until tomorrow but must be fed now
at other times i thought what if the young man who was with so much difficulty restrained from imbruing his hands in me should yield to a constitutional impatience or should mistake the time and should think himself accredited to my heart and liver tonight instead of tomorrow
if ever anybodys hair stood on end with terror mine must have done so then
but perhaps nobodys ever did
it was christmas eve and i had to stir the pudding for next day with a copperstick from seven to eight by the dutch clock
i tried it with the load upon my leg and that made me think afresh of the man with the load on his leg and found the tendency of exercise to bring the bread and butter out at my ankle quite unmanageable
happily i slipped away and deposited that part of my conscience in my garret bedroom
hark said i when i had done my stirring and was taking a final warm in the chimney corner before being sent up to bed was that great guns joe ah said joe
theres another conwict off what does that mean joe said i mrs joe who always took explanations upon herself said snappishly escaped
escaped administering the definition like tarwater
while mrs joe sat with her head bending over her needlework i put my mouth into the forms of saying to joe whats a convict joe put his mouth into the forms of returning such a highly elaborate answer that i could make out nothing of it but the single word pip there was a conwict off last night said joe aloud after sunsetgun
and they fired warning of him
and now it appears theyre firing warning of another whos firing said i
drat that boy interposed my sister frowning at me over her work what a questioner he is
ask no questions and youll be told no lies it was not very polite to herself i thought to imply that i should be told lies by her even if i did ask questions
but she never was polite unless there was company
at this point joe greatly augmented my curiosity by taking the utmost pains to open his mouth very wide and to put it into the form of a word that looked to me like sulks therefore i naturally pointed to mrs joe and put my mouth into the form of saying her but joe wouldnt hear of that at all and again opened his mouth very wide and shook the form of a most emphatic word out of it
but i could make nothing of the word
mrs
joe said i as a last resort i should like to knowif you wouldnt much mindwhere the firing comes from lord bless the boy exclaimed my sister as if she didnt quite mean that but rather the contrary
from the hulks ohh said i looking at joe
hulks joe gave a reproachful cough as much as to say well i told you so and please whats hulks said i
thats the way with this boy exclaimed my sister pointing me out with her needle and thread and shaking her head at me
answer him one question and hell ask you a dozen directly
hulks are prisonships right cross th meshes we always used that name for marshes in our country
i wonder whos put into prisonships and why theyre put there said i in a general way and with quiet desperation
it was too much for mrs joe who immediately rose
i tell you what young fellow said she i didnt bring you up by hand to badger peoples lives out
it would be blame to me and not praise if i had
people are put in the hulks because they murder and because they rob and forge and do all sorts of bad and they always begin by asking questions
now you get along to bed i was never allowed a candle to light me to bed and as i went upstairs in the dark with my head tinglingfrom mrs joes thimble having played the tambourine upon it to accompany her last wordsi felt fearfully sensible of the great convenience that the hulks were handy for me
i was clearly on my way there
i had begun by asking questions and i was going to rob mrs joe
since that time which is far enough away now i have often thought that few people know what secrecy there is in the young under terror
no matter how unreasonable the terror so that it be terror
i was in mortal terror of the young man who wanted my heart and liver i was in mortal terror of my interlocutor with the iron leg i was in mortal terror of myself from whom an awful promise had been extracted i had no hope of deliverance through my allpowerful sister who repulsed me at every turn i am afraid to think of what i might have done on requirement in the secrecy of my terror
if i slept at all that night it was only to imagine myself drifting down the river on a strong springtide to the hulks a ghostly pirate calling out to me through a speakingtrumpet as i passed the gibbetstation that i had better come ashore and be hanged there at once and not put it off
i was afraid to sleep even if i had been inclined for i knew that at the first faint dawn of morning i must rob the pantry
there was no doing it in the night for there was no getting a light by easy friction then to have got one i must have struck it out of flint and steel and have made a noise like the very pirate himself rattling his chains
as soon as the great black velvet pall outside my little window was shot with grey i got up and went downstairs every board upon the way and every crack in every board calling after me stop thief and get up mrs joe in the pantry which was far more abundantly supplied than usual owing to the season i was very much alarmed by a hare hanging up by the heels whom i rather thought i caught when my back was half turned winking
i had no time for verification no time for selection no time for anything for i had no time to spare
i stole some bread some rind of cheese about half a jar of mincemeat which i tied up in my pockethandkerchief with my last nights slice some brandy from a stone bottle which i decanted into a glass bottle i had secretly used for making that intoxicating fluid spanishliquoricewater up in my room diluting the stone bottle from a jug in the kitchen cupboard a meat bone with very little on it and a beautiful round compact pork pie
i was nearly going away without the pie but i was tempted to mount upon a shelf to look what it was that was put away so carefully in a covered earthenware dish in a corner and i found it was the pie and i took it in the hope that it was not intended for early use and would not be missed for some time
there was a door in the kitchen communicating with the forge i unlocked and unbolted that door and got a file from among joes tools
then i put the fastenings as i had found them opened the door at which i had entered when i ran home last night shut it and ran for the misty marshes
chapter iii
it was a rimy morning and very damp
i had seen the damp lying on the outside of my little window as if some goblin had been crying there all night and using the window for a pockethandkerchief
now i saw the damp lying on the bare hedges and spare grass like a coarser sort of spiders webs hanging itself from twig to twig and blade to blade
on every rail and gate wet lay clammy and the marsh mist was so thick that the wooden finger on the post directing people to our villagea direction which they never accepted for they never came therewas invisible to me until i was quite close under it
then as i looked up at it while it dripped it seemed to my oppressed conscience like a phantom devoting me to the hulks
the mist was heavier yet when i got out upon the marshes so that instead of my running at everything everything seemed to run at me
this was very disagreeable to a guilty mind
the gates and dikes and banks came bursting at me through the mist as if they cried as plainly as could be a boy with somebody elses pork pie
stop him the cattle came upon me with like suddenness staring out of their eyes and steaming out of their nostrils halloa young thief one black ox with a white cravat onwho even had to my awakened conscience something of a clerical airfixed me so obstinately with his eyes and moved his blunt head round in such an accusatory manner as i moved round that i blubbered out to him i couldnt help it sir
it wasnt for myself i took it upon which he put down his head blew a cloud of smoke out of his nose and vanished with a kickup of his hindlegs and a flourish of his tail
all this time i was getting on towards the river but however fast i went i couldnt warm my feet to which the damp cold seemed riveted as the iron was riveted to the leg of the man i was running to meet
i knew my way to the battery pretty straight for i had been down there on a sunday with joe and joe sitting on an old gun had told me that when i was prentice to him regularly bound we would have such larks there
however in the confusion of the mist i found myself at last too far to the right and consequently had to try back along the riverside on the bank of loose stones above the mud and the stakes that staked the tide out
making my way along here with all despatch i had just crossed a ditch which i knew to be very near the battery and had just scrambled up the mound beyond the ditch when i saw the man sitting before me
his back was towards me and he had his arms folded and was nodding forward heavy with sleep
i thought he would be more glad if i came upon him with his breakfast in that unexpected manner so i went forward softly and touched him on the shoulder
he instantly jumped up and it was not the same man but another man
and yet this man was dressed in coarse grey too and had a great iron on his leg and was lame and hoarse and cold and was everything that the other man was except that he had not the same face and had a flat broadbrimmed lowcrowned felt hat on
all this i saw in a moment for i had only a moment to see it in he swore an oath at me made a hit at meit was a round weak blow that missed me and almost knocked himself down for it made him stumbleand then he ran into the mist stumbling twice as he went and i lost him
its the young man i thought feeling my heart shoot as i identified him
i dare say i should have felt a pain in my liver too if i had known where it was
i was soon at the battery after that and there was the right manhugging himself and limping to and fro as if he had never all night left off hugging and limpingwaiting for me
he was awfully cold to be sure
i half expected to see him drop down before my face and die of deadly cold
his eyes looked so awfully hungry too that when i handed him the file and he laid it down on the grass it occurred to me he would have tried to eat it if he had not seen my bundle
he did not turn me upside down this time to get at what i had but left me right side upwards while i opened the bundle and emptied my pockets
whats in the bottle boy said he
brandy said i
he was already handing mincemeat down his throat in the most curious mannermore like a man who was putting it away somewhere in a violent hurry than a man who was eating itbut he left off to take some of the liquor
he shivered all the while so violently that it was quite as much as he could do to keep the neck of the bottle between his teeth without biting it off
i think you have got the ague said i
im much of your opinion boy said he
its bad about here i told him
youve been lying out on the meshes and theyre dreadful aguish
rheumatic too ill eat my breakfast afore theyre the death of me said he
id do that if i was going to be strung up to that there gallows as there is over there directly afterwards
ill beat the shivers so far ill bet you he was gobbling mincemeat meatbone bread cheese and pork pie all at once staring distrustfully while he did so at the mist all round us and often stoppingeven stopping his jawsto listen
some real or fancied sound some clink upon the river or breathing of beast upon the marsh now gave him a start and he said suddenly youre not a deceiving imp
you brought no one with you no sir
no nor giv no one the office to follow you no well said he i believe you
youd be but a fierce young hound indeed if at your time of life you could help to hunt a wretched warmint hunted as near death and dunghill as this poor wretched warmint is something clicked in his throat as if he had works in him like a clock and was going to strike
and he smeared his ragged rough sleeve over his eyes
pitying his desolation and watching him as he gradually settled down upon the pie i made bold to say i am glad you enjoy it did you speak i said i was glad you enjoyed it thankee my boy
i do i had often watched a large dog of ours eating his food and i now noticed a decided similarity between the dogs way of eating and the mans
the man took strong sharp sudden bites just like the dog
he swallowed or rather snapped up every mouthful too soon and too fast and he looked sideways here and there while he ate as if he thought there was danger in every direction of somebodys coming to take the pie away
he was altogether too unsettled in his mind over it to appreciate it comfortably i thought or to have anybody to dine with him without making a chop with his jaws at the visitor
in all of which particulars he was very like the dog
i am afraid you wont leave any of it for him said i timidly after a silence during which i had hesitated as to the politeness of making the remark
theres no more to be got where that came from it was the certainty of this fact that impelled me to offer the hint
leave any for him
whos him said my friend stopping in his crunching of piecrust
the young man
that you spoke of
that was hid with you oh ah he returned with something like a gruff laugh
him
yes yes
he dont want no wittles i thought he looked as if he did said i
the man stopped eating and regarded me with the keenest scrutiny and the greatest surprise
looked
when just now where yonder said i pointing over there where i found him nodding asleep and thought it was you he held me by the collar and stared at me so that i began to think his first idea about cutting my throat had revived
dressed like you you know only with a hat i explained trembling andandi was very anxious to put this delicatelyand withthe same reason for wanting to borrow a file
didnt you hear the cannon last night then there was firing he said to himself
i wonder you shouldnt have been sure of that i returned for we heard it up at home and thats farther away and we were shut in besides why see now said he
when a mans alone on these flats with a light head and a light stomach perishing of cold and want he hears nothin all night but guns firing and voices calling
hears
he sees the soldiers with their red coats lighted up by the torches carried afore closing in round him
hears his number called hears himself challenged hears the rattle of the muskets hears the orders make ready
present
cover him steady men and is laid hands onand theres nothin
why if i see one pursuing party last nightcoming up in order damn em with their tramp trampi see a hundred
and as to firing
why i see the mist shake with the cannon arter it was broad daybut this man he had said all the rest as if he had forgotten my being there did you notice anything in him he had a badly bruised face said i recalling what i hardly knew i knew
not here exclaimed the man striking his left cheek mercilessly with the flat of his hand
yes there where is he he crammed what little food was left into the breast of his grey jacket
show me the way he went
ill pull him down like a bloodhound
curse this iron on my sore leg
give us hold of the file boy i indicated in what direction the mist had shrouded the other man and he looked up at it for an instant
but he was down on the rank wet grass filing at his iron like a madman and not minding me or minding his own leg which had an old chafe upon it and was bloody but which he handled as roughly as if it had no more feeling in it than the file
i was very much afraid of him again now that he had worked himself into this fierce hurry and i was likewise very much afraid of keeping away from home any longer
i told him i must go but he took no notice so i thought the best thing i could do was to slip off
the last i saw of him his head was bent over his knee and he was working hard at his fetter muttering impatient imprecations at it and at his leg
the last i heard of him i stopped in the mist to listen and the file was still going
chapter iv
i fully expected to find a constable in the kitchen waiting to take me up
but not only was there no constable there but no discovery had yet been made of the robbery
mrs joe was prodigiously busy in getting the house ready for the festivities of the day and joe had been put upon the kitchen doorstep to keep him out of the dustpanan article into which his destiny always led him sooner or later when my sister was vigorously reaping the floors of her establishment
and where the deuce ha you been was mrs joes christmas salutation when i and my conscience showed ourselves
i said i had been down to hear the carols
ah
well observed mrs joe
you might ha done worse not a doubt of that i thought
perhaps if i warnt a blacksmiths wife and whats the same thing a slave with her apron never off i should have been to hear the carols said mrs joe
im rather partial to carols myself and thats the best of reasons for my never hearing any joe who had ventured into the kitchen after me as the dustpan had retired before us drew the back of his hand across his nose with a conciliatory air when mrs joe darted a look at him and when her eyes were withdrawn secretly crossed his two forefingers and exhibited them to me as our token that mrs joe was in a cross temper
this was so much her normal state that joe and i would often for weeks together be as to our fingers like monumental crusaders as to their legs
we were to have a superb dinner consisting of a leg of pickled pork and greens and a pair of roast stuffed fowls
a handsome mincepie had been made yesterday morning which accounted for the mincemeat not being missed and the pudding was already on the boil
these extensive arrangements occasioned us to be cut off unceremoniously in respect of breakfast for i aint said mrs joei aint agoing to have no formal cramming and busting and washing up now with what ive got before me i promise you so we had our slices served out as if we were two thousand troops on a forced march instead of a man and boy at home and we took gulps of milk and water with apologetic countenances from a jug on the dresser
in the meantime mrs joe put clean white curtains up and tacked a new flowered flounce across the wide chimney to replace the old one and uncovered the little state parlour across the passage which was never uncovered at any other time but passed the rest of the year in a cool haze of silver paper which even extended to the four little white crockery poodles on the mantelshelf each with a black nose and a basket of flowers in his mouth and each the counterpart of the other
mrs joe was a very clean housekeeper but had an exquisite art of making her cleanliness more uncomfortable and unacceptable than dirt itself
cleanliness is next to godliness and some people do the same by their religion
my sister having so much to do was going to church vicariously that is to say joe and i were going
in his workingclothes joe was a wellknit characteristiclooking blacksmith in his holiday clothes he was more like a scarecrow in good circumstances than anything else
nothing that he wore then fitted him or seemed to belong to him and everything that he wore then grazed him
on the present festive occasion he emerged from his room when the blithe bells were going the picture of misery in a full suit of sunday penitentials
as to me i think my sister must have had some general idea that i was a young offender whom an accoucheur policeman had taken up on my birthday and delivered over to her to be dealt with according to the outraged majesty of the law
i was always treated as if i had insisted on being born in opposition to the dictates of reason religion and morality and against the dissuading arguments of my best friends
even when i was taken to have a new suit of clothes the tailor had orders to make them like a kind of reformatory and on no account to let me have the free use of my limbs
joe and i going to church therefore must have been a moving spectacle for compassionate minds
yet what i suffered outside was nothing to what i underwent within
the terrors that had assailed me whenever mrs joe had gone near the pantry or out of the room were only to be equalled by the remorse with which my mind dwelt on what my hands had done
under the weight of my wicked secret i pondered whether the church would be powerful enough to shield me from the vengeance of the terrible young man if i divulged to that establishment
i conceived the idea that the time when the banns were read and when the clergyman said ye are now to declare it would be the time for me to rise and propose a private conference in the vestry
i am far from being sure that i might not have astonished our small congregation by resorting to this extreme measure but for its being christmas day and no sunday
mr wopsle the clerk at church was to dine with us and mr hubble the wheelwright and mrs hubble and uncle pumblechook joes uncle but mrs joe appropriated him who was a welltodo cornchandler in the nearest town and drove his own chaisecart
the dinner hour was halfpast one
when joe and i got home we found the table laid and mrs joe dressed and the dinner dressing and the front door unlocked it never was at any other time for the company to enter by and everything most splendid
and still not a word of the robbery
the time came without bringing with it any relief to my feelings and the company came
mr wopsle united to a roman nose and a large shining bald forehead had a deep voice which he was uncommonly proud of indeed it was understood among his acquaintance that if you could only give him his head he would read the clergyman into fits he himself confessed that if the church was thrown open meaning to competition he would not despair of making his mark in it
the church not being thrown open he was as i have said our clerk
but he punished the amens tremendously and when he gave out the psalmalways giving the whole versehe looked all round the congregation first as much as to say you have heard my friend overhead oblige me with your opinion of this style i opened the door to the companymaking believe that it was a habit of ours to open that doorand i opened it first to mr wopsle next to mr and mrs hubble and last of all to uncle pumblechook
nb
i was not allowed to call him uncle under the severest penalties
mrs
joe said uncle pumblechook a large hardbreathing middleaged slow man with a mouth like a fish dull staring eyes and sandy hair standing upright on his head so that he looked as if he had just been all but choked and had that moment come to i have brought you as the compliments of the seasoni have brought you mum a bottle of sherry wineand i have brought you mum a bottle of port wine every christmas day he presented himself as a profound novelty with exactly the same words and carrying the two bottles like dumbbells
every christmas day mrs joe replied as she now replied o uncle pumblechook
this is kind every christmas day he retorted as he now retorted its no more than your merits
and now are you all bobbish and hows sixpennorth of halfpence meaning me
we dined on these occasions in the kitchen and adjourned for the nuts and oranges and apples to the parlour which was a change very like joes change from his workingclothes to his sunday dress
my sister was uncommonly lively on the present occasion and indeed was generally more gracious in the society of mrs hubble than in other company
i remember mrs hubble as a little curly sharpedged person in skyblue who held a conventionally juvenile position because she had married mr hubblei dont know at what remote periodwhen she was much younger than he
i remember mr hubble as a tough highshouldered stooping old man of a sawdusty fragrance with his legs extraordinarily wide apart so that in my short days i always saw some miles of open country between them when i met him coming up the lane
among this good company i should have felt myself even if i hadnt robbed the pantry in a false position
not because i was squeezed in at an acute angle of the tablecloth with the table in my chest and the pumblechookian elbow in my eye nor because i was not allowed to speak i didnt want to speak nor because i was regaled with the scaly tips of the drumsticks of the fowls and with those obscure corners of pork of which the pig when living had had the least reason to be vain
no i should not have minded that if they would only have left me alone
but they wouldnt leave me alone
they seemed to think the opportunity lost if they failed to point the conversation at me every now and then and stick the point into me
i might have been an unfortunate little bull in a spanish arena i got so smartingly touched up by these moral goads
it began the moment we sat down to dinner
mr wopsle said grace with theatrical declamationas it now appears to me something like a religious cross of the ghost in hamlet with richard the thirdand ended with the very proper aspiration that we might be truly grateful
upon which my sister fixed me with her eye and said in a low reproachful voice do you hear that
be grateful especially said mr pumblechook be grateful boy to them which brought you up by hand mrs hubble shook her head and contemplating me with a mournful presentiment that i should come to no good asked why is it that the young are never grateful this moral mystery seemed too much for the company until mr hubble tersely solved it by saying naterally wicious everybody then murmured true and looked at me in a particularly unpleasant and personal manner
joes station and influence were something feebler if possible when there was company than when there was none
but he always aided and comforted me when he could in some way of his own and he always did so at dinnertime by giving me gravy if there were any
there being plenty of gravy today joe spooned into my plate at this point about half a pint
a little later on in the dinner mr wopsle reviewed the sermon with some severity and intimatedin the usual hypothetical case of the church being thrown openwhat kind of sermon he would have given them
after favouring them with some heads of that discourse he remarked that he considered the subject of the days homily ill chosen which was the less excusable he added when there were so many subjects going about true again said uncle pumblechook
youve hit it sir
plenty of subjects going about for them that know how to put salt upon their tails
thats whats wanted
a man neednt go far to find a subject if hes ready with his saltbox mr pumblechook added after a short interval of reflection look at pork alone
theres a subject
if you want a subject look at pork true sir
many a moral for the young returned mr wopsleand i knew he was going to lug me in before he said it might be deduced from that text you listen to this said my sister to me in a severe parenthesis
joe gave me some more gravy
swine pursued mr wopsle in his deepest voice and pointing his fork at my blushes as if he were mentioning my christian nameswine were the companions of the prodigal
the gluttony of swine is put before us as an example to the young i thought this pretty well in him who had been praising up the pork for being so plump and juicy
what is detestable in a pig is more detestable in a boy or girl suggested mr hubble
of course or girl mr hubble assented mr wopsle rather irritably but there is no girl present besides said mr pumblechook turning sharp on me think what youve got to be grateful for
if youd been born a squeaker he was if ever a child was said my sister most emphatically
joe gave me some more gravy
well but i mean a fourfooted squeaker said mr pumblechook
if you had been born such would you have been here now
not you unless in that form said mr wopsle nodding towards the dish
but i dont mean in that form sir returned mr pumblechook who had an objection to being interrupted i mean enjoying himself with his elders and betters and improving himself with their conversation and rolling in the lap of luxury
would he have been doing that
no he wouldnt
and what would have been your destination turning on me again
you would have been disposed of for so many shillings according to the market price of the article and dunstable the butcher would have come up to you as you lay in your straw and he would have whipped you under his left arm and with his right he would have tucked up his frock to get a penknife from out of his waistcoatpocket and he would have shed your blood and had your life
no bringing up by hand then
not a bit of it joe offered me more gravy which i was afraid to take
he was a world of trouble to you maam said mrs hubble commiserating my sister
trouble echoed my sister trouble and then entered on a fearful catalogue of all the illnesses i had been guilty of and all the acts of sleeplessness i had committed and all the high places i had tumbled from and all the low places i had tumbled into and all the injuries i had done myself and all the times she had wished me in my grave and i had contumaciously refused to go there
i think the romans must have aggravated one another very much with their noses
perhaps they became the restless people they were in consequence
anyhow mr wopsles roman nose so aggravated me during the recital of my misdemeanours that i should have liked to pull it until he howled
but all i had endured up to this time was nothing in comparison with the awful feelings that took possession of me when the pause was broken which ensued upon my sisters recital and in which pause everybody had looked at me as i felt painfully conscious with indignation and abhorrence
yet said mr pumblechook leading the company gently back to the theme from which they had strayed porkregarded as biledis rich too aint it have a little brandy uncle said my sister
o heavens it had come at last
he would find it was weak he would say it was weak and i was lost
i held tight to the leg of the table under the cloth with both hands and awaited my fate
my sister went for the stone bottle came back with the stone bottle and poured his brandy out no one else taking any
the wretched man trifled with his glasstook it up looked at it through the light put it downprolonged my misery
all this time mrs joe and joe were briskly clearing the table for the pie and pudding
i couldnt keep my eyes off him
always holding tight by the leg of the table with my hands and feet i saw the miserable creature finger his glass playfully take it up smile throw his head back and drink the brandy off
instantly afterwards the company were seized with unspeakable consternation owing to his springing to his feet turning round several times in an appalling spasmodic whoopingcough dance and rushing out at the door he then became visible through the window violently plunging and expectorating making the most hideous faces and apparently out of his mind
i held on tight while mrs joe and joe ran to him
i didnt know how i had done it but i had no doubt i had murdered him somehow
in my dreadful situation it was a relief when he was brought back and surveying the company all round as if they had disagreed with him sank down into his chair with the one significant gasp tar i had filled up the bottle from the tarwater jug
i knew he would be worse by and by
i moved the table like a medium of the present day by the vigor of my unseen hold upon it
tar cried my sister in amazement
why how ever could tar come there but uncle pumblechook who was omnipotent in that kitchen wouldnt hear the word wouldnt hear of the subject imperiously waved it all away with his hand and asked for hot gin and water
my sister who had begun to be alarmingly meditative had to employ herself actively in getting the gin the hot water the sugar and the lemonpeel and mixing them
for the time being at least i was saved
i still held on to the leg of the table but clutched it now with the fervor of gratitude
by degrees i became calm enough to release my grasp and partake of pudding
mr pumblechook partook of pudding
all partook of pudding
the course terminated and mr pumblechook had begun to beam under the genial influence of gin and water
i began to think i should get over the day when my sister said to joe clean platescold i clutched the leg of the table again immediately and pressed it to my bosom as if it had been the companion of my youth and friend of my soul
i foresaw what was coming and i felt that this time i really was gone
you must taste said my sister addressing the guests with her best graceyou must taste to finish with such a delightful and delicious present of uncle pumblechooks must they
let them not hope to taste it
you must know said my sister rising its a pie a savory pork pie the company murmured their compliments
uncle pumblechook sensible of having deserved well of his fellowcreatures saidquite vivaciously all things consideredwell mrs joe well do our best endeavours let us have a cut at this same pie my sister went out to get it
i heard her steps proceed to the pantry
i saw mr pumblechook balance his knife
i saw reawakening appetite in the roman nostrils of mr wopsle
i heard mr hubble remark that a bit of savory pork pie would lay atop of anything you could mention and do no harm and i heard joe say you shall have some pip i have never been absolutely certain whether i uttered a shrill yell of terror merely in spirit or in the bodily hearing of the company
i felt that i could bear no more and that i must run away
i released the leg of the table and ran for my life
but i ran no farther than the house door for there i ran headforemost into a party of soldiers with their muskets one of whom held out a pair of handcuffs to me saying here you are look sharp come on chapter v the apparition of a file of soldiers ringing down the butends of their loaded muskets on our doorstep caused the dinnerparty to rise from table in confusion and caused mrs joe reentering the kitchen emptyhanded to stop short and stare in her wondering lament of gracious goodness gracious me whats gonewith thepie the sergeant and i were in the kitchen when mrs joe stood staring at which crisis i partially recovered the use of my senses
it was the sergeant who had spoken to me and he was now looking round at the company with his handcuffs invitingly extended towards them in his right hand and his left on my shoulder
excuse me ladies and gentleman said the sergeant but as i have mentioned at the door to this smart young shaver which he hadnt i am on a chase in the name of the king and i want the blacksmith and pray what might you want with him retorted my sister quick to resent his being wanted at all
missis returned the gallant sergeant speaking for myself i should reply the honour and pleasure of his fine wifes acquaintance speaking for the king i answer a little job done this was received as rather neat in the sergeant insomuch that mr pumblechook cried audibly good again you see blacksmith said the sergeant who had by this time picked out joe with his eye we have had an accident with these and i find the lock of one of em goes wrong and the coupling dont act pretty
as they are wanted for immediate service will you throw your eye over them joe threw his eye over them and pronounced that the job would necessitate the lighting of his forge fire and would take nearer two hours than one
will it
then will you set about it at once blacksmith said the offhand sergeant as its on his majestys service
and if my men can bear a hand anywhere theyll make themselves useful with that he called to his men who came trooping into the kitchen one after another and piled their arms in a corner
and then they stood about as soldiers do now with their hands loosely clasped before them now resting a knee or a shoulder now easing a belt or a pouch now opening the door to spit stiffly over their high stocks out into the yard
all these things i saw without then knowing that i saw them for i was in an agony of apprehension
but beginning to perceive that the handcuffs were not for me and that the military had so far got the better of the pie as to put it in the background i collected a little more of my scattered wits
would you give me the time said the sergeant addressing himself to mr pumblechook as to a man whose appreciative powers justified the inference that he was equal to the time
its just gone half past two thats not so bad said the sergeant reflecting even if i was forced to halt here nigh two hours thatll do
how far might you call yourselves from the marshes hereabouts
not above a mile i reckon just a mile said mrs joe
thatll do
we begin to close in upon em about dusk
a little before dusk my orders are
thatll do convicts sergeant asked mr wopsle in a matterofcourse way
ay returned the sergeant two
theyre pretty well known to be out on the marshes still and they wont try to get clear of em before dusk
anybody here seen anything of any such game everybody myself excepted said no with confidence
nobody thought of me
well said the sergeant theyll find themselves trapped in a circle i expect sooner than they count on
now blacksmith
if youre ready his majesty the king is joe had got his coat and waistcoat and cravat off and his leather apron on and passed into the forge
one of the soldiers opened its wooden windows another lighted the fire another turned to at the bellows the rest stood round the blaze which was soon roaring
then joe began to hammer and clink hammer and clink and we all looked on
the interest of the impending pursuit not only absorbed the general attention but even made my sister liberal
she drew a pitcher of beer from the cask for the soldiers and invited the sergeant to take a glass of brandy
but mr pumblechook said sharply give him wine mum
ill engage theres no tar in that so the sergeant thanked him and said that as he preferred his drink without tar he would take wine if it was equally convenient
when it was given him he drank his majestys health and compliments of the season and took it all at a mouthful and smacked his lips
good stuff eh sergeant said mr pumblechook
ill tell you something returned the sergeant i suspect that stuffs of your providing mr pumblechook with a fat sort of laugh said ay ay
why because returned the sergeant clapping him on the shoulder youre a man that knows whats what dye think so said mr pumblechook with his former laugh
have another glass with you
hob and nob returned the sergeant
the top of mine to the foot of yoursthe foot of yours to the top of minering once ring twicethe best tune on the musical glasses
your health
may you live a thousand years and never be a worse judge of the right sort than you are at the present moment of your life the sergeant tossed off his glass again and seemed quite ready for another glass
i noticed that mr pumblechook in his hospitality appeared to forget that he had made a present of the wine but took the bottle from mrs joe and had all the credit of handing it about in a gush of joviality
even i got some
and he was so very free of the wine that he even called for the other bottle and handed that about with the same liberality when the first was gone
as i watched them while they all stood clustering about the forge enjoying themselves so much i thought what terrible good sauce for a dinner my fugitive friend on the marshes was
they had not enjoyed themselves a quarter so much before the entertainment was brightened with the excitement he furnished
and now when they were all in lively anticipation of the two villains being taken and when the bellows seemed to roar for the fugitives the fire to flare for them the smoke to hurry away in pursuit of them joe to hammer and clink for them and all the murky shadows on the wall to shake at them in menace as the blaze rose and sank and the redhot sparks dropped and died the pale afternoon outside almost seemed in my pitying young fancy to have turned pale on their account poor wretches
at last joes job was done and the ringing and roaring stopped
as joe got on his coat he mustered courage to propose that some of us should go down with the soldiers and see what came of the hunt
mr pumblechook and mr hubble declined on the plea of a pipe and ladies society but mr wopsle said he would go if joe would
joe said he was agreeable and would take me if mrs joe approved
we never should have got leave to go i am sure but for mrs joes curiosity to know all about it and how it ended
as it was she merely stipulated if you bring the boy back with his head blown to bits by a musket dont look to me to put it together again the sergeant took a polite leave of the ladies and parted from mr pumblechook as from a comrade though i doubt if he were quite as fully sensible of that gentlemans merits under arid conditions as when something moist was going
his men resumed their muskets and fell in
mr wopsle joe and i received strict charge to keep in the rear and to speak no word after we reached the marshes
when we were all out in the raw air and were steadily moving towards our business i treasonably whispered to joe i hope joe we shant find them and joe whispered to me id give a shilling if they had cut and run pip we were joined by no stragglers from the village for the weather was cold and threatening the way dreary the footing bad darkness coming on and the people had good fires indoors and were keeping the day
a few faces hurried to glowing windows and looked after us but none came out
we passed the fingerpost and held straight on to the churchyard
there we were stopped a few minutes by a signal from the sergeants hand while two or three of his men dispersed themselves among the graves and also examined the porch
they came in again without finding anything and then we struck out on the open marshes through the gate at the side of the churchyard
a bitter sleet came rattling against us here on the east wind and joe took me on his back
now that we were out upon the dismal wilderness where they little thought i had been within eight or nine hours and had seen both men hiding i considered for the first time with great dread if we should come upon them would my particular convict suppose that it was i who had brought the soldiers there
he had asked me if i was a deceiving imp and he had said i should be a fierce young hound if i joined the hunt against him
would he believe that i was both imp and hound in treacherous earnest and had betrayed him
it was of no use asking myself this question now
there i was on joes back and there was joe beneath me charging at the ditches like a hunter and stimulating mr wopsle not to tumble on his roman nose and to keep up with us
the soldiers were in front of us extending into a pretty wide line with an interval between man and man
we were taking the course i had begun with and from which i had diverged in the mist
either the mist was not out again yet or the wind had dispelled it
under the low red glare of sunset the beacon and the gibbet and the mound of the battery and the opposite shore of the river were plain though all of a watery lead colour
with my heart thumping like a blacksmith at joes broad shoulder i looked all about for any sign of the convicts
i could see none i could hear none
mr wopsle had greatly alarmed me more than once by his blowing and hard breathing but i knew the sounds by this time and could dissociate them from the object of pursuit
i got a dreadful start when i thought i heard the file still going but it was only a sheepbell
the sheep stopped in their eating and looked timidly at us and the cattle their heads turned from the wind and sleet stared angrily as if they held us responsible for both annoyances but except these things and the shudder of the dying day in every blade of grass there was no break in the bleak stillness of the marshes
the soldiers were moving on in the direction of the old battery and we were moving on a little way behind them when all of a sudden we all stopped
for there had reached us on the wings of the wind and rain a long shout
it was repeated
it was at a distance towards the east but it was long and loud
nay there seemed to be two or more shouts raised togetherif one might judge from a confusion in the sound
to this effect the sergeant and the nearest men were speaking under their breath when joe and i came up
after another moments listening joe who was a good judge agreed and mr wopsle who was a bad judge agreed
the sergeant a decisive man ordered that the sound should not be answered but that the course should be changed and that his men should make towards it at the double so we slanted to the right where the east was and joe pounded away so wonderfully that i had to hold on tight to keep my seat
it was a run indeed now and what joe called in the only two words he spoke all the time a winder down banks and up banks and over gates and splashing into dikes and breaking among coarse rushes no man cared where he went
as we came nearer to the shouting it became more and more apparent that it was made by more than one voice
sometimes it seemed to stop altogether and then the soldiers stopped
when it broke out again the soldiers made for it at a greater rate than ever and we after them
after a while we had so run it down that we could hear one voice calling murder and another voice convicts
runaways
guard
this way for the runaway convicts then both voices would seem to be stifled in a struggle and then would break out again
and when it had come to this the soldiers ran like deer and joe too
the sergeant ran in first when we had run the noise quite down and two of his men ran in close upon him
their pieces were cocked and levelled when we all ran in
here are both men panted the sergeant struggling at the bottom of a ditch
surrender you two
and confound you for two wild beasts
come asunder water was splashing and mud was flying and oaths were being sworn and blows were being struck when some more men went down into the ditch to help the sergeant and dragged out separately my convict and the other one
both were bleeding and panting and execrating and struggling but of course i knew them both directly
mind said my convict wiping blood from his face with his ragged sleeves and shaking torn hair from his fingers i took him
i give him up to you
mind that its not much to be particular about said the sergeant itll do you small good my man being in the same plight yourself
handcuffs there i dont expect it to do me any good
i dont want it to do me more good than it does now said my convict with a greedy laugh
i took him
he knows it
thats enough for me the other convict was livid to look at and in addition to the old bruised left side of his face seemed to be bruised and torn all over
he could not so much as get his breath to speak until they were both separately handcuffed but leaned upon a soldier to keep himself from falling
take notice guardhe tried to murder me were his first words
tried to murder him said my convict disdainfully
try and not do it
i took him and giv him up thats what i done
i not only prevented him getting off the marshes but i dragged him heredragged him this far on his way back
hes a gentleman if you please this villain
now the hulks has got its gentleman again through me
murder him
worth my while too to murder him when i could do worse and drag him back the other one still gasped he triedhe triedtomurder me
bearbear witness lookee here said my convict to the sergeant
singlehanded i got clear of the prisonship i made a dash and i done it
i could ha got clear of these deathcold flats likewiselook at my leg you wont find much iron on itif i hadnt made the discovery that he was here
let him go free
let him profit by the means as i found out
let him make a tool of me afresh and again
once more
no no no
if i had died at the bottom there and he made an emphatic swing at the ditch with his manacled hands id have held to him with that grip that you should have been safe to find him in my hold the other fugitive who was evidently in extreme horror of his companion repeated he tried to murder me
i should have been a dead man if you had not come up he lies said my convict with fierce energy
hes a liar born and hell die a liar
look at his face aint it written there
let him turn those eyes of his on me
i defy him to do it the other with an effort at a scornful smile which could not however collect the nervous working of his mouth into any set expression looked at the soldiers and looked about at the marshes and at the sky but certainly did not look at the speaker
do you see him pursued my convict
do you see what a villain he is
do you see those grovelling and wandering eyes
thats how he looked when we were tried together
he never looked at me the other always working and working his dry lips and turning his eyes restlessly about him far and near did at last turn them for a moment on the speaker with the words you are not much to look at and with a halftaunting glance at the bound hands
at that point my convict became so frantically exasperated that he would have rushed upon him but for the interposition of the soldiers
didnt i tell you said the other convict then that he would murder me if he could and any one could see that he shook with fear and that there broke out upon his lips curious white flakes like thin snow
enough of this parley said the sergeant
light those torches as one of the soldiers who carried a basket in lieu of a gun went down on his knee to open it my convict looked round him for the first time and saw me
i had alighted from joes back on the brink of the ditch when we came up and had not moved since
i looked at him eagerly when he looked at me and slightly moved my hands and shook my head
i had been waiting for him to see me that i might try to assure him of my innocence
it was not at all expressed to me that he even comprehended my intention for he gave me a look that i did not understand and it all passed in a moment
but if he had looked at me for an hour or for a day i could not have remembered his face ever afterwards as having been more attentive
the soldier with the basket soon got a light and lighted three or four torches and took one himself and distributed the others
it had been almost dark before but now it seemed quite dark and soon afterwards very dark
before we departed from that spot four soldiers standing in a ring fired twice into the air
presently we saw other torches kindled at some distance behind us and others on the marshes on the opposite bank of the river
all right said the sergeant
march we had not gone far when three cannon were fired ahead of us with a sound that seemed to burst something inside my ear
you are expected on board said the sergeant to my convict they know you are coming
dont straggle my man
close up here the two were kept apart and each walked surrounded by a separate guard
i had hold of joes hand now and joe carried one of the torches
mr wopsle had been for going back but joe was resolved to see it out so we went on with the party
there was a reasonably good path now mostly on the edge of the river with a divergence here and there where a dike came with a miniature windmill on it and a muddy sluicegate
when i looked round i could see the other lights coming in after us
the torches we carried dropped great blotches of fire upon the track and i could see those too lying smoking and flaring
i could see nothing else but black darkness
our lights warmed the air about us with their pitchy blaze and the two prisoners seemed rather to like that as they limped along in the midst of the muskets
we could not go fast because of their lameness and they were so spent that two or three times we had to halt while they rested
after an hour or so of this travelling we came to a rough wooden hut and a landingplace
there was a guard in the hut and they challenged and the sergeant answered
then we went into the hut where there was a smell of tobacco and whitewash and a bright fire and a lamp and a stand of muskets and a drum and a low wooden bedstead like an overgrown mangle without the machinery capable of holding about a dozen soldiers all at once
three or four soldiers who lay upon it in their greatcoats were not much interested in us but just lifted their heads and took a sleepy stare and then lay down again
the sergeant made some kind of report and some entry in a book and then the convict whom i call the other convict was drafted off with his guard to go on board first
my convict never looked at me except that once
while we stood in the hut he stood before the fire looking thoughtfully at it or putting up his feet by turns upon the hob and looking thoughtfully at them as if he pitied them for their recent adventures
suddenly he turned to the sergeant and remarked i wish to say something respecting this escape
it may prevent some persons laying under suspicion alonger me you can say what you like returned the sergeant standing coolly looking at him with his arms folded but you have no call to say it here
youll have opportunity enough to say about it and hear about it before its done with you know i know but this is another pint a separate matter
a man cant starve at least i cant
i took some wittles up at the willage over yonderwhere the church stands amost out on the marshes you mean stole said the sergeant
and ill tell you where from
from the blacksmiths halloa said the sergeant staring at joe
halloa pip said joe staring at me
it was some broken wittlesthats what it wasand a dram of liquor and a pie have you happened to miss such an article as a pie blacksmith asked the sergeant confidentially
my wife did at the very moment when you came in
dont you know pip so said my convict turning his eyes on joe in a moody manner and without the least glance at meso youre the blacksmith are you
than im sorry to say ive eat your pie god knows youre welcome to itso far as it was ever mine returned joe with a saving remembrance of mrs joe
we dont know what you have done but we wouldnt have you starved to death for it poor miserable fellowcreaturwould us pip the something that i had noticed before clicked in the mans throat again and he turned his back
the boat had returned and his guard were ready so we followed him to the landingplace made of rough stakes and stones and saw him put into the boat which was rowed by a crew of convicts like himself
no one seemed surprised to see him or interested in seeing him or glad to see him or sorry to see him or spoke a word except that somebody in the boat growled as if to dogs give way you which was the signal for the dip of the oars
by the light of the torches we saw the black hulk lying out a little way from the mud of the shore like a wicked noahs ark
cribbed and barred and moored by massive rusty chains the prisonship seemed in my young eyes to be ironed like the prisoners
we saw the boat go alongside and we saw him taken up the side and disappear
then the ends of the torches were flung hissing into the water and went out as if it were all over with him
chapter vi
my state of mind regarding the pilfering from which i had been so unexpectedly exonerated did not impel me to frank disclosure but i hope it had some dregs of good at the bottom of it
i do not recall that i felt any tenderness of conscience in reference to mrs joe when the fear of being found out was lifted off me
but i loved joeperhaps for no better reason in those early days than because the dear fellow let me love himand as to him my inner self was not so easily composed
it was much upon my mind particularly when i first saw him looking about for his file that i ought to tell joe the whole truth
yet i did not and for the reason that i mistrusted that if i did he would think me worse than i was
the fear of losing joes confidence and of thenceforth sitting in the chimney corner at night staring drearily at my forever lost companion and friend tied up my tongue
i morbidly represented to myself that if joe knew it i never afterwards could see him at the fireside feeling his fair whisker without thinking that he was meditating on it
that if joe knew it i never afterwards could see him glance however casually at yesterdays meat or pudding when it came on todays table without thinking that he was debating whether i had been in the pantry
that if joe knew it and at any subsequent period of our joint domestic life remarked that his beer was flat or thick the conviction that he suspected tar in it would bring a rush of blood to my face
in a word i was too cowardly to do what i knew to be right as i had been too cowardly to avoid doing what i knew to be wrong
i had had no intercourse with the world at that time and i imitated none of its many inhabitants who act in this manner
quite an untaught genius i made the discovery of the line of action for myself
as i was sleepy before we were far away from the prisonship joe took me on his back again and carried me home
he must have had a tiresome journey of it for mr wopsle being knocked up was in such a very bad temper that if the church had been thrown open he would probably have excommunicated the whole expedition beginning with joe and myself
in his lay capacity he persisted in sitting down in the damp to such an insane extent that when his coat was taken off to be dried at the kitchen fire the circumstantial evidence on his trousers would have hanged him if it had been a capital offence
by that time i was staggering on the kitchen floor like a little drunkard through having been newly set upon my feet and through having been fast asleep and through waking in the heat and lights and noise of tongues
as i came to myself with the aid of a heavy thump between the shoulders and the restorative exclamation yah
was there ever such a boy as this from my sister i found joe telling them about the convicts confession and all the visitors suggesting different ways by which he had got into the pantry
mr pumblechook made out after carefully surveying the premises that he had first got upon the roof of the forge and had then got upon the roof of the house and had then let himself down the kitchen chimney by a rope made of his bedding cut into strips and as mr pumblechook was very positive and drove his own chaisecartover everybodyit was agreed that it must be so
mr wopsle indeed wildly cried out no with the feeble malice of a tired man but as he had no theory and no coat on he was unanimously set at naughtnot to mention his smoking hard behind as he stood with his back to the kitchen fire to draw the damp out which was not calculated to inspire confidence
this was all i heard that night before my sister clutched me as a slumberous offence to the companys eyesight and assisted me up to bed with such a strong hand that i seemed to have fifty boots on and to be dangling them all against the edges of the stairs
my state of mind as i have described it began before i was up in the morning and lasted long after the subject had died out and had ceased to be mentioned saving on exceptional occasions
chapter vii
at the time when i stood in the churchyard reading the family tombstones i had just enough learning to be able to spell them out
my construction even of their simple meaning was not very correct for i read wife of the above as a complimentary reference to my fathers exaltation to a better world and if any one of my deceased relations had been referred to as below i have no doubt i should have formed the worst opinions of that member of the family
neither were my notions of the theological positions to which my catechism bound me at all accurate for i have a lively remembrance that i supposed my declaration that i was to walk in the same all the days of my life laid me under an obligation always to go through the village from our house in one particular direction and never to vary it by turning down by the wheelwrights or up by the mill
when i was old enough i was to be apprenticed to joe and until i could assume that dignity i was not to be what mrs joe called pompeyed or as i render it pampered
therefore i was not only oddboy about the forge but if any neighbour happened to want an extra boy to frighten birds or pick up stones or do any such job i was favoured with the employment
in order however that our superior position might not be compromised thereby a moneybox was kept on the kitchen mantelshelf into which it was publicly made known that all my earnings were dropped
i have an impression that they were to be contributed eventually towards the liquidation of the national debt but i know i had no hope of any personal participation in the treasure
mr wopsles greataunt kept an evening school in the village that is to say she was a ridiculous old woman of limited means and unlimited infirmity who used to go to sleep from six to seven every evening in the society of youth who paid two pence per week each for the improving opportunity of seeing her do it
she rented a small cottage and mr wopsle had the room upstairs where we students used to overhear him reading aloud in a most dignified and terrific manner and occasionally bumping on the ceiling
there was a fiction that mr wopsle examined the scholars once a quarter
what he did on those occasions was to turn up his cuffs stick up his hair and give us mark antonys oration over the body of caesar
this was always followed by collinss ode on the passions wherein i particularly venerated mr wopsle as revenge throwing his bloodstained sword in thunder down and taking the wardenouncing trumpet with a withering look
it was not with me then as it was in later life when i fell into the society of the passions and compared them with collins and wopsle rather to the disadvantage of both gentlemen
mr wopsles greataunt besides keeping this educational institution kept in the same rooma little general shop
she had no idea what stock she had or what the price of anything in it was but there was a little greasy memorandumbook kept in a drawer which served as a catalogue of prices and by this oracle biddy arranged all the shop transactions
biddy was mr wopsles greataunts granddaughter i confess myself quite unequal to the working out of the problem what relation she was to mr wopsle
she was an orphan like myself like me too had been brought up by hand
she was most noticeable i thought in respect of her extremities for her hair always wanted brushing her hands always wanted washing and her shoes always wanted mending and pulling up at heel
this description must be received with a weekday limitation
on sundays she went to church elaborated
much of my unassisted self and more by the help of biddy than of mr wopsles greataunt i struggled through the alphabet as if it had been a bramblebush getting considerably worried and scratched by every letter
after that i fell among those thieves the nine figures who seemed every evening to do something new to disguise themselves and baffle recognition
but at last i began in a purblind groping way to read write and cipher on the very smallest scale
one night i was sitting in the chimney corner with my slate expending great efforts on the production of a letter to joe
i think it must have been a full year after our hunt upon the marshes for it was a long time after and it was winter and a hard frost
with an alphabet on the hearth at my feet for reference i contrived in an hour or two to print and smear this epistle mi deer jo i ope u r krwite well i ope i shal son b habell teedge u jo an then we shorl b so glodd an wen i m prengtd u jo wot larx an bleve me inf xn pip there was no indispensable necessity for my communicating with joe by letter inasmuch as he sat beside me and we were alone
but i delivered this written communication slate and all with my own hand and joe received it as a miracle of erudition
i say pip old chap cried joe opening his blue eyes wide what a scholar you are
ant you i should like to be said i glancing at the slate as he held it with a misgiving that the writing was rather hilly
why heres a j said joe and a o equal to anythink
heres a j and a o pip and a jo joe illustration i had never heard joe read aloud to any greater extent than this monosyllable and i had observed at church last sunday when i accidentally held our prayerbook upside down that it seemed to suit his convenience quite as well as if it had been all right
wishing to embrace the present occasion of finding out whether in teaching joe i should have to begin quite at the beginning i said ah
but read the rest jo the rest eh pip said joe looking at it with a slow searching eye one two three
why heres three js and three os and three jo joes in it pip i leaned over joe and with the aid of my forefinger read him the whole letter
astonishing said joe when i had finished
you are a scholar how do you spell gargery joe i asked him with a modest patronage
i dont spell it at all said joe
but supposing you did it cant be supposed said joe
tho im uncommon fond of reading too are you joe oncommon
give me said joe a good book or a good newspaper and sit me down afore a good fire and i ask no better
lord he continued after rubbing his knees a little when you do come to a j and a o and says you here at last is a jo joe how interesting reading is i derived from this that joes education like steam was yet in its infancy
pursuing the subject i inquired didnt you ever go to school joe when you were as little as me no pip why didnt you ever go to school joe when you were as little as me well pip said joe taking up the poker and settling himself to his usual occupation when he was thoughtful of slowly raking the fire between the lower bars ill tell you
my father pip he were given to drink and when he were overtook with drink he hammered away at my mother most onmerciful
it were amost the only hammering he did indeed xcepting at myself
and he hammered at me with a wigor only to be equalled by the wigor with which he didnt hammer at his anwilyoure a listening and understanding pip yes joe consequence my mother and me we ran away from my father several times and then my mother shed go out to work and shed say joe shed say now please god you shall have some schooling child and shed put me to school
but my father were that good in his hart that he couldnt abear to be without us
so hed come with a most tremenjous crowd and make such a row at the doors of the houses where we was that they used to be obligated to have no more to do with us and to give us up to him
and then he took us home and hammered us
which you see pip said joe pausing in his meditative raking of the fire and looking at me were a drawback on my learning certainly poor joe though mind you pip said joe with a judicial touch or two of the poker on the top bar rendering unto all their doo and maintaining equal justice betwixt man and man my father were that good in his hart dont you see i didnt see but i didnt say so
well joe pursued somebody must keep the pot abiling pip or the pot wont bile dont you know i saw that and said so
consequence my father didnt make objections to my going to work so i went to work at my present calling which were his too if he would have followed it and i worked tolerable hard i assure you pip
in time i were able to keep him and i kep him till he went off in a purple leptic fit
and it were my intentions to have had put upon his tombstone that whatsumeer the failings on his part remember reader he were that good in his heart joe recited this couplet with such manifest pride and careful perspicuity that i asked him if he had made it himself
i made it said joe my own self
i made it in a moment
it was like striking out a horseshoe complete in a single blow
i never was so much surprised in all my lifecouldnt credit my own edto tell you the truth hardly believed it were my own ed
as i was saying pip it were my intentions to have had it cut over him but poetry costs money cut it how you will small or large and it were not done
not to mention bearers all the money that could be spared were wanted for my mother
she were in poor elth and quite broke
she werent long of following poor soul and her share of peace come round at last joes blue eyes turned a little watery he rubbed first one of them and then the other in a most uncongenial and uncomfortable manner with the round knob on the top of the poker
it were but lonesome then said joe living here alone and i got acquainted with your sister
now pipjoe looked firmly at me as if he knew i was not going to agree with himyour sister is a fine figure of a woman i could not help looking at the fire in an obvious state of doubt
whatever family opinions or whatever the worlds opinions on that subject may be pip your sister is joe tapped the top bar with the poker after every word following afinefigureofawoman i could think of nothing better to say than i am glad you think so joe so am i returned joe catching me up
i am glad i think so pip
a little redness or a little matter of bone here or there what does it signify to me i sagaciously observed if it didnt signify to him to whom did it signify
certainly assented joe
thats it
youre right old chap
when i got acquainted with your sister it were the talk how she was bringing you up by hand
very kind of her too all the folks said and i said along with all the folks
as to you joe pursued with a countenance expressive of seeing something very nasty indeed if you could have been aware how small and flabby and mean you was dear me youd have formed the most contemptible opinion of yourself not exactly relishing this i said never mind me joe but i did mind you pip he returned with tender simplicity
when i offered to your sister to keep company and to be asked in church at such times as she was willing and ready to come to the forge i said to her and bring the poor little child
god bless the poor little child i said to your sister theres room for him at the forge i broke out crying and begging pardon and hugged joe round the neck who dropped the poker to hug me and to say ever the best of friends ant us pip
dont cry old chap when this little interruption was over joe resumed well you see pip and here we are
thats about where it lights here we are
now when you take me in hand in my learning pip and i tell you beforehand i am awful dull most awful dull mrs joe mustnt see too much of what were up to
it must be done as i may say on the sly
and why on the sly
ill tell you why pip he had taken up the poker again without which i doubt if he could have proceeded in his demonstration
your sister is given to government given to government joe i was startled for i had some shadowy idea and i am afraid i must add hope that joe had divorced her in a favour of the lords of the admiralty or treasury
given to government said joe
which i meantersay the government of you and myself oh and she ant over partial to having scholars on the premises joe continued and in partickler would not be over partial to my being a scholar for fear as i might rise
like a sort of rebel dont you see i was going to retort with an inquiry and had got as far as why when joe stopped me
stay a bit
i know what youre agoing to say pip stay a bit
i dont deny that your sister comes the mogul over us now and again
i dont deny that she do throw us backfalls and that she do drop down upon us heavy
at such times as when your sister is on the rampage pip joe sank his voice to a whisper and glanced at the door candour compels fur to admit that she is a buster joe pronounced this word as if it began with at least twelve capital bs
why dont i rise
that were your observation when i broke it off pip yes joe well said joe passing the poker into his left hand that he might feel his whisker and i had no hope of him whenever he took to that placid occupation your sisters a mastermind
a mastermind whats that i asked in some hope of bringing him to a stand
but joe was readier with his definition than i had expected and completely stopped me by arguing circularly and answering with a fixed look her and i aint a mastermind joe resumed when he had unfixed his look and got back to his whisker
and last of all pipand this i want to say very serious to you old chapi see so much in my poor mother of a woman drudging and slaving and breaking her honest hart and never getting no peace in her mortal days that im dead afeerd of going wrong in the way of not doing whats right by a woman and id fur rather of the two go wrong the tother way and be a little illconwenienced myself
i wish it was only me that got put out pip i wish there warnt no tickler for you old chap i wish i could take it all on myself but this is the upanddownandstraight on it pip and i hope youll overlook shortcomings young as i was i believe that i dated a new admiration of joe from that night
we were equals afterwards as we had been before but afterwards at quiet times when i sat looking at joe and thinking about him i had a new sensation of feeling conscious that i was looking up to joe in my heart
however said joe rising to replenish the fire heres the dutchclock aworking himself up to being equal to strike eight of em and shes not come home yet
i hope uncle pumblechooks mare maynt have set a forefoot on a piece o ice and gone down mrs joe made occasional trips with uncle pumblechook on marketdays to assist him in buying such household stuffs and goods as required a womans judgment uncle pumblechook being a bachelor and reposing no confidences in his domestic servant
this was marketday and mrs joe was out on one of these expeditions
joe made the fire and swept the hearth and then we went to the door to listen for the chaisecart
it was a dry cold night and the wind blew keenly and the frost was white and hard
a man would die tonight of lying out on the marshes i thought
and then i looked at the stars and considered how awful it would be for a man to turn his face up to them as he froze to death and see no help or pity in all the glittering multitude
here comes the mare said joe ringing like a peal of bells the sound of her iron shoes upon the hard road was quite musical as she came along at a much brisker trot than usual
we got a chair out ready for mrs joes alighting and stirred up the fire that they might see a bright window and took a final survey of the kitchen that nothing might be out of its place
when we had completed these preparations they drove up wrapped to the eyes
mrs joe was soon landed and uncle pumblechook was soon down too covering the mare with a cloth and we were soon all in the kitchen carrying so much cold air in with us that it seemed to drive all the heat out of the fire
now said mrs joe unwrapping herself with haste and excitement and throwing her bonnet back on her shoulders where it hung by the strings if this boy aint grateful this night he never will be i looked as grateful as any boy possibly could who was wholly uninformed why he ought to assume that expression
its only to be hoped said my sister that he wont be pompeyed
but i have my fears she aint in that line mum said mr pumblechook
she knows better she
i looked at joe making the motion with my lips and eyebrows she joe looked at me making the motion with his lips and eyebrows she my sister catching him in the act he drew the back of his hand across his nose with his usual conciliatory air on such occasions and looked at her
well said my sister in her snappish way
what are you staring at
is the house afire which some individual joe politely hinted mentionedshe and she is a she i suppose said my sister
unless you call miss havisham a he
and i doubt if even youll go so far as that miss havisham up town said joe
is there any miss havisham down town returned my sister
she wants this boy to go and play there
and of course hes going
and he had better play there said my sister shaking her head at me as an encouragement to be extremely light and sportive or ill work him i had heard of miss havisham up towneverybody for miles round had heard of miss havisham up townas an immensely rich and grim lady who lived in a large and dismal house barricaded against robbers and who led a life of seclusion
well to be sure said joe astounded
i wonder how she come to know pip noodle cried my sister
who said she knew him which some individual joe again politely hinted mentioned that she wanted him to go and play there and couldnt she ask uncle pumblechook if he knew of a boy to go and play there
isnt it just barely possible that uncle pumblechook may be a tenant of hers and that he may sometimeswe wont say quarterly or halfyearly for that would be requiring too much of youbut sometimesgo there to pay his rent
and couldnt she then ask uncle pumblechook if he knew of a boy to go and play there
and couldnt uncle pumblechook being always considerate and thoughtful for usthough you may not think it joseph in a tone of the deepest reproach as if he were the most callous of nephews then mention this boy standing prancing herewhich i solemnly declare i was not doingthat i have for ever been a willing slave to good again cried uncle pumblechook
well put
prettily pointed
good indeed
now joseph you know the case no joseph said my sister still in a reproachful manner while joe apologetically drew the back of his hand across and across his nose you do not yetthough you may not think itknow the case
you may consider that you do but you do not joseph
for you do not know that uncle pumblechook being sensible that for anything we can tell this boys fortune may be made by his going to miss havishams has offered to take him into town tonight in his own chaisecart and to keep him tonight and to take him with his own hands to miss havishams tomorrow morning
and loramussy me cried my sister casting off her bonnet in sudden desperation here i stand talking to mere mooncalfs with uncle pumblechook waiting and the mare catching cold at the door and the boy grimed with crock and dirt from the hair of his head to the sole of his foot with that she pounced upon me like an eagle on a lamb and my face was squeezed into wooden bowls in sinks and my head was put under taps of waterbutts and i was soaped and kneaded and towelled and thumped and harrowed and rasped until i really was quite beside myself
i may here remark that i suppose myself to be better acquainted than any living authority with the ridgy effect of a weddingring passing unsympathetically over the human countenance
when my ablutions were completed i was put into clean linen of the stiffest character like a young penitent into sackcloth and was trussed up in my tightest and fearfullest suit
i was then delivered over to mr pumblechook who formally received me as if he were the sheriff and who let off upon me the speech that i knew he had been dying to make all along boy be forever grateful to all friends but especially unto them which brought you up by hand goodbye joe god bless you pip old chap i had never parted from him before and what with my feelings and what with soapsuds i could at first see no stars from the chaisecart
but they twinkled out one by one without throwing any light on the questions why on earth i was going to play at miss havishams and what on earth i was expected to play at
chapter viii
mr pumblechooks premises in the high street of the market town were of a peppercorny and farinaceous character as the premises of a cornchandler and seedsman should be
it appeared to me that he must be a very happy man indeed to have so many little drawers in his shop and i wondered when i peeped into one or two on the lower tiers and saw the tiedup brown paper packets inside whether the flowerseeds and bulbs ever wanted of a fine day to break out of those jails and bloom
it was in the early morning after my arrival that i entertained this speculation
on the previous night i had been sent straight to bed in an attic with a sloping roof which was so low in the corner where the bedstead was that i calculated the tiles as being within a foot of my eyebrows
in the same early morning i discovered a singular affinity between seeds and corduroys
mr pumblechook wore corduroys and so did his shopman and somehow there was a general air and flavour about the corduroys so much in the nature of seeds and a general air and flavour about the seeds so much in the nature of corduroys that i hardly knew which was which
the same opportunity served me for noticing that mr pumblechook appeared to conduct his business by looking across the street at the saddler who appeared to transact his business by keeping his eye on the coachmaker who appeared to get on in life by putting his hands in his pockets and contemplating the baker who in his turn folded his arms and stared at the grocer who stood at his door and yawned at the chemist
the watchmaker always poring over a little desk with a magnifyingglass at his eye and always inspected by a group of smockfrocks poring over him through the glass of his shopwindow seemed to be about the only person in the high street whose trade engaged his attention
mr pumblechook and i breakfasted at eight oclock in the parlour behind the shop while the shopman took his mug of tea and hunch of bread and butter on a sack of peas in the front premises
i considered mr pumblechook wretched company
besides being possessed by my sisters idea that a mortifying and penitential character ought to be imparted to my dietbesides giving me as much crumb as possible in combination with as little butter and putting such a quantity of warm water into my milk that it would have been more candid to have left the milk out altogetherhis conversation consisted of nothing but arithmetic
on my politely bidding him goodmorning he said pompously seven times nine boy and how should i be able to answer dodged in that way in a strange place on an empty stomach
i was hungry but before i had swallowed a morsel he began a running sum that lasted all through the breakfast
seven and four and eight and six and two and ten and so on
and after each figure was disposed of it was as much as i could do to get a bite or a sup before the next came while he sat at his ease guessing nothing and eating bacon and hot roll in if i may be allowed the expression a gorging and gormandizing manner
for such reasons i was very glad when ten oclock came and we started for miss havishams though i was not at all at my ease regarding the manner in which i should acquit myself under that ladys roof
within a quarter of an hour we came to miss havishams house which was of old brick and dismal and had a great many iron bars to it
some of the windows had been walled up of those that remained all the lower were rustily barred
there was a courtyard in front and that was barred so we had to wait after ringing the bell until some one should come to open it
while we waited at the gate i peeped in even then mr pumblechook said and fourteen but i pretended not to hear him and saw that at the side of the house there was a large brewery
no brewing was going on in it and none seemed to have gone on for a long long time
a window was raised and a clear voice demanded what name to which my conductor replied pumblechook the voice returned quite right and the window was shut again and a young lady came across the courtyard with keys in her hand
this said mr pumblechook is pip this is pip is it returned the young lady who was very pretty and seemed very proud come in pip mr pumblechook was coming in also when she stopped him with the gate
oh she said
did you wish to see miss havisham if miss havisham wished to see me returned mr pumblechook discomfited
ah said the girl but you see she dont she said it so finally and in such an undiscussible way that mr pumblechook though in a condition of ruffled dignity could not protest
but he eyed me severelyas if i had done anything to himand departed with the words reproachfully delivered boy
let your behaviour here be a credit unto them which brought you up by hand i was not free from apprehension that he would come back to propound through the gate and sixteen but he didnt
my young conductress locked the gate and we went across the courtyard
it was paved and clean but grass was growing in every crevice
the brewery buildings had a little lane of communication with it and the wooden gates of that lane stood open and all the brewery beyond stood open away to the high enclosing wall and all was empty and disused
the cold wind seemed to blow colder there than outside the gate and it made a shrill noise in howling in and out at the open sides of the brewery like the noise of wind in the rigging of a ship at sea
she saw me looking at it and she said you could drink without hurt all the strong beer thats brewed there now boy i should think i could miss said i in a shy way
better not try to brew beer there now or it would turn out sour boy dont you think so it looks like it miss not that anybody means to try she added for thats all done with and the place will stand as idle as it is till it falls
as to strong beer theres enough of it in the cellars already to drown the manor house illustration is that the name of this house miss one of its names boy it has more than one then miss one more
its other name was satis which is greek or latin or hebrew or all threeor all one to mefor enough enough house said i thats a curious name miss yes she replied but it meant more than it said
it meant when it was given that whoever had this house could want nothing else
they must have been easily satisfied in those days i should think
but dont loiter boy though she called me boy so often and with a carelessness that was far from complimentary she was of about my own age
she seemed much older than i of course being a girl and beautiful and selfpossessed and she was as scornful of me as if she had been oneandtwenty and a queen
we went into the house by a side door the great front entrance had two chains across it outsideand the first thing i noticed was that the passages were all dark and that she had left a candle burning there
she took it up and we went through more passages and up a staircase and still it was all dark and only the candle lighted us
at last we came to the door of a room and she said go in i answered more in shyness than politeness after you miss to this she returned dont be ridiculous boy i am not going in and scornfully walked away andwhat was worsetook the candle with her
this was very uncomfortable and i was half afraid
however the only thing to be done being to knock at the door i knocked and was told from within to enter
i entered therefore and found myself in a pretty large room well lighted with wax candles
no glimpse of daylight was to be seen in it
it was a dressingroom as i supposed from the furniture though much of it was of forms and uses then quite unknown to me
but prominent in it was a draped table with a gilded lookingglass and that i made out at first sight to be a fine ladys dressingtable
whether i should have made out this object so soon if there had been no fine lady sitting at it i cannot say
in an armchair with an elbow resting on the table and her head leaning on that hand sat the strangest lady i have ever seen or shall ever see
she was dressed in rich materialssatins and lace and silksall of white
her shoes were white
and she had a long white veil dependent from her hair and she had bridal flowers in her hair but her hair was white
some bright jewels sparkled on her neck and on her hands and some other jewels lay sparkling on the table
dresses less splendid than the dress she wore and halfpacked trunks were scattered about
she had not quite finished dressing for she had but one shoe onthe other was on the table near her handher veil was but half arranged her watch and chain were not put on and some lace for her bosom lay with those trinkets and with her handkerchief and gloves and some flowers and a prayerbook all confusedly heaped about the lookingglass
it was not in the first few moments that i saw all these things though i saw more of them in the first moments than might be supposed
but i saw that everything within my view which ought to be white had been white long ago and had lost its lustre and was faded and yellow
i saw that the bride within the bridal dress had withered like the dress and like the flowers and had no brightness left but the brightness of her sunken eyes
i saw that the dress had been put upon the rounded figure of a young woman and that the figure upon which it now hung loose had shrunk to skin and bone
once i had been taken to see some ghastly waxwork at the fair representing i know not what impossible personage lying in state
once i had been taken to one of our old marsh churches to see a skeleton in the ashes of a rich dress that had been dug out of a vault under the church pavement
now waxwork and skeleton seemed to have dark eyes that moved and looked at me
i should have cried out if i could
who is it said the lady at the table
pip maam pip mr
pumblechooks boy maam
cometo play come nearer let me look at you
come close it was when i stood before her avoiding her eyes that i took note of the surrounding objects in detail and saw that her watch had stopped at twenty minutes to nine and that a clock in the room had stopped at twenty minutes to nine
look at me said miss havisham
you are not afraid of a woman who has never seen the sun since you were born i regret to state that i was not afraid of telling the enormous lie comprehended in the answer no do you know what i touch here she said laying her hands one upon the other on her left side
yes maam it made me think of the young man
what do i touch your heart broken she uttered the word with an eager look and with strong emphasis and with a weird smile that had a kind of boast in it
afterwards she kept her hands there for a little while and slowly took them away as if they were heavy
i am tired said miss havisham
i want diversion and i have done with men and women
play i think it will be conceded by my most disputatious reader that she could hardly have directed an unfortunate boy to do anything in the wide world more difficult to be done under the circumstances
i sometimes have sick fancies she went on and i have a sick fancy that i want to see some play
there there with an impatient movement of the fingers of her right hand play play play for a moment with the fear of my sisters working me before my eyes i had a desperate idea of starting round the room in the assumed character of mr pumblechooks chaisecart
but i felt myself so unequal to the performance that i gave it up and stood looking at miss havisham in what i suppose she took for a dogged manner inasmuch as she said when we had taken a good look at each other are you sullen and obstinate no maam i am very sorry for you and very sorry i cant play just now
if you complain of me i shall get into trouble with my sister so i would do it if i could but its so new here and so strange and so fineand melancholy i stopped fearing i might say too much or had already said it and we took another look at each other
before she spoke again she turned her eyes from me and looked at the dress she wore and at the dressingtable and finally at herself in the lookingglass
so new to him she muttered so old to me so strange to him so familiar to me so melancholy to both of us
call estella as she was still looking at the reflection of herself i thought she was still talking to herself and kept quiet
call estella she repeated flashing a look at me
you can do that
call estella
at the door to stand in the dark in a mysterious passage of an unknown house bawling estella to a scornful young lady neither visible nor responsive and feeling it a dreadful liberty so to roar out her name was almost as bad as playing to order
but she answered at last and her light came along the dark passage like a star
miss havisham beckoned her to come close and took up a jewel from the table and tried its effect upon her fair young bosom and against her pretty brown hair
your own one day my dear and you will use it well
let me see you play cards with this boy with this boy
why he is a common labouringboy i thought i overheard miss havisham answeronly it seemed so unlikelywell
you can break his heart what do you play boy asked estella of myself with the greatest disdain
nothing but beggar my neighbour miss beggar him said miss havisham to estella
so we sat down to cards
it was then i began to understand that everything in the room had stopped like the watch and the clock a long time ago
i noticed that miss havisham put down the jewel exactly on the spot from which she had taken it up
as estella dealt the cards i glanced at the dressingtable again and saw that the shoe upon it once white now yellow had never been worn
i glanced down at the foot from which the shoe was absent and saw that the silk stocking on it once white now yellow had been trodden ragged
without this arrest of everything this standing still of all the pale decayed objects not even the withered bridal dress on the collapsed form could have looked so like graveclothes or the long veil so like a shroud
so she sat corpselike as we played at cards the frillings and trimmings on her bridal dress looking like earthy paper
i knew nothing then of the discoveries that are occasionally made of bodies buried in ancient times which fall to powder in the moment of being distinctly seen but i have often thought since that she must have looked as if the admission of the natural light of day would have struck her to dust
he calls the knaves jacks this boy said estella with disdain before our first game was out
and what coarse hands he has
and what thick boots i had never thought of being ashamed of my hands before but i began to consider them a very indifferent pair
her contempt for me was so strong that it became infectious and i caught it
she won the game and i dealt
i misdealt as was only natural when i knew she was lying in wait for me to do wrong and she denounced me for a stupid clumsy labouringboy
you say nothing of her remarked miss havisham to me as she looked on
she says many hard things of you but you say nothing of her
what do you think of her i dont like to say i stammered
tell me in my ear said miss havisham bending down
i think she is very proud i replied in a whisper
anything else i think she is very pretty anything else i think she is very insulting she was looking at me then with a look of supreme aversion
anything else i think i should like to go home and never see her again though she is so pretty i am not sure that i shouldnt like to see her again but i should like to go home now you shall go soon said miss havisham aloud
play the game out saving for the one weird smile at first i should have felt almost sure that miss havishams face could not smile
it had dropped into a watchful and brooding expressionmost likely when all the things about her had become transfixedand it looked as if nothing could ever lift it up again
her chest had dropped so that she stooped and her voice had dropped so that she spoke low and with a dead lull upon her altogether she had the appearance of having dropped body and soul within and without under the weight of a crushing blow
i played the game to an end with estella and she beggared me
she threw the cards down on the table when she had won them all as if she despised them for having been won of me
when shall i have you here again said miss havisham
let me think i was beginning to remind her that today was wednesday when she checked me with her former impatient movement of the fingers of her right hand
there there
i know nothing of days of the week i know nothing of weeks of the year
come again after six days
you hear yes maam estella take him down
let him have something to eat and let him roam and look about him while he eats
go pip i followed the candle down as i had followed the candle up and she stood it in the place where we had found it
until she opened the side entrance i had fancied without thinking about it that it must necessarily be nighttime
the rush of the daylight quite confounded me and made me feel as if i had been in the candlelight of the strange room many hours
you are to wait here you boy said estella and disappeared and closed the door
i took the opportunity of being alone in the courtyard to look at my coarse hands and my common boots
my opinion of those accessories was not favourable
they had never troubled me before but they troubled me now as vulgar appendages
i determined to ask joe why he had ever taught me to call those picturecards jacks which ought to be called knaves
i wished joe had been rather more genteelly brought up and then i should have been so too
she came back with some bread and meat and a little mug of beer
she put the mug down on the stones of the yard and gave me the bread and meat without looking at me as insolently as if i were a dog in disgrace
i was so humiliated hurt spurned offended angry sorryi cannot hit upon the right name for the smartgod knows what its name wasthat tears started to my eyes
the moment they sprang there the girl looked at me with a quick delight in having been the cause of them
this gave me power to keep them back and to look at her so she gave a contemptuous tossbut with a sense i thought of having made too sure that i was so woundedand left me
but when she was gone i looked about me for a place to hide my face in and got behind one of the gates in the brewerylane and leaned my sleeve against the wall there and leaned my forehead on it and cried
as i cried i kicked the wall and took a hard twist at my hair so bitter were my feelings and so sharp was the smart without a name that needed counteraction
my sisters bringing up had made me sensitive
in the little world in which children have their existence whosoever brings them up there is nothing so finely perceived and so finely felt as injustice
it may be only small injustice that the child can be exposed to but the child is small and its world is small and its rockinghorse stands as many hands high according to scale as a bigboned irish hunter
within myself i had sustained from my babyhood a perpetual conflict with injustice
i had known from the time when i could speak that my sister in her capricious and violent coercion was unjust to me
i had cherished a profound conviction that her bringing me up by hand gave her no right to bring me up by jerks
through all my punishments disgraces fasts and vigils and other penitential performances i had nursed this assurance and to my communing so much with it in a solitary and unprotected way i in great part refer the fact that i was morally timid and very sensitive
i got rid of my injured feelings for the time by kicking them into the brewery wall and twisting them out of my hair and then i smoothed my face with my sleeve and came from behind the gate
the bread and meat were acceptable and the beer was warming and tingling and i was soon in spirits to look about me
to be sure it was a deserted place down to the pigeonhouse in the breweryyard which had been blown crooked on its pole by some high wind and would have made the pigeons think themselves at sea if there had been any pigeons there to be rocked by it
but there were no pigeons in the dovecot no horses in the stable no pigs in the sty no malt in the storehouse no smells of grains and beer in the copper or the vat
all the uses and scents of the brewery might have evaporated with its last reek of smoke
in a byyard there was a wilderness of empty casks which had a certain sour remembrance of better days lingering about them but it was too sour to be accepted as a sample of the beer that was goneand in this respect i remember those recluses as being like most others
behind the furthest end of the brewery was a rank garden with an old wall not so high but that i could struggle up and hold on long enough to look over it and see that the rank garden was the garden of the house and that it was overgrown with tangled weeds but that there was a track upon the green and yellow paths as if some one sometimes walked there and that estella was walking away from me even then
but she seemed to be everywhere
for when i yielded to the temptation presented by the casks and began to walk on them i saw her walking on them at the end of the yard of casks
she had her back towards me and held her pretty brown hair spread out in her two hands and never looked round and passed out of my view directly
so in the brewery itselfby which i mean the large paved lofty place in which they used to make the beer and where the brewing utensils still were
when i first went into it and rather oppressed by its gloom stood near the door looking about me i saw her pass among the extinguished fires and ascend some light iron stairs and go out by a gallery high overhead as if she were going out into the sky
it was in this place and at this moment that a strange thing happened to my fancy
i thought it a strange thing then and i thought it a stranger thing long afterwards
i turned my eyesa little dimmed by looking up at the frosty lighttowards a great wooden beam in a low nook of the building near me on my right hand and i saw a figure hanging there by the neck
a figure all in yellow white with but one shoe to the feet and it hung so that i could see that the faded trimmings of the dress were like earthy paper and that the face was miss havishams with a movement going over the whole countenance as if she were trying to call to me
in the terror of seeing the figure and in the terror of being certain that it had not been there a moment before i at first ran from it and then ran towards it
and my terror was greatest of all when i found no figure there
nothing less than the frosty light of the cheerful sky the sight of people passing beyond the bars of the courtyard gate and the reviving influence of the rest of the bread and meat and beer would have brought me round
even with those aids i might not have come to myself as soon as i did but that i saw estella approaching with the keys to let me out
she would have some fair reason for looking down upon me i thought if she saw me frightened and she would have no fair reason
she gave me a triumphant glance in passing me as if she rejoiced that my hands were so coarse and my boots were so thick and she opened the gate and stood holding it
i was passing out without looking at her when she touched me with a taunting hand
why dont you cry because i dont want to you do said she
you have been crying till you are half blind and you are near crying again now she laughed contemptuously pushed me out and locked the gate upon me
i went straight to mr pumblechooks and was immensely relieved to find him not at home
so leaving word with the shopman on what day i was wanted at miss havishams again i set off on the fourmile walk to our forge pondering as i went along on all i had seen and deeply revolving that i was a common labouringboy that my hands were coarse that my boots were thick that i had fallen into a despicable habit of calling knaves jacks that i was much more ignorant than i had considered myself last night and generally that i was in a lowlived bad way
chapter ix
when i reached home my sister was very curious to know all about miss havishams and asked a number of questions
and i soon found myself getting heavily bumped from behind in the nape of the neck and the small of the back and having my face ignominiously shoved against the kitchen wall because i did not answer those questions at sufficient length
if a dread of not being understood be hidden in the breasts of other young people to anything like the extent to which it used to be hidden in minewhich i consider probable as i have no particular reason to suspect myself of having been a monstrosityit is the key to many reservations
i felt convinced that if i described miss havishams as my eyes had seen it i should not be understood
not only that but i felt convinced that miss havisham too would not be understood and although she was perfectly incomprehensible to me i entertained an impression that there would be something coarse and treacherous in my dragging her as she really was to say nothing of miss estella before the contemplation of mrs joe
consequently i said as little as i could and had my face shoved against the kitchen wall
the worst of it was that that bullying old pumblechook preyed upon by a devouring curiosity to be informed of all i had seen and heard came gaping over in his chaisecart at teatime to have the details divulged to him
and the mere sight of the torment with his fishy eyes and mouth open his sandy hair inquisitively on end and his waistcoat heaving with windy arithmetic made me vicious in my reticence
well boy uncle pumblechook began as soon as he was seated in the chair of honour by the fire
how did you get on up town i answered pretty well sir and my sister shook her fist at me
pretty well mr pumblechook repeated
pretty well is no answer
tell us what you mean by pretty well boy whitewash on the forehead hardens the brain into a state of obstinacy perhaps
anyhow with whitewash from the wall on my forehead my obstinacy was adamantine
i reflected for some time and then answered as if i had discovered a new idea i mean pretty well my sister with an exclamation of impatience was going to fly at mei had no shadow of defence for joe was busy in the forgewhen mr pumblechook interposed with no
dont lose your temper
leave this lad to me maam leave this lad to me mr pumblechook then turned me towards him as if he were going to cut my hair and said first to get our thoughts in order fortythree pence i calculated the consequences of replying four hundred pound and finding them against me went as near the answer as i couldwhich was somewhere about eightpence off
mr pumblechook then put me through my pencetable from twelve pence make one shilling up to forty pence make three and fourpence and then triumphantly demanded as if he had done for me now how much is fortythree pence to which i replied after a long interval of reflection i dont know and i was so aggravated that i almost doubt if i did know
mr pumblechook worked his head like a screw to screw it out of me and said is fortythree pence seven and sixpence three fardens for instance yes said i
and although my sister instantly boxed my ears it was highly gratifying to me to see that the answer spoilt his joke and brought him to a dead stop
boy
what like is miss havisham mr pumblechook began again when he had recovered folding his arms tight on his chest and applying the screw
very tall and dark i told him
is she uncle asked my sister
mr pumblechook winked assent from which i at once inferred that he had never seen miss havisham for she was nothing of the kind
good said mr pumblechook conceitedly
this is the way to have him
we are beginning to hold our own i think mum i am sure uncle returned mrs joe i wish you had him always you know so well how to deal with him now boy
what was she adoing of when you went in today asked mr pumblechook
she was sitting i answered in a black velvet coach mr pumblechook and mrs joe stared at one anotheras they well mightand both repeated in a black velvet coach yes said i
and miss estellathats her niece i thinkhanded her in cake and wine at the coachwindow on a gold plate
and we all had cake and wine on gold plates
and i got up behind the coach to eat mine because she told me to was anybody else there asked mr pumblechook
four dogs said i
large or small immense said i
and they fought for vealcutlets out of a silver basket mr pumblechook and mrs joe stared at one another again in utter amazement
i was perfectly frantica reckless witness under the tortureand would have told them anything
where was this coach in the name of gracious asked my sister
in miss havishams room they stared again
but there werent any horses to it i added this saving clause in the moment of rejecting four richly caparisoned coursers which i had had wild thoughts of harnessing
can this be possible uncle asked mrs joe
what can the boy mean ill tell you mum said mr pumblechook
my opinion is its a sedanchair
shes flighty you knowvery flightyquite flighty enough to pass her days in a sedanchair did you ever see her in it uncle asked mrs joe
how could i he returned forced to the admission when i never see her in my life
never clapped eyes upon her goodness uncle
and yet you have spoken to her why dont you know said mr pumblechook testily that when i have been there i have been took up to the outside of her door and the door has stood ajar and she has spoke to me that way
dont say you dont know that mum
howsever the boy went there to play
what did you play at boy we played with flags i said
i beg to observe that i think of myself with amazement when i recall the lies i told on this occasion
flags echoed my sister
yes said i
estella waved a blue flag and i waved a red one and miss havisham waved one sprinkled all over with little gold stars out at the coachwindow
and then we all waved our swords and hurrahed swords repeated my sister
where did you get swords from out of a cupboard said i
and i saw pistols in itand jamand pills
and there was no daylight in the room but it was all lighted up with candles thats true mum said mr pumblechook with a grave nod
thats the state of the case for that much ive seen myself and then they both stared at me and i with an obtrusive show of artlessness on my countenance stared at them and plaited the right leg of my trousers with my right hand
if they had asked me any more questions i should undoubtedly have betrayed myself for i was even then on the point of mentioning that there was a balloon in the yard and should have hazarded the statement but for my invention being divided between that phenomenon and a bear in the brewery
they were so much occupied however in discussing the marvels i had already presented for their consideration that i escaped
the subject still held them when joe came in from his work to have a cup of tea
to whom my sister more for the relief of her own mind than for the gratification of his related my pretended experiences
now when i saw joe open his blue eyes and roll them all round the kitchen in helpless amazement i was overtaken by penitence but only as regarded himnot in the least as regarded the other two
towards joe and joe only i considered myself a young monster while they sat debating what results would come to me from miss havishams acquaintance and favour
they had no doubt that miss havisham would do something for me their doubts related to the form that something would take
my sister stood out for property mr pumblechook was in favour of a handsome premium for binding me apprentice to some genteel tradesay the corn and seed trade for instance
joe fell into the deepest disgrace with both for offering the bright suggestion that i might only be presented with one of the dogs who had fought for the vealcutlets
if a fools head cant express better opinions than that said my sister and you have got any work to do you had better go and do it so he went
after mr pumblechook had driven off and when my sister was washing up i stole into the forge to joe and remained by him until he had done for the night
then i said before the fire goes out joe i should like to tell you something should you pip said joe drawing his shoeingstool near the forge
then tell us
what is it pip joe said i taking hold of his rolledup shirt sleeve and twisting it between my finger and thumb you remember all that about miss havishams remember said joe
i believe you
wonderful its a terrible thing joe it aint true what are you telling of pip cried joe falling back in the greatest amazement
you dont mean to say its yes i do its lies joe but not all of it
why sure you dont mean to say pip that there was no black welwet coeh for i stood shaking my head
but at least there was dogs pip
come pip said joe persuasively if there warnt no wealcutlets at least there was dogs no joe a dog said joe
a puppy
come no joe there was nothing at all of the kind as i fixed my eyes hopelessly on joe joe contemplated me in dismay
pip old chap
this wont do old fellow
i say
where do you expect to go to its terrible joe aint it terrible cried joe
awful
what possessed you i dont know what possessed me joe i replied letting his shirt sleeve go and sitting down in the ashes at his feet hanging my head but i wish you hadnt taught me to call knaves at cards jacks and i wish my boots werent so thick nor my hands so coarse and then i told joe that i felt very miserable and that i hadnt been able to explain myself to mrs joe and pumblechook who were so rude to me and that there had been a beautiful young lady at miss havishams who was dreadfully proud and that she had said i was common and that i knew i was common and that i wished i was not common and that the lies had come of it somehow though i didnt know how
this was a case of metaphysics at least as difficult for joe to deal with as for me
but joe took the case altogether out of the region of metaphysics and by that means vanquished it
theres one thing you may be sure of pip said joe after some rumination namely that lies is lies
howsever they come they didnt ought to come and they come from the father of lies and work round to the same
dont you tell no more of em pip
that aint the way to get out of being common old chap
and as to being common i dont make it out at all clear
you are oncommon in some things
youre oncommon small
likewise youre a oncommon scholar no i am ignorant and backward joe why see what a letter you wrote last night
wrote in print even
ive seen lettersah
and from gentlefolksthat ill swear werent wrote in print said joe
i have learnt next to nothing joe
you think much of me
its only that well pip said joe be it so or be it sont you must be a common scholar afore you can be a oncommon one i should hope
the king upon his throne with his crown upon his ed cant sit and write his acts of parliament in print without having begun when he were a unpromoted prince with the alphabetah added joe with a shake of the head that was full of meaning and begun at a too and worked his way to z
and i know what that is to do though i cant say ive exactly done it there was some hope in this piece of wisdom and it rather encouraged me
whether common ones as to callings and earnings pursued joe reflectively mightnt be the better of continuing for to keep company with common ones instead of going out to play with oncommon oneswhich reminds me to hope that there were a flag perhaps no joe im sorry there werent a flag pip
whether that might be or mightnt be is a thing as cant be looked into now without putting your sister on the rampage and thats a thing not to be thought of as being done intentional
lookee here pip at what is said to you by a true friend
which this to you the true friend say
if you cant get to be oncommon through going straight youll never get to do it through going crooked
so dont tell no more on em pip and live well and die happy you are not angry with me joe no old chap
but bearing in mind that them were which i meantersay of a stunning and outdacious sortalluding to them which bordered on wealcutlets and dogfightinga sincere wellwisher would adwise pip their being dropped into your meditations when you go upstairs to bed
thats all old chap and dont never do it no more when i got up to my little room and said my prayers i did not forget joes recommendation and yet my young mind was in that disturbed and unthankful state that i thought long after i laid me down how common estella would consider joe a mere blacksmith how thick his boots and how coarse his hands
i thought how joe and my sister were then sitting in the kitchen and how i had come up to bed from the kitchen and how miss havisham and estella never sat in a kitchen but were far above the level of such common doings
i fell asleep recalling what i used to do when i was at miss havishams as though i had been there weeks or months instead of hours and as though it were quite an old subject of remembrance instead of one that had arisen only that day
that was a memorable day to me for it made great changes in me
but it is the same with any life
imagine one selected day struck out of it and think how different its course would have been
pause you who read this and think for a moment of the long chain of iron or gold of thorns or flowers that would never have bound you but for the formation of the first link on one memorable day
chapter x
the felicitous idea occurred to me a morning or two later when i woke that the best step i could take towards making myself uncommon was to get out of biddy everything she knew
in pursuance of this luminous conception i mentioned to biddy when i went to mr wopsles greataunts at night that i had a particular reason for wishing to get on in life and that i should feel very much obliged to her if she would impart all her learning to me
biddy who was the most obliging of girls immediately said she would and indeed began to carry out her promise within five minutes
the educational scheme or course established by mr wopsles greataunt may be resolved into the following synopsis
the pupils ate apples and put straws down one anothers backs until mr wopsles greataunt collected her energies and made an indiscriminate totter at them with a birchrod
after receiving the charge with every mark of derision the pupils formed in line and buzzingly passed a ragged book from hand to hand
the book had an alphabet in it some figures and tables and a little spellingthat is to say it had had once
as soon as this volume began to circulate mr wopsles greataunt fell into a state of coma arising either from sleep or a rheumatic paroxysm
the pupils then entered among themselves upon a competitive examination on the subject of boots with the view of ascertaining who could tread the hardest upon whose toes
this mental exercise lasted until biddy made a rush at them and distributed three defaced bibles shaped as if they had been unskilfully cut off the chump end of something more illegibly printed at the best than any curiosities of literature i have since met with speckled all over with ironmould and having various specimens of the insect world smashed between their leaves
this part of the course was usually lightened by several single combats between biddy and refractory students
when the fights were over biddy gave out the number of a page and then we all read aloud what we couldor what we couldntin a frightful chorus biddy leading with a high shrill monotonous voice and none of us having the least notion of or reverence for what we were reading about
when this horrible din had lasted a certain time it mechanically awoke mr wopsles greataunt who staggered at a boy fortuitously and pulled his ears
this was understood to terminate the course for the evening and we emerged into the air with shrieks of intellectual victory
it is fair to remark that there was no prohibition against any pupils entertaining himself with a slate or even with the ink when there was any but that it was not easy to pursue that branch of study in the winter season on account of the little general shop in which the classes were holdenand which was also mr wopsles greataunts sittingroom and bedchamberbeing but faintly illuminated through the agency of one lowspirited dipcandle and no snuffers
it appeared to me that it would take time to become uncommon under these circumstances nevertheless i resolved to try it and that very evening biddy entered on our special agreement by imparting some information from her little catalogue of prices under the head of moist sugar and lending me to copy at home a large old english d which she had imitated from the heading of some newspaper and which i supposed until she told me what it was to be a design for a buckle
of course there was a publichouse in the village and of course joe liked sometimes to smoke his pipe there
i had received strict orders from my sister to call for him at the three jolly bargemen that evening on my way from school and bring him home at my peril
to the three jolly bargemen therefore i directed my steps
there was a bar at the jolly bargemen with some alarmingly long chalk scores in it on the wall at the side of the door which seemed to me to be never paid off
they had been there ever since i could remember and had grown more than i had
but there was a quantity of chalk about our country and perhaps the people neglected no opportunity of turning it to account
it being saturday night i found the landlord looking rather grimly at these records but as my business was with joe and not with him i merely wished him good evening and passed into the common room at the end of the passage where there was a bright large kitchen fire and where joe was smoking his pipe in company with mr wopsle and a stranger
joe greeted me as usual with halloa pip old chap and the moment he said that the stranger turned his head and looked at me
he was a secretlooking man whom i had never seen before
his head was all on one side and one of his eyes was half shut up as if he were taking aim at something with an invisible gun
he had a pipe in his mouth and he took it out and after slowly blowing all his smoke away and looking hard at me all the time nodded
so i nodded and then he nodded again and made room on the settle beside him that i might sit down there
but as i was used to sit beside joe whenever i entered that place of resort i said no thank you sir and fell into the space joe made for me on the opposite settle
the strange man after glancing at joe and seeing that his attention was otherwise engaged nodded to me again when i had taken my seat and then rubbed his legin a very odd way as it struck me
you was saying said the strange man turning to joe that you was a blacksmith yes
i said it you know said joe
whatll you drink mr
you didnt mention your name by the bye joe mentioned it now and the strange man called him by it
whatll you drink mr gargery
at my expense
to top up with well said joe to tell you the truth i aint much in the habit of drinking at anybodys expense but my own habit
no returned the stranger but once and away and on a saturday night too
come
put a name to it mr gargery i wouldnt wish to be stiff company said joe
rum rum repeated the stranger
and will the other gentleman originate a sentiment rum said mr wopsle
three rums cried the stranger calling to the landlord
glasses round this other gentleman observed joe by way of introducing mr wopsle is a gentleman that you would like to hear give it out
our clerk at church aha said the stranger quickly and cocking his eye at me
the lonely church right out on the marshes with graves round it thats it said joe
the stranger with a comfortable kind of grunt over his pipe put his legs up on the settle that he had to himself
he wore a flapping broadbrimmed travellers hat and under it a handkerchief tied over his head in the manner of a cap so that he showed no hair
as he looked at the fire i thought i saw a cunning expression followed by a halflaugh come into his face
i am not acquainted with this country gentlemen but it seems a solitary country towards the river most marshes is solitary said joe
no doubt no doubt
do you find any gypsies now or tramps or vagrants of any sort out there no said joe none but a runaway convict now and then
and we dont find them easy
eh mr wopsle mr wopsle with a majestic remembrance of old discomfiture assented but not warmly
seems you have been out after such asked the stranger
once returned joe
not that we wanted to take them you understand we went out as lookers on me and mr wopsle and pip
didnt us pip yes joe the stranger looked at me againstill cocking his eye as if he were expressly taking aim at me with his invisible gunand said hes a likely young parcel of bones that
what is it you call him pip said joe
christened pip no not christened pip surname pip no said joe its a kind of family name what he gave himself when a infant and is called by son of yours well said joe meditatively not of course that it could be in anywise necessary to consider about it but because it was the way at the jolly bargemen to seem to consider deeply about everything that was discussed over pipeswellno
no he aint nevvy said the strange man
well said joe with the same appearance of profound cogitation he is notno not to deceive you he is notmy nevvy what the blue blazes is he asked the stranger
which appeared to me to be an inquiry of unnecessary strength
mr wopsle struck in upon that as one who knew all about relationships having professional occasion to bear in mind what female relations a man might not marry and expounded the ties between me and joe
having his hand in mr wopsle finished off with a most terrifically snarling passage from richard the third and seemed to think he had done quite enough to account for it when he added as the poet says and here i may remark that when mr wopsle referred to me he considered it a necessary part of such reference to rumple my hair and poke it into my eyes
i cannot conceive why everybody of his standing who visited at our house should always have put me through the same inflammatory process under similar circumstances
yet i do not call to mind that i was ever in my earlier youth the subject of remark in our social family circle but some largehanded person took some such ophthalmic steps to patronise me
all this while the strange man looked at nobody but me and looked at me as if he were determined to have a shot at me at last and bring me down
but he said nothing after offering his blue blazes observation until the glasses of rum and water were brought and then he made his shot and a most extraordinary shot it was
it was not a verbal remark but a proceeding in dumbshow and was pointedly addressed to me
he stirred his rum and water pointedly at me and he tasted his rum and water pointedly at me
and he stirred it and he tasted it not with a spoon that was brought to him but with a file
he did this so that nobody but i saw the file and when he had done it he wiped the file and put it in a breastpocket
i knew it to be joes file and i knew that he knew my convict the moment i saw the instrument
i sat gazing at him spellbound
but he now reclined on his settle taking very little notice of me and talking principally about turnips
there was a delicious sense of cleaningup and making a quiet pause before going on in life afresh in our village on saturday nights which stimulated joe to dare to stay out half an hour longer on saturdays than at other times
the halfhour and the rum and water running out together joe got up to go and took me by the hand
stop half a moment mr gargery said the strange man
i think ive got a bright new shilling somewhere in my pocket and if i have the boy shall have it he looked it out from a handful of small change folded it in some crumpled paper and gave it to me
yours said he
mind
your own i thanked him staring at him far beyond the bounds of good manners and holding tight to joe
he gave joe goodnight and he gave mr wopsle goodnight who went out with us and he gave me only a look with his aiming eyeno not a look for he shut it up but wonders may be done with an eye by hiding it
on the way home if i had been in a humour for talking the talk must have been all on my side for mr wopsle parted from us at the door of the jolly bargemen and joe went all the way home with his mouth wide open to rinse the rum out with as much air as possible
but i was in a manner stupefied by this turning up of my old misdeed and old acquaintance and could think of nothing else
my sister was not in a very bad temper when we presented ourselves in the kitchen and joe was encouraged by that unusual circumstance to tell her about the bright shilling
a bad un ill be bound said mrs joe triumphantly or he wouldnt have given it to the boy
lets look at it i took it out of the paper and it proved to be a good one
but whats this said mrs joe throwing down the shilling and catching up the paper
two onepound notes nothing less than two fat sweltering onepound notes that seemed to have been on terms of the warmest intimacy with all the cattlemarkets in the county
joe caught up his hat again and ran with them to the jolly bargemen to restore them to their owner
while he was gone i sat down on my usual stool and looked vacantly at my sister feeling pretty sure that the man would not be there
presently joe came back saying that the man was gone but that he joe had left word at the three jolly bargemen concerning the notes
then my sister sealed them up in a piece of paper and put them under some dried roseleaves in an ornamental teapot on the top of a press in the state parlour
there they remained a nightmare to me many and many a night and day
i had sadly broken sleep when i got to bed through thinking of the strange man taking aim at me with his invisible gun and of the guiltily coarse and common thing it was to be on secret terms of conspiracy with convictsa feature in my low career that i had previously forgotten
i was haunted by the file too
a dread possessed me that when i least expected it the file would reappear
i coaxed myself to sleep by thinking of miss havishams next wednesday and in my sleep i saw the file coming at me out of a door without seeing who held it and i screamed myself awake
chapter xi
at the appointed time i returned to miss havishams and my hesitating ring at the gate brought out estella
she locked it after admitting me as she had done before and again preceded me into the dark passage where her candle stood
she took no notice of me until she had the candle in her hand when she looked over her shoulder superciliously saying you are to come this way today and took me to quite another part of the house
the passage was a long one and seemed to pervade the whole square basement of the manor house
we traversed but one side of the square however and at the end of it she stopped and put her candle down and opened a door
here the daylight reappeared and i found myself in a small paved courtyard the opposite side of which was formed by a detached dwellinghouse that looked as if it had once belonged to the manager or head clerk of the extinct brewery
there was a clock in the outer wall of this house
like the clock in miss havishams room and like miss havishams watch it had stopped at twenty minutes to nine
we went in at the door which stood open and into a gloomy room with a low ceiling on the groundfloor at the back
there was some company in the room and estella said to me as she joined it you are to go and stand there boy till you are wanted there being the window i crossed to it and stood there in a very uncomfortable state of mind looking out
it opened to the ground and looked into a most miserable corner of the neglected garden upon a rank ruin of cabbagestalks and one boxtree that had been clipped round long ago like a pudding and had a new growth at the top of it out of shape and of a different colour as if that part of the pudding had stuck to the saucepan and got burnt
this was my homely thought as i contemplated the boxtree
there had been some light snow overnight and it lay nowhere else to my knowledge but it had not quite melted from the cold shadow of this bit of garden and the wind caught it up in little eddies and threw it at the window as if it pelted me for coming there
i divined that my coming had stopped conversation in the room and that its other occupants were looking at me
i could see nothing of the room except the shining of the fire in the windowglass but i stiffened in all my joints with the consciousness that i was under close inspection
there were three ladies in the room and one gentleman
before i had been standing at the window five minutes they somehow conveyed to me that they were all toadies and humbugs but that each of them pretended not to know that the others were toadies and humbugs because the admission that he or she did know it would have made him or her out to be a toady and humbug
they all had a listless and dreary air of waiting somebodys pleasure and the most talkative of the ladies had to speak quite rigidly to repress a yawn
this lady whose name was camilla very much reminded me of my sister with the difference that she was older and as i found when i caught sight of her of a blunter cast of features
indeed when i knew her better i began to think it was a mercy she had any features at all so very blank and high was the dead wall of her face
poor dear soul said this lady with an abruptness of manner quite my sisters
nobodys enemy but his own it would be much more commendable to be somebody elses enemy said the gentleman far more natural cousin raymond observed another lady we are to love our neighbour sarah pocket returned cousin raymond if a man is not his own neighbour who is miss pocket laughed and camilla laughed and said checking a yawn the idea but i thought they seemed to think it rather a good idea too
the other lady who had not spoken yet said gravely and emphatically very true poor soul camilla presently went on i knew they had all been looking at me in the mean time he is so very strange
would anyone believe that when toms wife died he actually could not be induced to see the importance of the childrens having the deepest of trimmings to their mourning
good lord says he camilla what can it signify so long as the poor bereaved little things are in black so like matthew
the idea good points in him good points in him said cousin raymond heaven forbid i should deny good points in him but he never had and he never will have any sense of the proprieties you know i was obliged said camillai was obliged to be firm
i said it will not do for the credit of the family i told him that without deep trimmings the family was disgraced
i cried about it from breakfast till dinner
i injured my digestion
and at last he flung out in his violent way and said with a d then do as you like thank goodness it will always be a consolation to me to know that i instantly went out in a pouring rain and bought the things he paid for them did he not asked estella
its not the question my dear child who paid for them returned camilla
i bought them
and i shall often think of that with peace when i wake up in the night the ringing of a distant bell combined with the echoing of some cry or call along the passage by which i had come interrupted the conversation and caused estella to say to me now boy on my turning round they all looked at me with the utmost contempt and as i went out i heard sarah pocket say well i am sure
what next and camilla add with indignation was there ever such a fancy
the idea as we were going with our candle along the dark passage estella stopped all of a sudden and facing round said in her taunting manner with her face quite close to mine well well miss i answered almost falling over her and checking myself
she stood looking at me and of course i stood looking at her
am i pretty yes i think you are very pretty am i insulting not so much so as you were last time said i
not so much so no she fired when she asked the last question and she slapped my face with such force as she had when i answered it
now said she
you little coarse monster what do you think of me now i shall not tell you because you are going to tell upstairs
is that it no said i thats not it why dont you cry again you little wretch because ill never cry for you again said i
which was i suppose as false a declaration as ever was made for i was inwardly crying for her then and i know what i know of the pain she cost me afterwards
we went on our way upstairs after this episode and as we were going up we met a gentleman groping his way down
whom have we here asked the gentleman stopping and looking at me
a boy said estella
he was a burly man of an exceedingly dark complexion with an exceedingly large head and a corresponding large hand
he took my chin in his large hand and turned up my face to have a look at me by the light of the candle
he was prematurely bald on the top of his head and had bushy black eyebrows that wouldnt lie down but stood up bristling
his eyes were set very deep in his head and were disagreeably sharp and suspicious
he had a large watchchain and strong black dots where his beard and whiskers would have been if he had let them
he was nothing to me and i could have had no foresight then that he ever would be anything to me but it happened that i had this opportunity of observing him well
boy of the neighbourhood
hey said he
yes sir said i
how do you come here miss havisham sent for me sir i explained
well
behave yourself
i have a pretty large experience of boys and youre a bad set of fellows
now mind said he biting the side of his great forefinger as he frowned at me you behave yourself with those words he released mewhich i was glad of for his hand smelt of scented soapand went his way downstairs
i wondered whether he could be a doctor but no i thought he couldnt be a doctor or he would have a quieter and more persuasive manner
there was not much time to consider the subject for we were soon in miss havishams room where she and everything else were just as i had left them
estella left me standing near the door and i stood there until miss havisham cast her eyes upon me from the dressingtable
so she said without being startled or surprised the days have worn away have they yes maam
today is there there there with the impatient movement of her fingers
i dont want to know
are you ready to play i was obliged to answer in some confusion i dont think i am maam not at cards again she demanded with a searching look
yes maam i could do that if i was wanted since this house strikes you old and grave boy said miss havisham impatiently and you are unwilling to play are you willing to work i could answer this inquiry with a better heart than i had been able to find for the other question and i said i was quite willing
then go into that opposite room said she pointing at the door behind me with her withered hand and wait there till i come i crossed the staircase landing and entered the room she indicated
from that room too the daylight was completely excluded and it had an airless smell that was oppressive
a fire had been lately kindled in the damp oldfashioned grate and it was more disposed to go out than to burn up and the reluctant smoke which hung in the room seemed colder than the clearer airlike our own marsh mist
certain wintry branches of candles on the high chimneypiece faintly lighted the chamber or it would be more expressive to say faintly troubled its darkness
it was spacious and i dare say had once been handsome but every discernible thing in it was covered with dust and mould and dropping to pieces
the most prominent object was a long table with a tablecloth spread on it as if a feast had been in preparation when the house and the clocks all stopped together
an epergne or centrepiece of some kind was in the middle of this cloth it was so heavily overhung with cobwebs that its form was quite undistinguishable and as i looked along the yellow expanse out of which i remember its seeming to grow like a black fungus i saw specklelegged spiders with blotchy bodies running home to it and running out from it as if some circumstances of the greatest public importance had just transpired in the spider community
i heard the mice too rattling behind the panels as if the same occurrence were important to their interests
but the black beetles took no notice of the agitation and groped about the hearth in a ponderous elderly way as if they were shortsighted and hard of hearing and not on terms with one another
these crawling things had fascinated my attention and i was watching them from a distance when miss havisham laid a hand upon my shoulder
in her other hand she had a crutchheaded stick on which she leaned and she looked like the witch of the place
this said she pointing to the long table with her stick is where i will be laid when i am dead
they shall come and look at me here with some vague misgiving that she might get upon the table then and there and die at once the complete realisation of the ghastly waxwork at the fair i shrank under her touch
what do you think that is she asked me again pointing with her stick that where those cobwebs are i cant guess what it is maam its a great cake
a bridecake
mine she looked all round the room in a glaring manner and then said leaning on me while her hand twitched my shoulder come come come
walk me walk me i made out from this that the work i had to do was to walk miss havisham round and round the room
accordingly i started at once and she leaned upon my shoulder and we went away at a pace that might have been an imitation founded on my first impulse under that roof of mr pumblechooks chaisecart
she was not physically strong and after a little time said slower still we went at an impatient fitful speed and as we went she twitched the hand upon my shoulder and worked her mouth and led me to believe that we were going fast because her thoughts went fast
after a while she said call estella so i went out on the landing and roared that name as i had done on the previous occasion
when her light appeared i returned to miss havisham and we started away again round and round the room
if only estella had come to be a spectator of our proceedings i should have felt sufficiently discontented but as she brought with her the three ladies and the gentleman whom i had seen below i didnt know what to do
in my politeness i would have stopped but miss havisham twitched my shoulder and we posted onwith a shamefaced consciousness on my part that they would think it was all my doing
dear miss havisham said miss sarah pocket
how well you look i do not returned miss havisham
i am yellow skin and bone camilla brightened when miss pocket met with this rebuff and she murmured as she plaintively contemplated miss havisham poor dear soul
certainly not to be expected to look well poor thing
the idea and how are you said miss havisham to camilla
as we were close to camilla then i would have stopped as a matter of course only miss havisham wouldnt stop
we swept on and i felt that i was highly obnoxious to camilla
thank you miss havisham she returned i am as well as can be expected why whats the matter with you asked miss havisham with exceeding sharpness
nothing worth mentioning replied camilla
i dont wish to make a display of my feelings but i have habitually thought of you more in the night than i am quite equal to then dont think of me retorted miss havisham
very easily said remarked camilla amiably repressing a sob while a hitch came into her upper lip and her tears overflowed
raymond is a witness what ginger and sal volatile i am obliged to take in the night
raymond is a witness what nervous jerkings i have in my legs
chokings and nervous jerkings however are nothing new to me when i think with anxiety of those i love
if i could be less affectionate and sensitive i should have a better digestion and an iron set of nerves
i am sure i wish it could be so
but as to not thinking of you in the nightthe idea here a burst of tears
the raymond referred to i understood to be the gentleman present and him i understood to be mr camilla
he came to the rescue at this point and said in a consolatory and complimentary voice camilla my dear it is well known that your family feelings are gradually undermining you to the extent of making one of your legs shorter than the other i am not aware observed the grave lady whose voice i had heard but once that to think of any person is to make a great claim upon that person my dear miss sarah pocket whom i now saw to be a little dry brown corrugated old woman with a small face that might have been made of walnutshells and a large mouth like a cats without the whiskers supported this position by saying no indeed my dear
hem thinking is easy enough said the grave lady
what is easier you know assented miss sarah pocket
oh yes yes cried camilla whose fermenting feelings appeared to rise from her legs to her bosom
its all very true
its a weakness to be so affectionate but i cant help it
no doubt my health would be much better if it was otherwise still i wouldnt change my disposition if i could
its the cause of much suffering but its a consolation to know i posses it when i wake up in the night here another burst of feeling
miss havisham and i had never stopped all this time but kept going round and round the room now brushing against the skirts of the visitors now giving them the whole length of the dismal chamber
theres matthew said camilla
never mixing with any natural ties never coming here to see how miss havisham is
i have taken to the sofa with my staylace cut and have lain there hours insensible with my head over the side and my hair all down and my feet i dont know where much higher than your head my love said mr
camilla
i have gone off into that state hours and hours on account of matthews strange and inexplicable conduct and nobody has thanked me really i must say i should think not interposed the grave lady
you see my dear added miss sarah pocket a blandly vicious personage the question to put to yourself is who did you expect to thank you my love without expecting any thanks or anything of the sort resumed camilla i have remained in that state hours and hours and raymond is a witness of the extent to which i have choked and what the total inefficacy of ginger has been and i have been heard at the pianoforte tuners across the street where the poor mistaken children have even supposed it to be pigeons cooing at a distanceand now to be told here camilla put her hand to her throat and began to be quite chemical as to the formation of new combinations there
when this same matthew was mentioned miss havisham stopped me and herself and stood looking at the speaker
this change had a great influence in bringing camillas chemistry to a sudden end
matthew will come and see me at last said miss havisham sternly when i am laid on that table
that will be his placethere striking the table with her stick at my head
and yours will be there
and your husbands there
and sarah pockets there
and georgianas there
now you all know where to take your stations when you come to feast upon me
and now go at the mention of each name she had struck the table with her stick in a new place
she now said walk me walk me and we went on again
i suppose theres nothing to be done exclaimed camilla but comply and depart
its something to have seen the object of ones love and duty for even so short a time
i shall think of it with a melancholy satisfaction when i wake up in the night
i wish matthew could have that comfort but he sets it at defiance
i am determined not to make a display of my feelings but its very hard to be told one wants to feast on ones relationsas if one was a giantand to be told to go
the bare idea mr camilla interposing as mrs camilla laid her hand upon her heaving bosom that lady assumed an unnatural fortitude of manner which i supposed to be expressive of an intention to drop and choke when out of view and kissing her hand to miss havisham was escorted forth
sarah pocket and georgiana contended who should remain last but sarah was too knowing to be outdone and ambled round georgiana with that artful slipperiness that the latter was obliged to take precedence
sarah pocket then made her separate effect of departing with bless you miss havisham dear and with a smile of forgiving pity on her walnutshell countenance for the weaknesses of the rest
while estella was away lighting them down miss havisham still walked with her hand on my shoulder but more and more slowly
at last she stopped before the fire and said after muttering and looking at it some seconds this is my birthday pip i was going to wish her many happy returns when she lifted her stick
i dont suffer it to be spoken of
i dont suffer those who were here just now or any one to speak of it
they come here on the day but they dare not refer to it of course i made no further effort to refer to it
on this day of the year long before you were born this heap of decay stabbing with her crutched stick at the pile of cobwebs on the table but not touching it was brought here
it and i have worn away together
the mice have gnawed at it and sharper teeth than teeth of mice have gnawed at me she held the head of her stick against her heart as she stood looking at the table she in her once white dress all yellow and withered the once white cloth all yellow and withered everything around in a state to crumble under a touch
when the ruin is complete said she with a ghastly look and when they lay me dead in my brides dress on the brides tablewhich shall be done and which will be the finished curse upon himso much the better if it is done on this day she stood looking at the table as if she stood looking at her own figure lying there
i remained quiet
estella returned and she too remained quiet
it seemed to me that we continued thus for a long time
in the heavy air of the room and the heavy darkness that brooded in its remoter corners i even had an alarming fancy that estella and i might presently begin to decay
at length not coming out of her distraught state by degrees but in an instant miss havisham said let me see you two play cards why have you not begun with that we returned to her room and sat down as before i was beggared as before and again as before miss havisham watched us all the time directed my attention to estellas beauty and made me notice it the more by trying her jewels on estellas breast and hair
estella for her part likewise treated me as before except that she did not condescend to speak
when we had played some halfdozen games a day was appointed for my return and i was taken down into the yard to be fed in the former doglike manner
there too i was again left to wander about as i liked
it is not much to the purpose whether a gate in that garden wall which i had scrambled up to peep over on the last occasion was on that last occasion open or shut
enough that i saw no gate then and that i saw one now
as it stood open and as i knew that estella had let the visitors outfor she had returned with the keys in her handi strolled into the garden and strolled all over it
it was quite a wilderness and there were old melonframes and cucumberframes in it which seemed in their decline to have produced a spontaneous growth of weak attempts at pieces of old hats and boots with now and then a weedy offshoot into the likeness of a battered saucepan
when i had exhausted the garden and a greenhouse with nothing in it but a fallendown grapevine and some bottles i found myself in the dismal corner upon which i had looked out of the window
never questioning for a moment that the house was now empty i looked in at another window and found myself to my great surprise exchanging a broad stare with a pale young gentleman with red eyelids and light hair
this pale young gentleman quickly disappeared and reappeared beside me
he had been at his books when i had found myself staring at him and i now saw that he was inky
halloa said he young fellow halloa being a general observation which i had usually observed to be best answered by itself i said halloa politely omitting young fellow
who let you in said he
miss estella who gave you leave to prowl about miss estella come and fight said the pale young gentleman
what could i do but follow him
i have often asked myself the question since but what else could i do
his manner was so final and i was so astonished that i followed where he led as if i had been under a spell
stop a minute though he said wheeling round before we had gone many paces
i ought to give you a reason for fighting too
there it is in a most irritating manner he instantly slapped his hands against one another daintily flung one of his legs up behind him pulled my hair slapped his hands again dipped his head and butted it into my stomach
the bulllike proceeding last mentioned besides that it was unquestionably to be regarded in the light of a liberty was particularly disagreeable just after bread and meat
i therefore hit out at him and was going to hit out again when he said aha
would you and began dancing backwards and forwards in a manner quite unparalleled within my limited experience
laws of the game said he
here he skipped from his left leg on to his right
regular rules here he skipped from his right leg on to his left
come to the ground and go through the preliminaries here he dodged backwards and forwards and did all sorts of things while i looked helplessly at him
i was secretly afraid of him when i saw him so dexterous but i felt morally and physically convinced that his light head of hair could have had no business in the pit of my stomach and that i had a right to consider it irrelevant when so obtruded on my attention
therefore i followed him without a word to a retired nook of the garden formed by the junction of two walls and screened by some rubbish
on his asking me if i was satisfied with the ground and on my replying yes he begged my leave to absent himself for a moment and quickly returned with a bottle of water and a sponge dipped in vinegar
available for both he said placing these against the wall
and then fell to pulling off not only his jacket and waistcoat but his shirt too in a manner at once lighthearted businesslike and bloodthirsty
although he did not look very healthyhaving pimples on his face and a breaking out at his mouththese dreadful preparations quite appalled me
i judged him to be about my own age but he was much taller and he had a way of spinning himself about that was full of appearance
for the rest he was a young gentleman in a grey suit when not denuded for battle with his elbows knees wrists and heels considerably in advance of the rest of him as to development
my heart failed me when i saw him squaring at me with every demonstration of mechanical nicety and eyeing my anatomy as if he were minutely choosing his bone
i never have been so surprised in my life as i was when i let out the first blow and saw him lying on his back looking up at me with a bloody nose and his face exceedingly foreshortened
but he was on his feet directly and after sponging himself with a great show of dexterity began squaring again
the second greatest surprise i have ever had in my life was seeing him on his back again looking up at me out of a black eye
his spirit inspired me with great respect
he seemed to have no strength and he never once hit me hard and he was always knocked down but he would be up again in a moment sponging himself or drinking out of the waterbottle with the greatest satisfaction in seconding himself according to form and then came at me with an air and a show that made me believe he really was going to do for me at last
he got heavily bruised for i am sorry to record that the more i hit him the harder i hit him but he came up again and again and again until at last he got a bad fall with the back of his head against the wall
even after that crisis in our affairs he got up and turned round and round confusedly a few times not knowing where i was but finally went on his knees to his sponge and threw it up at the same time panting out that means you have won he seemed so brave and innocent that although i had not proposed the contest i felt but a gloomy satisfaction in my victory
indeed i go so far as to hope that i regarded myself while dressing as a species of savage young wolf or other wild beast
however i got dressed darkly wiping my sanguinary face at intervals and i said can i help you and he said no thankee and i said good afternoon and he said same to you when i got into the courtyard i found estella waiting with the keys
but she neither asked me where i had been nor why i had kept her waiting and there was a bright flush upon her face as though something had happened to delight her
instead of going straight to the gate too she stepped back into the passage and beckoned me
come here
you may kiss me if you like i kissed her cheek as she turned it to me
i think i would have gone through a great deal to kiss her cheek
but i felt that the kiss was given to the coarse common boy as a piece of money might have been and that it was worth nothing
what with the birthday visitors and what with the cards and what with the fight my stay had lasted so long that when i neared home the light on the spit of sand off the point on the marshes was gleaming against a black nightsky and joes furnace was flinging a path of fire across the road
chapter xii
my mind grew very uneasy on the subject of the pale young gentleman
the more i thought of the fight and recalled the pale young gentleman on his back in various stages of puffy and incrimsoned countenance the more certain it appeared that something would be done to me
i felt that the pale young gentlemans blood was on my head and that the law would avenge it
without having any definite idea of the penalties i had incurred it was clear to me that village boys could not go stalking about the country ravaging the houses of gentlefolks and pitching into the studious youth of england without laying themselves open to severe punishment
for some days i even kept close at home and looked out at the kitchen door with the greatest caution and trepidation before going on an errand lest the officers of the county jail should pounce upon me
the pale young gentlemans nose had stained my trousers and i tried to wash out that evidence of my guilt in the dead of night
i had cut my knuckles against the pale young gentlemans teeth and i twisted my imagination into a thousand tangles as i devised incredible ways of accounting for that damnatory circumstance when i should be haled before the judges
when the day came round for my return to the scene of the deed of violence my terrors reached their height
whether myrmidons of justice especially sent down from london would be lying in ambush behind the gatewhether miss havisham preferring to take personal vengeance for an outrage done to her house might rise in those graveclothes of hers draw a pistol and shoot me deadwhether suborned boysa numerous band of mercenariesmight be engaged to fall upon me in the brewery and cuff me until i was no moreit was high testimony to my confidence in the spirit of the pale young gentleman that i never imagined him accessory to these retaliations they always came into my mind as the acts of injudicious relatives of his goaded on by the state of his visage and an indignant sympathy with the family features
however go to miss havishams i must and go i did
and behold
nothing came of the late struggle
it was not alluded to in any way and no pale young gentleman was to be discovered on the premises
i found the same gate open and i explored the garden and even looked in at the windows of the detached house but my view was suddenly stopped by the closed shutters within and all was lifeless
only in the corner where the combat had taken place could i detect any evidence of the young gentlemans existence
there were traces of his gore in that spot and i covered them with gardenmould from the eye of man
on the broad landing between miss havishams own room and that other room in which the long table was laid out i saw a gardenchaira light chair on wheels that you pushed from behind
it had been placed there since my last visit and i entered that same day on a regular occupation of pushing miss havisham in this chair when she was tired of walking with her hand upon my shoulder round her own room and across the landing and round the other room
over and over and over again we would make these journeys and sometimes they would last as long as three hours at a stretch
i insensibly fall into a general mention of these journeys as numerous because it was at once settled that i should return every alternate day at noon for these purposes and because i am now going to sum up a period of at least eight or ten months
as we began to be more used to one another miss havisham talked more to me and asked me such questions as what had i learnt and what was i going to be
i told her i was going to be apprenticed to joe i believed and i enlarged upon my knowing nothing and wanting to know everything in the hope that she might offer some help towards that desirable end
but she did not on the contrary she seemed to prefer my being ignorant
neither did she ever give me any moneyor anything but my daily dinnernor ever stipulate that i should be paid for my services
estella was always about and always let me in and out but never told me i might kiss her again
sometimes she would coldly tolerate me sometimes she would condescend to me sometimes she would be quite familiar with me sometimes she would tell me energetically that she hated me
miss havisham would often ask me in a whisper or when we were alone does she grow prettier and prettier pip and when i said yes for indeed she did would seem to enjoy it greedily
also when we played at cards miss havisham would look on with a miserly relish of estellas moods whatever they were
and sometimes when her moods were so many and so contradictory of one another that i was puzzled what to say or do miss havisham would embrace her with lavish fondness murmuring something in her ear that sounded like break their hearts my pride and hope break their hearts and have no mercy there was a song joe used to hum fragments of at the forge of which the burden was old clem
this was not a very ceremonious way of rendering homage to a patron saint but i believe old clem stood in that relation towards smiths
it was a song that imitated the measure of beating upon iron and was a mere lyrical excuse for the introduction of old clems respected name
thus you were to hammer boys roundold clem
with a thump and a soundold clem
beat it out beat it outold clem
with a clink for the stoutold clem
blow the fire blow the fireold clem
roaring dryer soaring higherold clem
one day soon after the appearance of the chair miss havisham suddenly saying to me with the impatient movement of her fingers there there there
sing i was surprised into crooning this ditty as i pushed her over the floor
it happened so to catch her fancy that she took it up in a low brooding voice as if she were singing in her sleep
after that it became customary with us to have it as we moved about and estella would often join in though the whole strain was so subdued even when there were three of us that it made less noise in the grim old house than the lightest breath of wind
what could i become with these surroundings
how could my character fail to be influenced by them
is it to be wondered at if my thoughts were dazed as my eyes were when i came out into the natural light from the misty yellow rooms
perhaps i might have told joe about the pale young gentleman if i had not previously been betrayed into those enormous inventions to which i had confessed
under the circumstances i felt that joe could hardly fail to discern in the pale young gentleman an appropriate passenger to be put into the black velvet coach therefore i said nothing of him
besides that shrinking from having miss havisham and estella discussed which had come upon me in the beginning grew much more potent as time went on
i reposed complete confidence in no one but biddy but i told poor biddy everything
why it came natural to me to do so and why biddy had a deep concern in everything i told her i did not know then though i think i know now
meanwhile councils went on in the kitchen at home fraught with almost insupportable aggravation to my exasperated spirit
that ass pumblechook used often to come over of a night for the purpose of discussing my prospects with my sister and i really do believe to this hour with less penitence than i ought to feel that if these hands could have taken a linchpin out of his chaisecart they would have done it
the miserable man was a man of that confined stolidity of mind that he could not discuss my prospects without having me before himas it were to operate uponand he would drag me up from my stool usually by the collar where i was quiet in a corner and putting me before the fire as if i were going to be cooked would begin by saying now mum here is this boy
here is this boy which you brought up by hand
hold up your head boy and be forever grateful unto them which so did do
now mum with respections to this boy and then he would rumple my hair the wrong waywhich from my earliest remembrance as already hinted i have in my soul denied the right of any fellowcreature to doand would hold me before him by the sleevea spectacle of imbecility only to be equalled by himself
then he and my sister would pair off in such nonsensical speculations about miss havisham and about what she would do with me and for me that i used to wantquite painfullyto burst into spiteful tears fly at pumblechook and pummel him all over
in these dialogues my sister spoke to me as if she were morally wrenching one of my teeth out at every reference while pumblechook himself selfconstituted my patron would sit supervising me with a depreciatory eye like the architect of my fortunes who thought himself engaged on a very unremunerative job
in these discussions joe bore no part
but he was often talked at while they were in progress by reason of mrs joes perceiving that he was not favourable to my being taken from the forge
i was fully old enough now to be apprenticed to joe and when joe sat with the poker on his knees thoughtfully raking out the ashes between the lower bars my sister would so distinctly construe that innocent action into opposition on his part that she would dive at him take the poker out of his hands shake him and put it away
there was a most irritating end to every one of these debates
all in a moment with nothing to lead up to it my sister would stop herself in a yawn and catching sight of me as it were incidentally would swoop upon me with come
theres enough of you
you get along to bed youve given trouble enough for one night i hope as if i had besought them as a favour to bother my life out
we went on in this way for a long time and it seemed likely that we should continue to go on in this way for a long time when one day miss havisham stopped short as she and i were walking she leaning on my shoulder and said with some displeasure you are growing tall pip i thought it best to hint through the medium of a meditative look that this might be occasioned by circumstances over which i had no control
she said no more at the time but she presently stopped and looked at me again and presently again and after that looked frowning and moody
on the next day of my attendance when our usual exercise was over and i had landed her at her dressingtable she stayed me with a movement of her impatient fingers tell me the name again of that blacksmith of yours joe gargery maam meaning the master you were to be apprenticed to yes miss havisham you had better be apprenticed at once
would gargery come here with you and bring your indentures do you think i signified that i had no doubt he would take it as an honour to be asked
then let him come at any particular time miss havisham there there
i know nothing about times
let him come soon and come along with you when i got home at night and delivered this message for joe my sister went on the rampage in a more alarming degree than at any previous period
she asked me and joe whether we supposed she was doormats under our feet and how we dared to use her so and what company we graciously thought she was fit for
when she had exhausted a torrent of such inquiries she threw a candlestick at joe burst into a loud sobbing got out the dustpanwhich was always a very bad signput on her coarse apron and began cleaning up to a terrible extent
not satisfied with a dry cleaning she took to a pail and scrubbingbrush and cleaned us out of house and home so that we stood shivering in the backyard
it was ten oclock at night before we ventured to creep in again and then she asked joe why he hadnt married a negress slave at once
joe offered no answer poor fellow but stood feeling his whisker and looking dejectedly at me as if he thought it really might have been a better speculation
chapter xiii
it was a trial to my feelings on the next day but one to see joe arraying himself in his sunday clothes to accompany me to miss havishams
however as he thought his courtsuit necessary to the occasion it was not for me to tell him that he looked far better in his workingdress the rather because i knew he made himself so dreadfully uncomfortable entirely on my account and that it was for me he pulled up his shirtcollar so very high behind that it made the hair on the crown of his head stand up like a tuft of feathers
at breakfasttime my sister declared her intention of going to town with us and being left at uncle pumblechooks and called for when we had done with our fine ladiesa way of putting the case from which joe appeared inclined to augur the worst
the forge was shut up for the day and joe inscribed in chalk upon the door as it was his custom to do on the very rare occasions when he was not at work the monosyllable hout accompanied by a sketch of an arrow supposed to be flying in the direction he had taken
we walked to town my sister leading the way in a very large beaver bonnet and carrying a basket like the great seal of england in plaited straw a pair of pattens a spare shawl and an umbrella though it was a fine bright day
i am not quite clear whether these articles were carried penitentially or ostentatiously but i rather think they were displayed as articles of propertymuch as cleopatra or any other sovereign lady on the rampage might exhibit her wealth in a pageant or procession
when we came to pumblechooks my sister bounced in and left us
as it was almost noon joe and i held straight on to miss havishams house
estella opened the gate as usual and the moment she appeared joe took his hat off and stood weighing it by the brim in both his hands as if he had some urgent reason in his mind for being particular to half a quarter of an ounce
estella took no notice of either of us but led us the way that i knew so well
i followed next to her and joe came last
when i looked back at joe in the long passage he was still weighing his hat with the greatest care and was coming after us in long strides on the tips of his toes
estella told me we were both to go in so i took joe by the coatcuff and conducted him into miss havishams presence
she was seated at her dressingtable and looked round at us immediately
oh said she to joe
you are the husband of the sister of this boy i could hardly have imagined dear old joe looking so unlike himself or so like some extraordinary bird standing as he did speechless with his tuft of feathers ruffled and his mouth open as if he wanted a worm
you are the husband repeated miss havisham of the sister of this boy it was very aggravating but throughout the interview joe persisted in addressing me instead of miss havisham
which i meantersay pip joe now observed in a manner that was at once expressive of forcible argumentation strict confidence and great politeness as i hup and married your sister and i were at the time what you might call if you was anyways inclined a single man well said miss havisham
and you have reared the boy with the intention of taking him for your apprentice is that so mr gargery you know pip replied joe as you and me were ever friends and it were looked forard to betwixt us as being calclated to lead to larks
not but what pip if you had ever made objections to the businesssuch as its being open to black and sut or suchlikenot but what they would have been attended to dont you see has the boy said miss havisham ever made any objection
does he like the trade which it is well beknown to yourself pip returned joe strengthening his former mixture of argumentation confidence and politeness that it were the wish of your own hart i saw the idea suddenly break upon him that he would adapt his epitaph to the occasion before he went on to say and there werent no objection on your part and pip it were the great wish of your hart it was quite in vain for me to endeavour to make him sensible that he ought to speak to miss havisham
the more i made faces and gestures to him to do it the more confidential argumentative and polite he persisted in being to me
have you brought his indentures with you asked miss havisham
well pip you know replied joe as if that were a little unreasonable you yourself see me put em in my at and therefore you know as they are here with which he took them out and gave them not to miss havisham but to me
i am afraid i was ashamed of the dear good fellowi know i was ashamed of himwhen i saw that estella stood at the back of miss havishams chair and that her eyes laughed mischievously
i took the indentures out of his hand and gave them to miss havisham
you expected said miss havisham as she looked them over no premium with the boy joe i remonstrated for he made no reply at all
why dont you answer pip returned joe cutting me short as if he were hurt which i meantersay that were not a question requiring a answer betwixt yourself and me and which you know the answer to be full well no
you know it to be no pip and wherefore should i say it miss havisham glanced at him as if she understood what he really was better than i had thought possible seeing what he was there and took up a little bag from the table beside her
pip has earned a premium here she said and here it is
there are fiveandtwenty guineas in this bag
give it to your master pip as if he were absolutely out of his mind with the wonder awakened in him by her strange figure and the strange room joe even at this pass persisted in addressing me
this is wery liberal on your part pip said joe and it is as such received and grateful welcome though never looked for far nor near nor nowheres
and now old chap said joe conveying to me a sensation first of burning and then of freezing for i felt as if that familiar expression were applied to miss havishamand now old chap may we do our duty
may you and me do our duty both on us by one and another and by them which your liberal presenthaveconweyedto befor the satisfaction of mindofthem as never here joe showed that he felt he had fallen into frightful difficulties until he triumphantly rescued himself with the words and from myself far be it these words had such a round and convincing sound for him that he said them twice
goodbye pip said miss havisham
let them out estella am i to come again miss havisham i asked
no
gargery is your master now
gargery
one word thus calling him back as i went out of the door i heard her say to joe in a distinct emphatic voice the boy has been a good boy here and that is his reward
of course as an honest man you will expect no other and no more how joe got out of the room i have never been able to determine but i know that when he did get out he was steadily proceeding upstairs instead of coming down and was deaf to all remonstrances until i went after him and laid hold of him
in another minute we were outside the gate and it was locked and estella was gone
when we stood in the daylight alone again joe backed up against a wall and said to me astonishing and there he remained so long saying astonishing at intervals so often that i began to think his senses were never coming back
at length he prolonged his remark into pip i do assure you this is astonishing and so by degrees became conversational and able to walk away
i have reason to think that joes intellects were brightened by the encounter they had passed through and that on our way to pumblechooks he invented a subtle and deep design
my reason is to be found in what took place in mr pumblechooks parlour where on our presenting ourselves my sister sat in conference with that detested seedsman
well cried my sister addressing us both at once
and whats happened to you
i wonder you condescend to come back to such poor society as this i am sure i do miss havisham said joe with a fixed look at me like an effort of remembrance made it wery partickler that we should give herwere it compliments or respects pip compliments i said
which that were my own belief answered joe her compliments to mrs j gargery much good theyll do me observed my sister but rather gratified too
and wishing pursued joe with another fixed look at me like another effort of remembrance that the state of miss havishams elth were sitch as would haveallowed were it pip of her having the pleasure i added
of ladies company said joe
and drew a long breath
well cried my sister with a mollified glance at mr pumblechook
she might have had the politeness to send that message at first but its better late than never
and what did she give young rantipole here she giv him said joe nothing mrs joe was going to break out but joe went on
what she giv said joe she giv to his friends
and by his friends were her explanation i mean into the hands of his sister mrs j gargery them were her words mrs
j gargery she maynt have knowd added joe with an appearance of reflection whether it were joe or jorge my sister looked at pumblechook who smoothed the elbows of his wooden armchair and nodded at her and at the fire as if he had known all about it beforehand
and how much have you got asked my sister laughing
positively laughing
what would present company say to ten pound demanded joe
theyd say returned my sister curtly pretty well
not too much but pretty well its more than that then said joe
that fearful impostor pumblechook immediately nodded and said as he rubbed the arms of his chair its more than that mum why you dont mean to say began my sister
yes i do mum said pumblechook but wait a bit
go on joseph
good in you
go on what would present company say proceeded joe to twenty pound handsome would be the word returned my sister
well then said joe its more than twenty pound that abject hypocrite pumblechook nodded again and said with a patronizing laugh its more than that mum
good again
follow her up joseph then to make an end of it said joe delightedly handing the bag to my sister its fiveandtwenty pound its fiveandtwenty pound mum echoed that basest of swindlers pumblechook rising to shake hands with her and its no more than your merits as i said when my opinion was asked and i wish you joy of the money if the villain had stopped here his case would have been sufficiently awful but he blackened his guilt by proceeding to take me into custody with a right of patronage that left all his former criminality far behind
now you see joseph and wife said pumblechook as he took me by the arm above the elbow i am one of them that always go right through with what theyve begun
this boy must be bound out of hand
thats my way
bound out of hand goodness knows uncle pumblechook said my sister grasping the money were deeply beholden to you never mind me mum returned that diabolical cornchandler
a pleasures a pleasure all the world over
but this boy you know we must have him bound
i said id see to itto tell you the truth the justices were sitting in the town hall near at hand and we at once went over to have me bound apprentice to joe in the magisterial presence
i say we went over but i was pushed over by pumblechook exactly as if i had that moment picked a pocket or fired a rick indeed it was the general impression in court that i had been taken redhanded for as pumblechook shoved me before him through the crowd i heard some people say whats he done and others hes a young un too but looks bad dont he one person of mild and benevolent aspect even gave me a tract ornamented with a woodcut of a malevolent young man fitted up with a perfect sausageshop of fetters and entitled to be read in my cell
the hall was a queer place i thought with higher pews in it than a churchand with people hanging over the pews looking onand with mighty justices one with a powdered head leaning back in chairs with folded arms or taking snuff or going to sleep or writing or reading the newspapersand with some shining black portraits on the walls which my unartistic eye regarded as a composition of hardbake and stickingplaster
here in a corner my indentures were duly signed and attested and i was bound mr pumblechook holding me all the while as if we had looked in on our way to the scaffold to have those little preliminaries disposed of
when we had come out again and had got rid of the boys who had been put into great spirits by the expectation of seeing me publicly tortured and who were much disappointed to find that my friends were merely rallying round me we went back to pumblechooks
and there my sister became so excited by the twentyfive guineas that nothing would serve her but we must have a dinner out of that windfall at the blue boar and that pumblechook must go over in his chaisecart and bring the hubbles and mr wopsle
it was agreed to be done and a most melancholy day i passed
for it inscrutably appeared to stand to reason in the minds of the whole company that i was an excrescence on the entertainment
and to make it worse they all asked me from time to timein short whenever they had nothing else to dowhy i didnt enjoy myself
and what could i possibly do then but say i was enjoying myselfwhen i wasnt
however they were grown up and had their own way and they made the most of it
that swindling pumblechook exalted into the beneficent contriver of the whole occasion actually took the top of the table and when he addressed them on the subject of my being bound and had fiendishly congratulated them on my being liable to imprisonment if i played at cards drank strong liquors kept late hours or bad company or indulged in other vagaries which the form of my indentures appeared to contemplate as next to inevitable he placed me standing on a chair beside him to illustrate his remarks
my only other remembrances of the great festival are that they wouldnt let me go to sleep but whenever they saw me dropping off woke me up and told me to enjoy myself
that rather late in the evening mr wopsle gave us collinss ode and threw his bloodstained sword in thunder down with such effect that a waiter came in and said the commercials underneath sent up their compliments and it wasnt the tumblers arms that they were all in excellent spirits on the road home and sang o lady fair
mr wopsle taking the bass and asserting with a tremendously strong voice in reply to the inquisitive bore who leads that piece of music in a most impertinent manner by wanting to know all about everybodys private affairs that he was the man with his white locks flowing and that he was upon the whole the weakest pilgrim going
finally i remember that when i got into my little bedroom i was truly wretched and had a strong conviction on me that i should never like joes trade
i had liked it once but once was not now
chapter xiv
it is a most miserable thing to feel ashamed of home
there may be black ingratitude in the thing and the punishment may be retributive and well deserved but that it is a miserable thing i can testify
home had never been a very pleasant place to me because of my sisters temper
but joe had sanctified it and i had believed in it
i had believed in the best parlour as a most elegant saloon i had believed in the front door as a mysterious portal of the temple of state whose solemn opening was attended with a sacrifice of roast fowls i had believed in the kitchen as a chaste though not magnificent apartment i had believed in the forge as the glowing road to manhood and independence
within a single year all this was changed
now it was all coarse and common and i would not have had miss havisham and estella see it on any account
how much of my ungracious condition of mind may have been my own fault how much miss havishams how much my sisters is now of no moment to me or to any one
the change was made in me the thing was done
well or ill done excusably or inexcusably it was done
once it had seemed to me that when i should at last roll up my shirtsleeves and go into the forge joes prentice i should be distinguished and happy
now the reality was in my hold i only felt that i was dusty with the dust of smallcoal and that i had a weight upon my daily remembrance to which the anvil was a feather
there have been occasions in my later life i suppose as in most lives when i have felt for a time as if a thick curtain had fallen on all its interest and romance to shut me out from anything save dull endurance any more
never has that curtain dropped so heavy and blank as when my way in life lay stretched out straight before me through the newly entered road of apprenticeship to joe
i remember that at a later period of my time i used to stand about the churchyard on sunday evenings when night was falling comparing my own perspective with the windy marsh view and making out some likeness between them by thinking how flat and low both were and how on both there came an unknown way and a dark mist and then the sea
i was quite as dejected on the first workingday of my apprenticeship as in that aftertime but i am glad to know that i never breathed a murmur to joe while my indentures lasted
it is about the only thing i am glad to know of myself in that connection
for though it includes what i proceed to add all the merit of what i proceed to add was joes
it was not because i was faithful but because joe was faithful that i never ran away and went for a soldier or a sailor
it was not because i had a strong sense of the virtue of industry but because joe had a strong sense of the virtue of industry that i worked with tolerable zeal against the grain
it is not possible to know how far the influence of any amiable honesthearted dutydoing man flies out into the world but it is very possible to know how it has touched ones self in going by and i know right well that any good that intermixed itself with my apprenticeship came of plain contented joe and not of restlessly aspiring discontented me
what i wanted who can say
how can i say when i never knew
what i dreaded was that in some unlucky hour i being at my grimiest and commonest should lift up my eyes and see estella looking in at one of the wooden windows of the forge
i was haunted by the fear that she would sooner or later find me out with a black face and hands doing the coarsest part of my work and would exult over me and despise me
often after dark when i was pulling the bellows for joe and we were singing old clem and when the thought how we used to sing it at miss havishams would seem to show me estellas face in the fire with her pretty hair fluttering in the wind and her eyes scorning meoften at such a time i would look towards those panels of black night in the wall which the wooden windows then were and would fancy that i saw her just drawing her face away and would believe that she had come at last
after that when we went in to supper the place and the meal would have a more homely look than ever and i would feel more ashamed of home than ever in my own ungracious breast
chapter xv
as i was getting too big for mr wopsles greataunts room my education under that preposterous female terminated
not however until biddy had imparted to me everything she knew from the little catalogue of prices to a comic song she had once bought for a halfpenny
although the only coherent part of the latter piece of literature were the opening lines when i went to lunnon town sirs too rul loo rul too rul loo rul wasnt i done very brown sirs
too rul loo rul too rul loo rul still in my desire to be wiser i got this composition by heart with the utmost gravity nor do i recollect that i questioned its merit except that i thought as i still do the amount of too rul somewhat in excess of the poetry
in my hunger for information i made proposals to mr wopsle to bestow some intellectual crumbs upon me with which he kindly complied
as it turned out however that he only wanted me for a dramatic layfigure to be contradicted and embraced and wept over and bullied and clutched and stabbed and knocked about in a variety of ways i soon declined that course of instruction though not until mr wopsle in his poetic fury had severely mauled me
whatever i acquired i tried to impart to joe
this statement sounds so well that i cannot in my conscience let it pass unexplained
i wanted to make joe less ignorant and common that he might be worthier of my society and less open to estellas reproach
the old battery out on the marshes was our place of study and a broken slate and a short piece of slatepencil were our educational implements to which joe always added a pipe of tobacco
i never knew joe to remember anything from one sunday to another or to acquire under my tuition any piece of information whatever
yet he would smoke his pipe at the battery with a far more sagacious air than anywhere elseeven with a learned airas if he considered himself to be advancing immensely
dear fellow i hope he did
it was pleasant and quiet out there with the sails on the river passing beyond the earthwork and sometimes when the tide was low looking as if they belonged to sunken ships that were still sailing on at the bottom of the water
whenever i watched the vessels standing out to sea with their white sails spread i somehow thought of miss havisham and estella and whenever the light struck aslant afar off upon a cloud or sail or green hillside or waterline it was just the samemiss havisham and estella and the strange house and the strange life appeared to have something to do with everything that was picturesque
one sunday when joe greatly enjoying his pipe had so plumed himself on being most awful dull that i had given him up for the day i lay on the earthwork for some time with my chin on my hand descrying traces of miss havisham and estella all over the prospect in the sky and in the water until at last i resolved to mention a thought concerning them that had been much in my head
joe said i dont you think i ought to make miss havisham a visit well pip returned joe slowly considering
what for what for joe
what is any visit made for there is some wisits praps said joe as for ever remains open to the question pip
but in regard to wisiting miss havisham
she might think you wanted somethingexpected something of her dont you think i might say that i did not joe you might old chap said joe
and she might credit it
similarly she mightnt joe felt as i did that he had made a point there and he pulled hard at his pipe to keep himself from weakening it by repetition
you see pip joe pursued as soon as he was past that danger miss havisham done the handsome thing by you
when miss havisham done the handsome thing by you she called me back to say to me as that were all yes joe
i heard her all joe repeated very emphatically
yes joe
i tell you i heard her which i meantersay pip it might be that her meaning weremake a end on itas you wasme to the north and you to the southkeep in sunders i had thought of that too and it was very far from comforting to me to find that he had thought of it for it seemed to render it more probable
but joe yes old chap here am i getting on in the first year of my time and since the day of my being bound i have never thanked miss havisham or asked after her or shown that i remember her thats true pip and unless you was to turn her out a set of shoes all four roundand which i meantersay as even a set of shoes all four round might not be acceptable as a present in a total wacancy of hoofs i dont mean that sort of remembrance joe i dont mean a present but joe had got the idea of a present in his head and must harp upon it
or even said he if you was helped to knocking her up a new chain for the front dooror say a gross or two of sharkheaded screws for general useor some light fancy article such as a toastingfork when she took her muffinsor a gridiron when she took a sprat or such like i dont mean any present at all joe i interposed
well said joe still harping on it as though i had particularly pressed it if i was yourself pip i wouldnt
no i would not
for whats a doorchain when shes got one always up
and sharkheaders is open to misrepresentations
and if it was a toastingfork youd go into brass and do yourself no credit
and the oncommonest workman cant show himself oncommon in a gridironfor a gridiron is a gridiron said joe steadfastly impressing it upon me as if he were endeavouring to rouse me from a fixed delusion and you may haim at what you like but a gridiron it will come out either by your leave or again your leave and you cant help yourself my dear joe i cried in desperation taking hold of his coat dont go on in that way
i never thought of making miss havisham any present no pip joe assented as if he had been contending for that all along and what i say to you is you are right pip yes joe but what i wanted to say was that as we are rather slack just now if you would give me a halfholiday tomorrow i think i would go uptown and make a call on miss esthavisham which her name said joe gravely aint estavisham pip unless she have been rechrisened i know joe i know
it was a slip of mine
what do you think of it joe in brief joe thought that if i thought well of it he thought well of it
but he was particular in stipulating that if i were not received with cordiality or if i were not encouraged to repeat my visit as a visit which had no ulterior object but was simply one of gratitude for a favour received then this experimental trip should have no successor
by these conditions i promised to abide
now joe kept a journeyman at weekly wages whose name was orlick
he pretended that his christian name was dolgea clear impossibilitybut he was a fellow of that obstinate disposition that i believe him to have been the prey of no delusion in this particular but wilfully to have imposed that name upon the village as an affront to its understanding
he was a broadshouldered looselimbed swarthy fellow of great strength never in a hurry and always slouching
he never even seemed to come to his work on purpose but would slouch in as if by mere accident and when he went to the jolly bargemen to eat his dinner or went away at night he would slouch out like cain or the wandering jew as if he had no idea where he was going and no intention of ever coming back
he lodged at a sluicekeepers out on the marshes and on workingdays would come slouching from his hermitage with his hands in his pockets and his dinner loosely tied in a bundle round his neck and dangling on his back
on sundays he mostly lay all day on the sluicegates or stood against ricks and barns
he always slouched locomotively with his eyes on the ground and when accosted or otherwise required to raise them he looked up in a halfresentful halfpuzzled way as though the only thought he ever had was that it was rather an odd and injurious fact that he should never be thinking
this morose journeyman had no liking for me
when i was very small and timid he gave me to understand that the devil lived in a black corner of the forge and that he knew the fiend very well also that it was necessary to make up the fire once in seven years with a live boy and that i might consider myself fuel
when i became joes prentice orlick was perhaps confirmed in some suspicion that i should displace him howbeit he liked me still less
not that he ever said anything or did anything openly importing hostility i only noticed that he always beat his sparks in my direction and that whenever i sang old clem he came in out of time
dolge orlick was at work and present next day when i reminded joe of my halfholiday
he said nothing at the moment for he and joe had just got a piece of hot iron between them and i was at the bellows but by and by he said leaning on his hammer now master
sure youre not agoing to favour only one of us
if young pip has a halfholiday do as much for old orlick i suppose he was about fiveandtwenty but he usually spoke of himself as an ancient person
why whatll you do with a halfholiday if you get it said joe
whatll i do with it
whatll he do with it
ill do as much with it as him said orlick
as to pip hes going up town said joe
well then as to old orlick hes agoing up town retorted that worthy
two can go up town
taint only one wot can go up town
dont lose your temper said joe
shall if i like growled orlick
some and their uptowning
now master
come
no favouring in this shop
be a man the master refusing to entertain the subject until the journeyman was in a better temper orlick plunged at the furnace drew out a redhot bar made at me with it as if he were going to run it through my body whisked it round my head laid it on the anvil hammered it outas if it were i i thought and the sparks were my spirting bloodand finally said when he had hammered himself hot and the iron cold and he again leaned on his hammer now master are you all right now demanded joe
ah
i am all right said gruff old orlick
then as in general you stick to your work as well as most men said joe let it be a halfholiday for all my sister had been standing silent in the yard within hearingshe was a most unscrupulous spy and listenerand she instantly looked in at one of the windows
like you you fool said she to joe giving holidays to great idle hulkers like that
you are a rich man upon my life to waste wages in that way
i wish i was his master youd be everybodys master if you durst retorted orlick with an illfavoured grin
let her alone said joe
id be a match for all noodles and all rogues returned my sister beginning to work herself into a mighty rage
and i couldnt be a match for the noodles without being a match for your master whos the dunderheaded king of the noodles
and i couldnt be a match for the rogues without being a match for you who are the blackestlooking and the worst rogue between this and france
now youre a foul shrew mother gargery growled the journeyman
if that makes a judge of rogues you ought to be a goodun let her alone will you said joe
what did you say cried my sister beginning to scream
what did you say
what did that fellow orlick say to me pip
what did he call me with my husband standing by
oh
oh
oh each of these exclamations was a shriek and i must remark of my sister what is equally true of all the violent women i have ever seen that passion was no excuse for her because it is undeniable that instead of lapsing into passion she consciously and deliberately took extraordinary pains to force herself into it and became blindly furious by regular stages what was the name he gave me before the base man who swore to defend me
oh
hold me
oh ahhh growled the journeyman between his teeth id hold you if you was my wife
id hold you under the pump and choke it out of you i tell you let her alone said joe
oh
to hear him cried my sister with a clap of her hands and a scream togetherwhich was her next stage
to hear the names hes giving me
that orlick
in my own house
me a married woman
with my husband standing by
oh
oh here my sister after a fit of clappings and screamings beat her hands upon her bosom and upon her knees and threw her cap off and pulled her hair downwhich were the last stages on her road to frenzy
being by this time a perfect fury and a complete success she made a dash at the door which i had fortunately locked
what could the wretched joe do now after his disregarded parenthetical interruptions but stand up to his journeyman and ask him what he meant by interfering betwixt himself and mrs joe and further whether he was man enough to come on
old orlick felt that the situation admitted of nothing less than coming on and was on his defence straightway so without so much as pulling off their singed and burnt aprons they went at one another like two giants
but if any man in that neighbourhood could stand uplong against joe i never saw the man
orlick as if he had been of no more account than the pale young gentleman was very soon among the coaldust and in no hurry to come out of it
then joe unlocked the door and picked up my sister who had dropped insensible at the window but who had seen the fight first i think and who was carried into the house and laid down and who was recommended to revive and would do nothing but struggle and clench her hands in joes hair
then came that singular calm and silence which succeed all uproars and then with the vague sensation which i have always connected with such a lullnamely that it was sunday and somebody was deadi went upstairs to dress myself
illustration when i came down again i found joe and orlick sweeping up without any other traces of discomposure than a slit in one of orlicks nostrils which was neither expressive nor ornamental
a pot of beer had appeared from the jolly bargemen and they were sharing it by turns in a peaceable manner
the lull had a sedative and philosophical influence on joe who followed me out into the road to say as a parting observation that might do me good on the rampage pip and off the rampage pipsuch is life with what absurd emotions for we think the feelings that are very serious in a man quite comical in a boy i found myself again going to miss havishams matters little here
nor how i passed and repassed the gate many times before i could make up my mind to ring
nor how i debated whether i should go away without ringing nor how i should undoubtedly have gone if my time had been my own to come back
miss sarah pocket came to the gate
no estella
how then
you here again said miss pocket
what do you want when i said that i only came to see how miss havisham was sarah evidently deliberated whether or no she should send me about my business
but unwilling to hazard the responsibility she let me in and presently brought the sharp message that i was to come up everything was unchanged and miss havisham was alone
well said she fixing her eyes upon me
i hope you want nothing
youll get nothing no indeed miss havisham
i only wanted you to know that i am doing very well in my apprenticeship and am always much obliged to you there there with the old restless fingers
come now and then come on your birthdayay she cried suddenly turning herself and her chair towards me you are looking round for estella
hey i had been looking roundin fact for estellaand i stammered that i hoped she was well
abroad said miss havisham educating for a lady far out of reach prettier than ever admired by all who see her
do you feel that you have lost her there was such a malignant enjoyment in her utterance of the last words and she broke into such a disagreeable laugh that i was at a loss what to say
she spared me the trouble of considering by dismissing me
when the gate was closed upon me by sarah of the walnutshell countenance i felt more than ever dissatisfied with my home and with my trade and with everything and that was all i took by that motion
as i was loitering along the high street looking in disconsolately at the shop windows and thinking what i would buy if i were a gentleman who should come out of the bookshop but mr wopsle
mr wopsle had in his hand the affecting tragedy of george barnwell in which he had that moment invested sixpence with the view of heaping every word of it on the head of pumblechook with whom he was going to drink tea
no sooner did he see me than he appeared to consider that a special providence had put a prentice in his way to be read at and he laid hold of me and insisted on my accompanying him to the pumblechookian parlour
as i knew it would be miserable at home and as the nights were dark and the way was dreary and almost any companionship on the road was better than none i made no great resistance consequently we turned into pumblechooks just as the street and the shops were lighting up
as i never assisted at any other representation of george barnwell i dont know how long it may usually take but i know very well that it took until halfpast nine o clock that night and that when mr wopsle got into newgate i thought he never would go to the scaffold he became so much slower than at any former period of his disgraceful career
i thought it a little too much that he should complain of being cut short in his flower after all as if he had not been running to seed leaf after leaf ever since his course began
this however was a mere question of length and wearisomeness
what stung me was the identification of the whole affair with my unoffending self
when barnwell began to go wrong i declare that i felt positively apologetic pumblechooks indignant stare so taxed me with it
wopsle too took pains to present me in the worst light
at once ferocious and maudlin i was made to murder my uncle with no extenuating circumstances whatever millwood put me down in argument on every occasion it became sheer monomania in my masters daughter to care a button for me and all i can say for my gasping and procrastinating conduct on the fatal morning is that it was worthy of the general feebleness of my character
even after i was happily hanged and wopsle had closed the book pumblechook sat staring at me and shaking his head and saying take warning boy take warning as if it were a wellknown fact that i contemplated murdering a near relation provided i could only induce one to have the weakness to become my benefactor
it was a very dark night when it was all over and when i set out with mr wopsle on the walk home
beyond town we found a heavy mist out and it fell wet and thick
the turnpike lamp was a blur quite out of the lamps usual place apparently and its rays looked solid substance on the fog
we were noticing this and saying how that the mist rose with a change of wind from a certain quarter of our marshes when we came upon a man slouching under the lee of the turnpike house
halloa we said stopping
orlick there ah he answered slouching out
i was standing by a minute on the chance of company you are late i remarked
orlick not unnaturally answered well
and youre late we have been said mr wopsle exalted with his late performancewe have been indulging mr orlick in an intellectual evening old orlick growled as if he had nothing to say about that and we all went on together
i asked him presently whether he had been spending his halfholiday up and down town
yes said he all of it
i come in behind yourself
i didnt see you but i must have been pretty close behind you
by the by the guns is going again at the hulks said i
ay
theres some of the birds flown from the cages
the guns have been going since dark about
youll hear one presently in effect we had not walked many yards further when the wellremembered boom came towards us deadened by the mist and heavily rolled away along the low grounds by the river as if it were pursuing and threatening the fugitives
a good night for cutting off in said orlick
wed be puzzled how to bring down a jailbird on the wing tonight the subject was a suggestive one to me and i thought about it in silence
mr wopsle as the illrequited uncle of the evenings tragedy fell to meditating aloud in his garden at camberwell
orlick with his hands in his pockets slouched heavily at my side
it was very dark very wet very muddy and so we splashed along
now and then the sound of the signal cannon broke upon us again and again rolled sulkily along the course of the river
i kept myself to myself and my thoughts
mr wopsle died amiably at camberwell and exceedingly game on bosworth field and in the greatest agonies at glastonbury
orlick sometimes growled beat it out beat it outold clem
with a clink for the stoutold clem i thought he had been drinking but he was not drunk
thus we came to the village
the way by which we approached it took us past the three jolly bargemen which we were surprised to findit being eleven oclockin a state of commotion with the door wide open and unwonted lights that had been hastily caught up and put down scattered about
mr wopsle dropped in to ask what was the matter surmising that a convict had been taken but came running out in a great hurry
theres something wrong said he without stopping up at your place pip
run all what is it i asked keeping up with him
so did orlick at my side
i cant quite understand
the house seems to have been violently entered when joe gargery was out
supposed by convicts
somebody has been attacked and hurt we were running too fast to admit of more being said and we made no stop until we got into our kitchen
it was full of people the whole village was there or in the yard and there was a surgeon and there was joe and there were a group of women all on the floor in the midst of the kitchen
the unemployed bystanders drew back when they saw me and so i became aware of my sisterlying without sense or movement on the bare boards where she had been knocked down by a tremendous blow on the back of the head dealt by some unknown hand when her face was turned towards the firedestined never to be on the rampage again while she was the wife of joe
chapter xvi
with my head full of george barnwell i was at first disposed to believe that i must have had some hand in the attack upon my sister or at all events that as her near relation popularly known to be under obligations to her i was a more legitimate object of suspicion than any one else
but when in the clearer light of next morning i began to reconsider the matter and to hear it discussed around me on all sides i took another view of the case which was more reasonable
joe had been at the three jolly bargemen smoking his pipe from a quarter after eight oclock to a quarter before ten
while he was there my sister had been seen standing at the kitchen door and had exchanged good night with a farmlabourer going home
the man could not be more particular as to the time at which he saw her he got into dense confusion when he tried to be than that it must have been before nine
when joe went home at five minutes before ten he found her struck down on the floor and promptly called in assistance
the fire had not then burnt unusually low nor was the snuff of the candle very long the candle however had been blown out
nothing had been taken away from any part of the house
neither beyond the blowing out of the candlewhich stood on a table between the door and my sister and was behind her when she stood facing the fire and was struckwas there any disarrangement of the kitchen excepting such as she herself had made in falling and bleeding
but there was one remarkable piece of evidence on the spot
she had been struck with something blunt and heavy on the head and spine after the blows were dealt something heavy had been thrown down at her with considerable violence as she lay on her face
and on the ground beside her when joe picked her up was a convicts legiron which had been filed asunder
now joe examining this iron with a smiths eye declared it to have been filed asunder some time ago
the hue and cry going off to the hulks and people coming thence to examine the iron joes opinion was corroborated
they did not undertake to say when it had left the prisonships to which it undoubtedly had once belonged but they claimed to know for certain that that particular manacle had not been worn by either of the two convicts who had escaped last night
further one of those two was already retaken and had not freed himself of his iron
knowing what i knew i set up an inference of my own here
i believed the iron to be my convicts ironthe iron i had seen and heard him filing at on the marshesbut my mind did not accuse him of having put it to its latest use
for i believed one of two other persons to have become possessed of it and to have turned it to this cruel account
either orlick or the strange man who had shown me the file
now as to orlick he had gone to town exactly as he told us when we picked him up at the turnpike he had been seen about town all the evening he had been in divers companies in several publichouses and he had come back with myself and mr wopsle
there was nothing against him save the quarrel and my sister had quarrelled with him and with everybody else about her ten thousand times
as to the strange man if he had come back for his two banknotes there could have been no dispute about them because my sister was fully prepared to restore them
besides there had been no altercation the assailant had come in so silently and suddenly that she had been felled before she could look round
it was horrible to think that i had provided the weapon however undesignedly but i could hardly think otherwise
i suffered unspeakable trouble while i considered and reconsidered whether i should at last dissolve that spell of my childhood and tell joe all the story
for months afterwards i every day settled the question finally in the negative and reopened and reargued it next morning
the contention came after all to thisthe secret was such an old one now had so grown into me and become a part of myself that i could not tear it away
in addition to the dread that having led up to so much mischief it would be now more likely than ever to alienate joe from me if he believed it i had a further restraining dread that he would not believe it but would assort it with the fabulous dogs and vealcutlets as a monstrous invention
however i temporized with myself of coursefor was i not wavering between right and wrong when the thing is always doneand resolved to make a full disclosure if i should see any such new occasion as a new chance of helping in the discovery of the assailant
the constables and the bow street men from londonfor this happened in the days of the extinct redwaistcoated policewere about the house for a week or two and did pretty much what i have heard and read of like authorities doing in other such cases
they took up several obviously wrong people and they ran their heads very hard against wrong ideas and persisted in trying to fit the circumstances to the ideas instead of trying to extract ideas from the circumstances
also they stood about the door of the jolly bargemen with knowing and reserved looks that filled the whole neighbourhood with admiration and they had a mysterious manner of taking their drink that was almost as good as taking the culprit
but not quite for they never did it
long after these constitutional powers had dispersed my sister lay very ill in bed
her sight was disturbed so that she saw objects multiplied and grasped at visionary teacups and wineglasses instead of the realities her hearing was greatly impaired her memory also and her speech was unintelligible
when at last she came round so far as to be helped downstairs it was still necessary to keep my slate always by her that she might indicate in writing what she could not indicate in speech
as she was very bad handwriting apart a more than indifferent speller and as joe was a more than indifferent reader extraordinary complications arose between them which i was always called in to solve
the administration of mutton instead of medicine the substitution of tea for joe and the baker for bacon were among the mildest of my own mistakes
however her temper was greatly improved and she was patient
a tremulous uncertainty of the action of all her limbs soon became a part of her regular state and afterwards at intervals of two or three months she would often put her hands to her head and would then remain for about a week at a time in some gloomy aberration of mind
we were at a loss to find a suitable attendant for her until a circumstance happened conveniently to relieve us
mr wopsles greataunt conquered a confirmed habit of living into which she had fallen and biddy became a part of our establishment
it may have been about a month after my sisters reappearance in the kitchen when biddy came to us with a small speckled box containing the whole of her worldly effects and became a blessing to the household
above all she was a blessing to joe for the dear old fellow was sadly cut up by the constant contemplation of the wreck of his wife and had been accustomed while attending on her of an evening to turn to me every now and then and say with his blue eyes moistened such a fine figure of a woman as she once were pip biddy instantly taking the cleverest charge of her as though she had studied her from infancy joe became able in some sort to appreciate the greater quiet of his life and to get down to the jolly bargemen now and then for a change that did him good
it was characteristic of the police people that they had all more or less suspected poor joe though he never knew it and that they had to a man concurred in regarding him as one of the deepest spirits they had ever encountered
biddys first triumph in her new office was to solve a difficulty that had completely vanquished me
i had tried hard at it but had made nothing of it
thus it was again and again and again my sister had traced upon the slate a character that looked like a curious t and then with the utmost eagerness had called our attention to it as something she particularly wanted
i had in vain tried everything producible that began with a t from tar to toast and tub
at length it had come into my head that the sign looked like a hammer and on my lustily calling that word in my sisters ear she had begun to hammer on the table and had expressed a qualified assent
thereupon i had brought in all our hammers one after another but without avail
then i bethought me of a crutch the shape being much the same and i borrowed one in the village and displayed it to my sister with considerable confidence
but she shook her head to that extent when she was shown it that we were terrified lest in her weak and shattered state she should dislocate her neck
when my sister found that biddy was very quick to understand her this mysterious sign reappeared on the slate
biddy looked thoughtfully at it heard my explanation looked thoughtfully at my sister looked thoughtfully at joe who was always represented on the slate by his initial letter and ran into the forge followed by joe and me
why of course cried biddy with an exultant face
dont you see
its him orlick without a doubt
she had lost his name and could only signify him by his hammer
we told him why we wanted him to come into the kitchen and he slowly laid down his hammer wiped his brow with his arm took another wipe at it with his apron and came slouching out with a curious loose vagabond bend in the knees that strongly distinguished him
i confess that i expected to see my sister denounce him and that i was disappointed by the different result
she manifested the greatest anxiety to be on good terms with him was evidently much pleased by his being at length produced and motioned that she would have him given something to drink
she watched his countenance as if she were particularly wishful to be assured that he took kindly to his reception she showed every possible desire to conciliate him and there was an air of humble propitiation in all she did such as i have seen pervade the bearing of a child towards a hard master
after that day a day rarely passed without her drawing the hammer on her slate and without orlicks slouching in and standing doggedly before her as if he knew no more than i did what to make of it
chapter xvii
i now fell into a regular routine of apprenticeship life which was varied beyond the limits of the village and the marshes by no more remarkable circumstance than the arrival of my birthday and my paying another visit to miss havisham
i found miss sarah pocket still on duty at the gate i found miss havisham just as i had left her and she spoke of estella in the very same way if not in the very same words
the interview lasted but a few minutes and she gave me a guinea when i was going and told me to come again on my next birthday
i may mention at once that this became an annual custom
i tried to decline taking the guinea on the first occasion but with no better effect than causing her to ask me very angrily if i expected more
then and after that i took it
so unchanging was the dull old house the yellow light in the darkened room the faded spectre in the chair by the dressingtable glass that i felt as if the stopping of the clocks had stopped time in that mysterious place and while i and everything else outside it grew older it stood still
daylight never entered the house as to my thoughts and remembrances of it any more than as to the actual fact
it bewildered me and under its influence i continued at heart to hate my trade and to be ashamed of home
imperceptibly i became conscious of a change in biddy however
her shoes came up at the heel her hair grew bright and neat her hands were always clean
she was not beautifulshe was common and could not be like estellabut she was pleasant and wholesome and sweettempered
she had not been with us more than a year i remember her being newly out of mourning at the time it struck me when i observed to myself one evening that she had curiously thoughtful and attentive eyes eyes that were very pretty and very good
it came of my lifting up my own eyes from a task i was poring atwriting some passages from a book to improve myself in two ways at once by a sort of stratagemand seeing biddy observant of what i was about
i laid down my pen and biddy stopped in her needlework without laying it down
biddy said i how do you manage it
either i am very stupid or you are very clever what is it that i manage
i dont know returned biddy smiling
she managed our whole domestic life and wonderfully too but i did not mean that though that made what i did mean more surprising
how do you manage biddy said i to learn everything that i learn and always to keep up with me i was beginning to be rather vain of my knowledge for i spent my birthday guineas on it and set aside the greater part of my pocketmoney for similar investment though i have no doubt now that the little i knew was extremely dear at the price
i might as well ask you said biddy how you manage no because when i come in from the forge of a night any one can see me turning to at it
but you never turn to at it biddy i suppose i must catch it like a cough said biddy quietly and went on with her sewing
pursuing my idea as i leaned back in my wooden chair and looked at biddy sewing away with her head on one side i began to think her rather an extraordinary girl
for i called to mind now that she was equally accomplished in the terms of our trade and the names of our different sorts of work and our various tools
in short whatever i knew biddy knew
theoretically she was already as good a blacksmith as i or better
you are one of those biddy said i who make the most of every chance
you never had a chance before you came here and see how improved you are biddy looked at me for an instant and went on with her sewing
i was your first teacher though wasnt i said she as she sewed
biddy i exclaimed in amazement
why you are crying no i am not said biddy looking up and laughing
what put that in your head what could have put it in my head but the glistening of a tear as it dropped on her work
i sat silent recalling what a drudge she had been until mr wopsles greataunt successfully overcame that bad habit of living so highly desirable to be got rid of by some people
i recalled the hopeless circumstances by which she had been surrounded in the miserable little shop and the miserable little noisy evening school with that miserable old bundle of incompetence always to be dragged and shouldered
i reflected that even in those untoward times there must have been latent in biddy what was now developing for in my first uneasiness and discontent i had turned to her for help as a matter of course
biddy sat quietly sewing shedding no more tears and while i looked at her and thought about it all it occurred to me that perhaps i had not been sufficiently grateful to biddy
i might have been too reserved and should have patronised her more though i did not use that precise word in my meditations with my confidence
yes biddy i observed when i had done turning it over you were my first teacher and that at a time when we little thought of ever being together like this in this kitchen ah poor thing replied biddy
it was like her selfforgetfulness to transfer the remark to my sister and to get up and be busy about her making her more comfortable thats sadly true well said i we must talk together a little more as we used to do
and i must consult you a little more as i used to do
let us have a quiet walk on the marshes next sunday biddy and a long chat my sister was never left alone now but joe more than readily undertook the care of her on that sunday afternoon and biddy and i went out together
it was summertime and lovely weather
when we had passed the village and the church and the churchyard and were out on the marshes and began to see the sails of the ships as they sailed on i began to combine miss havisham and estella with the prospect in my usual way
when we came to the riverside and sat down on the bank with the water rippling at our feet making it all more quiet than it would have been without that sound i resolved that it was a good time and place for the admission of biddy into my inner confidence
biddy said i after binding her to secrecy i want to be a gentleman o i wouldnt if i was you she returned
i dont think it would answer biddy said i with some severity i have particular reasons for wanting to be a gentleman you know best pip but dont you think you are happier as you are biddy i exclaimed impatiently i am not at all happy as i am
i am disgusted with my calling and with my life
i have never taken to either since i was bound
dont be absurd was i absurd said biddy quietly raising her eyebrows i am sorry for that i didnt mean to be
i only want you to do well and to be comfortable well then understand once for all that i never shall or can be comfortableor anything but miserablethere biddyunless i can lead a very different sort of life from the life i lead now thats a pity said biddy shaking her head with a sorrowful air
now i too had so often thought it a pity that in the singular kind of quarrel with myself which i was always carrying on i was half inclined to shed tears of vexation and distress when biddy gave utterance to her sentiment and my own
i told her she was right and i knew it was much to be regretted but still it was not to be helped
if i could have settled down i said to biddy plucking up the short grass within reach much as i had once upon a time pulled my feelings out of my hair and kicked them into the brewery wallif i could have settled down and been but half as fond of the forge as i was when i was little i know it would have been much better for me
you and i and joe would have wanted nothing then and joe and i would perhaps have gone partners when i was out of my time and i might even have grown up to keep company with you and we might have sat on this very bank on a fine sunday quite different people
i should have been good enough for you shouldnt i biddy biddy sighed as she looked at the ships sailing on and returned for answer yes i am not overparticular it scarcely sounded flattering but i knew she meant well
instead of that said i plucking up more grass and chewing a blade or two see how i am going on
dissatisfied and uncomfortable andwhat would it signify to me being coarse and common if nobody had told me so biddy turned her face suddenly towards mine and looked far more attentively at me than she had looked at the sailing ships
it was neither a very true nor a very polite thing to say she remarked directing her eyes to the ships again
who said it i was disconcerted for i had broken away without quite seeing where i was going to
it was not to be shuffled off now however and i answered the beautiful young lady at miss havishams and shes more beautiful than anybody ever was and i admire her dreadfully and i want to be a gentleman on her account having made this lunatic confession i began to throw my tornup grass into the river as if i had some thoughts of following it
do you want to be a gentleman to spite her or to gain her over biddy quietly asked me after a pause
i dont know i moodily answered
because if it is to spite her biddy pursued i should thinkbut you know bestthat might be better and more independently done by caring nothing for her words
and if it is to gain her over i should thinkbut you know bestshe was not worth gaining over exactly what i myself had thought many times
exactly what was perfectly manifest to me at the moment
but how could i a poor dazed village lad avoid that wonderful inconsistency into which the best and wisest of men fall every day
it may be all quite true said i to biddy but i admire her dreadfully in short i turned over on my face when i came to that and got a good grasp on the hair on each side of my head and wrenched it well
all the while knowing the madness of my heart to be so very mad and misplaced that i was quite conscious it would have served my face right if i had lifted it up by my hair and knocked it against the pebbles as a punishment for belonging to such an idiot
biddy was the wisest of girls and she tried to reason no more with me
she put her hand which was a comfortable hand though roughened by work upon my hands one after another and gently took them out of my hair
then she softly patted my shoulder in a soothing way while with my face upon my sleeve i cried a littleexactly as i had done in the brewery yardand felt vaguely convinced that i was very much illused by somebody or by everybody i cant say which
i am glad of one thing said biddy and that is that you have felt you could give me your confidence pip
and i am glad of another thing and that is that of course you know you may depend upon my keeping it and always so far deserving it
if your first teacher dear
such a poor one and so much in need of being taught herself
had been your teacher at the present time she thinks she knows what lesson she would set
but it would be a hard one to learn and you have got beyond her and its of no use now so with a quiet sigh for me biddy rose from the bank and said with a fresh and pleasant change of voice shall we walk a little farther or go home biddy i cried getting up putting my arm round her neck and giving her a kiss i shall always tell you everything till youre a gentleman said biddy
you know i never shall be so thats always
not that i have any occasion to tell you anything for you know everything i knowas i told you at home the other night ah said biddy quite in a whisper as she looked away at the ships
and then repeated with her former pleasant change shall we walk a little farther or go home i said to biddy we would walk a little farther and we did so and the summer afternoon toned down into the summer evening and it was very beautiful
i began to consider whether i was not more naturally and wholesomely situated after all in these circumstances than playing beggar my neighbour by candlelight in the room with the stopped clocks and being despised by estella
i thought it would be very good for me if i could get her out of my head with all the rest of those remembrances and fancies and could go to work determined to relish what i had to do and stick to it and make the best of it
i asked myself the question whether i did not surely know that if estella were beside me at that moment instead of biddy she would make me miserable
i was obliged to admit that i did know it for a certainty and i said to myself pip what a fool you are we talked a good deal as we walked and all that biddy said seemed right
biddy was never insulting or capricious or biddy today and somebody else tomorrow she would have derived only pain and no pleasure from giving me pain she would far rather have wounded her own breast than mine
how could it be then that i did not like her much the better of the two
biddy said i when we were walking homeward i wish you could put me right i wish i could said biddy
if i could only get myself to fall in love with youyou dont mind my speaking so openly to such an old acquaintance oh dear not at all said biddy
dont mind me if i could only get myself to do it that would be the thing for me but you never will you see said biddy
it did not appear quite so unlikely to me that evening as it would have done if we had discussed it a few hours before
i therefore observed i was not quite sure of that
but biddy said she was and she said it decisively
in my heart i believed her to be right and yet i took it rather ill too that she should be so positive on the point
when we came near the churchyard we had to cross an embankment and get over a stile near a sluicegate
there started up from the gate or from the rushes or from the ooze which was quite in his stagnant way old orlick
halloa he growled where are you two going where should we be going but home well then said he im jiggered if i dont see you home this penalty of being jiggered was a favourite supposititious case of his
he attached no definite meaning to the word that i am aware of but used it like his own pretended christian name to affront mankind and convey an idea of something savagely damaging
when i was younger i had had a general belief that if he had jiggered me personally he would have done it with a sharp and twisted hook
biddy was much against his going with us and said to me in a whisper dont let him come i dont like him as i did not like him either i took the liberty of saying that we thanked him but we didnt want seeing home
he received that piece of information with a yell of laughter and dropped back but came slouching after us at a little distance
curious to know whether biddy suspected him of having had a hand in that murderous attack of which my sister had never been able to give any account i asked her why she did not like him
oh she replied glancing over her shoulder as he slouched after us because ii am afraid he likes me did he ever tell you he liked you i asked indignantly
no said biddy glancing over her shoulder again he never told me so but he dances at me whenever he can catch my eye however novel and peculiar this testimony of attachment i did not doubt the accuracy of the interpretation
i was very hot indeed upon old orlicks daring to admire her as hot as if it were an outrage on myself
but it makes no difference to you you know said biddy calmly
no biddy it makes no difference to me only i dont like it i dont approve of it nor i neither said biddy
though that makes no difference to you exactly said i but i must tell you i should have no opinion of you biddy if he danced at you with your own consent i kept an eye on orlick after that night and whenever circumstances were favourable to his dancing at biddy got before him to obscure that demonstration
he had struck root in joes establishment by reason of my sisters sudden fancy for him or i should have tried to get him dismissed
he quite understood and reciprocated my good intentions as i had reason to know thereafter
and now because my mind was not confused enough before i complicated its confusion fifty thousandfold by having states and seasons when i was clear that biddy was immeasurably better than estella and that the plain honest working life to which i was born had nothing in it to be ashamed of but offered me sufficient means of selfrespect and happiness
at those times i would decide conclusively that my disaffection to dear old joe and the forge was gone and that i was growing up in a fair way to be partners with joe and to keep company with biddywhen all in a moment some confounding remembrance of the havisham days would fall upon me like a destructive missile and scatter my wits again
scattered wits take a long time picking up and often before i had got them well together they would be dispersed in all directions by one stray thought that perhaps after all miss havisham was going to make my fortune when my time was out
if my time had run out it would have left me still at the height of my perplexities i dare say
it never did run out however but was brought to a premature end as i proceed to relate
chapter xviii
it was in the fourth year of my apprenticeship to joe and it was a saturday night
there was a group assembled round the fire at the three jolly bargemen attentive to mr wopsle as he read the newspaper aloud
of that group i was one
a highly popular murder had been committed and mr wopsle was imbrued in blood to the eyebrows
he gloated over every abhorrent adjective in the description and identified himself with every witness at the inquest
he faintly moaned i am done for as the victim and he barbarously bellowed ill serve you out as the murderer
he gave the medical testimony in pointed imitation of our local practitioner and he piped and shook as the aged turnpikekeeper who had heard blows to an extent so very paralytic as to suggest a doubt regarding the mental competency of that witness
the coroner in mr wopsles hands became timon of athens the beadle coriolanus
he enjoyed himself thoroughly and we all enjoyed ourselves and were delightfully comfortable
in this cosey state of mind we came to the verdict wilful murder
then and not sooner i became aware of a strange gentleman leaning over the back of the settle opposite me looking on
there was an expression of contempt on his face and he bit the side of a great forefinger as he watched the group of faces
well said the stranger to mr wopsle when the reading was done you have settled it all to your own satisfaction i have no doubt everybody started and looked up as if it were the murderer
he looked at everybody coldly and sarcastically
guilty of course said he
out with it
come sir returned mr wopsle without having the honour of your acquaintance i do say guilty upon this we all took courage to unite in a confirmatory murmur
i know you do said the stranger i knew you would
i told you so
but now ill ask you a question
do you know or do you not know that the law of england supposes every man to be innocent until he is provedprovedto be guilty sir mr wopsle began to reply as an englishman myself i come said the stranger biting his forefinger at him
dont evade the question
either you know it or you dont know it
which is it to be he stood with his head on one side and himself on one side in a bullying interrogative manner and he threw his forefinger at mr wopsleas it were to mark him outbefore biting it again
now said he
do you know it or dont you know it certainly i know it replied mr wopsle
certainly you know it
then why didnt you say so at first
now ill ask you another questiontaking possession of mr wopsle as if he had a right to himdo you know that none of these witnesses have yet been crossexamined mr wopsle was beginning i can only say when the stranger stopped him
what
you wont answer the question yes or no
now ill try you again throwing his finger at him again
attend to me
are you aware or are you not aware that none of these witnesses have yet been crossexamined
come i only want one word from you
yes or no mr wopsle hesitated and we all began to conceive rather a poor opinion of him
come said the stranger ill help you
you dont deserve help but ill help you
look at that paper you hold in your hand
what is it what is it repeated mr wopsle eyeing it much at a loss
is it pursued the stranger in his most sarcastic and suspicious manner the printed paper you have just been reading from undoubtedly undoubtedly
now turn to that paper and tell me whether it distinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that his legal advisers instructed him altogether to reserve his defence i read that just now mr wopsle pleaded
never mind what you read just now sir i dont ask you what you read just now
you may read the lords prayer backwards if you likeand perhaps have done it before today
turn to the paper
no no no my friend not to the top of the column you know better than that to the bottom to the bottom we all began to think mr wopsle full of subterfuge
well
have you found it here it is said mr wopsle
now follow that passage with your eye and tell me whether it distinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that he was instructed by his legal advisers wholly to reserve his defence
come
do you make that of it mr wopsle answered those are not the exact words not the exact words repeated the gentleman bitterly
is that the exact substance yes said mr wopsle
yes repeated the stranger looking round at the rest of the company with his right hand extended towards the witness wopsle
and now i ask you what you say to the conscience of that man who with that passage before his eyes can lay his head upon his pillow after having pronounced a fellowcreature guilty unheard we all began to suspect that mr wopsle was not the man we had thought him and that he was beginning to be found out
and that same man remember pursued the gentleman throwing his finger at mr wopsle heavilythat same man might be summoned as a juryman upon this very trial and having thus deeply committed himself might return to the bosom of his family and lay his head upon his pillow after deliberately swearing that he would well and truly try the issue joined between our sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and would a true verdict give according to the evidence so help him god we were all deeply persuaded that the unfortunate wopsle had gone too far and had better stop in his reckless career while there was yet time
the strange gentleman with an air of authority not to be disputed and with a manner expressive of knowing something secret about every one of us that would effectually do for each individual if he chose to disclose it left the back of the settle and came into the space between the two settles in front of the fire where he remained standing his left hand in his pocket and he biting the forefinger of his right
from information i have received said he looking round at us as we all quailed before him i have reason to believe there is a blacksmith among you by name josephor joegargery
which is the man here is the man said joe
the strange gentleman beckoned him out of his place and joe went
you have an apprentice pursued the stranger commonly known as pip
is he here i am here i cried
the stranger did not recognise me but i recognised him as the gentleman i had met on the stairs on the occasion of my second visit to miss havisham
i had known him the moment i saw him looking over the settle and now that i stood confronting him with his hand upon my shoulder i checked off again in detail his large head his dark complexion his deepset eyes his bushy black eyebrows his large watchchain his strong black dots of beard and whisker and even the smell of scented soap on his great hand
i wish to have a private conference with you two said he when he had surveyed me at his leisure
it will take a little time
perhaps we had better go to your place of residence
i prefer not to anticipate my communication here you will impart as much or as little of it as you please to your friends afterwards i have nothing to do with that amidst a wondering silence we three walked out of the jolly bargemen and in a wondering silence walked home
while going along the strange gentleman occasionally looked at me and occasionally bit the side of his finger
as we neared home joe vaguely acknowledging the occasion as an impressive and ceremonious one went on ahead to open the front door
our conference was held in the state parlour which was feebly lighted by one candle
it began with the strange gentlemans sitting down at the table drawing the candle to him and looking over some entries in his pocketbook
he then put up the pocketbook and set the candle a little aside after peering round it into the darkness at joe and me to ascertain which was which
my name he said is jaggers and i am a lawyer in london
i am pretty well known
i have unusual business to transact with you and i commence by explaining that it is not of my originating
if my advice had been asked i should not have been here
it was not asked and you see me here
what i have to do as the confidential agent of another i do
no less no more finding that he could not see us very well from where he sat he got up and threw one leg over the back of a chair and leaned upon it thus having one foot on the seat of the chair and one foot on the ground
now joseph gargery i am the bearer of an offer to relieve you of this young fellow your apprentice
you would not object to cancel his indentures at his request and for his good
you would want nothing for so doing lord forbid that i should want anything for not standing in pips way said joe staring
lord forbidding is pious but not to the purpose returned mr jaggers
the question is would you want anything
do you want anything the answer is returned joe sternly no i thought mr jaggers glanced at joe as if he considered him a fool for his disinterestedness
but i was too much bewildered between breathless curiosity and surprise to be sure of it
very well said mr jaggers
recollect the admission you have made and dont try to go from it presently whos agoing to try retorted joe
i dont say anybody is
do you keep a dog yes i do keep a dog bear in mind then that brag is a good dog but holdfast is a better
bear that in mind will you repeated mr jaggers shutting his eyes and nodding his head at joe as if he were forgiving him something
now i return to this young fellow
and the communication i have got to make is that he has great expectations joe and i gasped and looked at one another
i am instructed to communicate to him said mr jaggers throwing his finger at me sideways that he will come into a handsome property
further that it is the desire of the present possessor of that property that he be immediately removed from his present sphere of life and from this place and be brought up as a gentlemanin a word as a young fellow of great expectations my dream was out my wild fancy was surpassed by sober reality miss havisham was going to make my fortune on a grand scale
now mr pip pursued the lawyer i address the rest of what i have to say to you
you are to understand first that it is the request of the person from whom i take my instructions that you always bear the name of pip
you will have no objection i dare say to your great expectations being encumbered with that easy condition
but if you have any objection this is the time to mention it my heart was beating so fast and there was such a singing in my ears that i could scarcely stammer i had no objection
i should think not
now you are to understand secondly mr pip that the name of the person who is your liberal benefactor remains a profound secret until the person chooses to reveal it
i am empowered to mention that it is the intention of the person to reveal it at first hand by word of mouth to yourself
when or where that intention may be carried out i cannot say no one can say
it may be years hence
now you are distinctly to understand that you are most positively prohibited from making any inquiry on this head or any allusion or reference however distant to any individual whomsoever as the individual in all the communications you may have with me
if you have a suspicion in your own breast keep that suspicion in your own breast
it is not the least to the purpose what the reasons of this prohibition are they may be the strongest and gravest reasons or they may be mere whim
this is not for you to inquire into
the condition is laid down
your acceptance of it and your observance of it as binding is the only remaining condition that i am charged with by the person from whom i take my instructions and for whom i am not otherwise responsible
that person is the person from whom you derive your expectations and the secret is solely held by that person and by me
again not a very difficult condition with which to encumber such a rise in fortune but if you have any objection to it this is the time to mention it
speak out once more i stammered with difficulty that i had no objection
i should think not
now mr pip i have done with stipulations though he called me mr pip and began rather to make up to me he still could not get rid of a certain air of bullying suspicion and even now he occasionally shut his eyes and threw his finger at me while he spoke as much as to express that he knew all kinds of things to my disparagement if he only chose to mention them
we come next to mere details of arrangement
you must know that although i have used the term expectations more than once you are not endowed with expectations only
there is already lodged in my hands a sum of money amply sufficient for your suitable education and maintenance
you will please consider me your guardian
oh for i was going to thank him i tell you at once i am paid for my services or i shouldnt render them
it is considered that you must be better educated in accordance with your altered position and that you will be alive to the importance and necessity of at once entering on that advantage i said i had always longed for it
never mind what you have always longed for mr pip he retorted keep to the record
if you long for it now thats enough
am i answered that you are ready to be placed at once under some proper tutor
is that it i stammered yes that was it
good
now your inclinations are to be consulted
i dont think that wise mind but its my trust
have you ever heard of any tutor whom you would prefer to another i had never heard of any tutor but biddy and mr wopsles greataunt so i replied in the negative
there is a certain tutor of whom i have some knowledge who i think might suit the purpose said mr jaggers
i dont recommend him observe because i never recommend anybody
the gentleman i speak of is one mr matthew pocket ah
i caught at the name directly
miss havishams relation
the matthew whom mr and mrs camilla had spoken of
the matthew whose place was to be at miss havishams head when she lay dead in her brides dress on the brides table
you know the name said mr jaggers looking shrewdly at me and then shutting up his eyes while he waited for my answer
my answer was that i had heard of the name
oh said he
you have heard of the name
but the question is what do you say of it i said or tried to say that i was much obliged to him for his recommendation no my young friend he interrupted shaking his great head very slowly
recollect yourself not recollecting myself i began again that i was much obliged to him for his recommendation no my young friend he interrupted shaking his head and frowning and smiling both at onceno no no its very well done but it wont do you are too young to fix me with it
recommendation is not the word mr pip
try another correcting myself i said that i was much obliged to him for his mention of mr matthew pocket thats more like it cried mr jaggersand i added i would gladly try that gentleman
good
you had better try him in his own house
the way shall be prepared for you and you can see his son first who is in london
when will you come to london i said glancing at joe who stood looking on motionless that i supposed i could come directly
first said mr jaggers you should have some new clothes to come in and they should not be workingclothes
say this day week
youll want some money
shall i leave you twenty guineas he produced a long purse with the greatest coolness and counted them out on the table and pushed them over to me
this was the first time he had taken his leg from the chair
he sat astride of the chair when he had pushed the money over and sat swinging his purse and eyeing joe
well joseph gargery
you look dumbfoundered i am said joe in a very decided manner
it was understood that you wanted nothing for yourself remember it were understood said joe
and it are understood
and it ever will be similar according but what said mr jaggers swinging his pursewhat if it was in my instructions to make you a present as compensation as compensation what for joe demanded
for the loss of his services joe laid his hand upon my shoulder with the touch of a woman
i have often thought him since like the steamhammer that can crush a man or pat an eggshell in his combination of strength with gentleness
pip is that hearty welcome said joe to go free with his services to honour and fortun as no words can tell him
but if you think as money can make compensation to me for the loss of the little childwhat come to the forgeand ever the best of friends o dear good joe whom i was so ready to leave and so unthankful to i see you again with your muscular blacksmiths arm before your eyes and your broad chest heaving and your voice dying away
o dear good faithful tender joe i feel the loving tremble of your hand upon my arm as solemnly this day as if it had been the rustle of an angels wing
but i encouraged joe at the time
i was lost in the mazes of my future fortunes and could not retrace the bypaths we had trodden together
i begged joe to be comforted for as he said we had ever been the best of friends and as i said we ever would be so
joe scooped his eyes with his disengaged wrist as if he were bent on gouging himself but said not another word
mr jaggers had looked on at this as one who recognised in joe the village idiot and in me his keeper
when it was over he said weighing in his hand the purse he had ceased to swing now joseph gargery i warn you this is your last chance
no half measures with me
if you mean to take a present that i have it in charge to make you speak out and you shall have it
if on the contrary you mean to say here to his great amazement he was stopped by joes suddenly working round him with every demonstration of a fell pugilistic purpose
which i meantersay cried joe that if you come into my place bullbaiting and badgering me come out
which i meantersay as sech if youre a man come on
which i meantersay that what i say i meantersay and stand or fall by i drew joe away and he immediately became placable merely stating to me in an obliging manner and as a polite expostulatory notice to any one whom it might happen to concern that he were not agoing to be bullbaited and badgered in his own place
mr jaggers had risen when joe demonstrated and had backed near the door
without evincing any inclination to come in again he there delivered his valedictory remarks
they were these
well mr pip i think the sooner you leave hereas you are to be a gentlemanthe better
let it stand for this day week and you shall receive my printed address in the meantime
you can take a hackneycoach at the stagecoach office in london and come straight to me
understand that i express no opinion one way or other on the trust i undertake
i am paid for undertaking it and i do so
now understand that finally
understand that he was throwing his finger at both of us and i think would have gone on but for his seeming to think joe dangerous and going off
something came into my head which induced me to run after him as he was going down to the jolly bargemen where he had left a hired carriage
i beg your pardon mr jaggers halloa said he facing round whats the matter i wish to be quite right mr jaggers and to keep to your directions so i thought i had better ask
would there be any objection to my taking leave of any one i know about here before i go away no said he looking as if he hardly understood me
i dont mean in the village only but up town no said he
no objection i thanked him and ran home again and there i found that joe had already locked the front door and vacated the state parlour and was seated by the kitchen fire with a hand on each knee gazing intently at the burning coals
i too sat down before the fire and gazed at the coals and nothing was said for a long time
my sister was in her cushioned chair in her corner and biddy sat at her needlework before the fire and joe sat next biddy and i sat next joe in the corner opposite my sister
the more i looked into the glowing coals the more incapable i became of looking at joe the longer the silence lasted the more unable i felt to speak
at length i got out joe have you told biddy no pip returned joe still looking at the fire and holding his knees tight as if he had private information that they intended to make off somewhere which i left it to yourself pip i would rather you told joe pips a gentleman of fortun then said joe and god bless him in it biddy dropped her work and looked at me
joe held his knees and looked at me
i looked at both of them
after a pause they both heartily congratulated me but there was a certain touch of sadness in their congratulations that i rather resented
i took it upon myself to impress biddy and through biddy joe with the grave obligation i considered my friends under to know nothing and say nothing about the maker of my fortune
it would all come out in good time i observed and in the meanwhile nothing was to be said save that i had come into great expectations from a mysterious patron
biddy nodded her head thoughtfully at the fire as she took up her work again and said she would be very particular and joe still detaining his knees said ay ay ill be ekervally partickler pip and then they congratulated me again and went on to express so much wonder at the notion of my being a gentleman that i didnt half like it
infinite pains were then taken by biddy to convey to my sister some idea of what had happened
to the best of my belief those efforts entirely failed
she laughed and nodded her head a great many times and even repeated after biddy the words pip and property but i doubt if they had more meaning in them than an election cry and i cannot suggest a darker picture of her state of mind
i never could have believed it without experience but as joe and biddy became more at their cheerful ease again i became quite gloomy
dissatisfied with my fortune of course i could not be but it is possible that i may have been without quite knowing it dissatisfied with myself
anyhow i sat with my elbow on my knee and my face upon my hand looking into the fire as those two talked about my going away and about what they should do without me and all that
and whenever i caught one of them looking at me though never so pleasantly and they often looked at meparticularly biddy i felt offended as if they were expressing some mistrust of me
though heaven knows they never did by word or sign
at those times i would get up and look out at the door for our kitchen door opened at once upon the night and stood open on summer evenings to air the room
the very stars to which i then raised my eyes i am afraid i took to be but poor and humble stars for glittering on the rustic objects among which i had passed my life
saturday night said i when we sat at our supper of bread and cheese and beer
five more days and then the day before the day
theyll soon go yes pip observed joe whose voice sounded hollow in his beermug
theyll soon go soon soon go said biddy
i have been thinking joe that when i go down town on monday and order my new clothes i shall tell the tailor that ill come and put them on there or that ill have them sent to mr pumblechooks
it would be very disagreeable to be stared at by all the people here mr
and mrs hubble might like to see you in your new genteel figure too pip said joe industriously cutting his bread with his cheese on it in the palm of his left hand and glancing at my untasted supper as if he thought of the time when we used to compare slices
so might wopsle
and the jolly bargemen might take it as a compliment thats just what i dont want joe
they would make such a business of itsuch a coarse and common businessthat i couldnt bear myself ah that indeed pip said joe
if you couldnt abear yourself biddy asked me here as she sat holding my sisters plate have you thought about when youll show yourself to mr gargery and your sister and me
you will show yourself to us wont you biddy i returned with some resentment you are so exceedingly quick that its difficult to keep up with you she always were quick observed joe
if you had waited another moment biddy you would have heard me say that i shall bring my clothes here in a bundle one eveningmost likely on the evening before i go away biddy said no more
handsomely forgiving her i soon exchanged an affectionate good night with her and joe and went up to bed
when i got into my little room i sat down and took a long look at it as a mean little room that i should soon be parted from and raised above for ever
it was furnished with fresh young remembrances too and even at the same moment i fell into much the same confused division of mind between it and the better rooms to which i was going as i had been in so often between the forge and miss havishams and biddy and estella
the sun had been shining brightly all day on the roof of my attic and the room was warm
as i put the window open and stood looking out i saw joe come slowly forth at the dark door below and take a turn or two in the air and then i saw biddy come and bring him a pipe and light it for him
he never smoked so late and it seemed to hint to me that he wanted comforting for some reason or other
he presently stood at the door immediately beneath me smoking his pipe and biddy stood there too quietly talking to him and i knew that they talked of me for i heard my name mentioned in an endearing tone by both of them more than once
i would not have listened for more if i could have heard more so i drew away from the window and sat down in my one chair by the bedside feeling it very sorrowful and strange that this first night of my bright fortunes should be the loneliest i had ever known
looking towards the open window i saw light wreaths from joes pipe floating there and i fancied it was like a blessing from joenot obtruded on me or paraded before me but pervading the air we shared together
i put my light out and crept into bed and it was an uneasy bed now and i never slept the old sound sleep in it any more
chapter xix
morning made a considerable difference in my general prospect of life and brightened it so much that it scarcely seemed the same
what lay heaviest on my mind was the consideration that six days intervened between me and the day of departure for i could not divest myself of a misgiving that something might happen to london in the meanwhile and that when i got there it would be either greatly deteriorated or clean gone
joe and biddy were very sympathetic and pleasant when i spoke of our approaching separation but they only referred to it when i did
after breakfast joe brought out my indentures from the press in the best parlour and we put them in the fire and i felt that i was free
with all the novelty of my emancipation on me i went to church with joe and thought perhaps the clergyman wouldnt have read that about the rich man and the kingdom of heaven if he had known all
after our early dinner i strolled out alone purposing to finish off the marshes at once and get them done with
as i passed the church i felt as i had felt during service in the morning a sublime compassion for the poor creatures who were destined to go there sunday after sunday all their lives through and to lie obscurely at last among the low green mounds
i promised myself that i would do something for them one of these days and formed a plan in outline for bestowing a dinner of roastbeef and plumpudding a pint of ale and a gallon of condescension upon everybody in the village
if i had often thought before with something allied to shame of my companionship with the fugitive whom i had once seen limping among those graves what were my thoughts on this sunday when the place recalled the wretch ragged and shivering with his felon iron and badge
my comfort was that it happened a long time ago and that he had doubtless been transported a long way off and that he was dead to me and might be veritably dead into the bargain
no more low wet grounds no more dikes and sluices no more of these grazing cattlethough they seemed in their dull manner to wear a more respectful air now and to face round in order that they might stare as long as possible at the possessor of such great expectationsfarewell monotonous acquaintances of my childhood henceforth i was for london and greatness not for smiths work in general and for you
i made my exultant way to the old battery and lying down there to consider the question whether miss havisham intended me for estella fell asleep
when i awoke i was much surprised to find joe sitting beside me smoking his pipe
he greeted me with a cheerful smile on my opening my eyes and said as being the last time pip i thought id foller and joe i am very glad you did so thankee pip you may be sure dear joe i went on after we had shaken hands that i shall never forget you no no pip said joe in a comfortable tone im sure of that
ay ay old chap
bless you it were only necessary to get it well round in a mans mind to be certain on it
but it took a bit of time to get it well round the change come so oncommon plump didnt it somehow i was not best pleased with joes being so mightily secure of me
i should have liked him to have betrayed emotion or to have said it does you credit pip or something of that sort
therefore i made no remark on joes first head merely saying as to his second that the tidings had indeed come suddenly but that i had always wanted to be a gentleman and had often and often speculated on what i would do if i were one
have you though said joe
astonishing its a pity now joe said i that you did not get on a little more when we had our lessons here isnt it well i dont know returned joe
im so awful dull
im only master of my own trade
it were always a pity as i was so awful dull but its no more of a pity now than it wasthis day twelvemonthdont you see what i had meant was that when i came into my property and was able to do something for joe it would have been much more agreeable if he had been better qualified for a rise in station
he was so perfectly innocent of my meaning however that i thought i would mention it to biddy in preference
so when we had walked home and had had tea i took biddy into our little garden by the side of the lane and after throwing out in a general way for the elevation of her spirits that i should never forget her said i had a favour to ask of her
and it is biddy said i that you will not omit any opportunity of helping joe on a little how helping him on asked biddy with a steady sort of glance
well
joe is a dear good fellowin fact i think he is the dearest fellow that ever livedbut he is rather backward in some things
for instance biddy in his learning and his manners although i was looking at biddy as i spoke and although she opened her eyes very wide when i had spoken she did not look at me
o his manners
wont his manners do then asked biddy plucking a blackcurrant leaf
my dear biddy they do very well here o
they do very well here interrupted biddy looking closely at the leaf in her hand
hear me outbut if i were to remove joe into a higher sphere as i shall hope to remove him when i fully come into my property they would hardly do him justice and dont you think he knows that asked biddy
it was such a very provoking question for it had never in the most distant manner occurred to me that i said snappishly biddy what do you mean biddy having rubbed the leaf to pieces between her handsand the smell of a blackcurrant bush has ever since recalled to me that evening in the little garden by the side of the lanesaid have you never considered that he may be proud proud i repeated with disdainful emphasis
o
there are many kinds of pride said biddy looking full at me and shaking her head pride is not all of one kind well
what are you stopping for said i
not all of one kind resumed biddy
he may be too proud to let any one take him out of a place that he is competent to fill and fills well and with respect
to tell you the truth i think he is though it sounds bold in me to say so for you must know him far better than i do now biddy said i i am very sorry to see this in you
i did not expect to see this in you
you are envious biddy and grudging
you are dissatisfied on account of my rise in fortune and you cant help showing it if you have the heart to think so returned biddy say so
say so over and over again if you have the heart to think so if you have the heart to be so you mean biddy said i in a virtuous and superior tone dont put it off upon me
i am very sorry to see it and its aits a bad side of human nature
i did intend to ask you to use any little opportunities you might have after i was gone of improving dear joe
but after this i ask you nothing
i am extremely sorry to see this in you biddy i repeated
its aits a bad side of human nature whether you scold me or approve of me returned poor biddy you may equally depend upon my trying to do all that lies in my power here at all times
and whatever opinion you take away of me shall make no difference in my remembrance of you
yet a gentleman should not be unjust neither said biddy turning away her head
i again warmly repeated that it was a bad side of human nature in which sentiment waiving its application i have since seen reason to think i was right and i walked down the little path away from biddy and biddy went into the house and i went out at the garden gate and took a dejected stroll until suppertime again feeling it very sorrowful and strange that this the second night of my bright fortunes should be as lonely and unsatisfactory as the first
but morning once more brightened my view and i extended my clemency to biddy and we dropped the subject
putting on the best clothes i had i went into town as early as i could hope to find the shops open and presented myself before mr trabb the tailor who was having his breakfast in the parlour behind his shop and who did not think it worth his while to come out to me but called me in to him
well said mr trabb in a hailfellowwellmet kind of way
how are you and what can i do for you mr trabb had sliced his hot roll into three featherbeds and was slipping butter in between the blankets and covering it up
he was a prosperous old bachelor and his open window looked into a prosperous little garden and orchard and there was a prosperous iron safe let into the wall at the side of his fireplace and i did not doubt that heaps of his prosperity were put away in it in bags
mr
trabb said i its an unpleasant thing to have to mention because it looks like boasting but i have come into a handsome property a change passed over mr trabb
he forgot the butter in bed got up from the bedside and wiped his fingers on the tablecloth exclaiming lord bless my soul i am going up to my guardian in london said i casually drawing some guineas out of my pocket and looking at them and i want a fashionable suit of clothes to go in
i wish to pay for them i addedotherwise i thought he might only pretend to make them with ready money my dear sir said mr trabb as he respectfully bent his body opened his arms and took the liberty of touching me on the outside of each elbow dont hurt me by mentioning that
may i venture to congratulate you
would you do me the favour of stepping into the shop mr trabbs boy was the most audacious boy in all that countryside
when i had entered he was sweeping the shop and he had sweetened his labours by sweeping over me
he was still sweeping when i came out into the shop with mr trabb and he knocked the broom against all possible corners and obstacles to express as i understood it equality with any blacksmith alive or dead
hold that noise said mr trabb with the greatest sternness or ill knock your head offdo me the favour to be seated sir
now this said mr trabb taking down a roll of cloth and tiding it out in a flowing manner over the counter preparatory to getting his hand under it to show the gloss is a very sweet article
i can recommend it for your purpose sir because it really is extra super
but you shall see some others
give me number four you to the boy and with a dreadfully severe stare foreseeing the danger of that miscreants brushing me with it or making some other sign of familiarity
mr trabb never removed his stern eye from the boy until he had deposited number four on the counter and was at a safe distance again
then he commanded him to bring number five and number eight
and let me have none of your tricks here said mr trabb or you shall repent it you young scoundrel the longest day you have to live mr trabb then bent over number four and in a sort of deferential confidence recommended it to me as a light article for summer wear an article much in vogue among the nobility and gentry an article that it would ever be an honour to him to reflect upon a distinguished fellowtownsmans if he might claim me for a fellowtownsman having worn
are you bringing numbers five and eight you vagabond said mr trabb to the boy after that or shall i kick you out of the shop and bring them myself i selected the materials for a suit with the assistance of mr trabbs judgment and reentered the parlour to be measured
for although mr trabb had my measure already and had previously been quite contented with it he said apologetically that it wouldnt do under existing circumstances sirwouldnt do at all so mr trabb measured and calculated me in the parlour as if i were an estate and he the finest species of surveyor and gave himself such a world of trouble that i felt that no suit of clothes could possibly remunerate him for his pains
when he had at last done and had appointed to send the articles to mr pumblechooks on the thursday evening he said with his hand upon the parlour lock i know sir that london gentlemen cannot be expected to patronise local work as a rule but if you would give me a turn now and then in the quality of a townsman i should greatly esteem it
goodmorning sir much obligeddoor the last word was flung at the boy who had not the least notion what it meant
but i saw him collapse as his master rubbed me out with his hands and my first decided experience of the stupendous power of money was that it had morally laid upon his back trabbs boy
after this memorable event i went to the hatters and the bootmakers and the hosiers and felt rather like mother hubbards dog whose outfit required the services of so many trades
i also went to the coachoffice and took my place for seven oclock on saturday morning
it was not necessary to explain everywhere that i had come into a handsome property but whenever i said anything to that effect it followed that the officiating tradesman ceased to have his attention diverted through the window by the high street and concentrated his mind upon me
when i had ordered everything i wanted i directed my steps towards pumblechooks and as i approached that gentlemans place of business i saw him standing at his door
he was waiting for me with great impatience
he had been out early with the chaisecart and had called at the forge and heard the news
he had prepared a collation for me in the barnwell parlour and he too ordered his shopman to come out of the gangway as my sacred person passed
my dear friend said mr pumblechook taking me by both hands when he and i and the collation were alone i give you joy of your good fortune
well deserved well deserved this was coming to the point and i thought it a sensible way of expressing himself
to think said mr pumblechook after snorting admiration at me for some moments that i should have been the humble instrument of leading up to this is a proud reward i begged mr pumblechook to remember that nothing was to be ever said or hinted on that point
my dear young friend said mr pumblechook if you will allow me to call you so i murmured certainly and mr pumblechook took me by both hands again and communicated a movement to his waistcoat which had an emotional appearance though it was rather low down my dear young friend rely upon my doing my little all in your absence by keeping the fact before the mind of josephjoseph said mr pumblechook in the way of a compassionate adjuration
joseph
joseph
thereupon he shook his head and tapped it expressing his sense of deficiency in joseph
but my dear young friend said mr pumblechook you must be hungry you must be exhausted
be seated
here is a chicken had round from the boar here is a tongue had round from the boar heres one or two little things had round from the boar that i hope you may not despise
but do i said mr pumblechook getting up again the moment after he had sat down see afore me him as i ever sported with in his times of happy infancy
and may imay i this may i meant might he shake hands
i consented and he was fervent and then sat down again
here is wine said mr pumblechook
let us drink thanks to fortune and may she ever pick out her favourites with equal judgment
and yet i cannot said mr pumblechook getting up again see afore me oneand likewise drink to onewithout again expressingmay imay i i said he might and he shook hands with me again and emptied his glass and turned it upside down
i did the same and if i had turned myself upside down before drinking the wine could not have gone more direct to my head
mr pumblechook helped me to the liver wing and to the best slice of tongue none of those outoftheway no thoroughfares of pork now and took comparatively speaking no care of himself at all
ah
poultry poultry
you little thought said mr pumblechook apostrophising the fowl in the dish when you was a young fledgling what was in store for you
you little thought you was to be refreshment beneath this humble roof for one ascall it a weakness if you will said mr pumblechook getting up again but may i
may i it began to be unnecessary to repeat the form of saying he might so he did it at once
how he ever did it so often without wounding himself with my knife i dont know
and your sister he resumed after a little steady eating which had the honour of bringing you up by hand
its a sad picter to reflect that shes no longer equal to fully understanding the honour
may i saw he was about to come at me again and i stopped him
well drink her health said i
ah cried mr pumblechook leaning back in his chair quite flaccid with admiration thats the way you know em sir i dont know who sir was but he certainly was not i and there was no third person present thats the way you know the nobleminded sir
ever forgiving and ever affable
it might said the servile pumblechook putting down his untasted glass in a hurry and getting up again to a common person have the appearance of repeatingbut may i when he had done it he resumed his seat and drank to my sister
let us never be blind said mr pumblechook to her faults of temper but it is to be hoped she meant well at about this time i began to observe that he was getting flushed in the face as to myself i felt all face steeped in wine and smarting
i mentioned to mr pumblechook that i wished to have my new clothes sent to his house and he was ecstatic on my so distinguishing him
i mentioned my reason for desiring to avoid observation in the village and he lauded it to the skies
there was nobody but himself he intimated worthy of my confidence andin short might he
then he asked me tenderly if i remembered our boyish games at sums and how we had gone together to have me bound apprentice and in effect how he had ever been my favourite fancy and my chosen friend
if i had taken ten times as many glasses of wine as i had i should have known that he never had stood in that relation towards me and should in my heart of hearts have repudiated the idea
yet for all that i remember feeling convinced that i had been much mistaken in him and that he was a sensible practical goodhearted prime fellow
by degrees he fell to reposing such great confidence in me as to ask my advice in reference to his own affairs
he mentioned that there was an opportunity for a great amalgamation and monopoly of the corn and seed trade on those premises if enlarged such as had never occurred before in that or any other neighbourhood
what alone was wanting to the realisation of a vast fortune he considered to be more capital
those were the two little words more capital
now it appeared to him pumblechook that if that capital were got into the business through a sleeping partner sirwhich sleeping partner would have nothing to do but walk in by self or deputy whenever he pleased and examine the booksand walk in twice a year and take his profits away in his pocket to the tune of fifty per centit appeared to him that that might be an opening for a young gentleman of spirit combined with property which would be worthy of his attention
but what did i think
he had great confidence in my opinion and what did i think
i gave it as my opinion
wait a bit the united vastness and distinctness of this view so struck him that he no longer asked if he might shake hands with me but said he really mustand did
we drank all the wine and mr pumblechook pledged himself over and over again to keep joseph up to the mark i dont know what mark and to render me efficient and constant service i dont know what service
he also made known to me for the first time in my life and certainly after having kept his secret wonderfully well that he had always said of me that boy is no common boy and mark me his fortun will be no common fortun he said with a tearful smile that it was a singular thing to think of now and i said so too
finally i went out into the air with a dim perception that there was something unwonted in the conduct of the sunshine and found that i had slumberously got to the turnpike without having taken any account of the road
there i was roused by mr pumblechooks hailing me
he was a long way down the sunny street and was making expressive gestures for me to stop
i stopped and he came up breathless
no my dear friend said he when he had recovered wind for speech
not if i can help it
this occasion shall not entirely pass without that affability on your partmay i as an old friend and wellwisher
may i we shook hands for the hundredth time at least and he ordered a young carter out of my way with the greatest indignation
then he blessed me and stood waving his hand to me until i had passed the crook in the road and then i turned into a field and had a long nap under a hedge before i pursued my way home
i had scant luggage to take with me to london for little of the little i possessed was adapted to my new station
but i began packing that same afternoon and wildly packed up things that i knew i should want next morning in a fiction that there was not a moment to be lost
so tuesday wednesday and thursday passed and on friday morning i went to mr pumblechooks to put on my new clothes and pay my visit to miss havisham
mr pumblechooks own room was given up to me to dress in and was decorated with clean towels expressly for the event
my clothes were rather a disappointment of course
probably every new and eagerly expected garment ever put on since clothes came in fell a trifle short of the wearers expectation
but after i had had my new suit on some half an hour and had gone through an immensity of posturing with mr pumblechooks very limited dressingglass in the futile endeavour to see my legs it seemed to fit me better
it being market morning at a neighbouring town some ten miles off mr pumblechook was not at home
i had not told him exactly when i meant to leave and was not likely to shake hands with him again before departing
this was all as it should be and i went out in my new array fearfully ashamed of having to pass the shopman and suspicious after all that i was at a personal disadvantage something like joes in his sunday suit
i went circuitously to miss havishams by all the back ways and rang at the bell constrainedly on account of the stiff long fingers of my gloves
sarah pocket came to the gate and positively reeled back when she saw me so changed her walnutshell countenance likewise turned from brown to green and yellow
you said she
you
good gracious
what do you want i am going to london miss pocket said i and want to say goodbye to miss havisham i was not expected for she left me locked in the yard while she went to ask if i were to be admitted
after a very short delay she returned and took me up staring at me all the way
miss havisham was taking exercise in the room with the long spread table leaning on her crutch stick
the room was lighted as of yore and at the sound of our entrance she stopped and turned
she was then just abreast of the rotted bridecake
dont go sarah she said
well pip i start for london miss havisham tomorrow i was exceedingly careful what i said and i thought you would kindly not mind my taking leave of you this is a gay figure pip said she making her crutch stick play round me as if she the fairy godmother who had changed me were bestowing the finishing gift
i have come into such good fortune since i saw you last miss havisham i murmured
and i am so grateful for it miss havisham ay ay said she looking at the discomfited and envious sarah with delight
i have seen mr jaggers
i have heard about it pip
so you go tomorrow yes miss havisham and you are adopted by a rich person yes miss havisham not named no miss havisham and mr jaggers is made your guardian yes miss havisham she quite gloated on these questions and answers so keen was her enjoyment of sarah pockets jealous dismay
well she went on you have a promising career before you
be gooddeserve itand abide by mr jaggerss instructions she looked at me and looked at sarah and sarahs countenance wrung out of her watchful face a cruel smile
goodbye pipyou will always keep the name of pip you know yes miss havisham goodbye pip she stretched out her hand and i went down on my knee and put it to my lips
i had not considered how i should take leave of her it came naturally to me at the moment to do this
she looked at sarah pocket with triumph in her weird eyes and so i left my fairy godmother with both her hands on her crutch stick standing in the midst of the dimly lighted room beside the rotten bridecake that was hidden in cobwebs
sarah pocket conducted me down as if i were a ghost who must be seen out
she could not get over my appearance and was in the last degree confounded
i said goodbye miss pocket but she merely stared and did not seem collected enough to know that i had spoken
clear of the house i made the best of my way back to pumblechooks took off my new clothes made them into a bundle and went back home in my older dress carrying itto speak the truthmuch more at my ease too though i had the bundle to carry
and now those six days which were to have run out so slowly had run out fast and were gone and tomorrow looked me in the face more steadily than i could look at it
as the six evenings had dwindled away to five to four to three to two i had become more and more appreciative of the society of joe and biddy
on this last evening i dressed myself out in my new clothes for their delight and sat in my splendour	 until bedtime
we had a hot supper on the occasion graced by the inevitable roast fowl and we had some flip to finish with
we were all very low and none the higher for pretending to be in spirits
i was to leave our village at five in the morning carrying my little handportmanteau and i had told joe that i wished to walk away all alone
i am afraidsore afraidthat this purpose originated in my sense of the contrast there would be between me and joe if we went to the coach together
i had pretended with myself that there was nothing of this taint in the arrangement but when i went up to my little room on this last night i felt compelled to admit that it might be so and had an impulse upon me to go down again and entreat joe to walk with me in the morning
i did not
all night there were coaches in my broken sleep going to wrong places instead of to london and having in the traces now dogs now cats now pigs now mennever horses
fantastic failures of journeys occupied me until the day dawned and the birds were singing
then i got up and partly dressed and sat at the window to take a last look out and in taking it fell asleep
biddy was astir so early to get my breakfast that although i did not sleep at the window an hour i smelt the smoke of the kitchen fire when i started up with a terrible idea that it must be late in the afternoon
but long after that and long after i had heard the clinking of the teacups and was quite ready i wanted the resolution to go downstairs
after all i remained up there repeatedly unlocking and unstrapping my small portmanteau and locking and strapping it up again until biddy called to me that i was late
it was a hurried breakfast with no taste in it
i got up from the meal saying with a sort of briskness as if it had only just occurred to me well
i suppose i must be off and then i kissed my sister who was laughing and nodding and shaking in her usual chair and kissed biddy and threw my arms around joes neck
then i took up my little portmanteau and walked out
the last i saw of them was when i presently heard a scuffle behind me and looking back saw joe throwing an old shoe after me and biddy throwing another old shoe
i stopped then to wave my hat and dear old joe waved his strong right arm above his head crying huskily hooroar and biddy put her apron to her face
i walked away at a good pace thinking it was easier to go than i had supposed it would be and reflecting that it would never have done to have had an old shoe thrown after the coach in sight of all the high street
i whistled and made nothing of going
but the village was very peaceful and quiet and the light mists were solemnly rising as if to show me the world and i had been so innocent and little there and all beyond was so unknown and great that in a moment with a strong heave and sob i broke into tears
it was by the fingerpost at the end of the village and i laid my hand upon it and said goodbye o my dear dear friend heaven knows we need never be ashamed of our tears for they are rain upon the blinding dust of earth overlying our hard hearts
i was better after i had cried than beforemore sorry more aware of my own ingratitude more gentle
if i had cried before i should have had joe with me then
so subdued i was by those tears and by their breaking out again in the course of the quiet walk that when i was on the coach and it was clear of the town i deliberated with an aching heart whether i would not get down when we changed horses and walk back and have another evening at home and a better parting
we changed and i had not made up my mind and still reflected for my comfort that it would be quite practicable to get down and walk back when we changed again
and while i was occupied with these deliberations i would fancy an exact resemblance to joe in some man coming along the road towards us and my heart would beat highas if he could possibly be there
we changed again and yet again and it was now too late and too far to go back and i went on
and the mists had all solemnly risen now and the world lay spread before me
this is the end of the first stage of pips expectations
chapter xx
the journey from our town to the metropolis was a journey of about five hours
it was a little past midday when the fourhorse stagecoach by which i was a passenger got into the ravel of traffic frayed out about the cross keys wood street cheapside london
we britons had at that time particularly settled that it was treasonable to doubt our having and our being the best of everything otherwise while i was scared by the immensity of london i think i might have had some faint doubts whether it was not rather ugly crooked narrow and dirty
mr jaggers had duly sent me his address it was little britain and he had written after it on his card just out of smithfield and close by the coachoffice nevertheless a hackneycoachman who seemed to have as many capes to his greasy greatcoat as he was years old packed me up in his coach and hemmed me in with a folding and jingling barrier of steps as if he were going to take me fifty miles
his getting on his box which i remember to have been decorated with an old weatherstained peagreen hammercloth motheaten into rags was quite a work of time
it was a wonderful equipage with six great coronets outside and ragged things behind for i dont know how many footmen to hold on by and a harrow below them to prevent amateur footmen from yielding to the temptation
i had scarcely had time to enjoy the coach and to think how like a strawyard it was and yet how like a ragshop and to wonder why the horses nosebags were kept inside when i observed the coachman beginning to get down as if we were going to stop presently
and stop we presently did in a gloomy street at certain offices with an open door whereon was painted mr jaggers
how much i asked the coachman
the coachman answered a shillingunless you wish to make it more i naturally said i had no wish to make it more
then it must be a shilling observed the coachman
i dont want to get into trouble
i know him he darkly closed an eye at mr jaggerss name and shook his head
when he had got his shilling and had in course of time completed the ascent to his box and had got away which appeared to relieve his mind i went into the front office with my little portmanteau in my hand and asked was mr jaggers at home
he is not returned the clerk
he is in court at present
am i addressing mr pip i signified that he was addressing mr pip
mr
jaggers left word would you wait in his room
he couldnt say how long he might be having a case on
but it stands to reason his time being valuable that he wont be longer than he can help with those words the clerk opened a door and ushered me into an inner chamber at the back
here we found a gentleman with one eye in a velveteen suit and kneebreeches who wiped his nose with his sleeve on being interrupted in the perusal of the newspaper
go and wait outside mike said the clerk
i began to say that i hoped i was not interrupting when the clerk shoved this gentleman out with as little ceremony as i ever saw used and tossing his fur cap out after him left me alone
mr jaggerss room was lighted by a skylight only and was a most dismal place the skylight eccentrically pitched like a broken head and the distorted adjoining houses looking as if they had twisted themselves to peep down at me through it
there were not so many papers about as i should have expected to see and there were some odd objects about that i should not have expected to seesuch as an old rusty pistol a sword in a scabbard several strangelooking boxes and packages and two dreadful casts on a shelf of faces peculiarly swollen and twitchy about the nose
mr jaggerss own highbacked chair was of deadly black horsehair with rows of brass nails round it like a coffin and i fancied i could see how he leaned back in it and bit his forefinger at the clients
the room was but small and the clients seemed to have had a habit of backing up against the wall the wall especially opposite to mr jaggerss chair being greasy with shoulders
i recalled too that the oneeyed gentleman had shuffled forth against the wall when i was the innocent cause of his being turned out
i sat down in the cliental chair placed over against mr jaggerss chair and became fascinated by the dismal atmosphere of the place
i called to mind that the clerk had the same air of knowing something to everybody elses disadvantage as his master had
i wondered how many other clerks there were upstairs and whether they all claimed to have the same detrimental mastery of their fellowcreatures
i wondered what was the history of all the odd litter about the room and how it came there
i wondered whether the two swollen faces were of mr jaggerss family and if he were so unfortunate as to have had a pair of such illlooking relations why he stuck them on that dusty perch for the blacks and flies to settle on instead of giving them a place at home
of course i had no experience of a london summer day and my spirits may have been oppressed by the hot exhausted air and by the dust and grit that lay thick on everything
but i sat wondering and waiting in mr jaggerss close room until i really could not bear the two casts on the shelf above mr jaggerss chair and got up and went out
when i told the clerk that i would take a turn in the air while i waited he advised me to go round the corner and i should come into smithfield
so i came into smithfield and the shameful place being all asmear with filth and fat and blood and foam seemed to stick to me
so i rubbed it off with all possible speed by turning into a street where i saw the great black dome of saint pauls bulging at me from behind a grim stone building which a bystander said was newgate prison
following the wall of the jail i found the roadway covered with straw to deaden the noise of passing vehicles and from this and from the quantity of people standing about smelling strongly of spirits and beer i inferred that the trials were on
while i looked about me here an exceedingly dirty and partially drunk minister of justice asked me if i would like to step in and hear a trial or so informing me that he could give me a front place for half a crown whence i should command a full view of the lord chief justice in his wig and robesmentioning that awful personage like waxwork and presently offering him at the reduced price of eighteenpence
as i declined the proposal on the plea of an appointment he was so good as to take me into a yard and show me where the gallows was kept and also where people were publicly whipped and then he showed me the debtors door out of which culprits came to be hanged heightening the interest of that dreadful portal by giving me to understand that four on em would come out at that door the day after tomorrow at eight in the morning to be killed in a row
this was horrible and gave me a sickening idea of london the more so as the lord chief justices proprietor wore from his hat down to his boots and up again to his pockethandkerchief inclusive mildewed clothes which had evidently not belonged to him originally and which i took it into my head he had bought cheap of the executioner
under these circumstances i thought myself well rid of him for a shilling
i dropped into the office to ask if mr jaggers had come in yet and i found he had not and i strolled out again
this time i made the tour of little britain and turned into bartholomew close and now i became aware that other people were waiting about for mr jaggers as well as i
there were two men of secret appearance lounging in bartholomew close and thoughtfully fitting their feet into the cracks of the pavement as they talked together one of whom said to the other when they first passed me that jaggers would do it if it was to be done there was a knot of three men and two women standing at a corner and one of the women was crying on her dirty shawl and the other comforted her by saying as she pulled her own shawl over her shoulders jaggers is for him melia and what more could you have there was a redeyed little jew who came into the close while i was loitering there in company with a second little jew whom he sent upon an errand and while the messenger was gone i remarked this jew who was of a highly excitable temperament performing a jig of anxiety under a lamppost and accompanying himself in a kind of frenzy with the words o jaggerth jaggerth jaggerth
all otherth ith cagmaggerth give me jaggerth these testimonies to the popularity of my guardian made a deep impression on me and i admired and wondered more than ever
at length as i was looking out at the iron gate of bartholomew close into little britain i saw mr jaggers coming across the road towards me
all the others who were waiting saw him at the same time and there was quite a rush at him
mr jaggers putting a hand on my shoulder and walking me on at his side without saying anything to me addressed himself to his followers
first he took the two secret men
now i have nothing to say to you said mr jaggers throwing his finger at them
i want to know no more than i know
as to the result its a tossup
i told you from the first it was a tossup
have you paid wemmick we made the money up this morning sir said one of the men submissively while the other perused mr jaggerss face
i dont ask you when you made it up or where or whether you made it up at all
has wemmick got it yes sir said both the men together
very well then you may go
now i wont have it said mr jaggers waving his hand at them to put them behind him
if you say a word to me ill throw up the case we thought mr jaggers one of the men began pulling off his hat
thats what i told you not to do said mr jaggers
you thought
i think for you thats enough for you
if i want you i know where to find you i dont want you to find me
now i wont have it
i wont hear a word the two men looked at one another as mr jaggers waved them behind again and humbly fell back and were heard no more
and now you said mr jaggers suddenly stopping and turning on the two women with the shawls from whom the three men had meekly separatedoh
amelia is it yes mr jaggers and do you remember retorted mr jaggers that but for me you wouldnt be here and couldnt be here o yes sir exclaimed both women together
lord bless you sir well we knows that then why said mr jaggers do you come here my bill sir the crying woman pleaded
now i tell you what said mr jaggers
once for all
if you dont know that your bills in good hands i know it
and if you come here bothering about your bill ill make an example of both your bill and you and let him slip through my fingers
have you paid wemmick o yes sir
every farden very well
then you have done all you have got to do
say another wordone single wordand wemmick shall give you your money back this terrible threat caused the two women to fall off immediately
no one remained now but the excitable jew who had already raised the skirts of mr jaggerss coat to his lips several times
i dont know this man said mr jaggers in the same devastating strain what does this fellow want ma thear mithter jaggerth
hown brother to habraham latharuth whos he said mr jaggers
let go of my coat the suitor kissing the hem of the garment again before relinquishing it replied habraham latharuth on thuthpithion of plate youre too late said mr jaggers
i am over the way holy father mithter jaggerth cried my excitable acquaintance turning white dont thay youre again habraham latharuth i am said mr jaggers and theres an end of it

half a quarter of a moment
if youd have the condethenthun to be bought off from the tother thideat hany thuperior prithemoney no objectmithter jaggerthmithter my guardian threw his supplicant off with supreme indifference and left him dancing on the pavement as if it were red hot
without further interruption we reached the front office where we found the clerk and the man in velveteen with the fur cap
heres mike said the clerk getting down from his stool and approaching mr jaggers confidentially
oh said mr jaggers turning to the man who was pulling a lock of hair in the middle of his forehead like the bull in cock robin pulling at the bellrope your man comes on this afternoon
well well masr jaggers returned mike in the voice of a sufferer from a constitutional cold arter a deal o trouble ive found one sir as might do what is he prepared to swear well masr jaggers said mike wiping his nose on his fur cap this time in a general way anythink mr jaggers suddenly became most irate
now i warned you before said he throwing his forefinger at the terrified client that if you ever presumed to talk in that way here id make an example of you
you infernal scoundrel how dare you tell me that the client looked scared but bewildered too as if he were unconscious what he had done
spooney said the clerk in a low voice giving him a stir with his elbow
soft head
need you say it face to face now i ask you you blundering booby said my guardian very sternly once more and for the last time what the man you have brought here is prepared to swear mike looked hard at my guardian as if he were trying to learn a lesson from his face and slowly replied ayther to character or to having been in his company and never left him all the night in question now be careful
in what station of life is this man mike looked at his cap and looked at the floor and looked at the ceiling and looked at the clerk and even looked at me before beginning to reply in a nervous manner weve dressed him up like when my guardian blustered out what
you will will you spooney added the clerk again with another stir
after some helpless casting about mike brightened and began again he is dressed like a spectable pieman
a sort of a pastrycook is he here asked my guardian
i left him said mike a setting on some doorsteps round the corner take him past that window and let me see him the window indicated was the office window
we all three went to it behind the wire blind and presently saw the client go by in an accidental manner with a murderouslooking tall individual in a short suit of white linen and a paper cap
this guileless confectioner was not by any means sober and had a black eye in the green stage of recovery which was painted over
tell him to take his witness away directly said my guardian to the clerk in extreme disgust and ask him what he means by bringing such a fellow as that my guardian then took me into his own room and while he lunched standing from a sandwichbox and a pocketflask of sherry he seemed to bully his very sandwich as he ate it informed me what arrangements he had made for me
i was to go to barnards inn to young mr pockets rooms where a bed had been sent in for my accommodation i was to remain with young mr pocket until monday on monday i was to go with him to his fathers house on a visit that i might try how i liked it
also i was told what my allowance was to beit was a very liberal oneand had handed to me from one of my guardians drawers the cards of certain tradesmen with whom i was to deal for all kinds of clothes and such other things as i could in reason want
you will find your credit good mr pip said my guardian whose flask of sherry smelt like a whole caskful as he hastily refreshed himself but i shall by this means be able to check your bills and to pull you up if i find you outrunning the constable
of course youll go wrong somehow but thats no fault of mine after i had pondered a little over this encouraging sentiment i asked mr jaggers if i could send for a coach
he said it was not worth while i was so near my destination wemmick should walk round with me if i pleased
i then found that wemmick was the clerk in the next room
another clerk was rung down from upstairs to take his place while he was out and i accompanied him into the street after shaking hands with my guardian
we found a new set of people lingering outside but wemmick made a way among them by saying coolly yet decisively i tell you its no use he wont have a word to say to one of you and we soon got clear of them and went on side by side
chapter xxi
casting my eyes on mr wemmick as we went along to see what he was like in the light of day i found him to be a dry man rather short in stature with a square wooden face whose expression seemed to have been imperfectly chipped out with a dulledged chisel
there were some marks in it that might have been dimples if the material had been softer and the instrument finer but which as it was were only dints
the chisel had made three or four of these attempts at embellishment over his nose but had given them up without an effort to smooth them off
i judged him to be a bachelor from the frayed condition of his linen and he appeared to have sustained a good many bereavements for he wore at least four mourning rings besides a brooch representing a lady and a weeping willow at a tomb with an urn on it
i noticed too that several rings and seals hung at his watchchain as if he were quite laden with remembrances of departed friends
he had glittering eyessmall keen and blackand thin wide mottled lips
he had had them to the best of my belief from forty to fifty years
so you were never in london before said mr wemmick to me
no said i
i was new here once said mr wemmick
rum to think of now you are well acquainted with it now why yes said mr wemmick
i know the moves of it is it a very wicked place i asked more for the sake of saying something than for information
you may get cheated robbed and murdered in london
but there are plenty of people anywhere wholl do that for you if there is bad blood between you and them said i to soften it off a little
o
i dont know about bad blood returned mr wemmick theres not much bad blood about
theyll do it if theres anything to be got by it that makes it worse you think so returned mr wemmick
much about the same i should say he wore his hat on the back of his head and looked straight before him walking in a selfcontained way as if there were nothing in the streets to claim his attention
his mouth was such a postoffice of a mouth that he had a mechanical appearance of smiling
we had got to the top of holborn hill before i knew that it was merely a mechanical appearance and that he was not smiling at all
do you know where mr matthew pocket lives i asked mr wemmick
yes said he nodding in the direction
at hammersmith west of london is that far well
say five miles do you know him why youre a regular crossexaminer said mr wemmick looking at me with an approving air
yes i know him
i know him there was an air of toleration or depreciation about his utterance of these words that rather depressed me and i was still looking sideways at his block of a face in search of any encouraging note to the text when he said here we were at barnards inn
my depression was not alleviated by the announcement for i had supposed that establishment to be an hotel kept by mr barnard to which the blue boar in our town was a mere publichouse
whereas i now found barnard to be a disembodied spirit or a fiction and his inn the dingiest collection of shabby buildings ever squeezed together in a rank corner as a club for tomcats
we entered this haven through a wicketgate and were disgorged by an introductory passage into a melancholy little square that looked to me like a flat buryingground
i thought it had the most dismal trees in it and the most dismal sparrows and the most dismal cats and the most dismal houses in number half a dozen or so that i had ever seen
i thought the windows of the sets of chambers into which those houses were divided were in every stage of dilapidated blind and curtain crippled flowerpot cracked glass dusty decay and miserable makeshift while to let to let to let glared at me from empty rooms as if no new wretches ever came there and the vengeance of the soul of barnard were being slowly appeased by the gradual suicide of the present occupants and their unholy interment under the gravel
a frowzy mourning of soot and smoke attired this forlorn creation of barnard and it had strewn ashes on its head and was undergoing penance and humiliation as a mere dusthole
thus far my sense of sight while dry rot and wet rot and all the silent rots that rot in neglected roof and cellarrot of rat and mouse and bug and coachingstables near at hand besidesaddressed themselves faintly to my sense of smell and moaned try barnards mixture so imperfect was this realisation of the first of my great expectations that i looked in dismay at mr wemmick
ah said he mistaking me the retirement reminds you of the country
so it does me he led me into a corner and conducted me up a flight of stairswhich appeared to me to be slowly collapsing into sawdust so that one of those days the upper lodgers would look out at their doors and find themselves without the means of coming downto a set of chambers on the top floor
mr pocket jun was painted on the door and there was a label on the letterbox return shortly he hardly thought youd come so soon mr wemmick explained
you dont want me any more no thank you said i
as i keep the cash mr wemmick observed we shall most likely meet pretty often
good day good day i put out my hand and mr wemmick at first looked at it as if he thought i wanted something
then he looked at me and said correcting himself to be sure
yes
youre in the habit of shaking hands i was rather confused thinking it must be out of the london fashion but said yes
i have got so out of it said mr wemmickexcept at last
very glad im sure to make your acquaintance
good day when we had shaken hands and he was gone i opened the staircase window and had nearly beheaded myself for the lines had rotted away and it came down like the guillotine
happily it was so quick that i had not put my head out
after this escape i was content to take a foggy view of the inn through the windows encrusting dirt and to stand dolefully looking out saying to myself that london was decidedly overrated
mr pocket juniors idea of shortly was not mine for i had nearly maddened myself with looking out for half an hour and had written my name with my finger several times in the dirt of every pane in the window before i heard footsteps on the stairs
gradually there arose before me the hat head neckcloth waistcoat trousers boots of a member of society of about my own standing
he had a paperbag under each arm and a pottle of strawberries in one hand and was out of breath
mr
pip said he
mr
pocket said i
dear me he exclaimed
i am extremely sorry but i knew there was a coach from your part of the country at midday and i thought you would come by that one
the fact is i have been out on your accountnot that that is any excusefor i thought coming from the country you might like a little fruit after dinner and i went to covent garden market to get it good for a reason that i had i felt as if my eyes would start out of my head
i acknowledged his attention incoherently and began to think this was a dream
dear me said mr pocket junior
this door sticks so as he was fast making jam of his fruit by wrestling with the door while the paperbags were under his arms i begged him to allow me to hold them
he relinquished them with an agreeable smile and combated with the door as if it were a wild beast
it yielded so suddenly at last that he staggered back upon me and i staggered back upon the opposite door and we both laughed
but still i felt as if my eyes must start out of my head and as if this must be a dream
pray come in said mr pocket junior
allow me to lead the way
i am rather bare here but i hope youll be able to make out tolerably well till monday
my father thought you would get on more agreeably through tomorrow with me than with him and might like to take a walk about london
i am sure i shall be very happy to show london to you
as to our table you wont find that bad i hope for it will be supplied from our coffeehouse here and it is only right i should add at your expense such being mr jaggerss directions
as to our lodging its not by any means splendid because i have my own bread to earn and my father hasnt anything to give me and i shouldnt be willing to take it if he had
this is our sittingroomjust such chairs and tables and carpet and so forth you see as they could spare from home
you mustnt give me credit for the tablecloth and spoons and castors because they come for you from the coffeehouse
this is my little bedroom rather musty but barnards is musty
this is your bedroom the furnitures hired for the occasion but i trust it will answer the purpose if you should want anything ill go and fetch it
the chambers are retired and we shall be alone together but we shant fight i dare say
but dear me i beg your pardon youre holding the fruit all this time
pray let me take these bags from you
i am quite ashamed as i stood opposite to mr pocket junior delivering him the bags one two i saw the starting appearance come into his own eyes that i knew to be in mine and he said falling back lord bless me youre the prowling boy and you said i are the pale young gentleman chapter xxii
the pale young gentleman and i stood contemplating one another in barnards inn until we both burst out laughing
the idea of its being you said he
the idea of its being you said i
and then we contemplated one another afresh and laughed again
well said the pale young gentleman reaching out his hand goodhumouredly its all over now i hope and it will be magnanimous in you if youll forgive me for having knocked you about so i derived from this speech that mr herbert pocket for herbert was the pale young gentlemans name still rather confounded his intention with his execution
but i made a modest reply and we shook hands warmly
you hadnt come into your good fortune at that time said herbert pocket
no said i
no he acquiesced i heard it had happened very lately
i was rather on the lookout for good fortune then indeed yes
miss havisham had sent for me to see if she could take a fancy to me
but she couldntat all events she didnt i thought it polite to remark that i was surprised to hear that
bad taste said herbert laughing but a fact
yes she had sent for me on a trial visit and if i had come out of it successfully i suppose i should have been provided for perhaps i should have been whatyoumaycalled it to estella whats that i asked with sudden gravity
he was arranging his fruit in plates while we talked which divided his attention and was the cause of his having made this lapse of a word
affianced he explained still busy with the fruit
betrothed
engaged
whatshisnamed
any word of that sort how did you bear your disappointment i asked
pooh said he i didnt care much for it
shes a tartar miss havisham i dont say no to that but i meant estella
that girls hard and haughty and capricious to the last degree and has been brought up by miss havisham to wreak revenge on all the male sex what relation is she to miss havisham none said he
only adopted why should she wreak revenge on all the male sex
what revenge lord mr pip said he
dont you know no said i
dear me
its quite a story and shall be saved till dinnertime
and now let me take the liberty of asking you a question
how did you come there that day i told him and he was attentive until i had finished and then burst out laughing again and asked me if i was sore afterwards
i didnt ask him if he was for my conviction on that point was perfectly established
mr
jaggers is your guardian i understand he went on
yes you know he is miss havishams man of business and solicitor and has her confidence when nobody else has this was bringing me i felt towards dangerous ground
i answered with a constraint i made no attempt to disguise that i had seen mr jaggers in miss havishams house on the very day of our combat but never at any other time and that i believed he had no recollection of having ever seen me there
he was so obliging as to suggest my father for your tutor and he called on my father to propose it
of course he knew about my father from his connection with miss havisham
my father is miss havishams cousin not that that implies familiar intercourse between them for he is a bad courtier and will not propitiate her herbert pocket had a frank and easy way with him that was very taking
i had never seen any one then and i have never seen any one since who more strongly expressed to me in every look and tone a natural incapacity to do anything secret and mean
there was something wonderfully hopeful about his general air and something that at the same time whispered to me he would never be very successful or rich
i dont know how this was
i became imbued with the notion on that first occasion before we sat down to dinner but i cannot define by what means
he was still a pale young gentleman and had a certain conquered languor about him in the midst of his spirits and briskness that did not seem indicative of natural strength
he had not a handsome face but it was better than handsome being extremely amiable and cheerful
his figure was a little ungainly as in the days when my knuckles had taken such liberties with it but it looked as if it would always be light and young
whether mr trabbs local work would have sat more gracefully on him than on me may be a question but i am conscious that he carried off his rather old clothes much better than i carried off my new suit
as he was so communicative i felt that reserve on my part would be a bad return unsuited to our years
i therefore told him my small story and laid stress on my being forbidden to inquire who my benefactor was
i further mentioned that as i had been brought up a blacksmith in a country place and knew very little of the ways of politeness i would take it as a great kindness in him if he would give me a hint whenever he saw me at a loss or going wrong
with pleasure said he though i venture to prophesy that youll want very few hints
i dare say we shall be often together and i should like to banish any needless restraint between us
will you do me the favour to begin at once to call me by my christian name herbert i thanked him and said i would
i informed him in exchange that my christian name was philip
i dont take to philip said he smiling for it sounds like a moral boy out of the spellingbook who was so lazy that he fell into a pond or so fat that he couldnt see out of his eyes or so avaricious that he locked up his cake till the mice ate it or so determined to go a birdsnesting that he got himself eaten by bears who lived handy in the neighbourhood
i tell you what i should like
we are so harmonious and you have been a blacksmithwould you mind it i shouldnt mind anything that you propose i answered but i dont understand you would you mind handel for a familiar name
theres a charming piece of music by handel called the harmonious blacksmith i should like it very much then my dear handel said he turning round as the door opened here is the dinner and i must beg of you to take the top of the table because the dinner is of your providing this i would not hear of so he took the top and i faced him
it was a nice little dinnerseemed to me then a very lord mayors feastand it acquired additional relish from being eaten under those independent circumstances with no old people by and with london all around us
this again was heightened by a certain gypsy character that set the banquet off for while the table was as mr pumblechook might have said the lap of luxurybeing entirely furnished forth from the coffeehousethe circumjacent region of sittingroom was of a comparatively pastureless and shifty character imposing on the waiter the wandering habits of putting the covers on the floor where he fell over them the melted butter in the armchair the bread on the bookshelves the cheese in the coalscuttle and the boiled fowl into my bed in the next roomwhere i found much of its parsley and butter in a state of congelation when i retired for the night
all this made the feast delightful and when the waiter was not there to watch me my pleasure was without alloy
we had made some progress in the dinner when i reminded herbert of his promise to tell me about miss havisham
true he replied
ill redeem it at once
let me introduce the topic handel by mentioning that in london it is not the custom to put the knife in the mouthfor fear of accidentsand that while the fork is reserved for that use it is not put further in than necessary
it is scarcely worth mentioning only its as well to do as other people do
also the spoon is not generally used overhand but under
this has two advantages
you get at your mouth better which after all is the object and you save a good deal of the attitude of opening oysters on the part of the right elbow he offered these friendly suggestions in such a lively way that we both laughed and i scarcely blushed
now he pursued concerning miss havisham
miss havisham you must know was a spoilt child
her mother died when she was a baby and her father denied her nothing
her father was a country gentleman down in your part of the world and was a brewer
i dont know why it should be a crack thing to be a brewer but it is indisputable that while you cannot possibly be genteel and bake you may be as genteel as never was and brew
you see it every day yet a gentleman may not keep a publichouse may he said i
not on any account returned herbert but a publichouse may keep a gentleman
well
mr havisham was very rich and very proud
so was his daughter miss havisham was an only child i hazarded
stop a moment i am coming to that
no she was not an only child she had a halfbrother
her father privately married againhis cook i rather think i thought he was proud said i
my good handel so he was
he married his second wife privately because he was proud and in course of time she died
when she was dead i apprehend he first told his daughter what he had done and then the son became a part of the family residing in the house you are acquainted with
as the son grew a young man he turned out riotous extravagant undutifulaltogether bad
at last his father disinherited him but he softened when he was dying and left him well off though not nearly so well off as miss havishamtake another glass of wine and excuse my mentioning that society as a body does not expect one to be so strictly conscientious in emptying ones glass as to turn it bottom upwards with the rim on ones nose i had been doing this in an excess of attention to his recital
i thanked him and apologised
he said not at all and resumed
miss havisham was now an heiress and you may suppose was looked after as a great match
her halfbrother had now ample means again but what with debts and what with new madness wasted them most fearfully again
there were stronger differences between him and her than there had been between him and his father and it is suspected that he cherished a deep and mortal grudge against her as having influenced the fathers anger
now i come to the cruel part of the storymerely breaking off my dear handel to remark that a dinnernapkin will not go into a tumbler why i was trying to pack mine into my tumbler i am wholly unable to say
i only know that i found myself with a perseverance worthy of a much better cause making the most strenuous exertions to compress it within those limits
again i thanked him and apologised and again he said in the cheerfullest manner not at all i am sure and resumed
there appeared upon the scenesay at the races or the public balls or anywhere else you likea certain man who made love to miss havisham
i never saw him for this happened fiveandtwenty years ago before you and i were handel but i have heard my father mention that he was a showy man and the kind of man for the purpose
but that he was not to be without ignorance or prejudice mistaken for a gentleman my father most strongly asseverates because it is a principle of his that no man who was not a true gentleman at heart ever was since the world began a true gentleman in manner
he says no varnish can hide the grain of the wood and that the more varnish you put on the more the grain will express itself
well
this man pursued miss havisham closely and professed to be devoted to her
i believe she had not shown much susceptibility up to that time but all the susceptibility she possessed certainly came out then and she passionately loved him
there is no doubt that she perfectly idolized him
he practised on her affection in that systematic way that he got great sums of money from her and he induced her to buy her brother out of a share in the brewery which had been weakly left him by his father at an immense price on the plea that when he was her husband he must hold and manage it all
your guardian was not at that time in miss havishams counsels and she was too haughty and too much in love to be advised by any one
her relations were poor and scheming with the exception of my father he was poor enough but not timeserving or jealous
the only independent one among them he warned her that she was doing too much for this man and was placing herself too unreservedly in his power
she took the first opportunity of angrily ordering my father out of the house in his presence and my father has never seen her since i thought of her having said matthew will come and see me at last when i am laid dead upon that table and i asked herbert whether his father was so inveterate against her
its not that said he but she charged him in the presence of her intended husband with being disappointed in the hope of fawning upon her for his own advancement and if he were to go to her now it would look trueeven to himand even to her
to return to the man and make an end of him
the marriage day was fixed the wedding dresses were bought the wedding tour was planned out the wedding guests were invited
the day came but not the bridegroom
he wrote her a letter which she received i struck in when she was dressing for her marriage
at twenty minutes to nine at the hour and minute said herbert nodding at which she afterwards stopped all the clocks
what was in it further than that it most heartlessly broke the marriage off i cant tell you because i dont know
when she recovered from a bad illness that she had she laid the whole place waste as you have seen it and she has never since looked upon the light of day is that all the story i asked after considering it
all i know of it and indeed i only know so much through piecing it out for myself for my father always avoids it and even when miss havisham invited me to go there told me no more of it than it was absolutely requisite i should understand
but i have forgotten one thing
it has been supposed that the man to whom she gave her misplaced confidence acted throughout in concert with her halfbrother that it was a conspiracy between them and that they shared the profits i wonder he didnt marry her and get all the property said i
he may have been married already and her cruel mortification may have been a part of her halfbrothers scheme said herbert
mind
i dont know that what became of the two men i asked after again considering the subject
they fell into deeper shame and degradationif there can be deeperand ruin are they alive now i dont know you said just now that estella was not related to miss havisham but adopted
when adopted herbert shrugged his shoulders
there has always been an estella since i have heard of a miss havisham
i know no more
and now handel said he finally throwing off the story as it were there is a perfectly open understanding between us
all that i know about miss havisham you know and all that i know i retorted you know i fully believe it
so there can be no competition or perplexity between you and me
and as to the condition on which you hold your advancement in lifenamely that you are not to inquire or discuss to whom you owe ityou may be very sure that it will never be encroached upon or even approached by me or by any one belonging to me in truth he said this with so much delicacy that i felt the subject done with even though i should be under his fathers roof for years and years to come
yet he said it with so much meaning too that i felt he as perfectly understood miss havisham to be my benefactress as i understood the fact myself
it had not occurred to me before that he had led up to the theme for the purpose of clearing it out of our way but we were so much the lighter and easier for having broached it that i now perceived this to be the case
we were very gay and sociable and i asked him in the course of conversation what he was
he replied a capitalistan insurer of ships i suppose he saw me glancing about the room in search of some tokens of shipping or capital for he added in the city i had grand ideas of the wealth and importance of insurers of ships in the city and i began to think with awe of having laid a young insurer on his back blackened his enterprising eye and cut his responsible head open
but again there came upon me for my relief that odd impression that herbert pocket would never be very successful or rich
i shall not rest satisfied with merely employing my capital in insuring ships
i shall buy up some good life assurance shares and cut into the direction
i shall also do a little in the mining way
none of these things will interfere with my chartering a few thousand tons on my own account
i think i shall trade said he leaning back in his chair to the east indies for silks shawls spices dyes drugs and precious woods
its an interesting trade and the profits are large said i
tremendous said he
i wavered again and began to think here were greater expectations than my own
illustration i think i shall trade also said he putting his thumbs in his waistcoat pockets to the west indies for sugar tobacco and rum
also to ceylon especially for elephants tusks you will want a good many ships said i
a perfect fleet said he
quite overpowered by the magnificence of these transactions i asked him where the ships he insured mostly traded to at present
i havent begun insuring yet he replied
i am looking about me somehow that pursuit seemed more in keeping with barnards inn
i said in a tone of conviction ahh yes
i am in a countinghouse and looking about me is a countinghouse profitable i asked
todo you mean to the young fellow whos in it he asked in reply
yes to you why nno not to me he said this with the air of one carefully reckoning up and striking a balance
not directly profitable
that is it doesnt pay me anything and i have tokeep myself this certainly had not a profitable appearance and i shook my head as if i would imply that it would be difficult to lay by much accumulative capital from such a source of income
but the thing is said herbert pocket that you look about you
thats the grand thing
you are in a countinghouse you know and you look about you it struck me as a singular implication that you couldnt be out of a countinghouse you know and look about you but i silently deferred to his experience
then the time comes said herbert when you see your opening
and you go in and you swoop upon it and you make your capital and then there you are
when you have once made your capital you have nothing to do but employ it this was very like his way of conducting that encounter in the garden very like
his manner of bearing his poverty too exactly corresponded to his manner of bearing that defeat
it seemed to me that he took all blows and buffets now with just the same air as he had taken mine then
it was evident that he had nothing around him but the simplest necessaries for everything that i remarked upon turned out to have been sent in on my account from the coffeehouse or somewhere else
yet having already made his fortune in his own mind he was so unassuming with it that i felt quite grateful to him for not being puffed up
it was a pleasant addition to his naturally pleasant ways and we got on famously
in the evening we went out for a walk in the streets and went halfprice to the theatre and next day we went to church at westminster abbey and in the afternoon we walked in the parks and i wondered who shod all the horses there and wished joe did
on a moderate computation it was many months that sunday since i had left joe and biddy
the space interposed between myself and them partook of that expansion and our marshes were any distance off
that i could have been at our old church in my old churchgoing clothes on the very last sunday that ever was seemed a combination of impossibilities geographical and social solar and lunar
yet in the london streets so crowded with people and so brilliantly lighted in the dusk of evening there were depressing hints of reproaches for that i had put the poor old kitchen at home so far away and in the dead of night the footsteps of some incapable impostor of a porter mooning about barnards inn under pretence of watching it fell hollow on my heart
on the monday morning at a quarter before nine herbert went to the countinghouse to report himselfto look about him too i supposeand i bore him company
he was to come away in an hour or two to attend me to hammersmith and i was to wait about for him
it appeared to me that the eggs from which young insurers were hatched were incubated in dust and heat like the eggs of ostriches judging from the places to which those incipient giants repaired on a monday morning
nor did the countinghouse where herbert assisted show in my eyes as at all a good observatory being a back second floor up a yard of a grimy presence in all particulars and with a look into another back second floor rather than a look out
i waited about until it was noon and i went upon change and i saw fluey men sitting there under the bills about shipping whom i took to be great merchants though i couldnt understand why they should all be out of spirits
when herbert came we went and had lunch at a celebrated house which i then quite venerated but now believe to have been the most abject superstition in europe and where i could not help noticing even then that there was much more gravy on the tablecloths and knives and waiters clothes than in the steaks
this collation disposed of at a moderate price considering the grease which was not charged for we went back to barnards inn and got my little portmanteau and then took coach for hammersmith
we arrived there at two or three oclock in the afternoon and had very little way to walk to mr pockets house
lifting the latch of a gate we passed direct into a little garden overlooking the river where mr pockets children were playing about
and unless i deceive myself on a point where my interests or prepossessions are certainly not concerned i saw that mr and mrs pockets children were not growing up or being brought up but were tumbling up
mrs pocket was sitting on a garden chair under a tree reading with her legs upon another garden chair and mrs pockets two nursemaids were looking about them while the children played
mamma said herbert this is young mr pip upon which mrs pocket received me with an appearance of amiable dignity
master alick and miss jane cried one of the nurses to two of the children if you go a bouncing up against them bushes youll fall over into the river and be drownded and whatll your pa say then at the same time this nurse picked up mrs pockets handkerchief and said if that dont make six times youve dropped it mum upon which mrs pocket laughed and said thank you flopson and settling herself in one chair only resumed her book
her countenance immediately assumed a knitted and intent expression as if she had been reading for a week but before she could have read half a dozen lines she fixed her eyes upon me and said i hope your mamma is quite well this unexpected inquiry put me into such a difficulty that i began saying in the absurdest way that if there had been any such person i had no doubt she would have been quite well and would have been very much obliged and would have sent her compliments when the nurse came to my rescue
well she cried picking up the pockethandkerchief if that dont make seven times
what are you adoing of this afternoon mum mrs pocket received her property at first with a look of unutterable surprise as if she had never seen it before and then with a laugh of recognition and said thank you flopson and forgot me and went on reading
i found now i had leisure to count them that there were no fewer than six little pockets present in various stages of tumbling up
i had scarcely arrived at the total when a seventh was heard as in the region of air wailing dolefully
if there aint baby said flopson appearing to think it most surprising
make haste up millers millers who was the other nurse retired into the house and by degrees the childs wailing was hushed and stopped as if it were a young ventriloquist with something in its mouth
mrs pocket read all the time and i was curious to know what the book could be
we were waiting i supposed for mr pocket to come out to us at any rate we waited there and so i had an opportunity of observing the remarkable family phenomenon that whenever any of the children strayed near mrs pocket in their play they always tripped themselves up and tumbled over heralways very much to her momentary astonishment and their own more enduring lamentation
i was at a loss to account for this surprising circumstance and could not help giving my mind to speculations about it until by and by millers came down with the baby which baby was handed to flopson which flopson was handing it to mrs pocket when she too went fairly head foremost over mrs pocket baby and all and was caught by herbert and myself
gracious me flopson said mrs pocket looking off her book for a moment everybodys tumbling gracious you indeed mum returned flopson very red in the face what have you got there i got here flopson asked mrs pocket
why if it aint your footstool cried flopson
and if you keep it under your skirts like that whos to help tumbling
here
take the baby mum and give me your book mrs pocket acted on the advice and inexpertly danced the infant a little in her lap while the other children played about it
this had lasted but a very short time when mrs pocket issued summary orders that they were all to be taken into the house for a nap
thus i made the second discovery on that first occasion that the nurture of the little pockets consisted of alternately tumbling up and lying down
under these circumstances when flopson and millers had got the children into the house like a little flock of sheep and mr pocket came out of it to make my acquaintance i was not much surprised to find that mr pocket was a gentleman with a rather perplexed expression of face and with his very grey hair disordered on his head as if he didnt quite see his way to putting anything straight
chapter xxiii
mr pocket said he was glad to see me and he hoped i was not sorry to see him
for i really am not he added with his sons smile an alarming personage he was a younglooking man in spite of his perplexities and his very grey hair and his manner seemed quite natural
i use the word natural in the sense of its being unaffected there was something comic in his distraught way as though it would have been downright ludicrous but for his own perception that it was very near being so
when he had talked with me a little he said to mrs pocket with a rather anxious contraction of his eyebrows which were black and handsome belinda i hope you have welcomed mr pip and she looked up from her book and said yes she then smiled upon me in an absent state of mind and asked me if i liked the taste of orangeflower water
as the question had no bearing near or remote on any foregone or subsequent transaction i consider it to have been thrown out like her previous approaches in general conversational condescension
i found out within a few hours and may mention at once that mrs pocket was the only daughter of a certain quite accidental deceased knight who had invented for himself a conviction that his deceased father would have been made a baronet but for somebodys determined opposition arising out of entirely personal motivesi forget whose if i ever knewthe sovereigns the prime ministers the lord chancellors the archbishop of canterburys anybodysand had tacked himself on to the nobles of the earth in right of this quite supposititious fact
i believe he had been knighted himself for storming the english grammar at the point of the pen in a desperate address engrossed on vellum on the occasion of the laying of the first stone of some building or other and for handing some royal personage either the trowel or the mortar
be that as it may he had directed mrs pocket to be brought up from her cradle as one who in the nature of things must marry a title and who was to be guarded from the acquisition of plebeian domestic knowledge
so successful a watch and ward had been established over the young lady by this judicious parent that she had grown up highly ornamental but perfectly helpless and useless
with her character thus happily formed in the first bloom of her youth she had encountered mr pocket who was also in the first bloom of youth and not quite decided whether to mount to the woolsack or to roof himself in with a mitre
as his doing the one or the other was a mere question of time he and mrs pocket had taken time by the forelock when to judge from its length it would seem to have wanted cutting and had married without the knowledge of the judicious parent
the judicious parent having nothing to bestow or withhold but his blessing had handsomely settled that dower upon them after a short struggle and had informed mr pocket that his wife was a treasure for a prince mr pocket had invested the princes treasure in the ways of the world ever since and it was supposed to have brought him in but indifferent interest
still mrs pocket was in general the object of a queer sort of respectful pity because she had not married a title while mr pocket was the object of a queer sort of forgiving reproach because he had never got one
mr pocket took me into the house and showed me my room which was a pleasant one and so furnished as that i could use it with comfort for my own private sittingroom
he then knocked at the doors of two other similar rooms and introduced me to their occupants by name drummle and startop
drummle an oldlooking young man of a heavy order of architecture was whistling
startop younger in years and appearance was reading and holding his head as if he thought himself in danger of exploding it with too strong a charge of knowledge
both mr and mrs pocket had such a noticeable air of being in somebody elses hands that i wondered who really was in possession of the house and let them live there until i found this unknown power to be the servants
it was a smooth way of going on perhaps in respect of saving trouble but it had the appearance of being expensive for the servants felt it a duty they owed to themselves to be nice in their eating and drinking and to keep a deal of company downstairs
they allowed a very liberal table to mr and mrs pocket yet it always appeared to me that by far the best part of the house to have boarded in would have been the kitchenalways supposing the boarder capable of selfdefence for before i had been there a week a neighbouring lady with whom the family were personally unacquainted wrote in to say that she had seen millers slapping the baby
this greatly distressed mrs pocket who burst into tears on receiving the note and said that it was an extraordinary thing that the neighbours couldnt mind their own business
by degrees i learnt and chiefly from herbert that mr pocket had been educated at harrow and at cambridge where he had distinguished himself but that when he had had the happiness of marrying mrs pocket very early in life he had impaired his prospects and taken up the calling of a grinder
after grinding a number of dull bladesof whom it was remarkable that their fathers when influential were always going to help him to preferment but always forgot to do it when the blades had left the grindstonehe had wearied of that poor work and had come to london
here after gradually failing in loftier hopes he had read with divers who had lacked opportunities or neglected them and had refurbished divers others for special occasions and had turned his acquirements to the account of literary compilation and correction and on such means added to some very moderate private resources still maintained the house i saw
mr and mrs pocket had a toady neighbour a widow lady of that highly sympathetic nature that she agreed with everybody blessed everybody and shed smiles and tears on everybody according to circumstances
this ladys name was mrs coiler and i had the honour of taking her down to dinner on the day of my installation
she gave me to understand on the stairs that it was a blow to dear mrs pocket that dear mr pocket should be under the necessity of receiving gentlemen to read with him
that did not extend to me she told me in a gush of love and confidence at that time i had known her something less than five minutes if they were all like me it would be quite another thing
but dear mrs pocket said mrs coiler after her early disappointment not that dear mr pocket was to blame in that requires so much luxury and elegance yes maam i said to stop her for i was afraid she was going to cry
and she is of so aristocratic a disposition yes maam i said again with the same object as before
that it is hard said mrs coiler to have dear mr pockets time and attention diverted from dear mrs pocket i could not help thinking that it might be harder if the butchers time and attention were diverted from dear mrs pocket but i said nothing and indeed had enough to do in keeping a bashful watch upon my company manners
it came to my knowledge through what passed between mrs pocket and drummle while i was attentive to my knife and fork spoon glasses and other instruments of selfdestruction that drummle whose christian name was bentley was actually the next heir but one to a baronetcy
it further appeared that the book i had seen mrs pocket reading in the garden was all about titles and that she knew the exact date at which her grandpapa would have come into the book if he ever had come at all
drummle didnt say much but in his limited way he struck me as a sulky kind of fellow he spoke as one of the elect and recognised mrs pocket as a woman and a sister
no one but themselves and mrs coiler the toady neighbour showed any interest in this part of the conversation and it appeared to me that it was painful to herbert but it promised to last a long time when the page came in with the announcement of a domestic affliction
it was in effect that the cook had mislaid the beef
to my unutterable amazement i now for the first time saw mr pocket relieve his mind by going through a performance that struck me as very extraordinary but which made no impression on anybody else and with which i soon became as familiar as the rest
he laid down the carvingknife and forkbeing engaged in carving at the momentput his two hands into his disturbed hair and appeared to make an extraordinary effort to lift himself up by it
when he had done this and had not lifted himself up at all he quietly went on with what he was about
mrs coiler then changed the subject and began to flatter me
i liked it for a few moments but she flattered me so very grossly that the pleasure was soon over
she had a serpentine way of coming close at me when she pretended to be vitally interested in the friends and localities i had left which was altogether snaky and forktongued and when she made an occasional bounce upon startop who said very little to her or upon drummle who said less i rather envied them for being on the opposite side of the table
after dinner the children were introduced and mrs coiler made admiring comments on their eyes noses and legsa sagacious way of improving their minds
there were four little girls and two little boys besides the baby who might have been either and the babys next successor who was as yet neither
they were brought in by flopson and millers much as though those two noncommissioned officers had been recruiting somewhere for children and had enlisted these while mrs pocket looked at the young nobles that ought to have been as if she rather thought she had had the pleasure of inspecting them before but didnt quite know what to make of them
here
give me your fork mum and take the baby said flopson
dont take it that way or youll get its head under the table thus advised mrs pocket took it the other way and got its head upon the table which was announced to all present by a prodigious concussion
dear dear
give it me back mum said flopson and miss jane come and dance to baby do one of the little girls a mere mite who seemed to have prematurely taken upon herself some charge of the others stepped out of her place by me and danced to and from the baby until it left off crying and laughed
then all the children laughed and mr pocket who in the meantime had twice endeavoured to lift himself up by the hair laughed and we all laughed and were glad
flopson by dint of doubling the baby at the joints like a dutch doll then got it safely into mrs pockets lap and gave it the nutcrackers to play with at the same time recommending mrs pocket to take notice that the handles of that instrument were not likely to agree with its eyes and sharply charging miss jane to look after the same
then the two nurses left the room and had a lively scuffle on the staircase with a dissipated page who had waited at dinner and who had clearly lost half his buttons at the gamingtable
i was made very uneasy in my mind by mrs pockets falling into a discussion with drummle respecting two baronetcies while she ate a sliced orange steeped in sugar and wine and forgetting all about the baby on her lap who did most appalling things with the nutcrackers
at length little jane perceiving its young brains to be imperilled softly left her place and with many small artifices coaxed the dangerous weapon away
mrs pocket finishing her orange at about the same time and not approving of this said to jane you naughty child how dare you
go and sit down this instant mamma dear lisped the little girl baby ood have put hith eyeth out how dare you tell me so retorted mrs pocket
go and sit down in your chair this moment mrs pockets dignity was so crushing that i felt quite abashed as if i myself had done something to rouse it
belinda remonstrated mr pocket from the other end of the table how can you be so unreasonable
jane only interfered for the protection of baby i will not allow anybody to interfere said mrs pocket
i am surprised matthew that you should expose me to the affront of interference good god cried mr pocket in an outbreak of desolate desperation
are infants to be nutcrackered into their tombs and is nobody to save them i will not be interfered with by jane said mrs pocket with a majestic glance at that innocent little offender
i hope i know my poor grandpapas position
jane indeed mr pocket got his hands in his hair again and this time really did lift himself some inches out of his chair
hear this he helplessly exclaimed to the elements
babies are to be nutcrackered dead for peoples poor grandpapas positions then he let himself down again and became silent
we all looked awkwardly at the tablecloth while this was going on
a pause succeeded during which the honest and irrepressible baby made a series of leaps and crows at little jane who appeared to me to be the only member of the family irrespective of servants with whom it had any decided acquaintance
mr
drummle said mrs pocket will you ring for flopson
jane you undutiful little thing go and lie down
now baby darling come with ma the baby was the soul of honour and protested with all its might
it doubled itself up the wrong way over mrs pockets arm exhibited a pair of knitted shoes and dimpled ankles to the company in lieu of its soft face and was carried out in the highest state of mutiny
and it gained its point after all for i saw it through the window within a few minutes being nursed by little jane
it happened that the other five children were left behind at the dinnertable through flopsons having some private engagement and their not being anybody elses business
i thus became aware of the mutual relations between them and mr pocket which were exemplified in the following manner
mr pocket with the normal perplexity of his face heightened and his hair rumpled looked at them for some minutes as if he couldnt make out how they came to be boarding and lodging in that establishment and why they hadnt been billeted by nature on somebody else
then in a distant missionary way he asked them certain questionsas why little joe had that hole in his frill who said pa flopson was going to mend it when she had timeand how little fanny came by that whitlow who said pa millers was going to poultice it when she didnt forget
then he melted into parental tenderness and gave them a shilling apiece and told them to go and play and then as they went out with one very strong effort to lift himself up by the hair he dismissed the hopeless subject
in the evening there was rowing on the river
as drummle and startop had each a boat i resolved to set up mine and to cut them both out
i was pretty good at most exercises in which country boys are adepts but as i was conscious of wanting elegance of style for the thamesnot to say for other watersi at once engaged to place myself under the tuition of the winner of a prizewherry who plied at our stairs and to whom i was introduced by my new allies
this practical authority confused me very much by saying i had the arm of a blacksmith
if he could have known how nearly the compliment lost him his pupil i doubt if he would have paid it
there was a suppertray after we got home at night and i think we should all have enjoyed ourselves but for a rather disagreeable domestic occurrence
mr pocket was in good spirits when a housemaid came in and said if you please sir i should wish to speak to you speak to your master said mrs pocket whose dignity was roused again
how can you think of such a thing
go and speak to flopson
or speak to meat some other time begging your pardon maam returned the housemaid i should wish to speak at once and to speak to master hereupon mr pocket went out of the room and we made the best of ourselves until he came back
this is a pretty thing belinda said mr pocket returning with a countenance expressive of grief and despair
heres the cook lying insensibly drunk on the kitchen floor with a large bundle of fresh butter made up in the cupboard ready to sell for grease mrs pocket instantly showed much amiable emotion and said this is that odious sophias doing what do you mean belinda demanded mr pocket
sophia has told you said mrs pocket
did i not see her with my own eyes and hear her with my own ears come into the room just now and ask to speak to you but has she not taken me downstairs belinda returned mr pocket and shown me the woman and the bundle too and do you defend her matthew said mrs pocket for making mischief mr pocket uttered a dismal groan
am i grandpapas granddaughter to be nothing in the house said mrs pocket
besides the cook has always been a very nice respectful woman and said in the most natural manner when she came to look after the situation that she felt i was born to be a duchess there was a sofa where mr pocket stood and he dropped upon it in the attitude of the dying gladiator
still in that attitude he said with a hollow voice good night mr pip when i deemed it advisable to go to bed and leave him
chapter xxiv
after two or three days when i had established myself in my room and had gone backwards and forwards to london several times and had ordered all i wanted of my tradesmen mr pocket and i had a long talk together
he knew more of my intended career than i knew myself for he referred to his having been told by mr jaggers that i was not designed for any profession and that i should be well enough educated for my destiny if i could hold my own with the average of young men in prosperous circumstances
i acquiesced of course knowing nothing to the contrary
he advised my attending certain places in london for the acquisition of such mere rudiments as i wanted and my investing him with the functions of explainer and director of all my studies
he hoped that with intelligent assistance i should meet with little to discourage me and should soon be able to dispense with any aid but his
through his way of saying this and much more to similar purpose he placed himself on confidential terms with me in an admirable manner and i may state at once that he was always so zealous and honourable in fulfilling his compact with me that he made me zealous and honourable in fulfilling mine with him
if he had shown indifference as a master i have no doubt i should have returned the compliment as a pupil he gave me no such excuse and each of us did the other justice
nor did i ever regard him as having anything ludicrous about himor anything but what was serious honest and goodin his tutor communication with me
when these points were settled and so far carried out as that i had begun to work in earnest it occurred to me that if i could retain my bedroom in barnards inn my life would be agreeably varied while my manners would be none the worse for herberts society
mr pocket did not object to this arrangement but urged that before any step could possibly be taken in it it must be submitted to my guardian
i felt that this delicacy arose out of the consideration that the plan would save herbert some expense so i went off to little britain and imparted my wish to mr jaggers
if i could buy the furniture now hired for me said i and one or two other little things i should be quite at home there go it said mr jaggers with a short laugh
i told you youd get on
well
how much do you want i said i didnt know how much
come retorted mr jaggers
how much
fifty pounds o not nearly so much five pounds said mr jaggers
this was such a great fall that i said in discomfiture o more than that more than that eh retorted mr jaggers lying in wait for me with his hands in his pockets his head on one side and his eyes on the wall behind me how much more it is so difficult to fix a sum said i hesitating
come said mr jaggers
lets get at it
twice five will that do
three times five will that do
four times five will that do i said i thought that would do handsomely
four times five will do handsomely will it said mr jaggers knitting his brows
now what do you make of four times five what do i make of it ah said mr jaggers how much i suppose you make it twenty pounds said i smiling
never mind what i make it my friend observed mr jaggers with a knowing and contradictory toss of his head
i want to know what you make it twenty pounds of course wemmick said mr jaggers opening his office door
take mr pips written order and pay him twenty pounds this strongly marked way of doing business made a strongly marked impression on me and that not of an agreeable kind
mr jaggers never laughed but he wore great bright creaking boots and in poising himself on these boots with his large head bent down and his eyebrows joined together awaiting an answer he sometimes caused the boots to creak as if they laughed in a dry and suspicious way
as he happened to go out now and as wemmick was brisk and talkative i said to wemmick that i hardly knew what to make of mr jaggerss manner
tell him that and hell take it as a compliment answered wemmick he dont mean that you should know what to make of itoh for i looked surprised its not personal its professional only professional wemmick was at his desk lunchingand crunchingon a dry hard biscuit pieces of which he threw from time to time into his slit of a mouth as if he were posting them
always seems to me said wemmick as if he had set a mantrap and was watching it
suddenlyclickyoure caught without remarking that mantraps were not among the amenities of life i said i supposed he was very skilful
deep said wemmick as australia pointing with his pen at the office floor to express that australia was understood for the purposes of the figure to be symmetrically on the opposite spot of the globe
if there was anything deeper added wemmick bringing his pen to paper hed be it then i said i supposed he had a fine business and wemmick said capital then i asked if there were many clerks
to which he replied we dont run much into clerks because theres only one jaggers and people wont have him at second hand
there are only four of us
would you like to see em
you are one of us as i may say i accepted the offer
when mr wemmick had put all the biscuit into the post and had paid me my money from a cashbox in a safe the key of which safe he kept somewhere down his back and produced from his coatcollar like an ironpigtail we went upstairs
the house was dark and shabby and the greasy shoulders that had left their mark in mr jaggerss room seemed to have been shuffling up and down the staircase for years
in the front first floor a clerk who looked something between a publican and a ratcatchera large pale puffed swollen manwas attentively engaged with three or four people of shabby appearance whom he treated as unceremoniously as everybody seemed to be treated who contributed to mr jaggerss coffers
getting evidence together said mr wemmick as we came out for the bailey in the room over that a little flabby terrier of a clerk with dangling hair his cropping seemed to have been forgotten when he was a puppy was similarly engaged with a man with weak eyes whom mr wemmick presented to me as a smelter who kept his pot always boiling and who would melt me anything i pleasedand who was in an excessive whiteperspiration as if he had been trying his art on himself
in a back room a highshouldered man with a faceache tied up in dirty flannel who was dressed in old black clothes that bore the appearance of having been waxed was stooping over his work of making fair copies of the notes of the other two gentlemen for mr jaggerss own use
this was all the establishment
when we went downstairs again wemmick led me into my guardians room and said this youve seen already pray said i as the two odious casts with the twitchy leer upon them caught my sight again whose likenesses are those these said wemmick getting upon a chair and blowing the dust off the horrible heads before bringing them down
these are two celebrated ones
famous clients of ours that got us a world of credit
this chap why you must have come down in the night and been peeping into the inkstand to get this blot upon your eyebrow you old rascal
murdered his master and considering that he wasnt brought up to evidence didnt plan it badly is it like him i asked recoiling from the brute as wemmick spat upon his eyebrow and gave it a rub with his sleeve
like him
its himself you know
the cast was made in newgate directly after he was taken down
you had a particular fancy for me hadnt you old artful said wemmick
he then explained this affectionate apostrophe by touching his brooch representing the lady and the weeping willow at the tomb with the urn upon it and saying had it made for me express is the lady anybody said i
no returned wemmick
only his game
you liked your bit of game didnt you
no deuce a bit of a lady in the case mr pip except oneand she wasnt of this slender ladylike sort and you wouldnt have caught her looking after this urn unless there was something to drink in it wemmicks attention being thus directed to his brooch he put down the cast and polished the brooch with his pockethandkerchief
did that other creature come to the same end i asked
he has the same look youre right said wemmick its the genuine look
much as if one nostril was caught up with a horsehair and a little fishhook
yes he came to the same end quite the natural end here i assure you
he forged wills this blade did if he didnt also put the supposed testators to sleep too
you were a gentlemanly cove though mr wemmick was again apostrophising and you said you could write greek
yah bounceable
what a liar you were
i never met such a liar as you before putting his late friend on his shelf again wemmick touched the largest of his mourning rings and said sent out to buy it for me only the day before while he was putting up the other cast and coming down from the chair the thought crossed my mind that all his personal jewelry was derived from like sources
as he had shown no diffidence on the subject i ventured on the liberty of asking him the question when he stood before me dusting his hands
o yes he returned these are all gifts of that kind
one brings another you see thats the way of it
i always take em
theyre curiosities
and theyre property
they may not be worth much but after all theyre property and portable
it dont signify to you with your brilliant lookout but as to myself my guidingstar always is get hold of portable property when i had rendered homage to this light he went on to say in a friendly manner if at any odd time when you have nothing better to do you wouldnt mind coming over to see me at walworth i could offer you a bed and i should consider it an honour
i have not much to show you but such two or three curiosities as i have got you might like to look over and i am fond of a bit of garden and a summerhouse i said i should be delighted to accept his hospitality
thankee said he then well consider that its to come off when convenient to you
have you dined with mr jaggers yet not yet well said wemmick hell give you wine and good wine
ill give you punch and not bad punch
and now ill tell you something
when you go to dine with mr jaggers look at his housekeeper shall i see something very uncommon well said wemmick youll see a wild beast tamed
not so very uncommon youll tell me
i reply that depends on the original wildness of the beast and the amount of taming
it wont lower your opinion of mr jaggerss powers
keep your eye on it i told him i would do so with all the interest and curiosity that his preparation awakened
as i was taking my departure he asked me if i would like to devote five minutes to seeing mr jaggers at it for several reasons and not least because i didnt clearly know what mr jaggers would be found to be at i replied in the affirmative
we dived into the city and came up in a crowded policecourt where a bloodrelation in the murderous sense of the deceased with the fanciful taste in brooches was standing at the bar uncomfortably chewing something while my guardian had a woman under examination or crossexaminationi dont know whichand was striking her and the bench and everybody present with awe
if anybody of whatsoever degree said a word that he didnt approve of he instantly required to have it taken down if anybody wouldnt make an admission he said ill have it out of you and if anybody made an admission he said now i have got you the magistrates shivered under a single bite of his finger
thieves and thieftakers hung in dread rapture on his words and shrank when a hair of his eyebrows turned in their direction
which side he was on i couldnt make out for he seemed to me to be grinding the whole place in a mill i only know that when i stole out on tiptoe he was not on the side of the bench for he was making the legs of the old gentleman who presided quite convulsive under the table by his denunciations of his conduct as the representative of british law and justice in that chair that day
chapter xxv
bentley drummle who was so sulky a fellow that he even took up a book as if its writer had done him an injury did not take up an acquaintance in a more agreeable spirit
heavy in figure movement and comprehensionin the sluggish complexion of his face and in the large awkward tongue that seemed to loll about in his mouth as he himself lolled about in a roomhe was idle proud niggardly reserved and suspicious
he came of rich people down in somersetshire who had nursed this combination of qualities until they made the discovery that it was just of age and a blockhead
thus bentley drummle had come to mr pocket when he was a head taller than that gentleman and half a dozen heads thicker than most gentlemen
startop had been spoilt by a weak mother and kept at home when he ought to have been at school but he was devotedly attached to her and admired her beyond measure
he had a womans delicacy of feature and wasas you may see though you never saw her said herbert to meexactly like his mother it was but natural that i should take to him much more kindly than to drummle and that even in the earliest evenings of our boating he and i should pull homeward abreast of one another conversing from boat to boat while bentley drummle came up in our wake alone under the overhanging banks and among the rushes
he would always creep inshore like some uncomfortable amphibious creature even when the tide would have sent him fast upon his way and i always think of him as coming after us in the dark or by the backwater when our own two boats were breaking the sunset or the moonlight in midstream
herbert was my intimate companion and friend
i presented him with a halfshare in my boat which was the occasion of his often coming down to hammersmith and my possession of a halfshare in his chambers often took me up to london
we used to walk between the two places at all hours
i have an affection for the road yet though it is not so pleasant a road as it was then formed in the impressibility of untried youth and hope
when i had been in mr pockets family a month or two mr and mrs camilla turned up
camilla was mr pockets sister
georgiana whom i had seen at miss havishams on the same occasion also turned up
she was a cousinan indigestive single woman who called her rigidity religion and her liver love
these people hated me with the hatred of cupidity and disappointment
as a matter of course they fawned upon me in my prosperity with the basest meanness
towards mr pocket as a grownup infant with no notion of his own interests they showed the complacent forbearance i had heard them express
mrs pocket they held in contempt but they allowed the poor soul to have been heavily disappointed in life because that shed a feeble reflected light upon themselves
these were the surroundings among which i settled down and applied myself to my education
i soon contracted expensive habits and began to spend an amount of money that within a few short months i should have thought almost fabulous but through good and evil i stuck to my books
there was no other merit in this than my having sense enough to feel my deficiencies
between mr pocket and herbert i got on fast and with one or the other always at my elbow to give me the start i wanted and clear obstructions out of my road i must have been as great a dolt as drummle if i had done less
i had not seen mr wemmick for some weeks when i thought i would write him a note and propose to go home with him on a certain evening
he replied that it would give him much pleasure and that he would expect me at the office at six oclock
thither i went and there i found him putting the key of his safe down his back as the clock struck
did you think of walking down to walworth said he
certainly said i if you approve very much was wemmicks reply for i have had my legs under the desk all day and shall be glad to stretch them
now ill tell you what i have got for supper mr pip
i have got a stewed steakwhich is of home preparationand a cold roast fowlwhich is from the cooksshop
i think its tender because the master of the shop was a juryman in some cases of ours the other day and we let him down easy
i reminded him of it when i bought the fowl and i said pick us out a good one old briton because if we had chosen to keep you in the box another day or two we could easily have done it he said to that let me make you a present of the best fowl in the shop i let him of course
as far as it goes its property and portable
you dont object to an aged parent i hope i really thought he was still speaking of the fowl until he added because i have got an aged parent at my place i then said what politeness required
so you havent dined with mr jaggers yet he pursued as we walked along
not yet he told me so this afternoon when he heard you were coming
i expect youll have an invitation tomorrow
hes going to ask your pals too
three of em aint there although i was not in the habit of counting drummle as one of my intimate associates i answered yes well hes going to ask the whole gangi hardly felt complimented by the wordand whatever he gives you hell give you good
dont look forward to variety but youll have excellence
and theres another rum thing in his house proceeded wemmick after a moments pause as if the remark followed on the housekeeper understood he never lets a door or window be fastened at night is he never robbed thats it returned wemmick
he says and gives it out publicly i want to see the man wholl rob me lord bless you i have heard him a hundred times if i have heard him once say to regular cracksmen in our front office you know where i live now no bolt is ever drawn there why dont you do a stroke of business with me
come cant i tempt you not a man of them sir would be bold enough to try it on for love or money they dread him so much said i
dread him said wemmick
i believe you they dread him
not but what hes artful even in his defiance of them
no silver sir
britannia metal every spoon so they wouldnt have much i observed even if they ah
but he would have much said wemmick cutting me short and they know it
hed have their lives and the lives of scores of em
hed have all he could get
and its impossible to say what he couldnt get if he gave his mind to it i was falling into meditation on my guardians greatness when wemmick remarked as to the absence of plate thats only his natural depth you know
a rivers its natural depth and hes his natural depth
look at his watchchain
thats real enough its very massive said i
massive repeated wemmick
i think so
and his watch is a gold repeater and worth a hundred pound if its worth a penny
mr pip there are about seven hundred thieves in this town who know all about that watch theres not a man a woman or a child among them who wouldnt identify the smallest link in that chain and drop it as if it was red hot if inveigled into touching it at first with such discourse and afterwards with conversation of a more general nature did mr wemmick and i beguile the time and the road until he gave me to understand that we had arrived in the district of walworth
it appeared to be a collection of back lanes ditches and little gardens and to present the aspect of a rather dull retirement
wemmicks house was a little wooden cottage in the midst of plots of garden and the top of it was cut out and painted like a battery mounted with guns
my own doing said wemmick
looks pretty dont it i highly commended it i think it was the smallest house i ever saw with the queerest gothic windows by far the greater part of them sham and a gothic door almost too small to get in at
thats a real flagstaff you see said wemmick and on sundays i run up a real flag
then look here
after i have crossed this bridge i hoist it upsoand cut off the communication the bridge was a plank and it crossed a chasm about four feet wide and two deep
but it was very pleasant to see the pride with which he hoisted it up and made it fast smiling as he did so with a relish and not merely mechanically
at nine oclock every night greenwich time said wemmick the gun fires
there he is you see
and when you hear him go i think youll say hes a stinger the piece of ordnance referred to was mounted in a separate fortress constructed of latticework
it was protected from the weather by an ingenious little tarpaulin contrivance in the nature of an umbrella
then at the back said wemmick out of sight so as not to impede the idea of fortificationsfor its a principle with me if you have an idea carry it out and keep it upi dont know whether thats your opinion i said decidedly
at the back theres a pig and there are fowls and rabbits then i knock together my own little frame you see and grow cucumbers and youll judge at supper what sort of a salad i can raise
so sir said wemmick smiling again but seriously too as he shook his head if you can suppose the little place besieged it would hold out a devil of a time in point of provisions then he conducted me to a bower about a dozen yards off but which was approached by such ingenious twists of path that it took quite a long time to get at and in this retreat our glasses were already set forth
our punch was cooling in an ornamental lake on whose margin the bower was raised
this piece of water with an island in the middle which might have been the salad for supper was of a circular form and he had constructed a fountain in it which when you set a little mill going and took a cork out of a pipe played to that powerful extent that it made the back of your hand quite wet
i am my own engineer and my own carpenter and my own plumber and my own gardener and my own jack of all trades said wemmick in acknowledging my compliments
well its a good thing you know
it brushes the newgate cobwebs away and pleases the aged
you wouldnt mind being at once introduced to the aged would you
it wouldnt put you out i expressed the readiness i felt and we went into the castle
there we found sitting by a fire a very old man in a flannel coat clean cheerful comfortable and well cared for but intensely deaf
well aged parent said wemmick shaking hands with him in a cordial and jocose way how am you all right john all right replied the old man
heres mr pip aged parent said wemmick and i wish you could hear his name
nod away at him mr pip thats what he likes
nod away at him if you please like winking this is a fine place of my sons sir cried the old man while i nodded as hard as i possibly could
this is a pretty pleasureground sir
this spot and these beautiful works upon it ought to be kept together by the nation after my sons time for the peoples enjoyment youre as proud of it as punch aint you aged said wemmick contemplating the old man with his hard face really softened theres a nod for you giving him a tremendous one theres another for you giving him a still more tremendous one you like that dont you
if youre not tired mr pipthough i know its tiring to strangerswill you tip him one more
you cant think how it pleases him i tipped him several more and he was in great spirits
we left him bestirring himself to feed the fowls and we sat down to our punch in the arbour where wemmick told me as he smoked a pipe that it had taken him a good many years to bring the property up to its present pitch of perfection
is it your own mr wemmick o yes said wemmick i have got hold of it a bit at a time
its a freehold by george is it indeed
i hope mr jaggers admires it never seen it said wemmick
never heard of it
never seen the aged
never heard of him
no the office is one thing and private life is another
when i go into the office i leave the castle behind me and when i come into the castle i leave the office behind me
if its not in any way disagreeable to you youll oblige me by doing the same
i dont wish it professionally spoken about of course i felt my good faith involved in the observance of his request
the punch being very nice we sat there drinking it and talking until it was almost nine oclock
getting near gunfire said wemmick then as he laid down his pipe its the ageds treat proceeding into the castle again we found the aged heating the poker with expectant eyes as a preliminary to the performance of this great nightly ceremony
wemmick stood with his watch in his hand until the moment was come for him to take the redhot poker from the aged and repair to the battery
he took it and went out and presently the stinger went off with a bang that shook the crazy little box of a cottage as if it must fall to pieces and made every glass and teacup in it ring
upon this the agedwho i believe would have been blown out of his armchair but for holding on by the elbowscried out exultingly hes fired
i heerd him and i nodded at the old gentleman until it is no figure of speech to declare that i absolutely could not see him
the interval between that time and supper wemmick devoted to showing me his collection of curiosities
they were mostly of a felonious character comprising the pen with which a celebrated forgery had been committed a distinguished razor or two some locks of hair and several manuscript confessions written under condemnationupon which mr wemmick set particular value as being to use his own words every one of em lies sir these were agreeably dispersed among small specimens of china and glass various neat trifles made by the proprietor of the museum and some tobaccostoppers carved by the aged
they were all displayed in that chamber of the castle into which i had been first inducted and which served not only as the general sittingroom but as the kitchen too if i might judge from a saucepan on the hob and a brazen bijou over the fireplace designed for the suspension of a roastingjack
there was a neat little girl in attendance who looked after the aged in the day
when she had laid the suppercloth the bridge was lowered to give her means of egress and she withdrew for the night
the supper was excellent and though the castle was rather subject to dryrot insomuch that it tasted like a bad nut and though the pig might have been farther off i was heartily pleased with my whole entertainment
nor was there any drawback on my little turret bedroom beyond there being such a very thin ceiling between me and the flagstaff that when i lay down on my back in bed it seemed as if i had to balance that pole on my forehead all night
wemmick was up early in the morning and i am afraid i heard him cleaning my boots
after that he fell to gardening and i saw him from my gothic window pretending to employ the aged and nodding at him in a most devoted manner
our breakfast was as good as the supper and at halfpast eight precisely we started for little britain
by degrees wemmick got dryer and harder as we went along and his mouth tightened into a postoffice again
at last when we got to his place of business and he pulled out his key from his coatcollar he looked as unconscious of his walworth property as if the castle and the drawbridge and the arbour and the lake and the fountain and the aged had all been blown into space together by the last discharge of the stinger
chapter xxvi
it fell out as wemmick had told me it would that i had an early opportunity of comparing my guardians establishment with that of his cashier and clerk
my guardian was in his room washing his hands with his scented soap when i went into the office from walworth and he called me to him and gave me the invitation for myself and friends which wemmick had prepared me to receive
no ceremony he stipulated and no dinner dress and say tomorrow i asked him where we should come to for i had no idea where he lived and i believe it was in his general objection to make anything like an admission that he replied come here and ill take you home with me i embrace this opportunity of remarking that he washed his clients off as if he were a surgeon or a dentist
he had a closet in his room fitted up for the purpose which smelt of the scented soap like a perfumers shop
it had an unusually large jacktowel on a roller inside the door and he would wash his hands and wipe them and dry them all over this towel whenever he came in from a police court or dismissed a client from his room
when i and my friends repaired to him at six oclock next day he seemed to have been engaged on a case of a darker complexion than usual for we found him with his head butted into this closet not only washing his hands but laving his face and gargling his throat
and even when he had done all that and had gone all round the jacktowel he took out his penknife and scraped the case out of his nails before he put his coat on
there were some people slinking about as usual when we passed out into the street who were evidently anxious to speak with him but there was something so conclusive in the halo of scented soap which encircled his presence that they gave it up for that day
as we walked along westward he was recognised ever and again by some face in the crowd of the streets and whenever that happened he talked louder to me but he never otherwise recognised anybody or took notice that anybody recognised him
he conducted us to gerrard street soho to a house on the south side of that street
rather a stately house of its kind but dolefully in want of painting and with dirty windows
he took out his key and opened the door and we all went into a stone hall bare gloomy and little used
so up a dark brown staircase into a series of three dark brown rooms on the first floor
there were carved garlands on the panelled walls and as he stood among them giving us welcome i know what kind of loops i thought they looked like
dinner was laid in the best of these rooms the second was his dressingroom the third his bedroom
he told us that he held the whole house but rarely used more of it than we saw
the table was comfortably laidno silver in the service of courseand at the side of his chair was a capacious dumbwaiter with a variety of bottles and decanters on it and four dishes of fruit for dessert
i noticed throughout that he kept everything under his own hand and distributed everything himself
there was a bookcase in the room i saw from the backs of the books that they were about evidence criminal law criminal biography trials acts of parliament and such things
the furniture was all very solid and good like his watchchain
it had an official look however and there was nothing merely ornamental to be seen
in a corner was a little table of papers with a shaded lamp so that he seemed to bring the office home with him in that respect too and to wheel it out of an evening and fall to work
as he had scarcely seen my three companions until nowfor he and i had walked togetherhe stood on the hearthrug after ringing the bell and took a searching look at them
to my surprise he seemed at once to be principally if not solely interested in drummle
pip said he putting his large hand on my shoulder and moving me to the window i dont know one from the other
whos the spider the spider said i
the blotchy sprawly sulky fellow thats bentley drummle i replied the one with the delicate face is startop not making the least account of the one with the delicate face he returned bentley drummle is his name is it
i like the look of that fellow he immediately began to talk to drummle not at all deterred by his replying in his heavy reticent way but apparently led on by it to screw discourse out of him
i was looking at the two when there came between me and them the housekeeper with the first dish for the table
she was a woman of about forty i supposedbut i may have thought her younger than she was
rather tall of a lithe nimble figure extremely pale with large faded eyes and a quantity of streaming hair
i cannot say whether any diseased affection of the heart caused her lips to be parted as if she were panting and her face to bear a curious expression of suddenness and flutter but i know that i had been to see macbeth at the theatre a night or two before and that her face looked to me as if it were all disturbed by fiery air like the faces i had seen rise out of the witches caldron
she set the dish on touched my guardian quietly on the arm with a finger to notify that dinner was ready and vanished
we took our seats at the round table and my guardian kept drummle on one side of him while startop sat on the other
it was a noble dish of fish that the housekeeper had put on table and we had a joint of equally choice mutton afterwards and then an equally choice bird
sauces wines all the accessories we wanted and all of the best were given out by our host from his dumbwaiter and when they had made the circuit of the table he always put them back again
similarly he dealt us clean plates and knives and forks for each course and dropped those just disused into two baskets on the ground by his chair
no other attendant than the housekeeper appeared
she set on every dish and i always saw in her face a face rising out of the caldron
years afterwards i made a dreadful likeness of that woman by causing a face that had no other natural resemblance to it than it derived from flowing hair to pass behind a bowl of flaming spirits in a dark room
induced to take particular notice of the housekeeper both by her own striking appearance and by wemmicks preparation i observed that whenever she was in the room she kept her eyes attentively on my guardian and that she would remove her hands from any dish she put before him hesitatingly as if she dreaded his calling her back and wanted him to speak when she was nigh if he had anything to say
i fancied that i could detect in his manner a consciousness of this and a purpose of always holding her in suspense
dinner went off gayly and although my guardian seemed to follow rather than originate subjects i knew that he wrenched the weakest part of our dispositions out of us
for myself i found that i was expressing my tendency to lavish expenditure and to patronise herbert and to boast of my great prospects before i quite knew that i had opened my lips
it was so with all of us but with no one more than drummle the development of whose inclination to gird in a grudging and suspicious way at the rest was screwed out of him before the fish was taken off
it was not then but when we had got to the cheese that our conversation turned upon our rowing feats and that drummle was rallied for coming up behind of a night in that slow amphibious way of his
drummle upon this informed our host that he much preferred our room to our company and that as to skill he was more than our master and that as to strength he could scatter us like chaff
by some invisible agency my guardian wound him up to a pitch little short of ferocity about this trifle and he fell to baring and spanning his arm to show how muscular it was and we all fell to baring and spanning our arms in a ridiculous manner
now the housekeeper was at that time clearing the table my guardian taking no heed of her but with the side of his face turned from her was leaning back in his chair biting the side of his forefinger and showing an interest in drummle that to me was quite inexplicable
suddenly he clapped his large hand on the housekeepers like a trap as she stretched it across the table
so suddenly and smartly did he do this that we all stopped in our foolish contention
if you talk of strength said mr jaggers ill show you a wrist
molly let them see your wrist her entrapped hand was on the table but she had already put her other hand behind her waist
master she said in a low voice with her eyes attentively and entreatingly fixed upon him
dont ill show you a wrist repeated mr jaggers with an immovable determination to show it
molly let them see your wrist master she again murmured
please molly said mr jaggers not looking at her but obstinately looking at the opposite side of the room let them see both your wrists
show them
come he took his hand from hers and turned that wrist up on the table
she brought her other hand from behind her and held the two out side by side
the last wrist was much disfigureddeeply scarred and scarred across and across
when she held her hands out she took her eyes from mr jaggers and turned them watchfully on every one of the rest of us in succession
theres power here said mr jaggers coolly tracing out the sinews with his forefinger
very few men have the power of wrist that this woman has
its remarkable what mere force of grip there is in these hands
i have had occasion to notice many hands but i never saw stronger in that respect mans or womans than these while he said these words in a leisurely critical style she continued to look at every one of us in regular succession as we sat
the moment he ceased she looked at him again
thatll do molly said mr jaggers giving her a slight nod you have been admired and can go she withdrew her hands and went out of the room and mr jaggers putting the decanters on from his dumbwaiter filled his glass and passed round the wine
at halfpast nine gentlemen said he we must break up
pray make the best use of your time
i am glad to see you all
mr drummle i drink to you if his object in singling out drummle were to bring him out still more it perfectly succeeded
in a sulky triumph drummle showed his morose depreciation of the rest of us in a more and more offensive degree until he became downright intolerable
through all his stages mr jaggers followed him with the same strange interest
he actually seemed to serve as a zest to mr jaggerss wine
in our boyish want of discretion i dare say we took too much to drink and i know we talked too much
we became particularly hot upon some boorish sneer of drummles to the effect that we were too free with our money
it led to my remarking with more zeal than discretion that it came with a bad grace from him to whom startop had lent money in my presence but a week or so before
well retorted drummle hell be paid i dont mean to imply that he wont said i but it might make you hold your tongue about us and our money i should think you should think retorted drummle
oh lord i dare say i went on meaning to be very severe that you wouldnt lend money to any of us if we wanted it you are right said drummle
i wouldnt lend one of you a sixpence
i wouldnt lend anybody a sixpence rather mean to borrow under those circumstances i should say you should say repeated drummle
oh lord this was so very aggravatingthe more especially as i found myself making no way against his surly obtusenessthat i said disregarding herberts efforts to check me come mr drummle since we are on the subject ill tell you what passed between herbert here and me when you borrowed that money i dont want to know what passed between herbert there and you growled drummle
and i think he added in a lower growl that we might both go to the devil and shake ourselves
ill tell you however said i whether you want to know or not
we said that as you put it in your pocket very glad to get it you seemed to be immensely amused at his being so weak as to lend it drummle laughed outright and sat laughing in our faces with his hands in his pockets and his round shoulders raised plainly signifying that it was quite true and that he despised us as asses all
hereupon startop took him in hand though with a much better grace than i had shown and exhorted him to be a little more agreeable
startop being a lively bright young fellow and drummle being the exact opposite the latter was always disposed to resent him as a direct personal affront
he now retorted in a coarse lumpish way and startop tried to turn the discussion aside with some small pleasantry that made us all laugh
resenting this little success more than anything drummle without any threat or warning pulled his hands out of his pockets dropped his round shoulders swore took up a large glass and would have flung it at his adversarys head but for our entertainers dexterously seizing it at the instant when it was raised for that purpose
gentlemen said mr jaggers deliberately putting down the glass and hauling out his gold repeater by its massive chain i am exceedingly sorry to announce that its half past nine on this hint we all rose to depart
before we got to the street door startop was cheerily calling drummle old boy as if nothing had happened
but the old boy was so far from responding that he would not even walk to hammersmith on the same side of the way so herbert and i who remained in town saw them going down the street on opposite sides startop leading and drummle lagging behind in the shadow of the houses much as he was wont to follow in his boat
as the door was not yet shut i thought i would leave herbert there for a moment and run upstairs again to say a word to my guardian
i found him in his dressingroom surrounded by his stock of boots already hard at it washing his hands of us
i told him i had come up again to say how sorry i was that anything disagreeable should have occurred and that i hoped he would not blame me much
pooh said he sluicing his face and speaking through the waterdrops its nothing pip
i like that spider though he had turned towards me now and was shaking his head and blowing and towelling himself
i am glad you like him sir said ibut i dont no no my guardian assented dont have too much to do with him
keep as clear of him as you can
but i like the fellow pip he is one of the true sort
why if i was a fortuneteller looking out of the towel he caught my eye
but i am not a fortuneteller he said letting his head drop into a festoon of towel and towelling away at his two ears
you know what i am dont you
good night pip good night sir in about a month after that the spiders time with mr pocket was up for good and to the great relief of all the house but mrs pocket he went home to the family hole
chapter xxvii
my dear mr pip i write this by request of mr gargery for to let you know that he is going to london in company with mr wopsle and would be glad if agreeable to be allowed to see you
he would call at barnards hotel tuesday morning at nine oclock when if not agreeable please leave word
your poor sister is much the same as when you left
we talk of you in the kitchen every night and wonder what you are saying and doing
if now considered in the light of a liberty excuse it for the love of poor old days
no more dear mr pip from your ever obliged and affectionate servant biddy ps
he wishes me most particular to write what larks
he says you will understand
i hope and do not doubt it will be agreeable to see him even though a gentleman for you had ever a good heart and he is a worthy worthy man
i have read him all excepting only the last little sentence and he wishes me most particular to write again what larks i received this letter by the post on monday morning and therefore its appointment was for next day
let me confess exactly with what feelings i looked forward to joes coming
not with pleasure though i was bound to him by so many ties no with considerable disturbance some mortification and a keen sense of incongruity
if i could have kept him away by paying money i certainly would have paid money
my greatest reassurance was that he was coming to barnards inn not to hammersmith and consequently would not fall in bentley drummles way
i had little objection to his being seen by herbert or his father for both of whom i had a respect but i had the sharpest sensitiveness as to his being seen by drummle whom i held in contempt
so throughout life our worst weaknesses and meannesses are usually committed for the sake of the people whom we most despise
i had begun to be always decorating the chambers in some quite unnecessary and inappropriate way or other and very expensive those wrestles with barnard proved to be
by this time the rooms were vastly different from what i had found them and i enjoyed the honour of occupying a few prominent pages in the books of a neighbouring upholsterer
i had got on so fast of late that i had even started a boy in bootstop bootsin bondage and slavery to whom i might have been said to pass my days
for after i had made the monster out of the refuse of my washerwomans family and had clothed him with a blue coat canary waistcoat white cravat creamy breeches and the boots already mentioned i had to find him a little to do and a great deal to eat and with both of those horrible requirements he haunted my existence
this avenging phantom was ordered to be on duty at eight on tuesday morning in the hall it was two feet square as charged for floorcloth and herbert suggested certain things for breakfast that he thought joe would like
while i felt sincerely obliged to him for being so interested and considerate i had an odd halfprovoked sense of suspicion upon me that if joe had been coming to see him he wouldnt have been quite so brisk about it
however i came into town on the monday night to be ready for joe and i got up early in the morning and caused the sittingroom and breakfasttable to assume their most splendid appearance
unfortunately the morning was drizzly and an angel could not have concealed the fact that barnard was shedding sooty tears outside the window like some weak giant of a sweep
as the time approached i should have liked to run away but the avenger pursuant to orders was in the hall and presently i heard joe on the staircase
i knew it was joe by his clumsy manner of coming upstairshis state boots being always too big for himand by the time it took him to read the names on the other floors in the course of his ascent
when at last he stopped outside our door i could hear his finger tracing over the painted letters of my name and i afterwards distinctly heard him breathing in at the keyhole
finally he gave a faint single rap and peppersuch was the compromising name of the avenging boyannounced mr
gargery i thought he never would have done wiping his feet and that i must have gone out to lift him off the mat but at last he came in
joe how are you joe pip how air you pip with his good honest face all glowing and shining and his hat put down on the floor between us he caught both my hands and worked them straight up and down as if i had been the lastpatented pump
i am glad to see you joe
give me your hat but joe taking it up carefully with both hands like a birdsnest with eggs in it wouldnt hear of parting with that piece of property and persisted in standing talking over it in a most uncomfortable way
which you have that growed said joe and that swelled and that gentlefolked joe considered a little before he discovered this word as to be sure you are a honour to your king and country and you joe look wonderfully well thank god said joe im ekerval to most
and your sister shes no worse than she were
and biddy shes ever right and ready
and all friends is no backerder if not no forarder
ceptin wopsle hes had a drop all this time still with both hands taking great care of the birdsnest joe was rolling his eyes round and round the room and round and round the flowered pattern of my dressinggown
had a drop joe why yes said joe lowering his voice hes left the church and went into the playacting
which the playacting have likeways brought him to london along with me
and his wish were said joe getting the birdsnest under his left arm for the moment and groping in it for an egg with his right if no offence as i would and you that i took what joe gave me and found it to be the crumpled playbill of a small metropolitan theatre announcing the first appearance in that very week of the celebrated provincial amateur of roscian renown whose unique performance in the highest tragic walk of our national bard has lately occasioned so great a sensation in local dramatic circles were you at his performance joe i inquired
i were said joe with emphasis and solemnity
was there a great sensation why said joe yes there certainly were a peck of orangepeel
partickler when he see the ghost
though i put it to yourself sir whether it were calclated to keep a man up to his work with a good hart to be continiwally cutting in betwixt him and the ghost with amen a man may have had a misfortun and been in the church said joe lowering his voice to an argumentative and feeling tone but that is no reason why you should put him out at such a time
which i meantersay if the ghost of a mans own father cannot be allowed to claim his attention what can sir
still more when his mourning at is unfortunately made so small as that the weight of the black feathers brings it off try to keep it on how you may a ghostseeing effect in joes own countenance informed me that herbert had entered the room
so i presented joe to herbert who held out his hand but joe backed from it and held on by the birdsnest
your servant sir said joe which i hope as you and piphere his eye fell on the avenger who was putting some toast on table and so plainly denoted an intention to make that young gentleman one of the family that i frowned it down and confused him morei meantersay you two gentlemenwhich i hope as you get your elths in this close spot
for the present may be a werry good inn according to london opinions said joe confidentially and i believe its character do stand it but i wouldnt keep a pig in it myselfnot in the case that i wished him to fatten wholesome and to eat with a meller flavour on him having borne this flattering testimony to the merits of our dwellingplace and having incidentally shown this tendency to call me sir joe being invited to sit down to table looked all round the room for a suitable spot on which to deposit his hatas if it were only on some very few rare substances in nature that it could find a resting placeand ultimately stood it on an extreme corner of the chimneypiece from which it ever afterwards fell off at intervals
do you take tea or coffee mr gargery asked herbert who always presided of a morning
thankee sir said joe stiff from head to foot ill take whichever is most agreeable to yourself what do you say to coffee thankee sir returned joe evidently dispirited by the proposal since you are so kind as make chice of coffee i will not run contrairy to your own opinions
but dont you never find it a little eating say tea then said herbert pouring it out
here joes hat tumbled off the mantelpiece and he started out of his chair and picked it up and fitted it to the same exact spot
as if it were an absolute point of good breeding that it should tumble off again soon
when did you come to town mr gargery were it yesterday afternoon said joe after coughing behind his hand as if he had had time to catch the whoopingcough since he came
no it were not
yes it were
yes
it were yesterday afternoon with an appearance of mingled wisdom relief and strict impartiality
have you seen anything of london yet why yes sir said joe me and wopsle went off straight to look at the blacking wareus
but we didnt find that it come up to its likeness in the red bills at the shop doors which i meantersay added joe in an explanatory manner as it is there drawd too architectooralooral i really believe joe would have prolonged this word mightily expressive to my mind of some architecture that i know into a perfect chorus but for his attention being providentially attracted by his hat which was toppling
indeed it demanded from him a constant attention and a quickness of eye and hand very like that exacted by wicketkeeping
he made extraordinary play with it and showed the greatest skill now rushing at it and catching it neatly as it dropped now merely stopping it midway beating it up and humouring it in various parts of the room and against a good deal of the pattern of the paper on the wall before he felt it safe to close with it finally splashing it into the slopbasin where i took the liberty of laying hands upon it
illustration as to his shirtcollar and his coatcollar they were perplexing to reflect uponinsoluble mysteries both
why should a man scrape himself to that extent before he could consider himself full dressed
why should he suppose it necessary to be purified by suffering for his holiday clothes
then he fell into such unaccountable fits of meditation with his fork midway between his plate and his mouth had his eyes attracted in such strange directions was afflicted with such remarkable coughs sat so far from the table and dropped so much more than he ate and pretended that he hadnt dropped it that i was heartily glad when herbert left us for the city
i had neither the good sense nor the good feeling to know that this was all my fault and that if i had been easier with joe joe would have been easier with me
i felt impatient of him and out of temper with him in which condition he heaped coals of fire on my head
us two being now alone sirbegan joe
joe i interrupted pettishly how can you call me sir joe looked at me for a single instant with something faintly like reproach
utterly preposterous as his cravat was and as his collars were i was conscious of a sort of dignity in the look
us two being now alone resumed joe and me having the intentions and abilities to stay not many minutes more i will now concludeleastways beginto mention what have led to my having had the present honour
for was it not said joe with his old air of lucid exposition that my only wish were to be useful to you i should not have had the honour of breaking wittles in the company and abode of gentlemen i was so unwilling to see the look again that i made no remonstrance against this tone
well sir pursued joe this is how it were
i were at the bargemen tother night pipwhenever he subsided into affection he called me pip and whenever he relapsed into politeness he called me sir when there come up in his shaycart pumblechook
which that same identical said joe going down a new track do comb my air the wrong way sometimes awful by giving out up and down town as it were him which ever had your infant companionation and were looked upon as a playfellow by yourself nonsense
it was you joe which i fully believed it were pip said joe slightly tossing his head though it signify little now sir
well pip this same identical which his manners is given to blusterous come to me at the bargemen wot a pipe and a pint of beer do give refreshment to the workingman sir and do not over stimilate and his word were joseph miss havisham she wish to speak to you miss havisham joe she wish were pumblechooks word to speak to you joe sat and rolled his eyes at the ceiling
yes joe
go on please next day sir said joe looking at me as if i were a long way off having cleaned myself i go and i see miss a miss a joe
miss havisham which i say sir replied joe with an air of legal formality as if he were making his will miss a or otherways havisham
her expression air then as follering mr
gargery
you air in correspondence with mr pip having had a letter from you i were able to say i am when i married your sister sir i said i will and when i answered your friend pip i said i am would you tell him then said she that which estella has come home and would be glad to see him i felt my face fire up as i looked at joe
i hope one remote cause of its firing may have been my consciousness that if i had known his errand i should have given him more encouragement
biddy pursued joe when i got home and asked her fur to write the message to you a little hung back
biddy says i know he will be very glad to have it by word of mouth it is holiday time you want to see him go i have now concluded sir said joe rising from his chair and pip i wish you ever well and ever prospering to a greater and a greater height but you are not going now joe yes i am said joe
but you are coming back to dinner joe no i am not said joe
our eyes met and all the sir melted out of that manly heart as he gave me his hand
pip dear old chap life is made of ever so many partings welded together as i may say and one mans a blacksmith and ones a whitesmith and ones a goldsmith and ones a coppersmith
diwisions among such must come and must be met as they come
if theres been any fault at all today its mine
you and me is not two figures to be together in london nor yet anywheres else but what is private and beknown and understood among friends
it aint that i am proud but that i want to be right as you shall never see me no more in these clothes
im wrong in these clothes
im wrong out of the forge the kitchen or off th meshes
you wont find half so much fault in me if you think of me in my forge dress with my hammer in my hand or even my pipe
you wont find half so much fault in me if supposing as you should ever wish to see me you come and put your head in at the forge window and see joe the blacksmith there at the old anvil in the old burnt apron sticking to the old work
im awful dull but i hope ive beat out something nigh the rights of this at last
and so god bless you dear old pip old chap god bless you i had not been mistaken in my fancy that there was a simple dignity in him
the fashion of his dress could no more come in its way when he spoke these words than it could come in its way in heaven
he touched me gently on the forehead and went out
as soon as i could recover myself sufficiently i hurried out after him and looked for him in the neighbouring streets but he was gone
chapter xxviii
it was clear that i must repair to our town next day and in the first flow of my repentance it was equally clear that i must stay at joes
but when i had secured my boxplace by tomorrows coach and had been down to mr pockets and back i was not by any means convinced on the last point and began to invent reasons and make excuses for putting up at the blue boar
i should be an inconvenience at joes i was not expected and my bed would not be ready i should be too far from miss havishams and she was exacting and mightnt like it
all other swindlers upon earth are nothing to the selfswindlers and with such pretences did i cheat myself
surely a curious thing
that i should innocently take a bad halfcrown of somebody elses manufacture is reasonable enough but that i should knowingly reckon the spurious coin of my own make as good money
an obliging stranger under pretence of compactly folding up my banknotes for securitys sake abstracts the notes and gives me nutshells but what is his sleight of hand to mine when i fold up my own nutshells and pass them on myself as notes
having settled that i must go to the blue boar my mind was much disturbed by indecision whether or not to take the avenger
it was tempting to think of that expensive mercenary publicly airing his boots in the archway of the blue boars postingyard it was almost solemn to imagine him casually produced in the tailors shop and confounding the disrespectful senses of trabbs boy
on the other hand trabbs boy might worm himself into his intimacy and tell him things or reckless and desperate wretch as i knew he could be might hoot him in the high street
my patroness too might hear of him and not approve
on the whole i resolved to leave the avenger behind
it was the afternoon coach by which i had taken my place and as winter had now come round i should not arrive at my destination until two or three hours after dark
our time of starting from the cross keys was two oclock
i arrived on the ground with a quarter of an hour to spare attended by the avengerif i may connect that expression with one who never attended on me if he could possibly help it
at that time it was customary to carry convicts down to the dockyards by stagecoach
as i had often heard of them in the capacity of outside passengers and had more than once seen them on the high road dangling their ironed legs over the coach roof i had no cause to be surprised when herbert meeting me in the yard came up and told me there were two convicts going down with me
but i had a reason that was an old reason now for constitutionally faltering whenever i heard the word convict you dont mind them handel said herbert
o no i thought you seemed as if you didnt like them i cant pretend that i do like them and i suppose you dont particularly
but i dont mind them see
there they are said herbert coming out of the tap
what a degraded and vile sight it is they had been treating their guard i suppose for they had a gaoler with them and all three came out wiping their mouths on their hands
the two convicts were handcuffed together and had irons on their legsirons of a pattern that i knew well
they wore the dress that i likewise knew well
their keeper had a brace of pistols and carried a thickknobbed bludgeon under his arm but he was on terms of good understanding with them and stood with them beside him looking on at the puttingto of the horses rather with an air as if the convicts were an interesting exhibition not formally open at the moment and he the curator
one was a taller and stouter man than the other and appeared as a matter of course according to the mysterious ways of the world both convict and free to have had allotted to him the smaller suit of clothes
his arms and legs were like great pincushions of those shapes and his attire disguised him absurdly but i knew his halfclosed eye at one glance
there stood the man whom i had seen on the settle at the three jolly bargemen on a saturday night and who had brought me down with his invisible gun
it was easy to make sure that as yet he knew me no more than if he had never seen me in his life
he looked across at me and his eye appraised my watchchain and then he incidentally spat and said something to the other convict and they laughed and slued themselves round with a clink of their coupling manacle and looked at something else
the great numbers on their backs as if they were street doors their coarse mangy ungainly outer surface as if they were lower animals their ironed legs apologetically garlanded with pockethandkerchiefs and the way in which all present looked at them and kept from them made them as herbert had said a most disagreeable and degraded spectacle
but this was not the worst of it
it came out that the whole of the back of the coach had been taken by a family removing from london and that there were no places for the two prisoners but on the seat in front behind the coachman
hereupon a choleric gentleman who had taken the fourth place on that seat flew into a most violent passion and said that it was a breach of contract to mix him up with such villainous company and that it was poisonous and pernicious and infamous and shameful and i dont know what else
at this time the coach was ready and the coachman impatient and we were all preparing to get up and the prisoners had come over with their keeperbringing with them that curious flavour of breadpoultice baize ropeyarn and hearthstone which attends the convict presence
dont take it so much amiss sir pleaded the keeper to the angry passenger ill sit next you myself
ill put em on the outside of the row
they wont interfere with you sir
you neednt know theyre there and dont blame me growled the convict i had recognised
i dont want to go
i am quite ready to stay behind
as fur as i am concerned any ones welcome to my place or mine said the other gruffly
i wouldnt have incommoded none of you if id had my way then they both laughed and began cracking nuts and spitting the shells aboutas i really think i should have liked to do myself if i had been in their place and so despised
at length it was voted that there was no help for the angry gentleman and that he must either go in his chance company or remain behind
so he got into his place still making complaints and the keeper got into the place next him and the convicts hauled themselves up as well as they could and the convict i had recognised sat behind me with his breath on the hair of my head
goodbye handel herbert called out as we started
i thought what a blessed fortune it was that he had found another name for me than pip
it is impossible to express with what acuteness i felt the convicts breathing not only on the back of my head but all along my spine
the sensation was like being touched in the marrow with some pungent and searching acid it set my very teeth on edge
he seemed to have more breathing business to do than another man and to make more noise in doing it and i was conscious of growing highshouldered on one side in my shrinking endeavours to fend him off
the weather was miserably raw and the two cursed the cold
it made us all lethargic before we had gone far and when we had left the halfway house behind we habitually dozed and shivered and were silent
i dozed off myself in considering the question whether i ought to restore a couple of pounds sterling to this creature before losing sight of him and how it could best be done
in the act of dipping forward as if i were going to bathe among the horses i woke in a fright and took the question up again
but i must have lost it longer than i had thought since although i could recognise nothing in the darkness and the fitful lights and shadows of our lamps i traced marsh country in the cold damp wind that blew at us
cowering forward for warmth and to make me a screen against the wind the convicts were closer to me than before
the very first words i heard them interchange as i became conscious were the words of my own thought two one pound notes how did he get em said the convict i had never seen
how should i know returned the other
he had em stowed away somehows
giv him by friends i expect i wish said the other with a bitter curse upon the cold that i had em here two one pound notes or friends two one pound notes
id sell all the friends i ever had for one and think it a blessed good bargain
well
so he says so he says resumed the convict i had recognisedit was all said and done in half a minute behind a pile of timber in the dockyardyoure agoing to be discharged yes i was
would i find out that boy that had fed him and kep his secret and give him them two one pound notes
yes i would
and i did more fool you growled the other
id have spent em on a man in wittles and drink
he must have been a green one
mean to say he knowed nothing of you not a haporth
different gangs and different ships
he was tried again for prison breaking and got made a lifer and was thathonourthe only time you worked out in this part of the country the only time what might have been your opinion of the place a most beastly place
mudbank mist swamp and work work swamp mist and mudbank they both execrated the place in very strong language and gradually growled themselves out and had nothing left to say
after overhearing this dialogue i should assuredly have got down and been left in the solitude and darkness of the highway but for feeling certain that the man had no suspicion of my identity
indeed i was not only so changed in the course of nature but so differently dressed and so differently circumstanced that it was not at all likely he could have known me without accidental help
still the coincidence of our being together on the coach was sufficiently strange to fill me with a dread that some other coincidence might at any moment connect me in his hearing with my name
for this reason i resolved to alight as soon as we touched the town and put myself out of his hearing
this device i executed successfully
my little portmanteau was in the boot under my feet i had but to turn a hinge to get it out i threw it down before me got down after it and was left at the first lamp on the first stones of the town pavement
as to the convicts they went their way with the coach and i knew at what point they would be spirited off to the river
in my fancy i saw the boat with its convict crew waiting for them at the slimewashed stairsagain heard the gruff give way you like and order to dogsagain saw the wicked noahs ark lying out on the black water
i could not have said what i was afraid of for my fear was altogether undefined and vague but there was great fear upon me
as i walked on to the hotel i felt that a dread much exceeding the mere apprehension of a painful or disagreeable recognition made me tremble
i am confident that it took no distinctness of shape and that it was the revival for a few minutes of the terror of childhood
the coffeeroom at the blue boar was empty and i had not only ordered my dinner there but had sat down to it before the waiter knew me
as soon as he had apologised for the remissness of his memory he asked me if he should send boots for mr pumblechook
no said i certainly not the waiter it was he who had brought up the great remonstrance from the commercials on the day when i was bound appeared surprised and took the earliest opportunity of putting a dirty old copy of a local newspaper so directly in my way that i took it up and read this paragraph our readers will learn not altogether without interest in reference to the recent romantic rise in fortune of a young artificer in iron of this neighbourhood what a theme by the way for the magic pen of our as yet not universally acknowledged townsman tooby the poet of our columns
that the youths earliest patron companion and friend was a highly respected individual not entirely unconnected with the corn and seed trade and whose eminently convenient and commodious business premises are situate within a hundred miles of the high street
it is not wholly irrespective of our personal feelings that we record him as the mentor of our young telemachus for it is good to know that our town produced the founder of the latters fortunes
does the thoughtcontracted brow of the local sage or the lustrous eye of local beauty inquire whose fortunes
we believe that quintin matsys was the blacksmith of antwerp
verb
sap
i entertain a conviction based upon large experience that if in the days of my prosperity i had gone to the north pole i should have met somebody there wandering esquimaux or civilized man who would have told me that pumblechook was my earliest patron and the founder of my fortunes
chapter xxix
betimes in the morning i was up and out
it was too early yet to go to miss havishams so i loitered into the country on miss havishams side of townwhich was not joes side i could go there tomorrowthinking about my patroness and painting brilliant pictures of her plans for me
she had adopted estella she had as good as adopted me and it could not fail to be her intention to bring us together
she reserved it for me to restore the desolate house admit the sunshine into the dark rooms set the clocks agoing and the cold hearths ablazing tear down the cobwebs destroy the verminin short do all the shining deeds of the young knight of romance and marry the princess
i had stopped to look at the house as i passed and its seared red brick walls blocked windows and strong green ivy clasping even the stacks of chimneys with its twigs and tendons as if with sinewy old arms had made up a rich attractive mystery of which i was the hero
estella was the inspiration of it and the heart of it of course
but though she had taken such strong possession of me though my fancy and my hope were so set upon her though her influence on my boyish life and character had been allpowerful i did not even that romantic morning invest her with any attributes save those she possessed
i mention this in this place of a fixed purpose because it is the clue by which i am to be followed into my poor labyrinth
according to my experience the conventional notion of a lover cannot be always true
the unqualified truth is that when i loved estella with the love of a man i loved her simply because i found her irresistible
once for all i knew to my sorrow often and often if not always that i loved her against reason against promise against peace against hope against happiness against all discouragement that could be
once for all i loved her none the less because i knew it and it had no more influence in restraining me than if i had devoutly believed her to be human perfection
i so shaped out my walk as to arrive at the gate at my old time
when i had rung at the bell with an unsteady hand i turned my back upon the gate while i tried to get my breath and keep the beating of my heart moderately quiet
i heard the sidedoor open and steps come across the courtyard but i pretended not to hear even when the gate swung on its rusty hinges
being at last touched on the shoulder i started and turned
i started much more naturally then to find myself confronted by a man in a sober grey dress
the last man i should have expected to see in that place of porter at miss havishams door
orlick ah young master theres more changes than yours
but come in come in
its opposed to my orders to hold the gate open i entered and he swung it and locked it and took the key out
yes said he facing round after doggedly preceding me a few steps towards the house
here i am how did you come here i come here he retorted on my legs
i had my box brought alongside me in a barrow are you here for good i aint here for harm young master i suppose i was not so sure of that
i had leisure to entertain the retort in my mind while he slowly lifted his heavy glance from the pavement up my legs and arms to my face
then you have left the forge i said
do this look like a forge replied orlick sending his glance all round him with an air of injury
now do it look like it i asked him how long he had left gargerys forge
one day is so like another here he replied that i dont know without casting it up
however i come here some time since you left i could have told you that orlick ah said he dryly
but then youve got to be a scholar by this time we had come to the house where i found his room to be one just within the sidedoor with a little window in it looking on the courtyard
in its small proportions it was not unlike the kind of place usually assigned to a gateporter in paris
certain keys were hanging on the wall to which he now added the gate key and his patchworkcovered bed was in a little inner division or recess
the whole had a slovenly confined and sleepy look like a cage for a human dormouse while he looming dark and heavy in the shadow of a corner by the window looked like the human dormouse for whom it was fitted upas indeed he was
i never saw this room before i remarked but there used to be no porter here no said he not till it got about that there was no protection on the premises and it come to be considered dangerous with convicts and tag and rag and bobtail going up and down
and then i was recommended to the place as a man who could give another man as good as he brought and i took it
its easier than bellowsing and hammeringthats loaded that is my eye had been caught by a gun with a brassbound stock over the chimneypiece and his eye had followed mine
well said i not desirous of more conversation shall i go up to miss havisham burn me if i know he retorted first stretching himself and then shaking himself my orders ends here young master
i give this here bell a rap with this here hammer and you go on along the passage till you meet somebody i am expected i believe burn me twice over if i can say said he
upon that i turned down the long passage which i had first trodden in my thick boots and he made his bell sound
at the end of the passage while the bell was still reverberating i found sarah pocket who appeared to have now become constitutionally green and yellow by reason of me
oh said she
you is it mr pip it is miss pocket
i am glad to tell you that mr pocket and family are all well are they any wiser said sarah with a dismal shake of the head they had better be wiser than well
ah matthew matthew
you know your way sir tolerably for i had gone up the staircase in the dark many a time
i ascended it now in lighter boots than of yore and tapped in my old way at the door of miss havishams room
pips rap i heard her say immediately come in pip she was in her chair near the old table in the old dress with her two hands crossed on her stick her chin resting on them and her eyes on the fire
sitting near her with the white shoe that had never been worn in her hand and her head bent as she looked at it was an elegant lady whom i had never seen
come in pip miss havisham continued to mutter without looking round or up come in pip how do you do pip
so you kiss my hand as if i were a queen ehwell she looked up at me suddenly only moving her eyes and repeated in a grimly playful manner well i heard miss havisham said i rather at a loss that you were so kind as to wish me to come and see you and i came directly well the lady whom i had never seen before lifted up her eyes and looked archly at me and then i saw that the eyes were estellas eyes
but she was so much changed was so much more beautiful so much more womanly in all things winning admiration had made such wonderful advance that i seemed to have made none
i fancied as i looked at her that i slipped hopelessly back into the coarse and common boy again
o the sense of distance and disparity that came upon me and the inaccessibility that came about her
she gave me her hand
i stammered something about the pleasure i felt in seeing her again and about my having looked forward to it for a long long time
do you find her much changed pip asked miss havisham with her greedy look and striking her stick upon a chair that stood between them as a sign to me to sit down there
when i came in miss havisham i thought there was nothing of estella in the face or figure but now it all settles down so curiously into the old what
you are not going to say into the old estella miss havisham interrupted
she was proud and insulting and you wanted to go away from her
dont you remember i said confusedly that that was long ago and that i knew no better then and the like
estella smiled with perfect composure and said she had no doubt of my having been quite right and of her having been very disagreeable
is he changed miss havisham asked her
very much said estella looking at me
less coarse and common said miss havisham playing with estellas hair
estella laughed and looked at the shoe in her hand and laughed again and looked at me and put the shoe down
she treated me as a boy still but she lured me on
we sat in the dreamy room among the old strange influences which had so wrought upon me and i learnt that she had but just come home from france and that she was going to london
proud and wilful as of old she had brought those qualities into such subjection to her beauty that it was impossible and out of natureor i thought soto separate them from her beauty
truly it was impossible to dissociate her presence from all those wretched hankerings after money and gentility that had disturbed my boyhoodfrom all those illregulated aspirations that had first made me ashamed of home and joefrom all those visions that had raised her face in the glowing fire struck it out of the iron on the anvil extracted it from the darkness of night to look in at the wooden window of the forge and flit away
in a word it was impossible for me to separate her in the past or in the present from the innermost life of my life
it was settled that i should stay there all the rest of the day and return to the hotel at night and to london tomorrow
when we had conversed for a while miss havisham sent us two out to walk in the neglected garden on our coming in by and by she said i should wheel her about a little as in times of yore
so estella and i went out into the garden by the gate through which i had strayed to my encounter with the pale young gentleman now herbert i trembling in spirit and worshipping the very hem of her dress she quite composed and most decidedly not worshipping the hem of mine
as we drew near to the place of encounter she stopped and said i must have been a singular little creature to hide and see that fight that day but i did and i enjoyed it very much you rewarded me very much did i she replied in an incidental and forgetful way
i remember i entertained a great objection to your adversary because i took it ill that he should be brought here to pester me with his company he and i are great friends now are you
i think i recollect though that you read with his father yes i made the admission with reluctance for it seemed to have a boyish look and she already treated me more than enough like a boy
since your change of fortune and prospects you have changed your companions said estella
naturally said i
and necessarily she added in a haughty tone what was fit company for you once would be quite unfit company for you now in my conscience i doubt very much whether i had any lingering intention left of going to see joe but if i had this observation put it to flight
you had no idea of your impending good fortune in those times said estella with a slight wave of her hand signifying in the fighting times
not the least the air of completeness and superiority with which she walked at my side and the air of youthfulness and submission with which i walked at hers made a contrast that i strongly felt
it would have rankled in me more than it did if i had not regarded myself as eliciting it by being so set apart for her and assigned to her
the garden was too overgrown and rank for walking in with ease and after we had made the round of it twice or thrice we came out again into the brewery yard
i showed her to a nicety where i had seen her walking on the casks that first old day and she said with a cold and careless look in that direction did i i reminded her where she had come out of the house and given me my meat and drink and she said i dont remember not remember that you made me cry said i
no said she and shook her head and looked about her
i verily believe that her not remembering and not minding in the least made me cry again inwardlyand that is the sharpest crying of all
you must know said estella condescending to me as a brilliant and beautiful woman might that i have no heartif that has anything to do with my memory i got through some jargon to the effect that i took the liberty of doubting that
that i knew better
that there could be no such beauty without it
oh
i have a heart to be stabbed in or shot in i have no doubt said estella and of course if it ceased to beat i should cease to be
but you know what i mean
i have no softness there nosympathysentimentnonsense what was it that was borne in upon my mind when she stood still and looked attentively at me
anything that i had seen in miss havisham
no
in some of her looks and gestures there was that tinge of resemblance to miss havisham which may often be noticed to have been acquired by children from grown person with whom they have been much associated and secluded and which when childhood is passed will produce a remarkable occasional likeness of expression between faces that are otherwise quite different
and yet i could not trace this to miss havisham
i looked again and though she was still looking at me the suggestion was gone
what was it
i am serious said estella not so much with a frown for her brow was smooth as with a darkening of her face if we are to be thrown much together you had better believe it at once
no imperiously stopping me as i opened my lips
i have not bestowed my tenderness anywhere
i have never had any such thing in another moment we were in the brewery so long disused and she pointed to the high gallery where i had seen her going out on that same first day and told me she remembered to have been up there and to have seen me standing scared below
as my eyes followed her white hand again the same dim suggestion that i could not possibly grasp crossed me
my involuntary start occasioned her to lay her hand upon my arm
instantly the ghost passed once more and was gone
what was it
what is the matter asked estella
are you scared again i should be if i believed what you said just now i replied to turn it off
then you dont
very well
it is said at any rate
miss havisham will soon be expecting you at your old post though i think that might be laid aside now with other old belongings
let us make one more round of the garden and then go in
come
you shall not shed tears for my cruelty today you shall be my page and give me your shoulder her handsome dress had trailed upon the ground
she held it in one hand now and with the other lightly touched my shoulder as we walked
we walked round the ruined garden twice or thrice more and it was all in bloom for me
if the green and yellow growth of weed in the chinks of the old wall had been the most precious flowers that ever blew it could not have been more cherished in my remembrance
there was no discrepancy of years between us to remove her far from me we were of nearly the same age though of course the age told for more in her case than in mine but the air of inaccessibility which her beauty and her manner gave her tormented me in the midst of my delight and at the height of the assurance i felt that our patroness had chosen us for one another
wretched boy
at last we went back into the house and there i heard with surprise that my guardian had come down to see miss havisham on business and would come back to dinner
the old wintry branches of chandeliers in the room where the mouldering table was spread had been lighted while we were out and miss havisham was in her chair and waiting for me
it was like pushing the chair itself back into the past when we began the old slow circuit round about the ashes of the bridal feast
but in the funereal room with that figure of the grave fallen back in the chair fixing its eyes upon her estella looked more bright and beautiful than before and i was under stronger enchantment
the time so melted away that our early dinnerhour drew close at hand and estella left us to prepare herself
we had stopped near the centre of the long table and miss havisham with one of her withered arms stretched out of the chair rested that clenched hand upon the yellow cloth
as estella looked back over her shoulder before going out at the door miss havisham kissed that hand to her with a ravenous intensity that was of its kind quite dreadful
then estella being gone and we two left alone she turned to me and said in a whisper is she beautiful graceful wellgrown
do you admire her everybody must who sees her miss havisham she drew an arm round my neck and drew my head close down to hers as she sat in the chair
love her love her love her
how does she use you before i could answer if i could have answered so difficult a question at all she repeated love her love her love her
if she favours you love her
if she wounds you love her
if she tears your heart to piecesand as it gets older and stronger it will tear deeperlove her love her love her never had i seen such passionate eagerness as was joined to her utterance of these words
i could feel the muscles of the thin arm round my neck swell with the vehemence that possessed her
hear me pip
i adopted her to be loved
i bred her and educated her to be loved
i developed her into what she is that she might be loved
love her she said the word often enough and there could be no doubt that she meant to say it but if the often repeated word had been hate instead of lovedespairrevengedire deathit could not have sounded from her lips more like a curse
ill tell you said she in the same hurried passionate whisper what real love is
it is blind devotion unquestioning selfhumiliation utter submission trust and belief against yourself and against the whole world giving up your whole heart and soul to the smiteras i did when she came to that and to a wild cry that followed that i caught her round the waist
for she rose up in the chair in her shroud of a dress and struck at the air as if she would as soon have struck herself against the wall and fallen dead
all this passed in a few seconds
as i drew her down into her chair i was conscious of a scent that i knew and turning saw my guardian in the room
he always carried i have not yet mentioned it i think a pockethandkerchief of rich silk and of imposing proportions which was of great value to him in his profession
i have seen him so terrify a client or a witness by ceremoniously unfolding this pockethandkerchief as if he were immediately going to blow his nose and then pausing as if he knew he should not have time to do it before such client or witness committed himself that the selfcommittal has followed directly quite as a matter of course
when i saw him in the room he had this expressive pockethandkerchief in both hands and was looking at us
on meeting my eye he said plainly by a momentary and silent pause in that attitude indeed
singular and then put the handkerchief to its right use with wonderful effect
miss havisham had seen him as soon as i and was like everybody else afraid of him
she made a strong attempt to compose herself and stammered that he was as punctual as ever
as punctual as ever he repeated coming up to us
how do you do pip
shall i give you a ride miss havisham
once round
and so you are here pip i told him when i had arrived and how miss havisham had wished me to come and see estella
to which he replied ah
very fine young lady then he pushed miss havisham in her chair before him with one of his large hands and put the other in his trouserspocket as if the pocket were full of secrets
well pip
how often have you seen miss estella before said he when he came to a stop
how often ah
how many times
ten thousand times oh
certainly not so many twice jaggers interposed miss havisham much to my relief leave my pip alone and go with him to your dinner he complied and we groped our way down the dark stairs together
while we were still on our way to those detached apartments across the paved yard at the back he asked me how often i had seen miss havisham eat and drink offering me a breadth of choice as usual between a hundred times and once
i considered and said never and never will pip he retorted with a frowning smile
she has never allowed herself to be seen doing either since she lived this present life of hers
she wanders about in the night and then lays hands on such food as she takes pray sir said i may i ask you a question you may said he and i may decline to answer it
put your question estellas name
is it havisham or i had nothing to add
or what said he
is it havisham it is havisham this brought us to the dinnertable where she and sarah pocket awaited us
mr jaggers presided estella sat opposite to him i faced my green and yellow friend
we dined very well and were waited on by a maidservant whom i had never seen in all my comings and goings but who for anything i know had been in that mysterious house the whole time
after dinner a bottle of choice old port was placed before my guardian he was evidently well acquainted with the vintage and the two ladies left us
anything to equal the determined reticence of mr jaggers under that roof i never saw elsewhere even in him
he kept his very looks to himself and scarcely directed his eyes to estellas face once during dinner
when she spoke to him he listened and in due course answered but never looked at her that i could see
on the other hand she often looked at him with interest and curiosity if not distrust but his face never showed the least consciousness
throughout dinner he took a dry delight in making sarah pocket greener and yellower by often referring in conversation with me to my expectations but here again he showed no consciousness and even made it appear that he extortedand even did extort though i dont know howthose references out of my innocent self
and when he and i were left alone together he sat with an air upon him of general lying by in consequence of information he possessed that really was too much for me
he crossexamined his very wine when he had nothing else in hand
he held it between himself and the candle tasted the port rolled it in his mouth swallowed it looked at his glass again smelt the port tried it drank it filled again and crossexamined the glass again until i was as nervous as if i had known the wine to be telling him something to my disadvantage
three or four times i feebly thought i would start conversation but whenever he saw me going to ask him anything he looked at me with his glass in his hand and rolling his wine about in his mouth as if requesting me to take notice that it was of no use for he couldnt answer
i think miss pocket was conscious that the sight of me involved her in the danger of being goaded to madness and perhaps tearing off her capwhich was a very hideous one in the nature of a muslin mopand strewing the ground with her hairwhich assuredly had never grown on her head
she did not appear when we afterwards went up to miss havishams room and we four played at whist
in the interval miss havisham in a fantastic way had put some of the most beautiful jewels from her dressingtable into estellas hair and about her bosom and arms and i saw even my guardian look at her from under his thick eyebrows and raise them a little when her loveliness was before him with those rich flushes of glitter and colour in it
illustration of the manner and extent to which he took our trumps into custody and came out with mean little cards at the ends of hands before which the glory of our kings and queens was utterly abased i say nothing nor of the feeling that i had respecting his looking upon us personally in the light of three very obvious and poor riddles that he had found out long ago
what i suffered from was the incompatibility between his cold presence and my feelings towards estella
it was not that i knew i could never bear to speak to him about her that i knew i could never bear to hear him creak his boots at her that i knew i could never bear to see him wash his hands of her it was that my admiration should be within a foot or two of himit was that my feelings should be in the same place with himthat was the agonizing circumstance
we played until nine oclock and then it was arranged that when estella came to london i should be forewarned of her coming and should meet her at the coach and then i took leave of her and touched her and left her
my guardian lay at the boar in the next room to mine
far into the night miss havishams words love her love her love her sounded in my ears
i adapted them for my own repetition and said to my pillow i love her i love her i love her hundreds of times
then a burst of gratitude came upon me that she should be destined for me once the blacksmiths boy
then i thought if she were as i feared by no means rapturously grateful for that destiny yet when would she begin to be interested in me
when should i awaken the heart within her that was mute and sleeping now
ah me
i thought those were high and great emotions
but i never thought there was anything low and small in my keeping away from joe because i knew she would be contemptuous of him
it was but a day gone and joe had brought the tears into my eyes they had soon dried god forgive me
soon dried
chapter xxx
after well considering the matter while i was dressing at the blue boar in the morning i resolved to tell my guardian that i doubted orlicks being the right sort of man to fill a post of trust at miss havishams
why of course he is not the right sort of man pip said my guardian comfortably satisfied beforehand on the general head because the man who fills the post of trust never is the right sort of man it seemed quite to put him into spirits to find that this particular post was not exceptionally held by the right sort of man and he listened in a satisfied manner while i told him what knowledge i had of orlick
very good pip he observed when i had concluded ill go round presently and pay our friend off rather alarmed by this summary action i was for a little delay and even hinted that our friend himself might be difficult to deal with
oh no he wont said my guardian making his pockethandkerchiefpoint with perfect confidence i should like to see him argue the question with me as we were going back together to london by the midday coach and as i breakfasted under such terrors of pumblechook that i could scarcely hold my cup this gave me an opportunity of saying that i wanted a walk and that i would go on along the london road while mr jaggers was occupied if he would let the coachman know that i would get into my place when overtaken
i was thus enabled to fly from the blue boar immediately after breakfast
by then making a loop of about a couple of miles into the open country at the back of pumblechooks premises i got round into the high street again a little beyond that pitfall and felt myself in comparative security
it was interesting to be in the quiet old town once more and it was not disagreeable to be here and there suddenly recognised and stared after
one or two of the tradespeople even darted out of their shops and went a little way down the street before me that they might turn as if they had forgotten something and pass me face to faceon which occasions i dont know whether they or i made the worse pretence they of not doing it or i of not seeing it
still my position was a distinguished one and i was not at all dissatisfied with it until fate threw me in the way of that unlimited miscreant trabbs boy
casting my eyes along the street at a certain point of my progress i beheld trabbs boy approaching lashing himself with an empty blue bag
deeming that a serene and unconscious contemplation of him would best beseem me and would be most likely to quell his evil mind i advanced with that expression of countenance and was rather congratulating myself on my success when suddenly the knees of trabbs boy smote together his hair uprose his cap fell off he trembled violently in every limb staggered out into the road and crying to the populace hold me
im so frightened feigned to be in a paroxysm of terror and contrition occasioned by the dignity of my appearance
as i passed him his teeth loudly chattered in his head and with every mark of extreme humiliation he prostrated himself in the dust
this was a hard thing to bear but this was nothing
i had not advanced another two hundred yards when to my inexpressible terror amazement and indignation i again beheld trabbs boy approaching
he was coming round a narrow corner
his blue bag was slung over his shoulder honest industry beamed in his eyes a determination to proceed to trabbs with cheerful briskness was indicated in his gait
with a shock he became aware of me and was severely visited as before but this time his motion was rotatory and he staggered round and round me with knees more afflicted and with uplifted hands as if beseeching for mercy
his sufferings were hailed with the greatest joy by a knot of spectators and i felt utterly confounded
i had not got as much further down the street as the postoffice when i again beheld trabbs boy shooting round by a back way
this time he was entirely changed
he wore the blue bag in the manner of my greatcoat and was strutting along the pavement towards me on the opposite side of the street attended by a company of delighted young friends to whom he from time to time exclaimed with a wave of his hand dont know yah words cannot state the amount of aggravation and injury wreaked upon me by trabbs boy when passing abreast of me he pulled up his shirtcollar twined his sidehair stuck an arm akimbo and smirked extravagantly by wriggling his elbows and body and drawling to his attendants dont know yah dont know yah pon my soul dont know yah the disgrace attendant on his immediately afterwards taking to crowing and pursuing me across the bridge with crows as from an exceedingly dejected fowl who had known me when i was a blacksmith culminated the disgrace with which i left the town and was so to speak ejected by it into the open country
illustration but unless i had taken the life of trabbs boy on that occasion i really do not even now see what i could have done save endure
to have struggled with him in the street or to have exacted any lower recompense from him than his hearts best blood would have been futile and degrading
moreover he was a boy whom no man could hurt an invulnerable and dodging serpent who when chased into a corner flew out again between his captors legs scornfully yelping
i wrote however to mr trabb by next days post to say that mr pip must decline to deal further with one who could so far forget what he owed to the best interests of society as to employ a boy who excited loathing in every respectable mind
the coach with mr jaggers inside came up in due time and i took my boxseat again and arrived in london safebut not sound for my heart was gone
as soon as i arrived i sent a penitential codfish and barrel of oysters to joe as reparation for not having gone myself and then went on to barnards inn
i found herbert dining on cold meat and delighted to welcome me back
having despatched the avenger to the coffeehouse for an addition to the dinner i felt that i must open my breast that very evening to my friend and chum
as confidence was out of the question with the avenger in the hall which could merely be regarded in the light of an antechamber to the keyhole i sent him to the play
a better proof of the severity of my bondage to that taskmaster could scarcely be afforded than the degrading shifts to which i was constantly driven to find him employment
so mean is extremity that i sometimes sent him to hyde park corner to see what oclock it was
dinner done and we sitting with our feet upon the fender i said to herbert my dear herbert i have something very particular to tell you my dear handel he returned i shall esteem and respect your confidence it concerns myself herbert said i and one other person herbert crossed his feet looked at the fire with his head on one side and having looked at it in vain for some time looked at me because i didnt go on
herbert said i laying my hand upon his knee i lovei adoreestella instead of being transfixed herbert replied in an easy matterofcourse way exactly
well well herbert
is that all you say
well what next i mean said herbert
of course i know that how do you know it said i
how do i know it handel
why from you i never told you told me
you have never told me when you have got your hair cut but i have had senses to perceive it
you have always adored her ever since i have known you
you brought your adoration and your portmanteau here together
told me
why you have always told me all day long
when you told me your own story you told me plainly that you began adoring her the first time you saw her when you were very young indeed very well then said i to whom this was a new and not unwelcome light i have never left off adoring her
and she has come back a most beautiful and most elegant creature
and i saw her yesterday
and if i adored her before i now doubly adore her lucky for you then handel said herbert that you are picked out for her and allotted to her
without encroaching on forbidden ground we may venture to say that there can be no doubt between ourselves of that fact
have you any idea yet of estellas views on the adoration question i shook my head gloomily
oh
she is thousands of miles away from me said i
patience my dear handel time enough time enough
but you have something more to say i am ashamed to say it i returned and yet its no worse to say it than to think it
you call me a lucky fellow
of course i am
i was a blacksmiths boy but yesterday i amwhat shall i say i amtoday say a good fellow if you want a phrase returned herbert smiling and clapping his hand on the back of minea good fellow with impetuosity and hesitation boldness and diffidence action and dreaming curiously mixed in him i stopped for a moment to consider whether there really was this mixture in my character
on the whole i by no means recognised the analysis but thought it not worth disputing
when i ask what i am to call myself today herbert i went on i suggest what i have in my thoughts
you say i am lucky
i know i have done nothing to raise myself in life and that fortune alone has raised me that is being very lucky
and yet when i think of estella and when dont you you know herbert threw in with his eyes on the fire which i thought kind and sympathetic of him
then my dear herbert i cannot tell you how dependent and uncertain i feel and how exposed to hundreds of chances
avoiding forbidden ground as you did just now i may still say that on the constancy of one person naming no person all my expectations depend
and at the best how indefinite and unsatisfactory only to know so vaguely what they are in saying this i relieved my mind of what had always been there more or less though no doubt most since yesterday
now handel herbert replied in his gay hopeful way it seems to me that in the despondency of the tender passion we are looking into our gifthorses mouth with a magnifyingglass
likewise it seems to me that concentrating our attention on the examination we altogether overlook one of the best points of the animal
didnt you tell me that your guardian mr jaggers told you in the beginning that you were not endowed with expectations only
and even if he had not told you sothough that is a very large if i grantcould you believe that of all men in london mr jaggers is the man to hold his present relations towards you unless he were sure of his ground i said i could not deny that this was a strong point
i said it people often do so in such cases like a rather reluctant concession to truth and justiceas if i wanted to deny it
i should think it was a strong point said herbert and i should think you would be puzzled to imagine a stronger as to the rest you must bide your guardians time and he must bide his clients time
youll be oneandtwenty before you know where you are and then perhaps youll get some further enlightenment
at all events youll be nearer getting it for it must come at last what a hopeful disposition you have said i gratefully admiring his cheery ways
i ought to have said herbert for i have not much else
i must acknowledge by the by that the good sense of what i have just said is not my own but my fathers
the only remark i ever heard him make on your story was the final one the thing is settled and done or mr jaggers would not be in it and now before i say anything more about my father or my fathers son and repay confidence with confidence i want to make myself seriously disagreeable to you for a momentpositively repulsive you wont succeed said i
o yes i shall said he
one two three and now i am in for it
handel my good fellowthough he spoke in this light tone he was very much in earnesti have been thinking since we have been talking with our feet on this fender that estella surely cannot be a condition of your inheritance if she was never referred to by your guardian
am i right in so understanding what you have told me as that he never referred to her directly or indirectly in any way
never even hinted for instance that your patron might have views as to your marriage ultimately never now handel i am quite free from the flavour of sour grapes upon my soul and honour
not being bound to her can you not detach yourself from heri told you i should be disagreeable i turned my head aside for with a rush and a sweep like the old marsh winds coming up from the sea a feeling like that which had subdued me on the morning when i left the forge when the mists were solemnly rising and when i laid my hand upon the village fingerpost smote upon my heart again
there was silence between us for a little while
yes but my dear handel herbert went on as if we had been talking instead of silent its having been so strongly rooted in the breast of a boy whom nature and circumstances made so romantic renders it very serious
think of her bringingup and think of miss havisham
think of what she is herself now i am repulsive and you abominate me
this may lead to miserable things i know it herbert said i with my head still turned away but i cant help it you cant detach yourself no
impossible you cant try handel no
impossible well said herbert getting up with a lively shake as if he had been asleep and stirring the fire now ill endeavour to make myself agreeable again so he went round the room and shook the curtains out put the chairs in their places tidied the books and so forth that were lying about looked into the hall peeped into the letterbox shut the door and came back to his chair by the fire where he sat down nursing his left leg in both arms
i was going to say a word or two handel concerning my father and my fathers son
i am afraid it is scarcely necessary for my fathers son to remark that my fathers establishment is not particularly brilliant in its housekeeping there is always plenty herbert said i to say something encouraging
o yes
and so the dustman says i believe with the strongest approval and so does the marinestore shop in the back street
gravely handel for the subject is grave enough you know how it is as well as i do
i suppose there was a time once when my father had not given matters up but if ever there was the time is gone
may i ask you if you have ever had an opportunity of remarking down in your part of the country that the children of not exactly suitable marriages are always most particularly anxious to be married this was such a singular question that i asked him in return is it so i dont know said herbert thats what i want to know
because it is decidedly the case with us
my poor sister charlotte who was next me and died before she was fourteen was a striking example
little jane is the same
in her desire to be matrimonially established you might suppose her to have passed her short existence in the perpetual contemplation of domestic bliss
little alick in a frock has already made arrangements for his union with a suitable young person at kew
and indeed i think we are all engaged except the baby then you are said i
i am said herbert but its a secret i assured him of my keeping the secret and begged to be favoured with further particulars
he had spoken so sensibly and feelingly of my weakness that i wanted to know something about his strength
may i ask the name i said
name of clara said herbert
live in london yes perhaps i ought to mention said herbert who had become curiously crestfallen and meek since we entered on the interesting theme that she is rather below my mothers nonsensical family notions
her father had to do with the victualling of passengerships
i think he was a species of purser what is he now said i
hes an invalid now replied herbert
living on on the first floor said herbert
which was not at all what i meant for i had intended my question to apply to his means
i have never seen him for he has always kept his room overhead since i have known clara
but i have heard him constantly
he makes tremendous rowsroars and pegs at the floor with some frightful instrument in looking at me and then laughing heartily herbert for the time recovered his usual lively manner
dont you expect to see him said i
o yes i constantly expect to see him returned herbert because i never hear him without expecting him to come tumbling through the ceiling
but i dont know how long the rafters may hold when he had once more laughed heartily he became meek again and told me that the moment he began to realise capital it was his intention to marry this young lady
he added as a selfevident proposition engendering low spirits but you cant marry you know while youre looking about you as we contemplated the fire and as i thought what a difficult vision to realise this same capital sometimes was i put my hands in my pockets
a folded piece of paper in one of them attracting my attention i opened it and found it to be the playbill i had received from joe relative to the celebrated provincial amateur of roscian renown
and bless my heart i involuntarily added aloud its tonight this changed the subject in an instant and made us hurriedly resolve to go to the play
so when i had pledged myself to comfort and abet herbert in the affair of his heart by all practicable and impracticable means and when herbert had told me that his affianced already knew me by reputation and that i should be presented to her and when we had warmly shaken hands upon our mutual confidence we blew out our candles made up our fire locked our door and issued forth in quest of mr wopsle and denmark
chapter xxxi
on our arrival in denmark we found the king and queen of that country elevated in two armchairs on a kitchentable holding a court
the whole of the danish nobility were in attendance consisting of a noble boy in the washleather boots of a gigantic ancestor a venerable peer with a dirty face who seemed to have risen from the people late in life and the danish chivalry with a comb in its hair and a pair of white silk legs and presenting on the whole a feminine appearance
my gifted townsman stood gloomily apart with folded arms and i could have wished that his curls and forehead had been more probable
several curious little circumstances transpired as the action proceeded
the late king of the country not only appeared to have been troubled with a cough at the time of his decease but to have taken it with him to the tomb and to have brought it back
the royal phantom also carried a ghostly manuscript round its truncheon to which it had the appearance of occasionally referring and that too with an air of anxiety and a tendency to lose the place of reference which were suggestive of a state of mortality
it was this i conceive which led to the shades being advised by the gallery to turn overa recommendation which it took extremely ill
it was likewise to be noted of this majestic spirit that whereas it always appeared with an air of having been out a long time and walked an immense distance it perceptibly came from a closely contiguous wall
this occasioned its terrors to be received derisively
the queen of denmark a very buxom lady though no doubt historically brazen was considered by the public to have too much brass about her her chin being attached to her diadem by a broad band of that metal as if she had a gorgeous toothache her waist being encircled by another and each of her arms by another so that she was openly mentioned as the kettledrum the noble boy in the ancestral boots was inconsistent representing himself as it were in one breath as an able seaman a strolling actor a gravedigger a clergyman and a person of the utmost importance at a court fencingmatch on the authority of whose practised eye and nice discrimination the finest strokes were judged
this gradually led to a want of toleration for him and evenon his being detected in holy orders and declining to perform the funeral serviceto the general indignation taking the form of nuts
lastly ophelia was a prey to such slow musical madness that when in course of time she had taken off her white muslin scarf folded it up and buried it a sulky man who had been long cooling his impatient nose against an iron bar in the front row of the gallery growled now the babys put to bed lets have supper which to say the least of it was out of keeping
upon my unfortunate townsman all these incidents accumulated with playful effect
whenever that undecided prince had to ask a question or state a doubt the public helped him out with it
as for example on the question whether twas nobler in the mind to suffer some roared yes and some no and some inclining to both opinions said toss up for it and quite a debating society arose
when he asked what should such fellows as he do crawling between earth and heaven he was encouraged with loud cries of hear hear when he appeared with his stocking disordered its disorder expressed according to usage by one very neat fold in the top which i suppose to be always got up with a flat iron a conversation took place in the gallery respecting the paleness of his leg and whether it was occasioned by the turn the ghost had given him
on his taking the recordersvery like a little black flute that had just been played in the orchestra and handed out at the doorhe was called upon unanimously for rule britannia
when he recommended the player not to saw the air thus the sulky man said and dont you do it neither youre a deal worse than him and i grieve to add that peals of laughter greeted mr wopsle on every one of these occasions
but his greatest trials were in the churchyard which had the appearance of a primeval forest with a kind of small ecclesiastical washhouse on one side and a turnpike gate on the other
mr wopsle in a comprehensive black cloak being descried entering at the turnpike the gravedigger was admonished in a friendly way look out
heres the undertaker a coming to see how youre a getting on with your work i believe it is well known in a constitutional country that mr wopsle could not possibly have returned the skull after moralizing over it without dusting his fingers on a white napkin taken from his breast but even that innocent and indispensable action did not pass without the comment waiter the arrival of the body for interment in an empty black box with the lid tumbling open was the signal for a general joy which was much enhanced by the discovery among the bearers of an individual obnoxious to identification
the joy attended mr wopsle through his struggle with laertes on the brink of the orchestra and the grave and slackened no more until he had tumbled the king off the kitchentable and had died by inches from the ankles upward
we had made some pale efforts in the beginning to applaud mr wopsle but they were too hopeless to be persisted in
therefore we had sat feeling keenly for him but laughing nevertheless from ear to ear
i laughed in spite of myself all the time the whole thing was so droll and yet i had a latent impression that there was something decidedly fine in mr wopsles elocutionnot for old associations sake i am afraid but because it was very slow very dreary very uphill and downhill and very unlike any way in which any man in any natural circumstances of life or death ever expressed himself about anything
when the tragedy was over and he had been called for and hooted i said to herbert let us go at once or perhaps we shall meet him we made all the haste we could downstairs but we were not quick enough either
standing at the door was a jewish man with an unnatural heavy smear of eyebrow who caught my eyes as we advanced and said when we came up with him mr
pip and friend identity of mr pip and friend confessed
mr
waldengarver said the man would be glad to have the honour waldengarver i repeatedwhen herbert murmured in my ear probably wopsle oh said i
yes
shall we follow you a few steps please when we were in a side alley he turned and asked how did you think he lookedi dressed him i dont know what he had looked like except a funeral with the addition of a large danish sun or star hanging round his neck by a blue ribbon that had given him the appearance of being insured in some extraordinary fire office
but i said he had looked very nice
when he come to the grave said our conductor he showed his cloak beautiful
but judging from the wing it looked to me that when he see the ghost in the queens apartment he might have made more of his stockings i modestly assented and we all fell through a little dirty swing door into a sort of hot packingcase immediately behind it
here mr wopsle was divesting himself of his danish garments and here there was just room for us to look at him over one anothers shoulders by keeping the packingcase door or lid wide open
gentlemen said mr wopsle i am proud to see you
i hope mr pip you will excuse my sending round
i had the happiness to know you in former times and the drama has ever had a claim which has ever been acknowledged on the noble and the affluent meanwhile mr waldengarver in a frightful perspiration was trying to get himself out of his princely sables
skin the stockings off mr waldengarver said the owner of that property or youll bust em
bust em and youll bust fiveandthirty shillings
shakspeare never was complimented with a finer pair
keep quiet in your chair now and leave em to me with that he went upon his knees and began to flay his victim who on the first stocking coming off would certainly have fallen over backward with his chair but for there being no room to fall anyhow
i had been afraid until then to say a word about the play
but then mr waldengarver looked up at us complacently and said gentlemen how did it seem to you to go in front herbert said from behind at the same time poking me capitally so i said capitally how did you like my reading of the character gentlemen said mr waldengarver almost if not quite with patronage
herbert said from behind again poking me massive and concrete so i said boldly as if i had originated it and must beg to insist upon it massive and concrete i am glad to have your approbation gentlemen said mr waldengarver with an air of dignity in spite of his being ground against the wall at the time and holding on by the seat of the chair
but ill tell you one thing mr waldengarver said the man who was on his knees in which youre out in your reading
now mind
i dont care who says contrairy i tell you so
youre out in your reading of hamlet when you get your legs in profile
the last hamlet as i dressed made the same mistakes in his reading at rehearsal till i got him to put a large red wafer on each of his shins and then at that rehearsal which was the last i went in front sir to the back of the pit and whenever his reading brought him into profile i called out i dont see no wafers and at night his reading was lovely mr waldengarver smiled at me as much as to say a faithful dependenti overlook his folly and then said aloud my view is a little classic and thoughtful for them here but they will improve they will improve herbert and i said together o no doubt they would improve
did you observe gentlemen said mr waldengarver that there was a man in the gallery who endeavoured to cast derision on the servicei mean the representation we basely replied that we rather thought we had noticed such a man
i added he was drunk no doubt o dear no sir said mr wopsle not drunk
his employer would see to that sir
his employer would not allow him to be drunk you know his employer said i mr wopsle shut his eyes and opened them again performing both ceremonies very slowly
you must have observed gentlemen said he an ignorant and a blatant ass with a rasping throat and a countenance expressive of low malignity who went throughi will not say sustainedthe rle if i may use a french expression of claudius king of denmark
that is his employer gentlemen
such is the profession without distinctly knowing whether i should have been more sorry for mr wopsle if he had been in despair i was so sorry for him as it was that i took the opportunity of his turning round to have his braces put onwhich jostled us out at the doorwayto ask herbert what he thought of having him home to supper
herbert said he thought it would be kind to do so therefore i invited him and he went to barnards with us wrapped up to the eyes and we did our best for him and he sat until two oclock in the morning reviewing his success and developing his plans
i forget in detail what they were but i have a general recollection that he was to begin with reviving the drama and to end with crushing it inasmuch as his decease would leave it utterly bereft and without a chance or hope
miserably i went to bed after all and miserably thought of estella and miserably dreamed that my expectations were all cancelled and that i had to give my hand in marriage to herberts clara or play hamlet to miss havishams ghost before twenty thousand people without knowing twenty words of it
chapter xxxii
one day when i was busy with my books and mr pocket i received a note by the post the mere outside of which threw me into a great flutter for though i had never seen the handwriting in which it was addressed i divined whose hand it was
it had no set beginning as dear mr pip or dear pip or dear sir or dear anything but ran thus i am to come to london the day after tomorrow by the midday coach
i believe it was settled you should meet me
at all events miss havisham has that impression and i write in obedience to it
she sends you her regard
yours estella if there had been time i should probably have ordered several suits of clothes for this occasion but as there was not i was fain to be content with those i had
my appetite vanished instantly and i knew no peace or rest until the day arrived
not that its arrival brought me either for then i was worse than ever and began haunting the coachoffice in wood street cheapside before the coach had left the blue boar in our town
for all that i knew this perfectly well i still felt as if it were not safe to let the coachoffice be out of my sight longer than five minutes at a time and in this condition of unreason i had performed the first halfhour of a watch of four or five hours when wemmick ran against me
halloa mr pip said he how do you do
i should hardly have thought this was your beat i explained that i was waiting to meet somebody who was coming up by coach and i inquired after the castle and the aged
both flourishing thankye said wemmick and particularly the aged
hes in wonderful feather
hell be eightytwo next birthday
i have a notion of firing eightytwo times if the neighbourhood shouldnt complain and that cannon of mine should prove equal to the pressure
however this is not london talk
where do you think i am going to to the office said i for he was tending in that direction
next thing to it returned wemmick i am going to newgate
we are in a bankersparcel case just at present and i have been down the road taking a squint at the scene of action and thereupon must have a word or two with our client did your client commit the robbery i asked
bless your soul and body no answered wemmick very drily
but he is accused of it
so might you or i be
either of us might be accused of it you know only neither of us is i remarked
yah said wemmick touching me on the breast with his forefinger youre a deep one mr pip
would you like to have a look at newgate
have you time to spare i had so much time to spare that the proposal came as a relief notwithstanding its irreconcilability with my latent desire to keep my eye on the coachoffice
muttering that i would make the inquiry whether i had time to walk with him i went into the office and ascertained from the clerk with the nicest precision and much to the trying of his temper the earliest moment at which the coach could be expectedwhich i knew beforehand quite as well as he
i then rejoined mr wemmick and affecting to consult my watch and to be surprised by the information i had received accepted his offer
we were at newgate in a few minutes and we passed through the lodge where some fetters were hanging up on the bare walls among the prison rules into the interior of the jail
at that time jails were much neglected and the period of exaggerated reaction consequent on all public wrongdoingand which is always its heaviest and longest punishmentwas still far off
so felons were not lodged and fed better than soldiers to say nothing of paupers and seldom set fire to their prisons with the excusable object of improving the flavour of their soup
it was visiting time when wemmick took me in and a potman was going his rounds with beer and the prisoners behind bars in yards were buying beer and talking to friends and a frowzy ugly disorderly depressing scene it was
it struck me that wemmick walked among the prisoners much as a gardener might walk among his plants
this was first put into my head by his seeing a shoot that had come up in the night and saying what captain tom
are you there
ah indeed and also is that black bill behind the cistern
why i didnt look for you these two months how do you find yourself equally in his stopping at the bars and attending to anxious whisperersalways singlywemmick with his postoffice in an immovable state looked at them while in conference as if he were taking particular notice of the advance they had made since last observed towards coming out in full blow at their trial
he was highly popular and i found that he took the familiar department of mr jaggerss business though something of the state of mr jaggers hung about him too forbidding approach beyond certain limits
his personal recognition of each successive client was comprised in a nod and in his settling his hat a little easier on his head with both hands and then tightening the postoffice and putting his hands in his pockets
in one or two instances there was a difficulty respecting the raising of fees and then mr wemmick backing as far as possible from the insufficient money produced said its no use my boy
im only a subordinate
i cant take it
dont go on in that way with a subordinate
if you are unable to make up your quantum my boy you had better address yourself to a principal there are plenty of principals in the profession you know and what is not worth the while of one may be worth the while of another thats my recommendation to you speaking as a subordinate
dont try on useless measures
why should you
now whos next thus we walked through wemmicks greenhouse until he turned to me and said notice the man i shall shake hands with i should have done so without the preparation as he had shaken hands with no one yet
almost as soon as he had spoken a portly upright man whom i can see now as i write in a wellworn olivecoloured frockcoat with a peculiar pallor overspreading the red in his complexion and eyes that went wandering about when he tried to fix them came up to a corner of the bars and put his hand to his hatwhich had a greasy and fatty surface like cold brothwith a halfserious and halfjocose military salute
colonel to you said wemmick how are you colonel all right mr wemmick everything was done that could be done but the evidence was too strong for us colonel yes it was too strong sirbut i dont care no no said wemmick coolly you dont care then turning to me served his majesty this man
was a soldier in the line and bought his discharge i said indeed and the mans eyes looked at me and then looked over my head and then looked all round me and then he drew his hand across his lips and laughed
i think i shall be out of this on monday sir he said to wemmick
perhaps returned my friend but theres no knowing i am glad to have the chance of bidding you goodbye mr wemmick said the man stretching out his hand between two bars
thankye said wemmick shaking hands with him
same to you colonel if what i had upon me when taken had been real mr wemmick said the man unwilling to let his hand go i should have asked the favour of your wearing another ringin acknowledgment of your attentions ill accept the will for the deed said wemmick
by the by you were quite a pigeonfancier the man looked up at the sky
i am told you had a remarkable breed of tumblers
could you commission any friend of yours to bring me a pair if youve no further use for em it shall be done sir all right said wemmick they shall be taken care of
goodafternoon colonel
goodbye they shook hands again and as we walked away wemmick said to me a coiner a very good workman
the recorders report is made today and he is sure to be executed on monday
still you see as far as it goes a pair of pigeons are portable property all the same with that he looked back and nodded at this dead plant and then cast his eyes about him in walking out of the yard as if he were considering what other pot would go best in its place
as we came out of the prison through the lodge i found that the great importance of my guardian was appreciated by the turnkeys no less than by those whom they held in charge
well mr wemmick said the turnkey who kept us between the two studded and spiked lodge gates and who carefully locked one before he unlocked the other whats mr jaggers going to do with that waterside murder
is he going to make it manslaughter or whats he going to make of it why dont you ask him returned wemmick
o yes i dare say said the turnkey
now thats the way with them here mr pip remarked wemmick turning to me with his postoffice elongated
they dont mind what they ask of me the subordinate but youll never catch em asking any questions of my principal is this young gentleman one of the prentices or articled ones of your office asked the turnkey with a grin at mr wemmicks humour
there he goes again you see cried wemmick i told you so
asks another question of the subordinate before his first is dry
well supposing mr pip is one of them why then said the turnkey grinning again he knows what mr jaggers is yah cried wemmick suddenly hitting out at the turnkey in a facetious way youre dumb as one of your own keys when you have to do with my principal you know you are
let us out you old fox or ill get him to bring an action against you for false imprisonment the turnkey laughed and gave us good day and stood laughing at us over the spikes of the wicket when we descended the steps into the street
mind you mr pip said wemmick gravely in my ear as he took my arm to be more confidential i dont know that mr jaggers does a better thing than the way in which he keeps himself so high
hes always so high
his constant height is of a piece with his immense abilities
that colonel durst no more take leave of him than that turnkey durst ask him his intentions respecting a case
then between his height and them he slips in his subordinatedont you seeand so he has em soul and body i was very much impressed and not for the first time by my guardians subtlety
to confess the truth i very heartily wished and not for the first time that i had had some other guardian of minor abilities
mr wemmick and i parted at the office in little britain where suppliants for mr jaggerss notice were lingering about as usual and i returned to my watch in the street of the coachoffice with some three hours on hand
i consumed the whole time in thinking how strange it was that i should be encompassed by all this taint of prison and crime that in my childhood out on our lonely marshes on a winter evening i should have first encountered it that it should have reappeared on two occasions starting out like a stain that was faded but not gone that it should in this new way pervade my fortune and advancement
while my mind was thus engaged i thought of the beautiful young estella proud and refined coming towards me and i thought with absolute abhorrence of the contrast between the jail and her
i wished that wemmick had not met me or that i had not yielded to him and gone with him so that of all days in the year on this day i might not have had newgate in my breath and on my clothes
i beat the prison dust off my feet as i sauntered to and fro and i shook it out of my dress and i exhaled its air from my lungs
so contaminated did i feel remembering who was coming that the coach came quickly after all and i was not yet free from the soiling consciousness of mr wemmicks conservatory when i saw her face at the coach window and her hand waving to me
what was the nameless shadow which again in that one instant had passed
chapter xxxiii
in her furred travellingdress estella seemed more delicately beautiful than she had ever seemed yet even in my eyes
her manner was more winning than she had cared to let it be to me before and i thought i saw miss havishams influence in the change
we stood in the inn yard while she pointed out her luggage to me and when it was all collected i rememberedhaving forgotten everything but herself in the meanwhilethat i knew nothing of her destination
i am going to richmond she told me
our lesson is that there are two richmonds one in surrey and one in yorkshire and that mine is the surrey richmond
the distance is ten miles
i am to have a carriage and you are to take me
this is my purse and you are to pay my charges out of it
o you must take the purse
we have no choice you and i but to obey our instructions
we are not free to follow our own devices you and i as she looked at me in giving me the purse i hoped there was an inner meaning in her words
she said them slightingly but not with displeasure
a carriage will have to be sent for estella
will you rest here a little yes i am to rest here a little and i am to drink some tea and you are to take care of me the while she drew her arm through mine as if it must be done and i requested a waiter who had been staring at the coach like a man who had never seen such a thing in his life to show us a private sittingroom
upon that he pulled out a napkin as if it were a magic clue without which he couldnt find the way upstairs and led us to the black hole of the establishment fitted up with a diminishing mirror quite a superfluous article considering the holes proportions an anchovy saucecruet and somebodys pattens
on my objecting to this retreat he took us into another room with a dinnertable for thirty and in the grate a scorched leaf of a copybook under a bushel of coaldust
having looked at this extinct conflagration and shaken his head he took my order which proving to be merely some tea for the lady sent him out of the room in a very low state of mind
i was and i am sensible that the air of this chamber in its strong combination of stable with soupstock might have led one to infer that the coaching department was not doing well and that the enterprising proprietor was boiling down the horses for the refreshment department
yet the room was all in all to me estella being in it
i thought that with her i could have been happy there for life
i was not at all happy there at the time observe and i knew it well
where are you going to at richmond i asked estella
i am going to live said she at a great expense with a lady there who has the poweror says she hasof taking me about and introducing me and showing people to me and showing me to people i suppose you will be glad of variety and admiration yes i suppose so she answered so carelessly that i said you speak of yourself as if you were some one else where did you learn how i speak of others
come come said estella smiling delightfully you must not expect me to go to school to you i must talk in my own way
how do you thrive with mr pocket i live quite pleasantly there at least it appeared to me that i was losing a chance
at least repeated estella
as pleasantly as i could anywhere away from you you silly boy said estella quite composedly how can you talk such nonsense
your friend mr matthew i believe is superior to the rest of his family very superior indeed
he is nobodys enemy dont add but his own interposed estella for i hate that class of man
but he really is disinterested and above small jealousy and spite i have heard i am sure i have every reason to say so you have not every reason to say so of the rest of his people said estella nodding at me with an expression of face that was at once grave and rallying for they beset miss havisham with reports and insinuations to your disadvantage
they watch you misrepresent you write letters about you anonymous sometimes and you are the torment and the occupation of their lives
you can scarcely realise to yourself the hatred those people feel for you they do me no harm i hope instead of answering estella burst out laughing
this was very singular to me and i looked at her in considerable perplexity
when she left offand she had not laughed languidly but with real enjoymenti said in my diffident way with her i hope i may suppose that you would not be amused if they did me any harm no no you may be sure of that said estella
you may be certain that i laugh because they fail
o those people with miss havisham and the tortures they undergo she laughed again and even now when she had told me why her laughter was very singular to me for i could not doubt its being genuine and yet it seemed too much for the occasion
i thought there must really be something more here than i knew she saw the thought in my mind and answered it
it is not easy for even you said estella to know what satisfaction it gives me to see those people thwarted or what an enjoyable sense of the ridiculous i have when they are made ridiculous
for you were not brought up in that strange house from a mere baby
i was
you had not your little wits sharpened by their intriguing against you suppressed and defenceless under the mask of sympathy and pity and what not that is soft and soothing
i had
you did not gradually open your round childish eyes wider and wider to the discovery of that impostor of a woman who calculates her stores of peace of mind for when she wakes up in the night
i did it was no laughing matter with estella now nor was she summoning these remembrances from any shallow place
i would not have been the cause of that look of hers for all my expectations in a heap
two things i can tell you said estella
first notwithstanding the proverb that constant dropping will wear away a stone you may set your mind at rest that these people never willnever would in a hundred yearsimpair your ground with miss havisham in any particular great or small
second i am beholden to you as the cause of their being so busy and so mean in vain and there is my hand upon it as she gave it to me playfullyfor her darker mood had been but momentaryi held it and put it to my lips
you ridiculous boy said estella will you never take warning
or do you kiss my hand in the same spirit in which i once let you kiss my cheek what spirit was that said i
i must think a moment
a spirit of contempt for the fawners and plotters if i say yes may i kiss the cheek again you should have asked before you touched the hand
but yes if you like i leaned down and her calm face was like a statues
now said estella gliding away the instant i touched her cheek you are to take care that i have some tea and you are to take me to richmond her reverting to this tone as if our association were forced upon us and we were mere puppets gave me pain but everything in our intercourse did give me pain
whatever her tone with me happened to be i could put no trust in it and build no hope on it and yet i went on against trust and against hope
why repeat it a thousand times
so it always was
i rang for the tea and the waiter reappearing with his magic clue brought in by degrees some fifty adjuncts to that refreshment but of tea not a glimpse
a teaboard cups and saucers plates knives and forks including carvers spoons various saltcellars a meek little muffin confined with the utmost precaution under a strong iron cover moses in the bulrushes typified by a soft bit of butter in a quantity of parsley a pale loaf with a powdered head two proof impressions of the bars of the kitchen fireplace on triangular bits of bread and ultimately a fat family urn which the waiter staggered in with expressing in his countenance burden and suffering
after a prolonged absence at this stage of the entertainment he at length came back with a casket of precious appearance containing twigs
these i steeped in hot water and so from the whole of these appliances extracted one cup of i dont know what for estella
the bill paid and the waiter remembered and the ostler not forgotten and the chambermaid taken into considerationin a word the whole house bribed into a state of contempt and animosity and estellas purse much lightenedwe got into our postcoach and drove away
turning into cheapside and rattling up newgate street we were soon under the walls of which i was so ashamed
what place is that estella asked me
i made a foolish pretence of not at first recognising it and then told her
as she looked at it and drew in her head again murmuring wretches i would not have confessed to my visit for any consideration
mr
jaggers said i by way of putting it neatly on somebody else has the reputation of being more in the secrets of that dismal place than any man in london he is more in the secrets of every place i think said estella in a low voice
you have been accustomed to see him often i suppose i have been accustomed to see him at uncertain intervals ever since i can remember
but i know him no better now than i did before i could speak plainly
what is your own experience of him
do you advance with him once habituated to his distrustful manner said i i have done very well are you intimate i have dined with him at his private house i fancy said estella shrinking that must be a curious place it is a curious place i should have been chary of discussing my guardian too freely even with her but i should have gone on with the subject so far as to describe the dinner in gerrard street if we had not then come into a sudden glare of gas
it seemed while it lasted to be all alight and alive with that inexplicable feeling i had had before and when we were out of it i was as much dazed for a few moments as if i had been in lightning
so we fell into other talk and it was principally about the way by which we were travelling and about what parts of london lay on this side of it and what on that
the great city was almost new to her she told me for she had never left miss havishams neighbourhood until she had gone to france and she had merely passed through london then in going and returning
i asked her if my guardian had any charge of her while she remained here
to that she emphatically said god forbid and no more
it was impossible for me to avoid seeing that she cared to attract me that she made herself winning and would have won me even if the task had needed pains
yet this made me none the happier for even if she had not taken that tone of our being disposed of by others i should have felt that she held my heart in her hand because she wilfully chose to do it and not because it would have wrung any tenderness in her to crush it and throw it away
when we passed through hammersmith i showed her where mr matthew pocket lived and said it was no great way from richmond and that i hoped i should see her sometimes
o yes you are to see me you are to come when you think proper you are to be mentioned to the family indeed you are already mentioned i inquired was it a large household she was going to be a member of
no there are only two mother and daughter
the mother is a lady of some station though not averse to increasing her income i wonder miss havisham could part with you again so soon it is a part of miss havishams plans for me pip said estella with a sigh as if she were tired i am to write to her constantly and see her regularly and report how i go oni and the jewelsfor they are nearly all mine now it was the first time she had ever called me by my name
of course she did so purposely and knew that i should treasure it up
we came to richmond all too soon and our destination there was a house by the greena staid old house where hoops and powder and patches embroidered coats rolled stockings ruffles and swords had had their court days many a time
some ancient trees before the house were still cut into fashions as formal and unnatural as the hoops and wigs and stiff skirts but their own allotted places in the great procession of the dead were not far off and they would soon drop into them and go the silent way of the rest
a bell with an old voicewhich i dare say in its time had often said to the house here is the green farthingale here is the diamondhilted sword here are the shoes with red heels and the blue solitairesounded gravely in the moonlight and two cherrycoloured maids came fluttering out to receive estella
the doorway soon absorbed her boxes and she gave me her hand and a smile and said goodnight and was absorbed likewise
and still i stood looking at the house thinking how happy i should be if i lived there with her and knowing that i never was happy with her but always miserable
i got into the carriage to be taken back to hammersmith and i got in with a bad heartache and i got out with a worse heartache
at our own door i found little jane pocket coming home from a little party escorted by her little lover and i envied her little lover in spite of his being subject to flopson
mr pocket was out lecturing for he was a most delightful lecturer on domestic economy and his treatises on the management of children and servants were considered the very best textbooks on those themes
but mrs pocket was at home and was in a little difficulty on account of the babys having been accommodated with a needlecase to keep him quiet during the unaccountable absence with a relative in the foot guards of millers
and more needles were missing than it could be regarded as quite wholesome for a patient of such tender years either to apply externally or to take as a tonic
mr pocket being justly celebrated for giving most excellent practical advice and for having a clear and sound perception of things and a highly judicious mind i had some notion in my heartache of begging him to accept my confidence
but happening to look up at mrs pocket as she sat reading her book of dignities after prescribing bed as a sovereign remedy for baby i thoughtwellno i wouldnt
chapter xxxiv
as i had grown accustomed to my expectations i had insensibly begun to notice their effect upon myself and those around me
their influence on my own character i disguised from my recognition as much as possible but i knew very well that it was not all good
i lived in a state of chronic uneasiness respecting my behaviour to joe
my conscience was not by any means comfortable about biddy
when i woke up in the nightlike camillai used to think with a weariness on my spirits that i should have been happier and better if i had never seen miss havishams face and had risen to manhood content to be partners with joe in the honest old forge
many a time of an evening when i sat alone looking at the fire i thought after all there was no fire like the forge fire and the kitchen fire at home
yet estella was so inseparable from all my restlessness and disquiet of mind that i really fell into confusion as to the limits of my own part in its production
that is to say supposing i had had no expectations and yet had had estella to think of i could not make out to my satisfaction that i should have done much better
now concerning the influence of my position on others i was in no such difficulty and so i perceivedthough dimly enough perhapsthat it was not beneficial to anybody and above all that it was not beneficial to herbert
my lavish habits led his easy nature into expenses that he could not afford corrupted the simplicity of his life and disturbed his peace with anxieties and regrets
i was not at all remorseful for having unwittingly set those other branches of the pocket family to the poor arts they practised because such littlenesses were their natural bent and would have been evoked by anybody else if i had left them slumbering
but herberts was a very different case and it often caused me a twinge to think that i had done him evil service in crowding his sparely furnished chambers with incongruous upholstery work and placing the canarybreasted avenger at his disposal
so now as an infallible way of making little ease great ease i began to contract a quantity of debt
i could hardly begin but herbert must begin too so he soon followed
at startops suggestion we put ourselves down for election into a club called the finches of the grove the object of which institution i have never divined if it were not that the members should dine expensively once a fortnight to quarrel among themselves as much as possible after dinner and to cause six waiters to get drunk on the stairs
i know that these gratifying social ends were so invariably accomplished that herbert and i understood nothing else to be referred to in the first standing toast of the society which ran gentlemen may the present promotion of good feeling ever reign predominant among the finches of the grove the finches spent their money foolishly the hotel we dined at was in covent garden and the first finch i saw when i had the honour of joining the grove was bentley drummle at that time floundering about town in a cab of his own and doing a great deal of damage to the posts at the street corners
occasionally he shot himself out of his equipage headforemost over the apron and i saw him on one occasion deliver himself at the door of the grove in this unintentional waylike coals
but here i anticipate a little for i was not a finch and could not be according to the sacred laws of the society until i came of age
in my confidence in my own resources i would willingly have taken herberts expenses on myself but herbert was proud and i could make no such proposal to him
so he got into difficulties in every direction and continued to look about him
when we gradually fell into keeping late hours and late company i noticed that he looked about him with a desponding eye at breakfasttime that he began to look about him more hopefully about midday that he drooped when he came into dinner that he seemed to descry capital in the distance rather clearly after dinner that he all but realised capital towards midnight and that at about two oclock in the morning he became so deeply despondent again as to talk of buying a rifle and going to america with a general purpose of compelling buffaloes to make his fortune
i was usually at hammersmith about half the week and when i was at hammersmith i haunted richmond whereof separately by and by
herbert would often come to hammersmith when i was there and i think at those seasons his father would occasionally have some passing perception that the opening he was looking for had not appeared yet
but in the general tumbling up of the family his tumbling out in life somewhere was a thing to transact itself somehow
in the meantime mr pocket grew greyer and tried oftener to lift himself out of his perplexities by the hair
while mrs pocket tripped up the family with her footstool read her book of dignities lost her pockethandkerchief told us about her grandpapa and taught the young idea how to shoot by shooting it into bed whenever it attracted her notice
as i am now generalising a period of my life with the object of clearing my way before me i can scarcely do so better than by at once completing the description of our usual manners and customs at barnards inn
we spent as much money as we could and got as little for it as people could make up their minds to give us
we were always more or less miserable and most of our acquaintance were in the same condition
there was a gay fiction among us that we were constantly enjoying ourselves and a skeleton truth that we never did
to the best of my belief our case was in the last aspect a rather common one
every morning with an air ever new herbert went into the city to look about him
i often paid him a visit in the dark backroom in which he consorted with an inkjar a hatpeg a coalbox a stringbox an almanac a desk and stool and a ruler and i do not remember that i ever saw him do anything else but look about him
if we all did what we undertake to do as faithfully as herbert did we might live in a republic of the virtues
he had nothing else to do poor fellow except at a certain hour of every afternoon to go to lloydsin observance of a ceremony of seeing his principal i think
he never did anything else in connection with lloyds that i could find out except come back again
when he felt his case unusually serious and that he positively must find an opening he would go on change at a busy time and walk in and out in a kind of gloomy country dance figure among the assembled magnates
for says herbert to me coming home to dinner on one of those special occasions i find the truth to be handel that an opening wont come to one but one must go to itso i have been if we had been less attached to one another i think we must have hated one another regularly every morning
i detested the chambers beyond expression at that period of repentance and could not endure the sight of the avengers livery which had a more expensive and a less remunerative appearance then than at any other time in the fourandtwenty hours
as we got more and more into debt breakfast became a hollower and hollower form and being on one occasion at breakfasttime threatened by letter with legal proceedings not unwholly unconnected as my local paper might put it with jewelery i went so far as to seize the avenger by his blue collar and shake him off his feetso that he was actually in the air like a booted cupidfor presuming to suppose that we wanted a roll
at certain timesmeaning at uncertain times for they depended on our humouri would say to herbert as if it were a remarkable discovery my dear herbert we are getting on badly my dear handel herbert would say to me in all sincerity if you will believe me those very words were on my lips by a strange coincidence then herbert i would respond let us look into our affairs we always derived profound satisfaction from making an appointment for this purpose
i always thought this was business this was the way to confront the thing this was the way to take the foe by the throat
and i know herbert thought so too
we ordered something rather special for dinner with a bottle of something similarly out of the common way in order that our minds might be fortified for the occasion and we might come well up to the mark
dinner over we produced a bundle of pens a copious supply of ink and a goodly show of writing and blotting paper
for there was something very comfortable in having plenty of stationery
i would then take a sheet of paper and write across the top of it in a neat hand the heading memorandum of pips debts with barnards inn and the date very carefully added
herbert would also take a sheet of paper and write across it with similar formalities memorandum of herberts debts each of us would then refer to a confused heap of papers at his side which had been thrown into drawers worn into holes in pockets half burnt in lighting candles stuck for weeks into the lookingglass and otherwise damaged
the sound of our pens going refreshed us exceedingly insomuch that i sometimes found it difficult to distinguish between this edifying business proceeding and actually paying the money
in point of meritorious character the two things seemed about equal
when we had written a little while i would ask herbert how he got on
herbert probably would have been scratching his head in a most rueful manner at the sight of his accumulating figures
they are mounting up handel herbert would say upon my life they are mounting up be firm herbert i would retort plying my own pen with great assiduity
look the thing in the face
look into your affairs
stare them out of countenance so i would handel only they are staring me out of countenance however my determined manner would have its effect and herbert would fall to work again
after a time he would give up once more on the plea that he had not got cobbss bill or lobbss or nobbss as the case might be
then herbert estimate estimate it in round numbers and put it down what a fellow of resource you are my friend would reply with admiration
really your business powers are very remarkable i thought so too
i established with myself on these occasions the reputation of a firstrate man of businessprompt decisive energetic clear coolheaded
when i had got all my responsibilities down upon my list i compared each with the bill and ticked it off
my selfapproval when i ticked an entry was quite a luxurious sensation
when i had no more ticks to make i folded all my bills up uniformly docketed each on the back and tied the whole into a symmetrical bundle
then i did the same for herbert who modestly said he had not my administrative genius and felt that i had brought his affairs into a focus for him
my business habits had one other bright feature which i called leaving a margin for example supposing herberts debts to be one hundred and sixtyfour pounds fourandtwopence i would say leave a margin and put them down at two hundred or supposing my own to be four times as much i would leave a margin and put them down at seven hundred
i had the highest opinion of the wisdom of this same margin but i am bound to acknowledge that on looking back i deem it to have been an expensive device
for we always ran into new debt immediately to the full extent of the margin and sometimes in the sense of freedom and solvency it imparted got pretty far on into another margin
but there was a calm a rest a virtuous hush consequent on these examinations of our affairs that gave me for the time an admirable opinion of myself
soothed by my exertions my method and herberts compliments i would sit with his symmetrical bundle and my own on the table before me among the stationery and feel like a bank of some sort rather than a private individual
we shut our outer door on these solemn occasions in order that we might not be interrupted
i had fallen into my serene state one evening when we heard a letter dropped through the slit in the said door and fall on the ground
its for you handel said herbert going out and coming back with it and i hope there is nothing the matter this was in allusion to its heavy black seal and border
the letter was signed trabb co and its contents were simply that i was an honoured sir and that they begged to inform me that mrs j gargery had departed this life on monday last at twenty minutes past six in the evening and that my attendance was requested at the interment on monday next at three oclock in the afternoon
chapter xxxv
it was the first time that a grave had opened in my road of life and the gap it made in the smooth ground was wonderful
the figure of my sister in her chair by the kitchen fire haunted me night and day
that the place could possibly be without her was something my mind seemed unable to compass and whereas she had seldom or never been in my thoughts of late i had now the strangest ideas that she was coming towards me in the street or that she would presently knock at the door
in my rooms too with which she had never been at all associated there was at once the blankness of death and a perpetual suggestion of the sound of her voice or the turn of her face or figure as if she were still alive and had been often there
whatever my fortunes might have been i could scarcely have recalled my sister with much tenderness
but i suppose there is a shock of regret which may exist without much tenderness
under its influence and perhaps to make up for the want of the softer feeling i was seized with a violent indignation against the assailant from whom she had suffered so much and i felt that on sufficient proof i could have revengefully pursued orlick or any one else to the last extremity
having written to joe to offer him consolation and to assure him that i would come to the funeral i passed the intermediate days in the curious state of mind i have glanced at
i went down early in the morning and alighted at the blue boar in good time to walk over to the forge
it was fine summer weather again and as i walked along the times when i was a little helpless creature and my sister did not spare me vividly returned
but they returned with a gentle tone upon them that softened even the edge of tickler
for now the very breath of the beans and clover whispered to my heart that the day must come when it would be well for my memory that others walking in the sunshine should be softened as they thought of me
at last i came within sight of the house and saw that trabb and co had put in a funereal execution and taken possession
two dismally absurd persons each ostentatiously exhibiting a crutch done up in a black bandageas if that instrument could possibly communicate any comfort to anybodywere posted at the front door and in one of them i recognised a postboy discharged from the boar for turning a young couple into a sawpit on their bridal morning in consequence of intoxication rendering it necessary for him to ride his horse clasped round the neck with both arms
all the children of the village and most of the women were admiring these sable warders and the closed windows of the house and forge and as i came up one of the two warders the postboy knocked at the doorimplying that i was far too much exhausted by grief to have strength remaining to knock for myself
another sable warder a carpenter who had once eaten two geese for a wager opened the door and showed me into the best parlour
here mr trabb had taken unto himself the best table and had got all the leaves up and was holding a kind of black bazaar with the aid of a quantity of black pins
at the moment of my arrival he had just finished putting somebodys hat into black longclothes like an african baby so he held out his hand for mine
but i misled by the action and confused by the occasion shook hands with him with every testimony of warm affection
poor dear joe entangled in a little black cloak tied in a large bow under his chin was seated apart at the upper end of the room where as chief mourner he had evidently been stationed by trabb
when i bent down and said to him dear joe how are you he said pip old chap you knowed her when she were a fine figure of a and clasped my hand and said no more
biddy looking very neat and modest in her black dress went quietly here and there and was very helpful
when i had spoken to biddy as i thought it not a time for talking i went and sat down near joe and there began to wonder in what part of the house itshemy sisterwas
the air of the parlour being faint with the smell of sweetcake i looked about for the table of refreshments it was scarcely visible until one had got accustomed to the gloom but there was a cutup plum cake upon it and there were cutup oranges and sandwiches and biscuits and two decanters that i knew very well as ornaments but had never seen used in all my life one full of port and one of sherry
standing at this table i became conscious of the servile pumblechook in a black cloak and several yards of hatband who was alternately stuffing himself and making obsequious movements to catch my attention
the moment he succeeded he came over to me breathing sherry and crumbs and said in a subdued voice may i dear sir and did
i then descried mr and mrs hubble the lastnamed in a decent speechless paroxysm in a corner
we were all going to follow and were all in course of being tied up separately by trabb into ridiculous bundles
which i meantersay pip joe whispered me as we were being what mr trabb called formed in the parlour two and twoand it was dreadfully like a preparation for some grim kind of dance which i meantersay sir as i would in preference have carried her to the church myself along with three or four friendly ones wot come to it with willing harts and arms but it were considered wot the neighbours would look down on such and would be of opinions as it were wanting in respect pockethandkerchiefs out all cried mr trabb at this point in a depressed businesslike voice
pockethandkerchiefs out
we are ready so we all put our pockethandkerchiefs to our faces as if our noses were bleeding and filed out two and two joe and i biddy and pumblechook mr and mrs hubble
the remains of my poor sister had been brought round by the kitchen door and it being a point of undertaking ceremony that the six bearers must be stifled and blinded under a horrible black velvet housing with a white border the whole looked like a blind monster with twelve human legs shuffling and blundering along under the guidance of two keepersthe postboy and his comrade
the neighbourhood however highly approved of these arrangements and we were much admired as we went through the village the more youthful and vigorous part of the community making dashes now and then to cut us off and lying in wait to intercept us at points of vantage
at such times the more exuberant among them called out in an excited manner on our emergence round some corner of expectancy here they come here they are and we were all but cheered
in this progress i was much annoyed by the abject pumblechook who being behind me persisted all the way as a delicate attention in arranging my streaming hatband and smoothing my cloak
my thoughts were further distracted by the excessive pride of mr and mrs hubble who were surpassingly conceited and vainglorious in being members of so distinguished a procession
and now the range of marshes lay clear before us with the sails of the ships on the river growing out of it and we went into the churchyard close to the graves of my unknown parents philip pirrip late of this parish and also georgiana wife of the above
and there my sister was laid quietly in the earth while the larks sang high above it and the light wind strewed it with beautiful shadows of clouds and trees
of the conduct of the worldly minded pumblechook while this was doing i desire to say no more than it was all addressed to me and that even when those noble passages were read which remind humanity how it brought nothing into the world and can take nothing out and how it fleeth like a shadow and never continueth long in one stay i heard him cough a reservation of the case of a young gentleman who came unexpectedly into large property
when we got back he had the hardihood to tell me that he wished my sister could have known i had done her so much honour and to hint that she would have considered it reasonably purchased at the price of her death
after that he drank all the rest of the sherry and mr hubble drank the port and the two talked which i have since observed to be customary in such cases as if they were of quite another race from the deceased and were notoriously immortal
finally he went away with mr and mrs hubbleto make an evening of it i felt sure and to tell the jolly bargemen that he was the founder of my fortunes and my earliest benefactor
when they were all gone and when trabb and his menbut not his boy i looked for himhad crammed their mummery into bags and were gone too the house felt wholesomer
soon afterwards biddy joe and i had a cold dinner together but we dined in the best parlour not in the old kitchen and joe was so exceedingly particular what he did with his knife and fork and the saltcellar and what not that there was great restraint upon us
but after dinner when i made him take his pipe and when i had loitered with him about the forge and when we sat down together on the great block of stone outside it we got on better
i noticed that after the funeral joe changed his clothes so far as to make a compromise between his sunday dress and working dress in which the dear fellow looked natural and like the man he was
he was very much pleased by my asking if i might sleep in my own little room and i was pleased too for i felt that i had done rather a great thing in making the request
when the shadows of evening were closing in i took an opportunity of getting into the garden with biddy for a little talk
biddy said i i think you might have written to me about these sad matters do you mr pip said biddy
i should have written if i had thought that dont suppose that i mean to be unkind biddy when i say i consider that you ought to have thought that do you mr pip she was so quiet and had such an orderly good and pretty way with her that i did not like the thought of making her cry again
after looking a little at her downcast eyes as she walked beside me i gave up that point
i suppose it will be difficult for you to remain here now biddy dear oh
i cant do so mr pip said biddy in a tone of regret but still of quiet conviction
i have been speaking to mrs hubble and i am going to her tomorrow
i hope we shall be able to take some care of mr gargery together until he settles down how are you going to live biddy
if you want any mo how am i going to live repeated biddy striking in with a momentary flush upon her face
ill tell you mr pip
i am going to try to get the place of mistress in the new school nearly finished here
i can be well recommended by all the neighbours and i hope i can be industrious and patient and teach myself while i teach others
you know mr pip pursued biddy with a smile as she raised her eyes to my face the new schools are not like the old but i learnt a good deal from you after that time and have had time since then to improve i think you would always improve biddy under any circumstances ah
except in my bad side of human nature murmured biddy
it was not so much a reproach as an irresistible thinking aloud
well
i thought i would give up that point too
so i walked a little further with biddy looking silently at her downcast eyes
i have not heard the particulars of my sisters death biddy they are very slight poor thing
she had been in one of her bad statesthough they had got better of late rather than worsefor four days when she came out of it in the evening just at teatime and said quite plainly joe as she had never said any word for a long while i ran and fetched in mr gargery from the forge
she made signs to me that she wanted him to sit down close to her and wanted me to put her arms round his neck
so i put them round his neck and she laid her head down on his shoulder quite content and satisfied
and so she presently said joe again and once pardon and once pip and so she never lifted her head up any more and it was just an hour later when we laid it down on her own bed because we found she was gone biddy cried the darkening garden and the lane and the stars that were coming out were blurred in my own sight
nothing was ever discovered biddy nothing do you know what is become of orlick i should think from the colour of his clothes that he is working in the quarries of course you have seen him thenwhy are you looking at that dark tree in the lane i saw him there on the night she died that was not the last time either biddy no i have seen him there since we have been walking hereit is of no use said biddy laying her hand upon my arm as i was for running out you know i would not deceive you he was not there a minute and he is gone it revived my utmost indignation to find that she was still pursued by this fellow and i felt inveterate against him
i told her so and told her that i would spend any money or take any pains to drive him out of that country
by degrees she led me into more temperate talk and she told me how joe loved me and how joe never complained of anythingshe didnt say of me she had no need i knew what she meantbut ever did his duty in his way of life with a strong hand a quiet tongue and a gentle heart
indeed it would be hard to say too much for him said i and biddy we must often speak of these things for of course i shall be often down here now
i am not going to leave poor joe alone biddy said never a single word
biddy dont you hear me yes mr pip not to mention your calling me mr pipwhich appears to me to be in bad taste biddywhat do you mean what do i mean asked biddy timidly
biddy said i in a virtuously selfasserting manner i must request to know what you mean by this by this said biddy
now dont echo i retorted
you used not to echo biddy used not said biddy
o mr pip
used well
i rather thought i would give up that point too
after another silent turn in the garden i fell back on the main position
biddy said i i made a remark respecting my coming down here often to see joe which you received with a marked silence
have the goodness biddy to tell me why are you quite sure then that you will come to see him often asked biddy stopping in the narrow garden walk and looking at me under the stars with a clear and honest eye
o dear me said i as if i found myself compelled to give up biddy in despair
this really is a very bad side of human nature
dont say any more if you please biddy
this shocks me very much for which cogent reason i kept biddy at a distance during supper and when i went up to my own old little room took as stately a leave of her as i could in my murmuring soul deem reconcilable with the churchyard and the event of the day
as often as i was restless in the night and that was every quarter of an hour i reflected what an unkindness what an injury what an injustice biddy had done me
early in the morning i was to go
early in the morning i was out and looking in unseen at one of the wooden windows of the forge
there i stood for minutes looking at joe already at work with a glow of health and strength upon his face that made it show as if the bright sun of the life in store for him were shining on it
goodbye dear joeno dont wipe it offfor gods sake give me your blackened handi shall be down soon and often illustration never too soon sir said joe and never too often pip biddy was waiting for me at the kitchen door with a mug of new milk and a crust of bread
biddy said i when i gave her my hand at parting i am not angry but i am hurt no dont be hurt she pleaded quite pathetically let only me be hurt if i have been ungenerous once more the mists were rising as i walked away
if they disclosed to me as i suspect they did that i should not come back and that biddy was quite right all i can say isthey were quite right too
chapter xxxvi
herbert and i went on from bad to worse in the way of increasing our debts looking into our affairs leaving margins and the like exemplary transactions and time went on whether or no as he has a way of doing and i came of agein fulfilment of herberts prediction that i should do so before i knew where i was
herbert himself had come of age eight months before me
as he had nothing else than his majority to come into the event did not make a profound sensation in barnards inn
but we had looked forward to my oneandtwentieth birthday with a crowd of speculations and anticipations for we had both considered that my guardian could hardly help saying something definite on that occasion
i had taken care to have it well understood in little britain when my birthday was
on the day before it i received an official note from wemmick informing me that mr jaggers would be glad if i would call upon him at five in the afternoon of the auspicious day
this convinced us that something great was to happen and threw me into an unusual flutter when i repaired to my guardians office a model of punctuality
in the outer office wemmick offered me his congratulations and incidentally rubbed the side of his nose with a folded piece of tissuepaper that i liked the look of
but he said nothing respecting it and motioned me with a nod into my guardians room
it was november and my guardian was standing before his fire leaning his back against the chimneypiece with his hands under his coattails
well pip said he i must call you mr pip today
congratulations mr pip we shook handshe was always a remarkably short shakerand i thanked him
take a chair mr pip said my guardian
as i sat down and he preserved his attitude and bent his brows at his boots i felt at a disadvantage which reminded me of that old time when i had been put upon a tombstone
the two ghastly casts on the shelf were not far from him and their expression was as if they were making a stupid apoplectic attempt to attend to the conversation
now my young friend my guardian began as if i were a witness in the box i am going to have a word or two with you if you please sir what do you suppose said mr jaggers bending forward to look at the ground and then throwing his head back to look at the ceilingwhat do you suppose you are living at the rate of at the rate of sir at repeated mr jaggers still looking at the ceiling therateof and then looked all round the room and paused with his pockethandkerchief in his hand halfway to his nose
i had looked into my affairs so often that i had thoroughly destroyed any slight notion i might ever have had of their bearings
reluctantly i confessed myself quite unable to answer the question
this reply seemed agreeable to mr jaggers who said i thought so and blew his nose with an air of satisfaction
now i have asked you a question my friend said mr jaggers
have you anything to ask me of course it would be a great relief to me to ask you several questions sir but i remember your prohibition ask one said mr jaggers
is my benefactor to be made known to me today no
ask another is that confidence to be imparted to me soon waive that a moment said mr jaggers and ask another i looked about me but there appeared to be now no possible escape from the inquiry haveianything to receive sir on that mr jaggers said triumphantly i thought we should come to it and called to wemmick to give him that piece of paper
wemmick appeared handed it in and disappeared
now mr pip said mr jaggers attend if you please
you have been drawing pretty freely here your name occurs pretty often in wemmicks cashbook but you are in debt of course i am afraid i must say yes sir you know you must say yes dont you said mr jaggers
yes sir i dont ask you what you owe because you dont know and if you did know you wouldnt tell me you would say less
yes yes my friend cried mr jaggers waving his forefinger to stop me as i made a show of protesting its likely enough that you think you wouldnt but you would
youll excuse me but i know better than you
now take this piece of paper in your hand
you have got it
very good
now unfold it and tell me what it is this is a banknote said i for five hundred pounds that is a banknote repeated mr jaggers for five hundred pounds
and a very handsome sum of money too i think
you consider it so how could i do otherwise ah
but answer the question said mr jaggers
undoubtedly you consider it undoubtedly a handsome sum of money
now that handsome sum of money pip is your own
it is a present to you on this day in earnest of your expectations
and at the rate of that handsome sum of money per annum and at no higher rate you are to live until the donor of the whole appears
that is to say you will now take your money affairs entirely into your own hands and you will draw from wemmick one hundred and twentyfive pounds per quarter until you are in communication with the fountainhead and no longer with the mere agent
as i have told you before i am the mere agent
i execute my instructions and i am paid for doing so
i think them injudicious but i am not paid for giving any opinion on their merits i was beginning to express my gratitude to my benefactor for the great liberality with which i was treated when mr jaggers stopped me
i am not paid pip said he coolly to carry your words to any one and then gathered up his coattails as he had gathered up the subject and stood frowning at his boots as if he suspected them of designs against him
after a pause i hinted there was a question just now mr jaggers which you desired me to waive for a moment
i hope i am doing nothing wrong in asking it again what is it said he
i might have known that he would never help me out but it took me aback to have to shape the question afresh as if it were quite new
is it likely i said after hesitating that my patron the fountainhead you have spoken of mr jaggers will soon there i delicately stopped
will soon what asked mr jaggers
thats no question as it stands you know will soon come to london said i after casting about for a precise form of words or summon me anywhere else now here replied mr jaggers fixing me for the first time with his dark deepset eyes we must revert to the evening when we first encountered one another in your village
what did i tell you then pip you told me mr jaggers that it might be years hence when that person appeared just so said mr jaggers thats my answer as we looked full at one another i felt my breath come quicker in my strong desire to get something out of him
and as i felt that it came quicker and as i felt that he saw that it came quicker i felt that i had less chance than ever of getting anything out of him
do you suppose it will still be years hence mr jaggers mr jaggers shook his headnot in negativing the question but in altogether negativing the notion that he could anyhow be got to answer itand the two horrible casts of the twitched faces looked when my eyes strayed up to them as if they had come to a crisis in their suspended attention and were going to sneeze
come said mr jaggers warming the backs of his legs with the backs of his warmed hands ill be plain with you my friend pip
thats a question i must not be asked
youll understand that better when i tell you its a question that might compromise me
come
ill go a little further with you ill say something more he bent down so low to frown at his boots that he was able to rub the calves of his legs in the pause he made
when that person discloses said mr jaggers straightening himself you and that person will settle your own affairs
when that person discloses my part in this business will cease and determine
when that person discloses it will not be necessary for me to know anything about it
and thats all i have got to say we looked at one another until i withdrew my eyes and looked thoughtfully at the floor
from this last speech i derived the notion that miss havisham for some reason or no reason had not taken him into her confidence as to her designing me for estella that he resented this and felt a jealousy about it or that he really did object to that scheme and would have nothing to do with it
when i raised my eyes again i found that he had been shrewdly looking at me all the time and was doing so still
if that is all you have to say sir i remarked there can be nothing left for me to say he nodded assent and pulled out his thiefdreaded watch and asked me where i was going to dine
i replied at my own chambers with herbert
as a necessary sequence i asked him if he would favour us with his company and he promptly accepted the invitation
but he insisted on walking home with me in order that i might make no extra preparation for him and first he had a letter or two to write and of course had his hands to wash
so i said i would go into the outer office and talk to wemmick
the fact was that when the five hundred pounds had come into my pocket a thought had come into my head which had been often there before and it appeared to me that wemmick was a good person to advise with concerning such thought
he had already locked up his safe and made preparations for going home
he had left his desk brought out his two greasy office candlesticks and stood them in line with the snuffers on a slab near the door ready to be extinguished he had raked his fire low put his hat and greatcoat ready and was beating himself all over the chest with his safekey as an athletic exercise after business
mr
wemmick said i i want to ask your opinion
i am very desirous to serve a friend wemmick tightened his postoffice and shook his head as if his opinion were dead against any fatal weakness of that sort
this friend i pursued is trying to get on in commercial life but has no money and finds it difficult and disheartening to make a beginning
now i want somehow to help him to a beginning with money down said wemmick in a tone drier than any sawdust
with some money down i replied for an uneasy remembrance shot across me of that symmetrical bundle of papers at homewith some money down and perhaps some anticipation of my expectations mr
pip said wemmick i should like just to run over with you on my fingers if you please the names of the various bridges up as high as chelsea reach
lets see theres london one southwark two blackfriars three waterloo four westminster five vauxhall six he had checked off each bridge in its turn with the handle of his safekey on the palm of his hand
theres as many as six you see to choose from i dont understand you said i
choose your bridge mr pip returned wemmick and take a walk upon your bridge and pitch your money into the thames over the centre arch of your bridge and you know the end of it
serve a friend with it and you may know the end of it toobut its a less pleasant and profitable end i could have posted a newspaper in his mouth he made it so wide after saying this
this is very discouraging said i
meant to be so said wemmick
then is it your opinion i inquired with some little indignation that a man should never invest portable property in a friend said wemmick
certainly he should not
unless he wants to get rid of the friendand then it becomes a question how much portable property it may be worth to get rid of him and that said i is your deliberate opinion mr wemmick that he returned is my deliberate opinion in this office ah said i pressing him for i thought i saw him near a loophole here but would that be your opinion at walworth mr
pip he replied with gravity walworth is one place and this office is another
much as the aged is one person and mr jaggers is another
they must not be confounded together
my walworth sentiments must be taken at walworth none but my official sentiments can be taken in this office very well said i much relieved then i shall look you up at walworth you may depend upon it mr
pip he returned you will be welcome there in a private and personal capacity we had held this conversation in a low voice well knowing my guardians ears to be the sharpest of the sharp
as he now appeared in his doorway towelling his hands wemmick got on his greatcoat and stood by to snuff out the candles
we all three went into the street together and from the doorstep wemmick turned his way and mr jaggers and i turned ours
i could not help wishing more than once that evening that mr jaggers had had an aged in gerrard street or a stinger or a something or a somebody to unbend his brows a little
it was an uncomfortable consideration on a twentyfirst birthday that coming of age at all seemed hardly worth while in such a guarded and suspicious world as he made of it
he was a thousand times better informed and cleverer than wemmick and yet i would a thousand times rather have had wemmick to dinner
and mr jaggers made not me alone intensely melancholy because after he was gone herbert said of himself with his eyes fixed on the fire that he thought he must have committed a felony and forgotten the details of it he felt so dejected and guilty
chapter xxxvii
deeming sunday the best day for taking mr wemmicks walworth sentiments i devoted the next ensuing sunday afternoon to a pilgrimage to the castle
on arriving before the battlements i found the union jack flying and the drawbridge up but undeterred by this show of defiance and resistance i rang at the gate and was admitted in a most pacific manner by the aged
my son sir said the old man after securing the drawbridge rather had it in his mind that you might happen to drop in and he left word that he would soon be home from his afternoons walk
he is very regular in his walks is my son
very regular in everything is my son i nodded at the old gentleman as wemmick himself might have nodded and we went in and sat down by the fireside
you made acquaintance with my son sir said the old man in his chirping way while he warmed his hands at the blaze at his office i expect i nodded
hah
i have heerd that my son is a wonderful hand at his business sir i nodded hard
yes so they tell me
his business is the law i nodded harder
which makes it more surprising in my son said the old man for he was not brought up to the law but to the winecoopering curious to know how the old gentleman stood informed concerning the reputation of mr jaggers i roared that name at him
he threw me into the greatest confusion by laughing heartily and replying in a very sprightly manner no to be sure youre right and to this hour i have not the faintest notion what he meant or what joke he thought i had made
as i could not sit there nodding at him perpetually without making some other attempt to interest him i shouted at inquiry whether his own calling in life had been the winecoopering by dint of straining that term out of myself several times and tapping the old gentleman on the chest to associate it with him i at last succeeded in making my meaning understood
no said the old gentleman the warehousing the warehousing
first over yonder he appeared to mean up the chimney but i believe he intended to refer me to liverpool and then in the city of london here
however having an infirmityfor i am hard of hearing sir i expressed in pantomime the greatest astonishment
yes hard of hearing having that infirmity coming upon me my son he went into the law and he took charge of me and he by little and little made out this elegant and beautiful property
but returning to what you said you know pursued the old man again laughing heartily what i say is no to be sure youre right i was modestly wondering whether my utmost ingenuity would have enabled me to say anything that would have amused him half as much as this imaginary pleasantry when i was startled by a sudden click in the wall on one side of the chimney and the ghostly tumbling open of a little wooden flap with john upon it
the old man following my eyes cried with great triumph my sons come home and we both went out to the drawbridge
it was worth any money to see wemmick waving a salute to me from the other side of the moat when we might have shaken hands across it with the greatest ease
the aged was so delighted to work the drawbridge that i made no offer to assist him but stood quiet until wemmick had come across and had presented me to miss skiffins a lady by whom he was accompanied
miss skiffins was of a wooden appearance and was like her escort in the postoffice branch of the service
she might have been some two or three years younger than wemmick and i judged her to stand possessed of portable property
the cut of her dress from the waist upward both before and behind made her figure very like a boys kite and i might have pronounced her gown a little too decidedly orange and her gloves a little too intensely green
but she seemed to be a good sort of fellow and showed a high regard for the aged
i was not long in discovering that she was a frequent visitor at the castle for on our going in and my complimenting wemmick on his ingenious contrivance for announcing himself to the aged he begged me to give my attention for a moment to the other side of the chimney and disappeared
presently another click came and another little door tumbled open with miss skiffins on it then miss skiffins shut up and john tumbled open then miss skiffins and john both tumbled open together and finally shut up together
on wemmicks return from working these mechanical appliances i expressed the great admiration with which i regarded them and he said well you know theyre both pleasant and useful to the aged
and by george sir its a thing worth mentioning that of all the people who come to this gate the secret of those pulls is only known to the aged miss skiffins and me and mr wemmick made them added miss skiffins with his own hands out of his own head while miss skiffins was taking off her bonnet she retained her green gloves during the evening as an outward and visible sign that there was company wemmick invited me to take a walk with him round the property and see how the island looked in wintertime
thinking that he did this to give me an opportunity of taking his walworth sentiments i seized the opportunity as soon as we were out of the castle
having thought of the matter with care i approached my subject as if i had never hinted at it before
i informed wemmick that i was anxious in behalf of herbert pocket and i told him how we had first met and how we had fought
i glanced at herberts home and at his character and at his having no means but such as he was dependent on his father for those uncertain and unpunctual
i alluded to the advantages i had derived in my first rawness and ignorance from his society and i confessed that i feared i had but ill repaid them and that he might have done better without me and my expectations
keeping miss havisham in the background at a great distance i still hinted at the possibility of my having competed with him in his prospects and at the certainty of his possessing a generous soul and being far above any mean distrusts retaliations or designs
for all these reasons i told wemmick and because he was my young companion and friend and i had a great affection for him i wished my own good fortune to reflect some rays upon him and therefore i sought advice from wemmicks experience and knowledge of men and affairs how i could best try with my resources to help herbert to some present incomesay of a hundred a year to keep him in good hope and heartand gradually to buy him on to some small partnership
i begged wemmick in conclusion to understand that my help must always be rendered without herberts knowledge or suspicion and that there was no one else in the world with whom i could advise
i wound up by laying my hand upon his shoulder and saying i cant help confiding in you though i know it must be troublesome to you but that is your fault in having ever brought me here wemmick was silent for a little while and then said with a kind of start well you know mr pip i must tell you one thing
this is devilish good of you say youll help me to be good then said i
ecod replied wemmick shaking his head thats not my trade nor is this your tradingplace said i
you are right he returned
you hit the nail on the head
mr pip ill put on my consideringcap and i think all you want to do may be done by degrees
skiffins thats her brother is an accountant and agent
ill look him up and go to work for you i thank you ten thousand times on the contrary said he i thank you for though we are strictly in our private and personal capacity still it may be mentioned that there are newgate cobwebs about and it brushes them away after a little further conversation to the same effect we returned into the castle where we found miss skiffins preparing tea
the responsible duty of making the toast was delegated to the aged and that excellent old gentleman was so intent upon it that he seemed to me in some danger of melting his eyes
it was no nominal meal that we were going to make but a vigorous reality
the aged prepared such a haystack of buttered toast that i could scarcely see him over it as it simmered on an iron stand hooked on to the topbar while miss skiffins brewed such a jorum of tea that the pig in the back premises became strongly excited and repeatedly expressed his desire to participate in the entertainment
the flag had been struck and the gun had been fired at the right moment of time and i felt as snugly cut off from the rest of walworth as if the moat were thirty feet wide by as many deep
nothing disturbed the tranquillity of the castle but the occasional tumbling open of john and miss skiffins which little doors were a prey to some spasmodic infirmity that made me sympathetically uncomfortable until i got used to it
i inferred from the methodical nature of miss skiffinss arrangements that she made tea there every sunday night and i rather suspected that a classic brooch she wore representing the profile of an undesirable female with a very straight nose and a very new moon was a piece of portable property that had been given her by wemmick
we ate the whole of the toast and drank tea in proportion and it was delightful to see how warm and greasy we all got after it
the aged especially might have passed for some clean old chief of a savage tribe just oiled
after a short pause of repose miss skiffinsin the absence of the little servant who it seemed retired to the bosom of her family on sunday afternoonswashed up the teathings in a trifling ladylike amateur manner that compromised none of us
then she put on her gloves again and we drew round the fire and wemmick said now aged parent tip us the paper wemmick explained to me while the aged got his spectacles out that this was according to custom and that it gave the old gentleman infinite satisfaction to read the news aloud
i wont offer an apology said wemmick for he isnt capable of many pleasuresare you aged p all right john all right returned the old man seeing himself spoken to
only tip him a nod every now and then when he looks off his paper said wemmick and hell be as happy as a king
we are all attention aged one all right john all right returned the cheerful old man so busy and so pleased that it really was quite charming
the ageds reading reminded me of the classes at mr wopsles greataunts with the pleasanter peculiarity that it seemed to come through a keyhole
as he wanted the candles close to him and as he was always on the verge of putting either his head or the newspaper into them he required as much watching as a powdermill
but wemmick was equally untiring and gentle in his vigilance and the aged read on quite unconscious of his many rescues
whenever he looked at us we all expressed the greatest interest and amazement and nodded until he resumed again
as wemmick and miss skiffins sat side by side and as i sat in a shadowy corner i observed a slow and gradual elongation of mr wemmicks mouth powerfully suggestive of his slowly and gradually stealing his arm round miss skiffinss waist
in course of time i saw his hand appear on the other side of miss skiffins but at that moment miss skiffins neatly stopped him with the green glove unwound his arm again as if it were an article of dress and with the greatest deliberation laid it on the table before her
miss skiffinss composure while she did this was one of the most remarkable sights i have ever seen and if i could have thought the act consistent with abstraction of mind i should have deemed that miss skiffins performed it mechanically
by and by i noticed wemmicks arm beginning to disappear again and gradually fading out of view
shortly afterwards his mouth began to widen again
after an interval of suspense on my part that was quite enthralling and almost painful i saw his hand appear on the other side of miss skiffins
instantly miss skiffins stopped it with the neatness of a placid boxer took off that girdle or cestus as before and laid it on the table
taking the table to represent the path of virtue i am justified in stating that during the whole time of the ageds reading wemmicks arm was straying from the path of virtue and being recalled to it by miss skiffins
at last the aged read himself into a light slumber
this was the time for wemmick to produce a little kettle a tray of glasses and a black bottle with a porcelaintopped cork representing some clerical dignitary of a rubicund and social aspect
with the aid of these appliances we all had something warm to drink including the aged who was soon awake again
miss skiffins mixed and i observed that she and wemmick drank out of one glass
of course i knew better than to offer to see miss skiffins home and under the circumstances i thought i had best go first which i did taking a cordial leave of the aged and having passed a pleasant evening
before a week was out i received a note from wemmick dated walworth stating that he hoped he had made some advance in that matter appertaining to our private and personal capacities and that he would be glad if i could come and see him again upon it
so i went out to walworth again and yet again and yet again and i saw him by appointment in the city several times but never held any communication with him on the subject in or near little britain
the upshot was that we found a worthy young merchant or shippingbroker not long established in business who wanted intelligent help and who wanted capital and who in due course of time and receipt would want a partner
between him and me secret articles were signed of which herbert was the subject and i paid him half of my five hundred pounds down and engaged for sundry other payments some to fall due at certain dates out of my income some contingent on my coming into my property
miss skiffinss brother conducted the negotiation
wemmick pervaded it throughout but never appeared in it
the whole business was so cleverly managed that herbert had not the least suspicion of my hand being in it
i never shall forget the radiant face with which he came home one afternoon and told me as a mighty piece of news of his having fallen in with one clarriker the young merchants name and of clarrikers having shown an extraordinary inclination towards him and of his belief that the opening had come at last
day by day as his hopes grew stronger and his face brighter he must have thought me a more and more affectionate friend for i had the greatest difficulty in restraining my tears of triumph when i saw him so happy
at length the thing being done and he having that day entered clarrikers house and he having talked to me for a whole evening in a flush of pleasure and success i did really cry in good earnest when i went to bed to think that my expectations had done some good to somebody
a great event in my life the turning point of my life now opens on my view
but before i proceed to narrate it and before i pass on to all the changes it involved i must give one chapter to estella
it is not much to give to the theme that so long filled my heart
chapter xxxviii
if that staid old house near the green at richmond should ever come to be haunted when i am dead it will be haunted surely by my ghost
o the many many nights and days through which the unquiet spirit within me haunted that house when estella lived there
let my body be where it would my spirit was always wandering wandering wandering about that house
the lady with whom estella was placed mrs brandley by name was a widow with one daughter several years older than estella
the mother looked young and the daughter looked old the mothers complexion was pink and the daughters was yellow the mother set up for frivolity and the daughter for theology
they were in what is called a good position and visited and were visited by numbers of people
little if any community of feeling subsisted between them and estella but the understanding was established that they were necessary to her and that she was necessary to them
mrs brandley had been a friend of miss havishams before the time of her seclusion
in mrs brandleys house and out of mrs brandleys house i suffered every kind and degree of torture that estella could cause me
the nature of my relations with her which placed me on terms of familiarity without placing me on terms of favour conduced to my distraction
she made use of me to tease other admirers and she turned the very familiarity between herself and me to the account of putting a constant slight on my devotion to her
if i had been her secretary steward halfbrother poor relationif i had been a younger brother of her appointed husbandi could not have seemed to myself further from my hopes when i was nearest to her
the privilege of calling her by her name and hearing her call me by mine became under the circumstances an aggravation of my trials and while i think it likely that it almost maddened her other lovers i know too certainly that it almost maddened me
she had admirers without end
no doubt my jealousy made an admirer of every one who went near her but there were more than enough of them without that
i saw her often at richmond i heard of her often in town and i used often to take her and the brandleys on the water there were picnics fte days plays operas concerts parties all sorts of pleasures through which i pursued herand they were all miseries to me
i never had one hours happiness in her society and yet my mind all round the fourandtwenty hours was harping on the happiness of having her with me unto death
throughout this part of our intercourseand it lasted as will presently be seen for what i then thought a long timeshe habitually reverted to that tone which expressed that our association was forced upon us
there were other times when she would come to a sudden check in this tone and in all her many tones and would seem to pity me
pip pip she said one evening coming to such a check when we sat apart at a darkening window of the house in richmond will you never take warning of what of me warning not to be attracted by you do you mean estella do i mean
if you dont know what i mean you are blind i should have replied that love was commonly reputed blind but for the reason that i always was restrainedand this was not the least of my miseriesby a feeling that it was ungenerous to press myself upon her when she knew that she could not choose but obey miss havisham
my dread always was that this knowledge on her part laid me under a heavy disadvantage with her pride and made me the subject of a rebellious struggle in her bosom
at any rate said i i have no warning given me just now for you wrote to me to come to you this time thats true said estella with a cold careless smile that always chilled me
after looking at the twilight without for a little while she went on to say the time has come round when miss havisham wishes to have me for a day at satis
you are to take me there and bring me back if you will
she would rather i did not travel alone and objects to receiving my maid for she has a sensitive horror of being talked of by such people
can you take me can i take you estella you can then
the day after tomorrow if you please
you are to pay all charges out of my purse
you hear the condition of your going and must obey said i
this was all the preparation i received for that visit or for others like it miss havisham never wrote to me nor had i ever so much as seen her handwriting
we went down on the next day but one and we found her in the room where i had first beheld her and it is needless to add that there was no change in satis house
she was even more dreadfully fond of estella than she had been when i last saw them together i repeat the word advisedly for there was something positively dreadful in the energy of her looks and embraces
she hung upon estellas beauty hung upon her words hung upon her gestures and sat mumbling her own trembling fingers while she looked at her as though she were devouring the beautiful creature she had reared
from estella she looked at me with a searching glance that seemed to pry into my heart and probe its wounds
how does she use you pip how does she use you she asked me again with her witchlike eagerness even in estellas hearing
but when we sat by her flickering fire at night she was most weird for then keeping estellas hand drawn through her arm and clutched in her own hand she extorted from her by dint of referring back to what estella had told her in her regular letters the names and conditions of the men whom she had fascinated and as miss havisham dwelt upon this roll with the intensity of a mind mortally hurt and diseased she sat with her other hand on her crutch stick and her chin on that and her wan bright eyes glaring at me a very spectre
i saw in this wretched though it made me and bitter the sense of dependence and even of degradation that it awakenedi saw in this that estella was set to wreak miss havishams revenge on men and that she was not to be given to me until she had gratified it for a term
i saw in this a reason for her being beforehand assigned to me
sending her out to attract and torment and do mischief miss havisham sent her with the malicious assurance that she was beyond the reach of all admirers and that all who staked upon that cast were secured to lose
i saw in this that i too was tormented by a perversion of ingenuity even while the prize was reserved for me
i saw in this the reason for my being staved off so long and the reason for my late guardians declining to commit himself to the formal knowledge of such a scheme
in a word i saw in this miss havisham as i had her then and there before my eyes and always had had her before my eyes and i saw in this the distinct shadow of the darkened and unhealthy house in which her life was hidden from the sun
the candles that lighted that room of hers were placed in sconces on the wall
they were high from the ground and they burnt with the steady dulness of artificial light in air that is seldom renewed
as i looked round at them and at the pale gloom they made and at the stopped clock and at the withered articles of bridal dress upon the table and the ground and at her own awful figure with its ghostly reflection thrown large by the fire upon the ceiling and the wall i saw in everything the construction that my mind had come to repeated and thrown back to me
my thoughts passed into the great room across the landing where the table was spread and i saw it written as it were in the falls of the cobwebs from the centrepiece in the crawlings of the spiders on the cloth in the tracks of the mice as they betook their little quickened hearts behind the panels and in the gropings and pausings of the beetles on the floor
it happened on the occasion of this visit that some sharp words arose between estella and miss havisham
it was the first time i had ever seen them opposed
we were seated by the fire as just now described and miss havisham still had estellas arm drawn through her own and still clutched estellas hand in hers when estella gradually began to detach herself
she had shown a proud impatience more than once before and had rather endured that fierce affection than accepted or returned it
what said miss havisham flashing her eyes upon her are you tired of me only a little tired of myself replied estella disengaging her arm and moving to the great chimneypiece where she stood looking down at the fire
speak the truth you ingrate cried miss havisham passionately striking her stick upon the floor you are tired of me estella looked at her with perfect composure and again looked down at the fire
her graceful figure and her beautiful face expressed a selfpossessed indifference to the wild heat of the other that was almost cruel
you stock and stone exclaimed miss havisham
you cold cold heart what said estella preserving her attitude of indifference as she leaned against the great chimneypiece and only moving her eyes do you reproach me for being cold
you are you not was the fierce retort
you should know said estella
i am what you have made me
take all the praise take all the blame take all the success take all the failure in short take me o look at her look at her cried miss havisham bitterly look at her so hard and thankless on the hearth where she was reared
where i took her into this wretched breast when it was first bleeding from its stabs and where i have lavished years of tenderness upon her illustration at least i was no party to the compact said estella for if i could walk and speak when it was made it was as much as i could do
but what would you have
you have been very good to me and i owe everything to you
what would you have love replied the other
you have it i have not said miss havisham
mother by adoption retorted estella never departing from the easy grace of her attitude never raising her voice as the other did never yielding either to anger or tendernessmother by adoption i have said that i owe everything to you
all i possess is freely yours
all that you have given me is at your command to have again
beyond that i have nothing
and if you ask me to give you what you never gave me my gratitude and duty cannot do impossibilities did i never give her love cried miss havisham turning wildly to me
did i never give her a burning love inseparable from jealousy at all times and from sharp pain while she speaks thus to me
let her call me mad let her call me mad why should i call you mad returned estella i of all people
does any one live who knows what set purposes you have half as well as i do
does any one live who knows what a steady memory you have half as well as i do
i who have sat on this same hearth on the little stool that is even now beside you there learning your lessons and looking up into your face when your face was strange and frightened me soon forgotten moaned miss havisham
times soon forgotten no not forgotten retorted estellanot forgotten but treasured up in my memory
when have you found me false to your teaching
when have you found me unmindful of your lessons
when have you found me giving admission here she touched her bosom with her hand to anything that you excluded
be just to me so proud so proud moaned miss havisham pushing away her grey hair with both her hands
who taught me to be proud returned estella
who praised me when i learnt my lesson so hard so hard moaned miss havisham with her former action
who taught me to be hard returned estella
who praised me when i learnt my lesson but to be proud and hard to me miss havisham quite shrieked as she stretched out her arms
estella estella estella to be proud and hard to me estella looked at her for a moment with a kind of calm wonder but was not otherwise disturbed when the moment was past she looked down at the fire again
i cannot think said estella raising her eyes after a silence why you should be so unreasonable when i come to see you after a separation
i have never forgotten your wrongs and their causes
i have never been unfaithful to you or your schooling
i have never shown any weakness that i can charge myself with would it be weakness to return my love exclaimed miss havisham
but yes yes she would call it so i begin to think said estella in a musing way after another moment of calm wonder that i almost understand how this comes about
if you had brought up your adopted daughter wholly in the dark confinement of these rooms and had never let her know that there was such a thing as the daylight by which she had never once seen your faceif you had done that and then for a purpose had wanted her to understand the daylight and know all about it you would have been disappointed and angry miss havisham with her head in her hands sat making a low moaning and swaying herself on her chair but gave no answer
or said estellawhich is a nearer caseif you had taught her from the dawn of her intelligence with your utmost energy and might that there was such a thing as daylight but that it was made to be her enemy and destroyer and she must always turn against it for it had blighted you and would else blight herif you had done this and then for a purpose had wanted her to take naturally to the daylight and she could not do it you would have been disappointed and angry miss havisham sat listening or it seemed so for i could not see her face but still made no answer
so said estella i must be taken as i have been made
the success is not mine the failure is not mine but the two together make me miss havisham had settled down i hardly knew how upon the floor among the faded bridal relics with which it was strewn
i took advantage of the momenti had sought one from the firstto leave the room after beseeching estellas attention to her with a movement of my hand
when i left estella was yet standing by the great chimneypiece just as she had stood throughout
miss havishams grey hair was all adrift upon the ground among the other bridal wrecks and was a miserable sight to see
it was with a depressed heart that i walked in the starlight for an hour and more about the courtyard and about the brewery and about the ruined garden
when i at last took courage to return to the room i found estella sitting at miss havishams knee taking up some stitches in one of those old articles of dress that were dropping to pieces and of which i have often been reminded since by the faded tatters of old banners that i have seen hanging up in cathedrals
afterwards estella and i played at cards as of yoreonly we were skilful now and played french gamesand so the evening wore away and i went to bed
i lay in that separate building across the courtyard
it was the first time i had ever lain down to rest in satis house and sleep refused to come near me
a thousand miss havishams haunted me
she was on this side of my pillow on that at the head of the bed at the foot behind the halfopened door of the dressingroom in the dressingroom in the room overhead in the room beneatheverywhere
at last when the night was slow to creep on towards two oclock i felt that i absolutely could no longer bear the place as a place to lie down in and that i must get up
i therefore got up and put on my clothes and went out across the yard into the long stone passage designing to gain the outer courtyard and walk there for the relief of my mind
but i was no sooner in the passage than i extinguished my candle for i saw miss havisham going along it in a ghostly manner making a low cry
i followed her at a distance and saw her go up the staircase
she carried a bare candle in her hand which she had probably taken from one of the sconces in her own room and was a most unearthly object by its light
standing at the bottom of the staircase i felt the mildewed air of the feastchamber without seeing her open the door and i heard her walking there and so across into her own room and so across again into that never ceasing the low cry
after a time i tried in the dark both to get out and to go back but i could do neither until some streaks of day strayed in and showed me where to lay my hands
during the whole interval whenever i went to the bottom of the staircase i heard her footstep saw her light pass above and heard her ceaseless low cry
before we left next day there was no revival of the difference between her and estella nor was it ever revived on any similar occasion and there were four similar occasions to the best of my remembrance
nor did miss havishams manner towards estella in anywise change except that i believed it to have something like fear infused among its former characteristics
it is impossible to turn this leaf of my life without putting bentley drummles name upon it or i would very gladly
on a certain occasion when the finches were assembled in force and when good feeling was being promoted in the usual manner by nobodys agreeing with anybody else the presiding finch called the grove to order forasmuch as mr drummle had not yet toasted a lady which according to the solemn constitution of the society it was the brutes turn to do that day
i thought i saw him leer in an ugly way at me while the decanters were going round but as there was no love lost between us that might easily be
what was my indignant surprise when he called upon the company to pledge him to estella estella who said i
never you mind retorted drummle
estella of where said i
you are bound to say of where which he was as a finch
of richmond gentlemen said drummle putting me out of the question and a peerless beauty much he knew about peerless beauties a mean miserable idiot
i whispered herbert
i know that lady said herbert across the table when the toast had been honoured
do you said drummle
and so do i i added with a scarlet face
do you said drummle
o lord this was the only retortexcept glass or crockerythat the heavy creature was capable of making but i became as highly incensed by it as if it had been barbed with wit and i immediately rose in my place and said that i could not but regard it as being like the honourable finchs impudence to come down to that grovewe always talked about coming down to that grove as a neat parliamentary turn of expressiondown to that grove proposing a lady of whom he knew nothing
mr drummle upon this starting up demanded what i meant by that
whereupon i made him the extreme reply that i believed he knew where i was to be found
whether it was possible in a christian country to get on without blood after this was a question on which the finches were divided
the debate upon it grew so lively indeed that at least six more honourable members told six more during the discussion that they believed they knew where they were to be found
however it was decided at last the grove being a court of honour that if mr drummle would bring never so slight a certificate from the lady importing that he had the honour of her acquaintance mr pip must express his regret as a gentleman and a finch for having been betrayed into a warmth which next day was appointed for the production lest our honour should take cold from delay and next day drummle appeared with a polite little avowal in estellas hand that she had had the honour of dancing with him several times
this left me no course but to regret that i had been betrayed into a warmth which and on the whole to repudiate as untenable the idea that i was to be found anywhere
drummle and i then sat snorting at one another for an hour while the grove engaged in indiscriminate contradiction and finally the promotion of good feeling was declared to have gone ahead at an amazing rate
i tell this lightly but it was no light thing to me
for i cannot adequately express what pain it gave me to think that estella should show any favour to a contemptible clumsy sulky booby so very far below the average
to the present moment i believe it to have been referable to some pure fire of generosity and disinterestedness in my love for her that i could not endure the thought of her stooping to that hound
no doubt i should have been miserable whomsoever she had favoured but a worthier object would have caused me a different kind and degree of distress
it was easy for me to find out and i did soon find out that drummle had begun to follow her closely and that she allowed him to do it
a little while and he was always in pursuit of her and he and i crossed one another every day
he held on in a dull persistent way and estella held him on now with encouragement now with discouragement now almost flattering him now openly despising him now knowing him very well now scarcely remembering who he was
the spider as mr jaggers had called him was used to lying in wait however and had the patience of his tribe
added to that he had a blockhead confidence in his money and in his family greatness which sometimes did him good servicealmost taking the place of concentration and determined purpose
so the spider doggedly watching estella outwatched many brighter insects and would often uncoil himself and drop at the right nick of time
at a certain assembly ball at richmond there used to be assembly balls at most places then where estella had outshone all other beauties this blundering drummle so hung about her and with so much toleration on her part that i resolved to speak to her concerning him
i took the next opportunity which was when she was waiting for mrs blandley to take her home and was sitting apart among some flowers ready to go
i was with her for i almost always accompanied them to and from such places
are you tired estella rather pip you should be say rather i should not be for i have my letter to satis house to write before i go to sleep recounting tonights triumph said i
surely a very poor one estella what do you mean
i didnt know there had been any estella said i do look at that fellow in the corner yonder who is looking over here at us why should i look at him returned estella with her eyes on me instead
what is there in that fellow in the corner yonderto use your wordsthat i need look at indeed that is the very question i want to ask you said i
for he has been hovering about you all night moths and all sorts of ugly creatures replied estella with a glance towards him hover about a lighted candle
can the candle help it no i returned but cannot the estella help it well said she laughing after a moment perhaps
yes
anything you like but estella do hear me speak
it makes me wretched that you should encourage a man so generally despised as drummle
you know he is despised well said she
you know he is as ungainly within as without
a deficient illtempered lowering stupid fellow well said she
you know he has nothing to recommend him but money and a ridiculous roll of addleheaded predecessors now dont you well said she again and each time she said it she opened her lovely eyes the wider
to overcome the difficulty of getting past that monosyllable i took it from her and said repeating it with emphasis well
then that is why it makes me wretched now if i could have believed that she favoured drummle with any idea of making memewretched i should have been in better heart about it but in that habitual way of hers she put me so entirely out of the question that i could believe nothing of the kind
pip said estella casting her glance over the room dont be foolish about its effect on you
it may have its effect on others and may be meant to have
its not worth discussing yes it is said i because i cannot bear that people should say she throws away her graces and attractions on a mere boor the lowest in the crowd i can bear it said estella
oh
dont be so proud estella and so inflexible calls me proud and inflexible in this breath said estella opening her hands
and in his last breath reproached me for stooping to a boor there is no doubt you do said i something hurriedly for i have seen you give him looks and smiles this very night such as you never give tome do you want me then said estella turning suddenly with a fixed and serious if not angry look to deceive and entrap you do you deceive and entrap him estella yes and many othersall of them but you
here is mrs brandley
ill say no more and now that i have given the one chapter to the theme that so filled my heart and so often made it ache and ache again i pass on unhindered to the event that had impended over me longer yet the event that had begun to be prepared for before i knew that the world held estella and in the days when her baby intelligence was receiving its first distortions from miss havishams wasting hands
in the eastern story the heavy slab that was to fall on the bed of state in the flush of conquest was slowly wrought out of the quarry the tunnel for the rope to hold it in its place was slowly carried through the leagues of rock the slab was slowly raised and fitted in the roof the rope was rove to it and slowly taken through the miles of hollow to the great iron ring
all being made ready with much labour and the hour come the sultan was aroused in the dead of the night and the sharpened axe that was to sever the rope from the great iron ring was put into his hand and he struck with it and the rope parted and rushed away and the ceiling fell
so in my case all the work near and afar that tended to the end had been accomplished and in an instant the blow was struck and the roof of my stronghold dropped upon me
chapter xxxix
i was threeandtwenty years of age
not another word had i heard to enlighten me on the subject of my expectations and my twentythird birthday was a week gone
we had left barnards inn more than a year and lived in the temple
our chambers were in gardencourt down by the river
mr pocket and i had for some time parted company as to our original relations though we continued on the best terms
notwithstanding my inability to settle to anythingwhich i hope arose out of the restless and incomplete tenure on which i held my meansi had a taste for reading and read regularly so many hours a day
that matter of herberts was still progressing and everything with me was as i have brought it down to the close of the last preceding chapter
business had taken herbert on a journey to marseilles
i was alone and had a dull sense of being alone
dispirited and anxious long hoping that tomorrow or next week would clear my way and long disappointed i sadly missed the cheerful face and ready response of my friend
it was wretched weather stormy and wet stormy and wet and mud mud mud deep in all the streets
day after day a vast heavy veil had been driving over london from the east and it drove still as if in the east there were an eternity of cloud and wind
so furious had been the gusts that high buildings in town had had the lead stripped off their roofs and in the country trees had been torn up and sails of windmills carried away and gloomy accounts had come in from the coast of shipwreck and death
violent blasts of rain had accompanied these rages of wind and the day just closed as i sat down to read had been the worst of all
alterations have been made in that part of the temple since that time and it has not now so lonely a character as it had then nor is it so exposed to the river
we lived at the top of the last house and the wind rushing up the river shook the house that night like discharges of cannon or breakings of a sea
when the rain came with it and dashed against the windows i thought raising my eyes to them as they rocked that i might have fancied myself in a stormbeaten lighthouse
occasionally the smoke came rolling down the chimney as though it could not bear to go out into such a night and when i set the doors open and looked down the staircase the staircase lamps were blown out and when i shaded my face with my hands and looked through the black windows opening them ever so little was out of the question in the teeth of such wind and rain i saw that the lamps in the court were blown out and that the lamps on the bridges and the shore were shuddering and that the coalfires in barges on the river were being carried away before the wind like redhot splashes in the rain
i read with my watch upon the table purposing to close my book at eleven oclock
as i shut it saint pauls and all the many churchclocks in the citysome leading some accompanying some followingstruck that hour
the sound was curiously flawed by the wind and i was listening and thinking how the wind assailed and tore it when i heard a footstep on the stair
what nervous folly made me start and awfully connect it with the footstep of my dead sister matters not
it was past in a moment and i listened again and heard the footstep stumble in coming on
remembering then that the staircaselights were blown out i took up my readinglamp and went out to the stairhead
whoever was below had stopped on seeing my lamp for all was quiet
there is some one down there is there not i called out looking down
yes said a voice from the darkness beneath
what floor do you want the top
mr pip that is my namethere is nothing the matter nothing the matter returned the voice
and the man came on
i stood with my lamp held out over the stairrail and he came slowly within its light
it was a shaded lamp to shine upon a book and its circle of light was very contracted so that he was in it for a mere instant and then out of it
in the instant i had seen a face that was strange to me looking up with an incomprehensible air of being touched and pleased by the sight of me
moving the lamp as the man moved i made out that he was substantially dressed but roughly like a voyager by sea
that he had long irongrey hair
that his age was about sixty
that he was a muscular man strong on his legs and that he was browned and hardened by exposure to weather
as he ascended the last stair or two and the light of my lamp included us both i saw with a stupid kind of amazement that he was holding out both his hands to me
pray what is your business i asked him
my business he repeated pausing
ah
yes
i will explain my business by your leave do you wish to come in yes he replied i wish to come in master i had asked him the question inhospitably enough for i resented the sort of bright and gratified recognition that still shone in his face
i resented it because it seemed to imply that he expected me to respond to it
but i took him into the room i had just left and having set the lamp on the table asked him as civilly as i could to explain himself
he looked about him with the strangest airan air of wondering pleasure as if he had some part in the things he admiredand he pulled off a rough outer coat and his hat
then i saw that his head was furrowed and bald and that the long irongrey hair grew only on its sides
but i saw nothing that in the least explained him
on the contrary i saw him next moment once more holding out both his hands to me
what do you mean said i half suspecting him to be mad
he stopped in his looking at me and slowly rubbed his right hand over his head
its disapinting to a man he said in a coarse broken voice arter having looked forard so distant and come so fur but youre not to blame for thatneither on us is to blame for that
ill speak in half a minute
give me half a minute please he sat down on a chair that stood before the fire and covered his forehead with his large brown veinous hands
i looked at him attentively then and recoiled a little from him but i did not know him
theres no one nigh said he looking over his shoulder is there why do you a stranger coming into my rooms at this time of the night ask that question said i
youre a game one he returned shaking his head at me with a deliberate affection at once most unintelligible and most exasperating im glad youve growd up a game one
but dont catch hold of me
youd be sorry arterwards to have done it i relinquished the intention he had detected for i knew him
even yet i could not recall a single feature but i knew him
if the wind and the rain had driven away the intervening years had scattered all the intervening objects had swept us to the churchyard where we first stood face to face on such different levels i could not have known my convict more distinctly than i knew him now as he sat in the chair before the fire
no need to take a file from his pocket and show it to me no need to take the handkerchief from his neck and twist it round his head no need to hug himself with both his arms and take a shivering turn across the room looking back at me for recognition
i knew him before he gave me one of those aids though a moment before i had not been conscious of remotely suspecting his identity
he came back to where i stood and again held out both his hands
not knowing what to dofor in my astonishment i had lost my selfpossessioni reluctantly gave him my hands
he grasped them heartily raised them to his lips kissed them and still held them
you acted noble my boy said he
noble pip
and i have never forgot it at a change in his manner as if he were even going to embrace me i laid a hand upon his breast and put him away
stay said i
keep off
if you are grateful to me for what i did when i was a little child i hope you have shown your gratitude by mending your way of life
if you have come here to thank me it was not necessary
still however you have found me out there must be something good in the feeling that has brought you here and i will not repulse you but surely you must understand thati my attention was so attracted by the singularity of his fixed look at me that the words died away on my tongue
you was asaying he observed when we had confronted one another in silence that surely i must understand
what surely must i understand that i cannot wish to renew that chance intercourse with you of long ago under these different circumstances
i am glad to believe you have repented and recovered yourself
i am glad to tell you so
i am glad that thinking i deserve to be thanked you have come to thank me
but our ways are different ways none the less
you are wet and you look weary
will you drink something before you go he had replaced his neckerchief loosely and had stood keenly observant of me biting a long end of it
i think he answered still with the end at his mouth and still observant of me that i will drink i thank you afore i go there was a tray ready on a sidetable
i brought it to the table near the fire and asked him what he would have
he touched one of the bottles without looking at it or speaking and i made him some hot rum and water
i tried to keep my hand steady while i did so but his look at me as he leaned back in his chair with the long draggled end of his neckerchief between his teethevidently forgottenmade my hand very difficult to master
when at last i put the glass to him i saw with amazement that his eyes were full of tears
up to this time i had remained standing not to disguise that i wished him gone
but i was softened by the softened aspect of the man and felt a touch of reproach
i hope said i hurriedly putting something into a glass for myself and drawing a chair to the table that you will not think i spoke harshly to you just now
i had no intention of doing it and i am sorry for it if i did
i wish you well and happy as i put my glass to my lips he glanced with surprise at the end of his neckerchief dropping from his mouth when he opened it and stretched out his hand
i gave him mine and then he drank and drew his sleeve across his eyes and forehead
how are you living i asked him
ive been a sheepfarmer stockbreeder other trades besides away in the new world said he many a thousand mile of stormy water off from this i hope you have done well ive done wonderfully well
theres others went out alonger me as has done well too but no man has done nigh as well as me
im famous for it i am glad to hear it i hope to hear you say so my dear boy without stopping to try to understand those words or the tone in which they were spoken i turned off to a point that had just come into my mind
have you ever seen a messenger you once sent to me i inquired since he undertook that trust never set eyes upon him
i warnt likely to it he came faithfully and he brought me the two onepound notes
i was a poor boy then as you know and to a poor boy they were a little fortune
but like you i have done well since and you must let me pay them back
you can put them to some other poor boys use i took out my purse
he watched me as i laid my purse upon the table and opened it and he watched me as i separated two onepound notes from its contents
they were clean and new and i spread them out and handed them over to him
still watching me he laid them one upon the other folded them longwise gave them a twist set fire to them at the lamp and dropped the ashes into the tray
may i make so bold he said then with a smile that was like a frown and with a frown that was like a smile as ask you how you have done well since you and me was out on them lone shivering marshes how ah he emptied his glass got up and stood at the side of the fire with his heavy brown hand on the mantelshelf
he put a foot up to the bars to dry and warm it and the wet boot began to steam but he neither looked at it nor at the fire but steadily looked at me
it was only now that i began to tremble
when my lips had parted and had shaped some words that were without sound i forced myself to tell him though i could not do it distinctly that i had been chosen to succeed to some property
might a mere warmint ask what property said he
i faltered i dont know might a mere warmint ask whose property said he
i faltered again i dont know could i make a guess i wonder said the convict at your income since you come of age
as to the first figure now
five with my heart beating like a heavy hammer of disordered action i rose out of my chair and stood with my hand upon the back of it looking wildly at him
concerning a guardian he went on
there ought to have been some guardian or suchlike whiles you was a minor
some lawyer maybe
as to the first letter of that lawyers name now
would it be j all the truth of my position came flashing on me and its disappointments dangers disgraces consequences of all kinds rushed in in such a multitude that i was borne down by them and had to struggle for every breath i drew
put it he resumed as the employer of that lawyer whose name begun with a j and might be jaggersput it as he had come over sea to portsmouth and had landed there and had wanted to come on to you
however you have found me out you says just now
well
however did i find you out
why i wrote from portsmouth to a person in london for particulars of your address
that persons name
why wemmick i could not have spoken one word though it had been to save my life
i stood with a hand on the chairback and a hand on my breast where i seemed to be suffocatingi stood so looking wildly at him until i grasped at the chair when the room began to surge and turn
he caught me drew me to the sofa put me up against the cushions and bent on one knee before me bringing the face that i now well remembered and that i shuddered at very near to mine
yes pip dear boy ive made a gentleman on you
its me wot has done it
i swore that time sure as ever i earned a guinea that guinea should go to you
i swore arterwards sure as ever i speclated and got rich you should get rich
i lived rough that you should live smooth i worked hard that you should be above work
what odds dear boy
do i tell it fur you to feel a obligation
not a bit
i tell it fur you to know as that there hunted dunghill dog wot you kep life in got his head so high that he could make a gentlemanand pip youre him the abhorrence in which i held the man the dread i had of him the repugnance with which i shrank from him could not have been exceeded if he had been some terrible beast
lookee here pip
im your second father
youre my sonmore to me nor any son
ive put away money only for you to spend
when i was a hiredout shepherd in a solitary hut not seeing no faces but faces of sheep till i half forgot wot mens and womens faces wos like i see yourn
i drops my knife many a time in that hut when i was aeating my dinner or my supper and i says heres the boy again a looking at me whiles i eats and drinks i see you there a many times as plain as ever i see you on them misty marshes
lord strike me dead i says each timeand i goes out in the air to say it under the open heavensbut wot if i gets liberty and money ill make that boy a gentleman and i done it
why look at you dear boy
look at these here lodgings of yourn fit for a lord
a lord
ah
you shall show money with lords for wagers and beat em in his heat and triumph and in his knowledge that i had been nearly fainting he did not remark on my reception of all this
it was the one grain of relief i had
lookee here he went on taking my watch out of my pocket and turning towards him a ring on my finger while i recoiled from his touch as if he had been a snake a gold un and a beauty thats a gentlemans i hope
a diamond all set round with rubies thats a gentlemans i hope
look at your linen fine and beautiful
look at your clothes better aint to be got
and your books too turning his eyes round the room mounting up on their shelves by hundreds
and you read em dont you
i see youd been a reading of em when i come in
ha ha ha
you shall read em to me dear boy
and if theyre in foreign languages wot i dont understand i shall be just as proud as if i did again he took both my hands and put them to his lips while my blood ran cold within me
dont you mind talking pip said he after again drawing his sleeve over his eyes and forehead as the click came in his throat which i well rememberedand he was all the more horrible to me that he was so much in earnest you cant do better nor keep quiet dear boy
you aint looked slowly forward to this as i have you wosnt prepared for this as i wos
but didnt you never think it might be me o no no no i returned never never well you see it wos me and singlehanded
never a soul in it but my own self and mr jaggers was there no one else i asked
no said he with a glance of surprise who else should there be
and dear boy how good looking you have growed
theres bright eyes somewhereseh
isnt there bright eyes somewheres wot you love the thoughts on o estella estella
they shall be yourn dear boy if money can buy em
not that a gentleman like you so well set up as you cant win em off of his own game but money shall back you
let me finish wot i was a telling you dear boy
from that there hut and that there hiringout i got money left me by my master which died and had been the same as me and got my liberty and went for myself
in every single thing i went for i went for you
lord strike a blight upon it i says wotever it was i went for if it aint for him it all prospered wonderful
as i giv you to understand just now im famous for it
it was the money left me and the gains of the first few year wot i sent home to mr jaggersall for youwhen he first come arter you agreeable to my letter o that he had never come
that he had left me at the forgefar from contented yet by comparison happy
and then dear boy it was a recompense to me lookee here to know in secret that i was making a gentleman
the blood horses of them colonists might fling up the dust over me as i was walking what do i say
i says to myself im making a better gentleman nor ever youll be when one of em says to another he was a convict a few year ago and is a ignorant common fellow now for all hes lucky what do i say
i says to myself if i aint a gentleman nor yet aint got no learning im the owner of such
all on you owns stock and land which on you owns a broughtup london gentleman this way i kep myself agoing
and this way i held steady afore my mind that i would for certain come one day and see my boy and make myself known to him on his own ground he laid his hand on my shoulder
i shuddered at the thought that for anything i knew his hand might be stained with blood
it warnt easy pip for me to leave them parts nor yet it warnt safe
but i held to it and the harder it was the stronger i held for i was determined and my mind firm made up
at last i done it
dear boy i done it i tried to collect my thoughts but i was stunned
throughout i had seemed to myself to attend more to the wind and the rain than to him even now i could not separate his voice from those voices though those were loud and his was silent
where will you put me he asked presently
i must be put somewheres dear boy to sleep said i
yes
and to sleep long and sound he answered for ive been seatossed and seawashed months and months my friend and companion said i rising from the sofa is absent you must have his room he wont come back tomorrow will he no said i answering almost mechanically in spite of my utmost efforts not tomorrow because lookee here dear boy he said dropping his voice and laying a long finger on my breast in an impressive manner caution is necessary how do you mean
caution by g its death whats death i was sent for life
its death to come back
theres been overmuch coming back of late years and i should of a certainty be hanged if took nothing was needed but this the wretched man after loading wretched me with his gold and silver chains for years had risked his life to come to me and i held it there in my keeping
if i had loved him instead of abhorring him if i had been attracted to him by the strongest admiration and affection instead of shrinking from him with the strongest repugnance it could have been no worse
on the contrary it would have been better for his preservation would then have naturally and tenderly addressed my heart
my first care was to close the shutters so that no light might be seen from without and then to close and make fast the doors
while i did so he stood at the table drinking rum and eating biscuit and when i saw him thus engaged i saw my convict on the marshes at his meal again
it almost seemed to me as if he must stoop down presently to file at his leg
when i had gone into herberts room and had shut off any other communication between it and the staircase than through the room in which our conversation had been held i asked him if he would go to bed
he said yes but asked me for some of my gentlemans linen to put on in the morning
i brought it out and laid it ready for him and my blood again ran cold when he again took me by both hands to give me goodnight
i got away from him without knowing how i did it and mended the fire in the room where we had been together and sat down by it afraid to go to bed
for an hour or more i remained too stunned to think and it was not until i began to think that i began fully to know how wrecked i was and how the ship in which i had sailed was gone to pieces
miss havishams intentions towards me all a mere dream estella not designed for me i only suffered in satis house as a convenience a sting for the greedy relations a model with a mechanical heart to practise on when no other practice was at hand those were the first smarts i had
but sharpest and deepest pain of allit was for the convict guilty of i knew not what crimes and liable to be taken out of those rooms where i sat thinking and hanged at the old bailey door that i had deserted joe
i would not have gone back to joe now i would not have gone back to biddy now for any consideration simply i suppose because my sense of my own worthless conduct to them was greater than every consideration
no wisdom on earth could have given me the comfort that i should have derived from their simplicity and fidelity but i could never never undo what i had done
in every rage of wind and rush of rain i heard pursuers
twice i could have sworn there was a knocking and whispering at the outer door
with these fears upon me i began either to imagine or recall that i had had mysterious warnings of this mans approach
that for weeks gone by i had passed faces in the streets which i had thought like his
that these likenesses had grown more numerous as he coming over the sea had drawn nearer
that his wicked spirit had somehow sent these messengers to mine and that now on this stormy night he was as good as his word and with me
crowding up with these reflections came the reflection that i had seen him with my childish eyes to be a desperately violent man that i had heard that other convict reiterate that he had tried to murder him that i had seen him down in the ditch tearing and fighting like a wild beast
out of such remembrances i brought into the light of the fire a halfformed terror that it might not be safe to be shut up there with him in the dead of the wild solitary night
this dilated until it filled the room and impelled me to take a candle and go in and look at my dreadful burden
he had rolled a handkerchief round his head and his face was set and lowering in his sleep
but he was asleep and quietly too though he had a pistol lying on the pillow
assured of this i softly removed the key to the outside of his door and turned it on him before i again sat down by the fire
gradually i slipped from the chair and lay on the floor
when i awoke without having parted in my sleep with the perception of my wretchedness the clocks of the eastward churches were striking five the candles were wasted out the fire was dead and the wind and rain intensified the thick black darkness
this is the end of the second stage of pips expectations
chapter xl
it was fortunate for me that i had to take precautions to ensure so far as i could the safety of my dreaded visitor for this thought pressing on me when i awoke held other thoughts in a confused concourse at a distance
the impossibility of keeping him concealed in the chambers was selfevident
it could not be done and the attempt to do it would inevitably engender suspicion
true i had no avenger in my service now but i was looked after by an inflammatory old female assisted by an animated ragbag whom she called her niece and to keep a room secret from them would be to invite curiosity and exaggeration
they both had weak eyes which i had long attributed to their chronically looking in at keyholes and they were always at hand when not wanted indeed that was their only reliable quality besides larceny
not to get up a mystery with these people i resolved to announce in the morning that my uncle had unexpectedly come from the country
this course i decided on while i was yet groping about in the darkness for the means of getting a light
not stumbling on the means after all i was fain to go out to the adjacent lodge and get the watchman there to come with his lantern
now in groping my way down the black staircase i fell over something and that something was a man crouching in a corner
as the man made no answer when i asked him what he did there but eluded my touch in silence i ran to the lodge and urged the watchman to come quickly telling him of the incident on the way back
the wind being as fierce as ever we did not care to endanger the light in the lantern by rekindling the extinguished lamps on the staircase but we examined the staircase from the bottom to the top and found no one there
it then occurred to me as possible that the man might have slipped into my rooms so lighting my candle at the watchmans and leaving him standing at the door i examined them carefully including the room in which my dreaded guest lay asleep
all was quiet and assuredly no other man was in those chambers
it troubled me that there should have been a lurker on the stairs on that night of all nights in the year and i asked the watchman on the chance of eliciting some hopeful explanation as i handed him a dram at the door whether he had admitted at his gate any gentleman who had perceptibly been dining out
yes he said at different times of the night three
one lived in fountain court and the other two lived in the lane and he had seen them all go home
again the only other man who dwelt in the house of which my chambers formed a part had been in the country for some weeks and he certainly had not returned in the night because we had seen his door with his seal on it as we came upstairs
the night being so bad sir said the watchman as he gave me back my glass uncommon few have come in at my gate
besides them three gentlemen that i have named i dont call to mind another since about eleven oclock when a stranger asked for you my uncle i muttered
yes you saw him sir yes
oh yes likewise the person with him person with him i repeated
i judged the person to be with him returned the watchman
the person stopped when he stopped to make inquiry of me and the person took this way when he took this way what sort of person the watchman had not particularly noticed he should say a working person to the best of his belief he had a dustcoloured kind of clothes on under a dark coat
the watchman made more light of the matter than i did and naturally not having my reason for attaching weight to it
when i had got rid of him which i thought it well to do without prolonging explanations my mind was much troubled by these two circumstances taken together
whereas they were easy of innocent solution apartas for instance some diner out or diner at home who had not gone near this watchmans gate might have strayed to my staircase and dropped asleep thereand my nameless visitor might have brought some one with him to show him the waystill joined they had an ugly look to one as prone to distrust and fear as the changes of a few hours had made me
i lighted my fire which burnt with a raw pale flare at that time of the morning and fell into a doze before it
i seemed to have been dozing a whole night when the clocks struck six
as there was full an hour and a half between me and daylight i dozed again now waking up uneasily with prolix conversations about nothing in my ears now making thunder of the wind in the chimney at length falling off into a profound sleep from which the daylight woke me with a start
all this time i had never been able to consider my own situation nor could i do so yet
i had not the power to attend to it
i was greatly dejected and distressed but in an incoherent wholesale sort of way
as to forming any plan for the future i could as soon have formed an elephant
when i opened the shutters and looked out at the wet wild morning all of a leaden hue when i walked from room to room when i sat down again shivering before the fire waiting for my laundress to appear i thought how miserable i was but hardly knew why or how long i had been so or on what day of the week i made the reflection or even who i was that made it
at last the old woman and the niece came inthe latter with a head not easily distinguishable from her dusty broomand testified surprise at sight of me and the fire
to whom i imparted how my uncle had come in the night and was then asleep and how the breakfast preparations were to be modified accordingly
then i washed and dressed while they knocked the furniture about and made a dust and so in a sort of dream or sleepwaking i found myself sitting by the fire again waiting forhimto come to breakfast
by and by his door opened and he came out
i could not bring myself to bear the sight of him and i thought he had a worse look by daylight
i do not even know said i speaking low as he took his seat at the table by what name to call you
i have given out that you are my uncle thats it dear boy
call me uncle you assumed some name i suppose on board ship yes dear boy
i took the name of provis do you mean to keep that name why yes dear boy its as good as anotherunless youd like another what is your real name i asked him in a whisper
magwitch he answered in the same tone chrisend abel what were you brought up to be a warmint dear boy he answered quite seriously and used the word as if it denoted some profession
when you came into the temple last night said i pausing to wonder whether that could really have been last night which seemed so long ago
yes dear boy when you came in at the gate and asked the watchman the way here had you any one with you with me
no dear boy but there was some one there i didnt take particular notice he said dubiously not knowing the ways of the place
but i think there was a person too come in alonger me are you known in london i hope not said he giving his neck a jerk with his forefinger that made me turn hot and sick
were you known in london once not over and above dear boy
i was in the provinces mostly were youtriedin london which time said he with a sharp look
the last time he nodded
first knowed mr jaggers that way
jaggers was for me it was on my lips to ask him what he was tried for but he took up a knife gave it a flourish and with the words and what i done is worked out and paid for fell to at his breakfast
he ate in a ravenous way that was very disagreeable and all his actions were uncouth noisy and greedy
some of his teeth had failed him since i saw him eat on the marshes and as he turned his food in his mouth and turned his head sideways to bring his strongest fangs to bear upon it he looked terribly like a hungry old dog
if i had begun with any appetite he would have taken it away and i should have sat much as i didrepelled from him by an insurmountable aversion and gloomily looking at the cloth
im a heavy grubber dear boy he said as a polite kind of apology when he made an end of his meal but i always was
if it had been in my constitution to be a lighter grubber i might ha got into lighter trouble
similarly i must have my smoke
when i was first hired out as shepherd tother side the world its my belief i should ha turned into a molloncollymad sheep myself if i hadnt a had my smoke as he said so he got up from table and putting his hand into the breast of the peacoat he wore brought out a short black pipe and a handful of loose tobacco of the kind that is called negrohead
having filled his pipe he put the surplus tobacco back again as if his pocket were a drawer
then he took a live coal from the fire with the tongs and lighted his pipe at it and then turned round on the hearthrug with his back to the fire and went through his favourite action of holding out both his hands for mine
and this said he dandling my hands up and down in his as he puffed at his pipeand this is the gentleman what i made
the real genuine one
it does me good fur to look at you pip
all i stiplate is to stand by and look at you dear boy i released my hands as soon as i could and found that i was beginning slowly to settle down to the contemplation of my condition
what i was chained to and how heavily became intelligible to me as i heard his hoarse voice and sat looking up at his furrowed bald head with its iron grey hair at the sides
i mustnt see my gentleman a footing it in the mire of the streets there mustnt be no mud on his boots
my gentleman must have horses pip
horses to ride and horses to drive and horses for his servant to ride and drive as well
shall colonists have their horses and blood uns if you please good lord
and not my london gentleman
no no
well show em another pair of shoes than that pip wont us he took out of his pocket a great thick pocketbook bursting with papers and tossed it on the table
theres something worth spending in that there book dear boy
its yourn
all ive got aint mine its yourn
dont you be afeerd on it
theres more where that come from
ive come to the old country fur to see my gentleman spend his money like a gentleman
thatll be my pleasure
my pleasure ull be fur to see him do it
and blast you all he wound up looking round the room and snapping his fingers once with a loud snap blast you every one from the judge in his wig to the colonist a stirring up the dust ill show a better gentleman than the whole kit on you put together stop said i almost in a frenzy of fear and dislike i want to speak to you
i want to know what is to be done
i want to know how you are to be kept out of danger how long you are going to stay what projects you have lookee here pip said he laying his hand on my arm in a suddenly altered and subdued manner first of all lookee here
i forgot myself half a minute ago
what i said was low thats what it was low
lookee here pip
look over it
i aint agoing to be low first i resumed half groaning what precautions can be taken against your being recognised and seized no dear boy he said in the same tone as before that dont go first
lowness goes first
i aint took so many year to make a gentleman not without knowing whats due to him
lookee here pip
i was low thats what i was low
look over it dear boy some sense of the grimlyludicrous moved me to a fretful laugh as i replied i have looked over it
in heavens name dont harp upon it yes but lookee here he persisted
dear boy i aint come so fur not fur to be low
now go on dear boy
you was a saying how are you to be guarded from the danger you have incurred well dear boy the danger aint so great
without i was informed agen the danger aint so much to signify
theres jaggers and theres wemmick and theres you
who else is there to inform is there no chance person who might identify you in the street said i
well he returned there aint many
nor yet i dont intend to advertise myself in the newspapers by the name of am come back from botany bay and years have rolled away and whos to gain by it
still lookee here pip
if the danger had been fifty times as great i should ha come to see you mind you just the same and how long do you remain how long said he taking his black pipe from his mouth and dropping his jaw as he stared at me
im not agoing back
ive come for good where are you to live said i
what is to be done with you
where will you be safe dear boy he returned theres disguising wigs can be bought for money and theres hair powder and spectacles and black clothesshorts and what not
others has done it safe afore and what others has done afore others can do agen
as to the where and how of living dear boy give me your own opinions on it you take it smoothly now said i but you were very serious last night when you swore it was death and so i swear it is death said he putting his pipe back in his mouth and death by the rope in the open street not fur from this and its serious that you should fully understand it to be so
what then when thats once done
here i am
to go back now ud be as bad as to stand groundworse
besides pip im here because ive meant it by you years and years
as to what i dare im a old bird now as has dared all manner of traps since first he was fledged and im not afeerd to perch upon a scarecrow
if theres death hid inside of it there is and let him come out and ill face him and then ill believe in him and not afore
and now let me have a look at my gentleman agen once more he took me by both hands and surveyed me with an air of admiring proprietorship smoking with great complacency all the while
it appeared to me that i could do no better than secure him some quiet lodging hard by of which he might take possession when herbert returned whom i expected in two or three days
that the secret must be confided to herbert as a matter of unavoidable necessity even if i could have put the immense relief i should derive from sharing it with him out of the question was plain to me
but it was by no means so plain to mr provis i resolved to call him by that name who reserved his consent to herberts participation until he should have seen him and formed a favourable judgment of his physiognomy
and even then dear boy said he pulling a greasy little clasped black testament out of his pocket well have him on his oath to state that my terrible patron carried this little black book about the world solely to swear people on in cases of emergency would be to state what i never quite established but this i can say that i never knew him put it to any other use
the book itself had the appearance of having been stolen from some court of justice and perhaps his knowledge of its antecedents combined with his own experience in that wise gave him a reliance on its powers as a sort of legal spell or charm
on this first occasion of his producing it i recalled how he had made me swear fidelity in the churchyard long ago and how he had described himself last night as always swearing to his resolutions in his solitude
as he was at present dressed in a seafaring slop suit in which he looked as if he had some parrots and cigars to dispose of i next discussed with him what dress he should wear
he cherished an extraordinary belief in the virtues of shorts as a disguise and had in his own mind sketched a dress for himself that would have made him something between a dean and a dentist
it was with considerable difficulty that i won him over to the assumption of a dress more like a prosperous farmers and we arranged that he should cut his hair close and wear a little powder
lastly as he had not yet been seen by the laundress or her niece he was to keep himself out of their view until his change of dress was made
it would seem a simple matter to decide on these precautions but in my dazed not to say distracted state it took so long that i did not get out to further them until two or three in the afternoon
he was to remain shut up in the chambers while i was gone and was on no account to open the door
there being to my knowledge a respectable lodginghouse in essex street the back of which looked into the temple and was almost within hail of my windows i first of all repaired to that house and was so fortunate as to secure the second floor for my uncle mr provis
i then went from shop to shop making such purchases as were necessary to the change in his appearance
this business transacted i turned my face on my own account to little britain
mr jaggers was at his desk but seeing me enter got up immediately and stood before his fire
now pip said he be careful i will sir i returned
for coming along i had thought well of what i was going to say
dont commit yourself said mr jaggers and dont commit any one
you understandany one
dont tell me anything i dont want to know anything i am not curious of course i saw that he knew the man was come
i merely want mr jaggers said i to assure myself that what i have been told is true
i have no hope of its being untrue but at least i may verify it mr jaggers nodded
but did you say told or informed he asked me with his head on one side and not looking at me but looking in a listening way at the floor
told would seem to imply verbal communication
you cant have verbal communication with a man in new south wales you know i will say informed mr jaggers good i have been informed by a person named abel magwitch that he is the benefactor so long unknown to me that is the man said mr jaggers in new south wales and only he said i
and only he said mr jaggers
i am not so unreasonable sir as to think you at all responsible for my mistakes and wrong conclusions but i always supposed it was miss havisham as you say pip returned mr jaggers turning his eyes upon me coolly and taking a bite at his forefinger i am not at all responsible for that and yet it looked so like it sir i pleaded with a downcast heart
not a particle of evidence pip said mr jaggers shaking his head and gathering up his skirts
take nothing on its looks take everything on evidence
theres no better rule i have no more to say said i with a sigh after standing silent for a little while
i have verified my information and theres an end and magwitchin new south waleshaving at last disclosed himself said mr jaggers you will comprehend pip how rigidly throughout my communication with you i have always adhered to the strict line of fact
there has never been the least departure from the strict line of fact
you are quite aware of that quite sir i communicated to magwitchin new south waleswhen he first wrote to mefrom new south walesthe caution that he must not expect me ever to deviate from the strict line of fact
i also communicated to him another caution
he appeared to me to have obscurely hinted in his letter at some distant idea he had of seeing you in england here
i cautioned him that i must hear no more of that that he was not at all likely to obtain a pardon that he was expatriated for the term of his natural life and that his presenting himself in this country would be an act of felony rendering him liable to the extreme penalty of the law
i gave magwitch that caution said mr jaggers looking hard at me i wrote it to new south wales
he guided himself by it no doubt no doubt said i
i have been informed by wemmick pursued mr jaggers still looking hard at me that he has received a letter under date portsmouth from a colonist of the name of purvis or or provis i suggested
or provisthank you pip
perhaps it is provis
perhaps you know its provis yes said i
you know its provis
a letter under date portsmouth from a colonist of the name of provis asking for the particulars of your address on behalf of magwitch
wemmick sent him the particulars i understand by return of post
probably it is through provis that you have received the explanation of magwitchin new south wales it came through provis i replied
good day pip said mr jaggers offering his hand glad to have seen you
in writing by post to magwitchin new south walesor in communicating with him through provis have the goodness to mention that the particulars and vouchers of our long account shall be sent to you together with the balance for there is still a balance remaining
goodday pip we shook hands and he looked hard at me as long as he could see me
i turned at the door and he was still looking hard at me while the two vile casts on the shelf seemed to be trying to get their eyelids open and to force out of their swollen throats o what a man he is wemmick was out and though he had been at his desk he could have done nothing for me
i went straight back to the temple where i found the terrible provis drinking rum and water and smoking negrohead in safety
next day the clothes i had ordered all came home and he put them on
whatever he put on became him less it dismally seemed to me than what he had worn before
to my thinking there was something in him that made it hopeless to attempt to disguise him
the more i dressed him and the better i dressed him the more he looked like the slouching fugitive on the marshes
this effect on my anxious fancy was partly referable no doubt to his old face and manner growing more familiar to me but i believe too that he dragged one of his legs as if there were still a weight of iron on it and that from head to foot there was convict in the very grain of the man
the influences of his solitary hutlife were upon him besides and gave him a savage air that no dress could tame added to these were the influences of his subsequent branded life among men and crowning all his consciousness that he was dodging and hiding now
in all his ways of sitting and standing and eating and drinkingof brooding about in a highshouldered reluctant styleof taking out his great hornhandled jackknife and wiping it on his legs and cutting his foodof lifting light glasses and cups to his lips as if they were clumsy pannikinsof chopping a wedge off his bread and soaking up with it the last fragments of gravy round and round his plate as if to make the most of an allowance and then drying his fingerends on it and then swallowing itin these ways and a thousand other small nameless instances arising every minute in the day there was prisoner felon bondsman plain as plain could be
it had been his own idea to wear that touch of powder and i had conceded the powder after overcoming the shorts
but i can compare the effect of it when on to nothing but the probable effect of rouge upon the dead so awful was the manner in which everything in him that it was most desirable to repress started through that thin layer of pretence and seemed to come blazing out at the crown of his head
it was abandoned as soon as tried and he wore his grizzled hair cut short
words cannot tell what a sense i had at the same time of the dreadful mystery that he was to me
when he fell asleep of an evening with his knotted hands clenching the sides of the easychair and his bald head tattooed with deep wrinkles falling forward on his breast i would sit and look at him wondering what he had done and loading him with all the crimes in the calendar until the impulse was powerful on me to start up and fly from him
every hour so increased my abhorrence of him that i even think i might have yielded to this impulse in the first agonies of being so haunted notwithstanding all he had done for me and the risk he ran but for the knowledge that herbert must soon come back
once i actually did start out of bed in the night and begin to dress myself in my worst clothes hurriedly intending to leave him there with everything else i possessed and enlist for india as a private soldier
i doubt if a ghost could have been more terrible to me up in those lonely rooms in the long evenings and long nights with the wind and the rain always rushing by
a ghost could not have been taken and hanged on my account and the consideration that he could be and the dread that he would be were no small addition to my horrors
when he was not asleep or playing a complicated kind of patience with a ragged pack of cards of his owna game that i never saw before or since and in which he recorded his winnings by sticking his jackknife into the tablewhen he was not engaged in either of these pursuits he would ask me to read to himforeign language dear boy while i complied he not comprehending a single word would stand before the fire surveying me with the air of an exhibitor and i would see him between the fingers of the hand with which i shaded my face appealing in dumb show to the furniture to take notice of my proficiency
the imaginary student pursued by the misshapen creature he had impiously made was not more wretched than i pursued by the creature who had made me and recoiling from him with a stronger repulsion the more he admired me and the fonder he was of me
this is written of i am sensible as if it had lasted a year
it lasted about five days
expecting herbert all the time i dared not go out except when i took provis for an airing after dark
at length one evening when dinner was over and i had dropped into a slumber quite worn outfor my nights had been agitated and my rest broken by fearful dreamsi was roused by the welcome footstep on the staircase
provis who had been asleep too staggered up at the noise i made and in an instant i saw his jackknife shining in his hand
quiet
its herbert i said and herbert came bursting in with the airy freshness of six hundred miles of france upon him
handel my dear fellow how are you and again how are you and again how are you
i seem to have been gone a twelvemonth
why so i must have been for you have grown quite thin and pale
handel myhalloa
i beg your pardon he was stopped in his running on and in his shaking hands with me by seeing provis
provis regarding him with a fixed attention was slowly putting up his jackknife and groping in another pocket for something else
herbert my dear friend said i shutting the double doors while herbert stood staring and wondering something very strange has happened
this isa visitor of mine its all right dear boy said provis coming forward with his little clasped black book and then addressing himself to herbert
take it in your right hand
lord strike you dead on the spot if ever you split in any way sumever
kiss it do so as he wishes it i said to herbert
so herbert looking at me with a friendly uneasiness and amazement complied and provis immediately shaking hands with him said now youre on your oath you know
and never believe me on mine if pip shant make a gentleman on you chapter xli
in vain should i attempt to describe the astonishment and disquiet of herbert when he and i and provis sat down before the fire and i recounted the whole of the secret
enough that i saw my own feelings reflected in herberts face and not least among them my repugnance towards the man who had done so much for me
what would alone have set a division between that man and us if there had been no other dividing circumstance was his triumph in my story
saving his troublesome sense of having been low on one occasion since his returnon which point he began to hold forth to herbert the moment my revelation was finishedhe had no perception of the possibility of my finding any fault with my good fortune
his boast that he had made me a gentleman and that he had come to see me support the character on his ample resources was made for me quite as much as for himself
and that it was a highly agreeable boast to both of us and that we must both be very proud of it was a conclusion quite established in his own mind
though lookee here pips comrade he said to herbert after having discoursed for some time i know very well that once since i come backfor half a minuteive been low
i said to pip i knowed as i had been low
but dont you fret yourself on that score
i aint made pip a gentleman and pip aint agoing to make you a gentleman not fur me not to know whats due to ye both
dear boy and pips comrade you two may count upon me always having a genteel muzzle on
muzzled i have been since that half a minute when i was betrayed into lowness muzzled i am at the present time muzzled i ever will be herbert said certainly but looked as if there were no specific consolation in this and remained perplexed and dismayed
we were anxious for the time when he would go to his lodging and leave us together but he was evidently jealous of leaving us together and sat late
it was midnight before i took him round to essex street and saw him safely in at his own dark door
when it closed upon him i experienced the first moment of relief i had known since the night of his arrival
never quite free from an uneasy remembrance of the man on the stairs i had always looked about me in taking my guest out after dark and in bringing him back and i looked about me now
difficult as it is in a large city to avoid the suspicion of being watched when the mind is conscious of danger in that regard i could not persuade myself that any of the people within sight cared about my movements
the few who were passing passed on their several ways and the street was empty when i turned back into the temple
nobody had come out at the gate with us nobody went in at the gate with me
as i crossed by the fountain i saw his lighted back windows looking bright and quiet and when i stood for a few moments in the doorway of the building where i lived before going up the stairs garden court was as still and lifeless as the staircase was when i ascended it
herbert received me with open arms and i had never felt before so blessedly what it is to have a friend
when he had spoken some sound words of sympathy and encouragement we sat down to consider the question what was to be done
the chair that provis had occupied still remaining where it had stoodfor he had a barrack way with him of hanging about one spot in one unsettled manner and going through one round of observances with his pipe and his negrohead and his jackknife and his pack of cards and what not as if it were all put down for him on a slatei say his chair remaining where it had stood herbert unconsciously took it but next moment started out of it pushed it away and took another
he had no occasion to say after that that he had conceived an aversion for my patron neither had i occasion to confess my own
we interchanged that confidence without shaping a syllable
what said i to herbert when he was safe in another chairwhat is to be done my poor dear handel he replied holding his head i am too stunned to think so was i herbert when the blow first fell
still something must be done
he is intent upon various new expenseshorses and carriages and lavish appearances of all kinds
he must be stopped somehow you mean that you cant accept how can i i interposed as herbert paused
think of him
look at him an involuntary shudder passed over both of us
yet i am afraid the dreadful truth is herbert that he is attached to me strongly attached to me
was there ever such a fate my poor dear handel herbert repeated
then said i after all stopping short here never taking another penny from him think what i owe him already
then again i am heavily in debtvery heavily for me who have now no expectationsand i have been bred to no calling and i am fit for nothing well well well herbert remonstrated
dont say fit for nothing what am i fit for
i know only one thing that i am fit for and that is to go for a soldier
and i might have gone my dear herbert but for the prospect of taking counsel with your friendship and affection of course i broke down there and of course herbert beyond seizing a warm grip of my hand pretended not to know it
anyhow my dear handel said he presently soldiering wont do
if you were to renounce this patronage and these favours i suppose you would do so with some faint hope of one day repaying what you have already had
not very strong that hope if you went soldiering
besides its absurd
you would be infinitely better in clarrikers house small as it is
i am working up towards a partnership you know poor fellow
he little suspected with whose money
but there is another question said herbert
this is an ignorant determined man who has long had one fixed idea
more than that he seems to me i may misjudge him to be a man of a desperate and fierce character i know he is i returned
let me tell you what evidence i have seen of it and i told him what i had not mentioned in my narrative of that encounter with the other convict
see then said herbert think of this
he comes here at the peril of his life for the realisation of his fixed idea
in the moment of realisation after all his toil and waiting you cut the ground from under his feet destroy his idea and make his gains worthless to him
do you see nothing that he might do under the disappointment i have seen it herbert and dreamed of it ever since the fatal night of his arrival
nothing has been in my thoughts so distinctly as his putting himself in the way of being taken then you may rely upon it said herbert that there would be great danger of his doing it
that is his power over you as long as he remains in england and that would be his reckless course if you forsook him i was so struck by the horror of this idea which had weighed upon me from the first and the working out of which would make me regard myself in some sort as his murderer that i could not rest in my chair but began pacing to and fro
i said to herbert meanwhile that even if provis were recognised and taken in spite of himself i should be wretched as the cause however innocently
yes even though i was so wretched in having him at large and near me and even though i would far rather have worked at the forge all the days of my life than i would ever have come to this
but there was no staving off the question what was to be done
the first and the main thing to be done said herbert is to get him out of england
you will have to go with him and then he may be induced to go but get him where i will could i prevent his coming back my good handel is it not obvious that with newgate in the next street there must be far greater hazard in your breaking your mind to him and making him reckless here than elsewhere
if a pretext to get him away could be made out of that other convict or out of anything else in his life now there again said i stopping before herbert with my open hands held out as if they contained the desperation of the case
i know nothing of his life
it has almost made me mad to sit here of a night and see him before me so bound up with my fortunes and misfortunes and yet so unknown to me except as the miserable wretch who terrified me two days in my childhood herbert got up and linked his arm in mine and we slowly walked to and fro together studying the carpet
handel said herbert stopping you feel convinced that you can take no further benefits from him do you fully
surely you would too if you were in my place and you feel convinced that you must break with him herbert can you ask me and you have and are bound to have that tenderness for the life he has risked on your account that you must save him if possible from throwing it away
then you must get him out of england before you stir a finger to extricate yourself
that done extricate yourself in heavens name and well see it out together dear old boy it was a comfort to shake hands upon it and walk up and down again with only that done
now herbert said i with reference to gaining some knowledge of his history
there is but one way that i know of
i must ask him point blank yes
ask him said herbert when we sit at breakfast in the morning for he had said on taking leave of herbert that he would come to breakfast with us
with this project formed we went to bed
i had the wildest dreams concerning him and woke unrefreshed i woke too to recover the fear which i had lost in the night of his being found out as a returned transport
waking i never lost that fear
he came round at the appointed time took out his jackknife and sat down to his meal
he was full of plans for his gentlemans coming out strong and like a gentleman and urged me to begin speedily upon the pocketbook which he had left in my possession
he considered the chambers and his own lodging as temporary residences and advised me to look out at once for a fashionable crib near hyde park in which he could have a shakedown when he had made an end of his breakfast and was wiping his knife on his leg i said to him without a word of preface after you were gone last night i told my friend of the struggle that the soldiers found you engaged in on the marshes when we came up
you remember remember said he
i think so we want to know something about that manand about you
it is strange to know no more about either and particularly you than i was able to tell last night
is not this as good a time as another for our knowing more well he said after consideration
youre on your oath you know pips comrade assuredly replied herbert
as to anything i say you know he insisted
the oath applies to all i understand it to do so and lookee here
wotever i done is worked out and paid for he insisted again
so be it he took out his black pipe and was going to fill it with negrohead when looking at the tangle of tobacco in his hand he seemed to think it might perplex the thread of his narrative
he put it back again stuck his pipe in a buttonhole of his coat spread a hand on each knee and after turning an angry eye on the fire for a few silent moments looked round at us and said what follows
chapter xlii
dear boy and pips comrade
i am not agoing fur to tell you my life like a song or a storybook
but to give it you short and handy ill put it at once into a mouthful of english
in jail and out of jail in jail and out of jail in jail and out of jail
there youve got it
thats my life pretty much down to such times as i got shipped off arter pip stood my friend
ive been done everything to pretty wellexcept hanged
ive been locked up as much as a silver teakittle
ive been carted here and carted there and put out of this town and put out of that town and stuck in the stocks and whipped and worried and drove
ive no more notion where i was born than you haveif so much
i first become aware of myself down in essex a thieving turnips for my living
summun had run away from mea mana tinkerand hed took the fire with him and left me wery cold
i knowd my name to be magwitch chrisend abel
how did i know it
much as i knowd the birds names in the hedges to be chaffinch sparrer thrush
i might have thought it was all lies together only as the birds names come out true i supposed mine did
so fur as i could find there warnt a soul that see young abel magwitch with us little on him as in him but wot caught fright at him and either drove him off or took him up
i was took up took up took up to that extent that i reglarly growd up took up
this is the way it was that when i was a ragged little creetur as much to be pitied as ever i see not that i looked in the glass for there warnt many insides of furnished houses known to me i got the name of being hardened
this is a terrible hardened one they says to prison wisitors picking out me
may be said to live in jails this boy then they looked at me and i looked at them and they measured my head some on emthey had better a measured my stomachand others on em giv me tracts what i couldnt read and made me speeches what i couldnt understand
they always went on agen me about the devil
but what the devil was i to do
i must put something into my stomach mustnt ihowsomever im a getting low and i know whats due
dear boy and pips comrade dont you be afeerd of me being low
tramping begging thieving working sometimes when i couldthough that warnt as often as you may think till you put the question whether you would ha been overready to give me work yourselvesa bit of a poacher a bit of a labourer a bit of a wagoner a bit of a haymaker a bit of a hawker a bit of most things that dont pay and lead to trouble i got to be a man
a deserting soldier in a travellers rest what lay hid up to the chin under a lot of taturs learnt me to read and a travelling giant what signed his name at a penny a time learnt me to write
i warnt locked up as often now as formerly but i wore out my good share of keymetal still
at epsom races a matter of over twenty years ago i got acquainted wi a man whose skull id crack wi this poker like the claw of a lobster if id got it on this hob
his right name was compeyson and thats the man dear boy what you see me a pounding in the ditch according to what you truly told your comrade arter i was gone last night
he set up fur a gentleman this compeyson and hed been to a public boardingschool and had learning
he was a smooth one to talk and was a dab at the ways of gentlefolks
he was goodlooking too
it was the night afore the great race when i found him on the heath in a booth that i knowd on
him and some more was a sitting among the tables when i went in and the landlord which had a knowledge of me and was a sporting one called him out and said i think this is a man that might suit youmeaning i was
compeyson he looks at me very noticing and i look at him
he has a watch and a chain and a ring and a breastpin and a handsome suit of clothes
to judge from appearances youre out of luck says compeyson to me
yes master and ive never been in it much i had come out of kingston jail last on a vagrancy committal
not but what it might have been for something else but it warnt
luck changes says compeyson perhaps yours is going to change i says i hope it may be so
theres room what can you do says compeyson
eat and drink i says if youll find the materials compeyson laughed looked at me again very noticing giv me five shillings and appointed me for next night
same place
i went to compeyson next night same place and compeyson took me on to be his man and pardner
and what was compeysons business in which we was to go pardners
compeysons business was the swindling handwriting forging stolen banknote passing and suchlike
all sorts of traps as compeyson could set with his head and keep his own legs out of and get the profits from and let another man in for was compeysons business
hed no more heart than a iron file he was as cold as death and he had the head of the devil afore mentioned
there was another in with compeyson as was called arthurnot as being so chrisend but as a surname
he was in a decline and was a shadow to look at
him and compeyson had been in a bad thing with a rich lady some years afore and theyd made a pot of money by it but compeyson betted and gamed and hed have run through the kings taxes
so arthur was a dying and a dying poor and with the horrors on him and compeysons wife which compeyson kicked mostly was a having pity on him when she could and compeyson was a having pity on nothing and nobody
i might a took warning by arthur but i didnt and i wont pretend i was particklerfor where ud be the good on it dear boy and comrade
so i begun wi compeyson and a poor tool i was in his hands
arthur lived at the top of compeysons house over nigh brentford it was and compeyson kept a careful account agen him for board and lodging in case he should ever get better to work it out
but arthur soon settled the account
the second or third time as ever i see him he come a tearing down into compeysons parlour late at night in only a flannel gown with his hair all in a sweat and he says to compeysons wife sally she really is upstairs alonger me now and i cant get rid of her
shes all in white he says wi white flowers in her hair and shes awful mad and shes got a shroud hanging over her arm and she says shell put it on me at five in the morning says compeyson why you fool dont you know shes got a living body
and how should she be up there without coming through the door or in at the window and up the stairs i dont know how shes there says arthur shivering dreadful with the horrors but shes standing in the corner at the foot of the bed awful mad
and over where her hearts brokeyou broke ittheres drops of blood compeyson spoke hardy but he was always a coward
go up alonger this drivelling sick man he says to his wife and magwitch lend her a hand will you but he never come nigh himself
compeysons wife and me took him up to bed agen and he raved most dreadful
why look at her he cries out
shes a shaking the shroud at me
dont you see her
look at her eyes
aint it awful to see her so mad next he cries shell put it on me and then im done for
take it away from her take it away and then he catched hold of us and kep on a talking to her and answering of her till i half believed i see her myself
compeysons wife being used to him giv him some liquor to get the horrors off and by and by he quieted
o shes gone
has her keeper been for her he says
yes says compeysons wife
did you tell him to lock her and bar her in yes and to take that ugly thing away from her yes yes all right youre a good creetur he says dont leave me whatever you do and thank you he rested pretty quiet till it might want a few minutes of five and then he starts up with a scream and screams out here she is
shes got the shroud again
shes unfolding it
shes coming out of the corner
shes coming to the bed
hold me both on youone of each sidedont let her touch me with it
hah
she missed me that time
dont let her throw it over my shoulders
dont let her lift me up to get it round me
shes lifting me up
keep me down then he lifted himself up hard and was dead
compeyson took it easy as a good riddance for both sides
him and me was soon busy and first he swore me being ever artful on my own bookthis here little black book dear boy what i swore your comrade on
not to go into the things that compeyson planned and i donewhich ud take a weekill simply say to you dear boy and pips comrade that that man got me into such nets as made me his black slave
i was always in debt to him always under his thumb always a working always a getting into danger
he was younger than me but hed got craft and hed got learning and he overmatched me five hundred times told and no mercy
my missis as i had the hard time wistop though
i aint brought her in he looked about him in a confused way as if he had lost his place in the book of his remembrance and he turned his face to the fire and spread his hands broader on his knees and lifted them off and put them on again
there aint no need to go into it he said looking round once more
the time wi compeyson was amost as hard a time as ever i had that said alls said
did i tell you as i was tried alone for misdemeanor while with compeyson i answered no
well he said i was and got convicted
as to took up on suspicion that was twice or three times in the four or five year that it lasted but evidence was wanting
at last me and compeyson was both committed for felonyon a charge of putting stolen notes in circulationand there was other charges behind
compeyson says to me separate defences no communication and that was all
and i was so miserable poor that i sold all the clothes i had except what hung on my back afore i could get jaggers
when we was put in the dock i noticed first of all what a gentleman compeyson looked wi his curly hair and his black clothes and his white pockethandkercher and what a common sort of a wretch i looked
when the prosecution opened and the evidence was put short aforehand i noticed how heavy it all bore on me and how light on him
when the evidence was giv in the box i noticed how it was always me that had come forard and could be swore to how it was always me that the money had been paid to how it was always me that had seemed to work the thing and get the profit
but when the defence come on then i see the plan plainer for says the counsellor for compeyson my lord and gentlemen here you has afore you side by side two persons as your eyes can separate wide one the younger well brought up who will be spoke to as such one the elder ill brought up who will be spoke to as such one the younger seldom if ever seen in these here transactions and only suspected tother the elder always seen in em and always wi his guilt brought home
can you doubt if there is but one in it which is the one and if there is two in it which is much the worst one and suchlike
and when it come to character warnt it compeyson as had been to the school and warnt it his schoolfellows as was in this position and in that and warnt it him as had been knowd by witnesses in such clubs and societies and nowt to his disadvantage
and warnt it me as had been tried afore and as had been knowd up hill and down dale in bridewells and lockups
and when it come to speechmaking warnt it compeyson as could speak to em wi his face dropping every now and then into his white pockethandkercherah
and wi verses in his speech tooand warnt it me as could only say gentlemen this man at my side is a most precious rascal
and when the verdict come warnt it compeyson as was recommended to mercy on account of good character and bad company and giving up all the information he could agen me and warnt it me as got never a word but guilty
and when i says to compeyson once out of this court ill smash that face of yourn aint it compeyson as prays the judge to be protected and gets two turnkeys stood betwixt us
and when were sentenced aint it him as gets seven year and me fourteen and aint it him as the judge is sorry for because he might a done so well and aint it me as the judge perceives to be a old offender of wiolent passion likely to come to worse he had worked himself into a state of great excitement but he checked it took two or three short breaths swallowed as often and stretching out his hand towards me said in a reassuring manner i aint agoing to be low dear boy he had so heated himself that he took out his handkerchief and wiped his face and head and neck and hands before he could go on
illustration i had said to compeyson that id smash that face of his and i swore lord smash mine
to do it
we was in the same prisonship but i couldnt get at him for long though i tried
at last i come behind him and hit him on the cheek to turn him round and get a smashing one at him when i was seen and seized
the blackhole of that ship warnt a strong one to a judge of blackholes that could swim and dive
i escaped to the shore and i was a hiding among the graves there envying them as was in em and all over when i first see my boy he regarded me with a look of affection that made him almost abhorrent to me again though i had felt great pity for him
by my boy i was giv to understand as compeyson was out on them marshes too
upon my soul i half believe he escaped in his terror to get quit of me not knowing it was me as had got ashore
i hunted him down
i smashed his face
and now says i as the worst thing i can do caring nothing for myself ill drag you back and id have swum off towing him by the hair if it had come to that and id a got him aboard without the soldiers
of course hed much the best of it to the lasthis character was so good
he had escaped when he was made half wild by me and my murderous intentions and his punishment was light
i was put in irons brought to trial again and sent for life
i didnt stop for life dear boy and pips comrade being here he wiped himself again as he had done before and then slowly took his tangle of tobacco from his pocket and plucked his pipe from his buttonhole and slowly filled it and began to smoke
is he dead i asked after a silence
is who dead dear boy compeyson he hopes i am if hes alive you may be sure with a fierce look
i never heerd no more of him herbert had been writing with his pencil in the cover of a book
he softly pushed the book over to me as provis stood smoking with his eyes on the fire and i read in it young havishams name was arthur
compeyson is the man who professed to be miss havishams lover i shut the book and nodded slightly to herbert and put the book by but we neither of us said anything and both looked at provis as he stood smoking by the fire
chapter xliii
why should i pause to ask how much of my shrinking from provis might be traced to estella
why should i loiter on my road to compare the state of mind in which i had tried to rid myself of the stain of the prison before meeting her at the coachoffice with the state of mind in which i now reflected on the abyss between estella in her pride and beauty and the returned transport whom i harboured
the road would be none the smoother for it the end would be none the better for it he would not be helped nor i extenuated
a new fear had been engendered in my mind by his narrative or rather his narrative had given form and purpose to the fear that was already there
if compeyson were alive and should discover his return i could hardly doubt the consequence
that compeyson stood in mortal fear of him neither of the two could know much better than i and that any such man as that man had been described to be would hesitate to release himself for good from a dreaded enemy by the safe means of becoming an informer was scarcely to be imagined
never had i breathed and never would i breatheor so i resolveda word of estella to provis
but i said to herbert that before i could go abroad i must see both estella and miss havisham
this was when we were left alone on the night of the day when provis told us his story
i resolved to go out to richmond next day and i went
on my presenting myself at mrs brandleys estellas maid was called to tell that estella had gone into the country
where
to satis house as usual
not as usual i said for she had never yet gone there without me when was she coming back
there was an air of reservation in the answer which increased my perplexity and the answer was that her maid believed she was only coming back at all for a little while
i could make nothing of this except that it was meant that i should make nothing of it and i went home again in complete discomfiture
another night consultation with herbert after provis was gone home i always took him home and always looked well about me led us to the conclusion that nothing should be said about going abroad until i came back from miss havishams
in the mean time herbert and i were to consider separately what it would be best to say whether we should devise any pretence of being afraid that he was under suspicious observation or whether i who had never yet been abroad should propose an expedition
we both knew that i had but to propose anything and he would consent
we agreed that his remaining many days in his present hazard was not to be thought of
next day i had the meanness to feign that i was under a binding promise to go down to joe but i was capable of almost any meanness towards joe or his name
provis was to be strictly careful while i was gone and herbert was to take the charge of him that i had taken
i was to be absent only one night and on my return the gratification of his impatience for my starting as a gentleman on a greater scale was to be begun
it occurred to me then and as i afterwards found to herbert also that he might be best got away across the water on that pretenceas to make purchases or the like
having thus cleared the way for my expedition to miss havishams i set off by the early morning coach before it was yet light and was out on the open country road when the day came creeping on halting and whimpering and shivering and wrapped in patches of cloud and rags of mist like a beggar
when we drove up to the blue boar after a drizzly ride whom should i see come out under the gateway toothpick in hand to look at the coach but bentley drummle
as he pretended not to see me i pretended not to see him
it was a very lame pretence on both sides the lamer because we both went into the coffeeroom where he had just finished his breakfast and where i ordered mine
it was poisonous to me to see him in the town for i very well knew why he had come there
pretending to read a smeary newspaper long out of date which had nothing half so legible in its local news as the foreign matter of coffee pickles fish sauces gravy melted butter and wine with which it was sprinkled all over as if it had taken the measles in a highly irregular form i sat at my table while he stood before the fire
by degrees it became an enormous injury to me that he stood before the fire
and i got up determined to have my share of it
i had to put my hand behind his legs for the poker when i went up to the fireplace to stir the fire but still pretended not to know him
is this a cut said mr drummle
oh said i poker in hand its you is it
how do you do
i was wondering who it was who kept the fire off with that i poked tremendously and having done so planted myself side by side with mr drummle my shoulders squared and my back to the fire
you have just come down said mr drummle edging me a little away with his shoulder
yes said i edging him a little away with my shoulder
beastly place said drummle
your part of the country i think yes i assented
i am told its very like your shropshire not in the least like it said drummle
here mr drummle looked at his boots and i looked at mine and then mr drummle looked at my boots and i looked at his
have you been here long i asked determined not to yield an inch of the fire
long enough to be tired of it returned drummle pretending to yawn but equally determined
do you stay here long cant say answered mr drummle
do you cant say said i i felt here through a tingling in my blood that if mr drummles shoulder had claimed another hairs breadth of room i should have jerked him into the window equally that if my own shoulder had urged a similar claim mr drummle would have jerked me into the nearest box
he whistled a little
so did i
large tract of marshes about here i believe said drummle
yes
what of that said i mr drummle looked at me and then at my boots and then said oh and laughed
are you amused mr drummle no said he not particularly
i am going out for a ride in the saddle
i mean to explore those marshes for amusement
outoftheway villages there they tell me
curious little publichousesand smithiesand that
waiter yes sir is that horse of mine ready brought round to the door sir i say
look here you sir
the lady wont ride today the weather wont do very good sir and i dont dine because im going to dine at the ladys very good sir then drummle glanced at me with an insolent triumph on his greatjowled face that cut me to the heart dull as he was and so exasperated me that i felt inclined to take him in my arms as the robber in the storybook is said to have taken the old lady and seat him on the fire
one thing was manifest to both of us and that was that until relief came neither of us could relinquish the fire
there we stood well squared up before it shoulder to shoulder and foot to foot with our hands behind us not budging an inch
the horse was visible outside in the drizzle at the door my breakfast was put on the table drummles was cleared away the waiter invited me to begin i nodded we both stood our ground
have you been to the grove since said drummle
no said i i had quite enough of the finches the last time i was there was that when we had a difference of opinion yes i replied very shortly
come come
they let you off easily enough sneered drummle
you shouldnt have lost your temper mr
drummle said i you are not competent to give advice on that subject
when i lose my temper not that i admit having done so on that occasion i dont throw glasses i do said drummle
after glancing at him once or twice in an increased state of smouldering ferocity i said mr
drummle i did not seek this conversation and i dont think it an agreeable one i am sure its not said he superciliously over his shoulder i dont think anything about it and therefore i went on with your leave i will suggest that we hold no kind of communication in future quite my opinion said drummle and what i should have suggested myself or donemore likelywithout suggesting
but dont lose your temper
havent you lost enough without that what do you mean sir waiter said drummle by way of answering me
the waiter reappeared
look here you sir
you quite understand that the young lady dont ride today and that i dine at the young ladys quite so sir when the waiter had felt my fastcooling teapot with the palm of his hand and had looked imploringly at me and had gone out drummle careful not to move the shoulder next me took a cigar from his pocket and bit the end off but showed no sign of stirring
choking and boiling as i was i felt that we could not go a word further without introducing estellas name which i could not endure to hear him utter and therefore i looked stonily at the opposite wall as if there were no one present and forced myself to silence
how long we might have remained in this ridiculous position it is impossible to say but for the incursion of three thriving farmerslaid on by the waiter i thinkwho came into the coffeeroom unbuttoning their greatcoats and rubbing their hands and before whom as they charged at the fire we were obliged to give way
i saw him through the window seizing his horses mane and mounting in his blundering brutal manner and sidling and backing away
i thought he was gone when he came back calling for a light for the cigar in his mouth which he had forgotten
a man in a dustcoloured dress appeared with what was wantedi could not have said from where whether from the inn yard or the street or where notand as drummle leaned down from the saddle and lighted his cigar and laughed with a jerk of his head towards the coffeeroom windows the slouching shoulders and ragged hair of this man whose back was towards me reminded me of orlick
too heavily out of sorts to care much at the time whether it were he or no or after all to touch the breakfast i washed the weather and the journey from my face and hands and went out to the memorable old house that it would have been so much the better for me never to have entered never to have seen
chapter xliv
in the room where the dressingtable stood and where the waxcandles burnt on the wall i found miss havisham and estella miss havisham seated on a settee near the fire and estella on a cushion at her feet
estella was knitting and miss havisham was looking on
they both raised their eyes as i went in and both saw an alteration in me
i derived that from the look they interchanged
and what wind said miss havisham blows you here pip though she looked steadily at me i saw that she was rather confused
estella pausing a moment in her knitting with her eyes upon me and then going on i fancied that i read in the action of her fingers as plainly as if she had told me in the dumb alphabet that she perceived i had discovered my real benefactor
miss havisham said i i went to richmond yesterday to speak to estella and finding that some wind had blown her here i followed miss havisham motioning to me for the third or fourth time to sit down i took the chair by the dressingtable which i had often seen her occupy
with all that ruin at my feet and about me it seemed a natural place for me that day
what i had to say to estella miss havisham i will say before you presentlyin a few moments
it will not surprise you it will not displease you
i am as unhappy as you can ever have meant me to be miss havisham continued to look steadily at me
i could see in the action of estellas fingers as they worked that she attended to what i said but she did not look up
i have found out who my patron is
it is not a fortunate discovery and is not likely ever to enrich me in reputation station fortune anything
there are reasons why i must say no more of that
it is not my secret but anothers as i was silent for a while looking at estella and considering how to go on miss havisham repeated it is not your secret but anothers
well when you first caused me to be brought here miss havisham when i belonged to the village over yonder that i wish i had never left i suppose i did really come here as any other chance boy might have comeas a kind of servant to gratify a want or a whim and to be paid for it ay pip replied miss havisham steadily nodding her head you did and that mr jaggers mr
jaggers said miss havisham taking me up in a firm tone had nothing to do with it and knew nothing of it
his being my lawyer and his being the lawyer of your patron is a coincidence
he holds the same relation towards numbers of people and it might easily arise
be that as it may it did arise and was not brought about by any one any one might have seen in her haggard face that there was no suppression or evasion so far
but when i fell into the mistake i have so long remained in at least you led me on said i
yes she returned again nodding steadily i let you go on was that kind who am i cried miss havisham striking her stick upon the floor and flashing into wrath so suddenly that estella glanced up at her in surprisewho am i for gods sake that i should be kind it was a weak complaint to have made and i had not meant to make it
i told her so as she sat brooding after this outburst
well well well she said
what else i was liberally paid for my old attendance here i said to soothe her in being apprenticed and i have asked these questions only for my own information
what follows has another and i hope more disinterested purpose
in humouring my mistake miss havisham you punishedpractised onperhaps you will supply whatever term expresses your intention without offenceyour selfseeking relations i did
why they would have it so
so would you
what has been my history that i should be at the pains of entreating either them or you not to have it so
you made your own snares
i never made them waiting until she was quiet againfor this too flashed out of her in a wild and sudden wayi went on
i have been thrown among one family of your relations miss havisham and have been constantly among them since i went to london
i know them to have been as honestly under my delusion as i myself
and i should be false and base if i did not tell you whether it is acceptable to you or no and whether you are inclined to give credence to it or no that you deeply wrong both mr matthew pocket and his son herbert if you suppose them to be otherwise than generous upright open and incapable of anything designing or mean they are your friends said miss havisham
they made themselves my friends said i when they supposed me to have superseded them and when sarah pocket miss georgiana and mistress camilla were not my friends i think this contrasting of them with the rest seemed i was glad to see to do them good with her
she looked at me keenly for a little while and then said quietly what do you want for them only said i that you would not confound them with the others
they may be of the same blood but believe me they are not of the same nature still looking at me keenly miss havisham repeated what do you want for them i am not so cunning you see i said in answer conscious that i reddened a little as that i could hide from you even if i desired that i do want something
miss havisham if you would spare the money to do my friend herbert a lasting service in life but which from the nature of the case must be done without his knowledge i could show you how why must it be done without his knowledge she asked settling her hands upon her stick that she might regard me the more attentively
because said i i began the service myself more than two years ago without his knowledge and i dont want to be betrayed
why i fail in my ability to finish it i cannot explain
it is a part of the secret which is another persons and not mine she gradually withdrew her eyes from me and turned them on the fire
after watching it for what appeared in the silence and by the light of the slowly wasting candles to be a long time she was roused by the collapse of some of the red coals and looked towards me againat first vacantlythen with a gradually concentrating attention
all this time estella knitted on
when miss havisham had fixed her attention on me she said speaking as if there had been no lapse in our dialogue what else estella said i turning to her now and trying to command my trembling voice you know i love you
you know that i have loved you long and dearly she raised her eyes to my face on being thus addressed and her fingers plied their work and she looked at me with an unmoved countenance
i saw that miss havisham glanced from me to her and from her to me
i should have said this sooner but for my long mistake
it induced me to hope that miss havisham meant us for one another
while i thought you could not help yourself as it were i refrained from saying it
but i must say it now preserving her unmoved countenance and with her fingers still going estella shook her head
i know said i in answer to that actioni know
i have no hope that i shall ever call you mine estella
i am ignorant what may become of me very soon how poor i may be or where i may go
still i love you
i have loved you ever since i first saw you in this house looking at me perfectly unmoved and with her fingers busy she shook her head again
it would have been cruel in miss havisham horribly cruel to practise on the susceptibility of a poor boy and to torture me through all these years with a vain hope and an idle pursuit if she had reflected on the gravity of what she did
but i think she did not
i think that in the endurance of her own trial she forgot mine estella i saw miss havisham put her hand to her heart and hold it there as she sat looking by turns at estella and at me
it seems said estella very calmly that there are sentiments fanciesi dont know how to call themwhich i am not able to comprehend
when you say you love me i know what you mean as a form of words but nothing more
you address nothing in my breast you touch nothing there
i dont care for what you say at all
i have tried to warn you of this now have i not i said in a miserable manner yes yes
but you would not be warned for you thought i did not mean it
now did you not think so i thought and hoped you could not mean it
you so young untried and beautiful estella
surely it is not in nature it is in my nature she returned
and then she added with a stress upon the words it is in the nature formed within me
i make a great difference between you and all other people when i say so much
i can do no more is it not true said i that bentley drummle is in town here and pursuing you it is quite true she replied referring to him with the indifference of utter contempt
that you encourage him and ride out with him and that he dines with you this very day she seemed a little surprised that i should know it but again replied quite true you cannot love him estella her fingers stopped for the first time as she retorted rather angrily what have i told you
do you still think in spite of it that i do not mean what i say you would never marry him estella she looked towards miss havisham and considered for a moment with her work in her hands
then she said why not tell you the truth
i am going to be married to him i dropped my face into my hands but was able to control myself better than i could have expected considering what agony it gave me to hear her say those words
when i raised my face again there was such a ghastly look upon miss havishams that it impressed me even in my passionate hurry and grief
estella dearest estella do not let miss havisham lead you into this fatal step
put me aside for everyou have done so i well knowbut bestow yourself on some worthier person than drummle
miss havisham gives you to him as the greatest slight and injury that could be done to the many far better men who admire you and to the few who truly love you
among those few there may be one who loves you even as dearly though he has not loved you as long as i
take him and i can bear it better for your sake my earnestness awoke a wonder in her that seemed as if it would have been touched with compassion if she could have rendered me at all intelligible to her own mind
i am going she said again in a gentler voice to be married to him
the preparations for my marriage are making and i shall be married soon
why do you injuriously introduce the name of my mother by adoption
it is my own act your own act estella to fling yourself away upon a brute on whom should i fling myself away she retorted with a smile
should i fling myself away upon the man who would the soonest feel if people do feel such things that i took nothing to him
there
it is done
i shall do well enough and so will my husband
as to leading me into what you call this fatal step miss havisham would have had me wait and not marry yet but i am tired of the life i have led which has very few charms for me and i am willing enough to change it
say no more
we shall never understand each other such a mean brute such a stupid brute i urged in despair
dont be afraid of my being a blessing to him said estella i shall not be that
come
here is my hand
do we part on this you visionary boyor man o estella i answered as my bitter tears fell fast on her hand do what i would to restrain them even if i remained in england and could hold my head up with the rest how could i see you drummles wife nonsense she returnednonsense
this will pass in no time never estella you will get me out of your thoughts in a week out of my thoughts
you are part of my existence part of myself
you have been in every line i have ever read since i first came here the rough common boy whose poor heart you wounded even then
you have been in every prospect i have ever seen sinceon the river on the sails of the ships on the marshes in the clouds in the light in the darkness in the wind in the woods in the sea in the streets
you have been the embodiment of every graceful fancy that my mind has ever become acquainted with
the stones of which the strongest london buildings are made are not more real or more impossible to be displaced by your hands than your presence and influence have been to me there and everywhere and will be
estella to the last hour of my life you cannot choose but remain part of my character part of the little good in me part of the evil
but in this separation i associate you only with the good and i will faithfully hold you to that always for you must have done me far more good than harm let me feel now what sharp distress i may
o god bless you god forgive you in what ecstasy of unhappiness i got these broken words out of myself i dont know
the rhapsody welled up within me like blood from an inward wound and gushed out
i held her hand to my lips some lingering moments and so i left her
but ever afterwards i rememberedand soon afterwards with stronger reasonthat while estella looked at me merely with incredulous wonder the spectral figure of miss havisham her hand still covering her heart seemed all resolved into a ghastly stare of pity and remorse
all done all gone
so much was done and gone that when i went out at the gate the light of the day seemed of a darker colour than when i went in
for a while i hid myself among some lanes and bypaths and then struck off to walk all the way to london
for i had by that time come to myself so far as to consider that i could not go back to the inn and see drummle there that i could not bear to sit upon the coach and be spoken to that i could do nothing half so good for myself as tire myself out
it was past midnight when i crossed london bridge
pursuing the narrow intricacies of the streets which at that time tended westward near the middlesex shore of the river my readiest access to the temple was close by the riverside through whitefriars
i was not expected till tomorrow but i had my keys and if herbert were gone to bed could get to bed myself without disturbing him
as it seldom happened that i came in at that whitefriars gate after the temple was closed and as i was very muddy and weary i did not take it ill that the nightporter examined me with much attention as he held the gate a little way open for me to pass in
to help his memory i mentioned my name
i was not quite sure sir but i thought so
heres a note sir
the messenger that brought it said would you be so good as read it by my lantern illustration much surprised by the request i took the note
it was directed to philip pip esquire and on the top of the superscription were the words please read this here i opened it the watchman holding up his light and read inside in wemmicks writing dont go home chapter xlv
turning from the temple gate as soon as i had read the warning i made the best of my way to fleet street and there got a late hackney chariot and drove to the hummums in covent garden
in those times a bed was always to be got there at any hour of the night and the chamberlain letting me in at his ready wicket lighted the candle next in order on his shelf and showed me straight into the bedroom next in order on his list
it was a sort of vault on the ground floor at the back with a despotic monster of a fourpost bedstead in it straddling over the whole place putting one of his arbitrary legs into the fireplace and another into the doorway and squeezing the wretched little washingstand in quite a divinely righteous manner
as i had asked for a nightlight the chamberlain had brought me in before he left me the good old constitutional rushlight of those virtuous daysan object like the ghost of a walkingcane which instantly broke its back if it were touched which nothing could ever be lighted at and which was placed in solitary confinement at the bottom of a high tin tower perforated with round holes that made a staringly wideawake pattern on the walls
when i had got into bed and lay there footsore weary and wretched i found that i could no more close my own eyes than i could close the eyes of this foolish argus
and thus in the gloom and death of the night we stared at one another
what a doleful night
how anxious how dismal how long
there was an inhospitable smell in the room of cold soot and hot dust and as i looked up into the corners of the tester over my head i thought what a number of bluebottle flies from the butchers and earwigs from the market and grubs from the country must be holding on up there lying by for next summer
this led me to speculate whether any of them ever tumbled down and then i fancied that i felt light falls on my facea disagreeable turn of thought suggesting other and more objectionable approaches up my back
when i had lain awake a little while those extraordinary voices with which silence teems began to make themselves audible
the closet whispered the fireplace sighed the little washingstand ticked and one guitarstring played occasionally in the chest of drawers
at about the same time the eyes on the wall acquired a new expression and in every one of those staring rounds i saw written dont go home
whatever nightfancies and nightnoises crowded on me they never warded off this dont go home
it plaited itself into whatever i thought of as a bodily pain would have done
not long before i had read in the newspapers how a gentleman unknown had come to the hummums in the night and had gone to bed and had destroyed himself and had been found in the morning weltering in blood
it came into my head that he must have occupied this very vault of mine and i got out of bed to assure myself that there were no red marks about then opened the door to look out into the passages and cheer myself with the companionship of a distant light near which i knew the chamberlain to be dozing
but all this time why i was not to go home and what had happened at home and when i should go home and whether provis was safe at home were questions occupying my mind so busily that one might have supposed there could be no more room in it for any other theme
even when i thought of estella and how we had parted that day forever and when i recalled all the circumstances of our parting and all her looks and tones and the action of her fingers while she knittedeven then i was pursuing here and there and everywhere the caution dont go home
when at last i dozed in sheer exhaustion of mind and body it became a vast shadowy verb which i had to conjugate
imperative mood present tense do not thou go home let him not go home let us not go home do not ye or you go home let not them go home
then potentially i may not and i cannot go home and i might not could not would not and should not go home until i felt that i was going distracted and rolled over on the pillow and looked at the staring rounds upon the wall again
i had left directions that i was to be called at seven for it was plain that i must see wemmick before seeing any one else and equally plain that this was a case in which his walworth sentiments only could be taken
it was a relief to get out of the room where the night had been so miserable and i needed no second knocking at the door to startle me from my uneasy bed
the castle battlements arose upon my view at eight oclock
the little servant happening to be entering the fortress with two hot rolls i passed through the postern and crossed the drawbridge in her company and so came without announcement into the presence of wemmick as he was making tea for himself and the aged
an open door afforded a perspective view of the aged in bed
halloa mr pip said wemmick
you did come home then yes i returned but i didnt go home thats all right said he rubbing his hands
i left a note for you at each of the temple gates on the chance
which gate did you come to i told him
ill go round to the others in the course of the day and destroy the notes said wemmick its a good rule never to leave documentary evidence if you can help it because you dont know when it may be put in
im going to take a liberty with you
would you mind toasting this sausage for the aged p i said i should be delighted to do it
then you can go about your work mary anne said wemmick to the little servant which leaves us to ourselves dont you see mr pip he added winking as she disappeared
i thanked him for his friendship and caution and our discourse proceeded in a low tone while i toasted the ageds sausage and he buttered the crumb of the ageds roll
now mr pip you know said wemmick you and i understand one another
we are in our private and personal capacities and we have been engaged in a confidential transaction before today
official sentiments are one thing
we are extra official i cordially assented
i was so very nervous that i had already lighted the ageds sausage like a torch and been obliged to blow it out
i accidentally heard yesterday morning said wemmick being in a certain place where i once took youeven between you and me its as well not to mention names when avoidable much better not said i
i understand you i heard there by chance yesterday morning said wemmick that a certain person not altogether of uncolonial pursuits and not unpossessed of portable propertyi dont know who it may really bewe wont name this person not necessary said i
had made some little stir in a certain part of the world where a good many people go not always in gratification of their own inclinations and not quite irrespective of the government expense in watching his face i made quite a firework of the ageds sausage and greatly discomposed both my own attention and wemmicks for which i apologised
by disappearing from such place and being no more heard of thereabouts
from which said wemmick conjectures had been raised and theories formed
i also heard that you at your chambers in garden court temple had been watched and might be watched again by whom said i
i wouldnt go into that said wemmick evasively it might clash with official responsibilities
i heard it as i have in my time heard other curious things in the same place
i dont tell it you on information received
i heard it he took the toastingfork and sausage from me as he spoke and set forth the ageds breakfast neatly on a little tray
previous to placing it before him he went into the ageds room with a clean white cloth and tied the same under the old gentlemans chin and propped him up and put his nightcap on one side and gave him quite a rakish air
then he placed his breakfast before him with great care and said all right aint you aged p to which the cheerful aged replied all right john my boy all right as there seemed to be a tacit understanding that the aged was not in a presentable state and was therefore to be considered invisible i made a pretence of being in complete ignorance of these proceedings
this watching of me at my chambers which i have once had reason to suspect i said to wemmick when he came back is inseparable from the person to whom you have adverted is it wemmick looked very serious
i couldnt undertake to say that of my own knowledge
i mean i couldnt undertake to say it was at first
but it either is or it will be or its in great danger of being as i saw that he was restrained by fealty to little britain from saying as much as he could and as i knew with thankfulness to him how far out of his way he went to say what he did i could not press him
but i told him after a little meditation over the fire that i would like to ask him a question subject to his answering or not answering as he deemed right and sure that his course would be right
he paused in his breakfast and crossing his arms and pinching his shirtsleeves his notion of indoor comfort was to sit without any coat he nodded to me once to put my question
you have heard of a man of bad character whose true name is compeyson he answered with one other nod
is he living one other nod
is he in london he gave me one other nod compressed the postoffice exceedingly gave me one last nod and went on with his breakfast
now said wemmick questioning being over which he emphasised and repeated for my guidance i come to what i did after hearing what i heard
i went to garden court to find you not finding you i went to clarrikers to find mr herbert and him you found said i with great anxiety
and him i found
without mentioning any names or going into any details i gave him to understand that if he was aware of anybodytom jack or richardbeing about the chambers or about the immediate neighbourhood he had better get tom jack or richard out of the way while you were out of the way he would be greatly puzzled what to do he was puzzled what to do not the less because i gave him my opinion that it was not safe to try to get tom jack or richard too far out of the way at present
mr pip ill tell you something
under existing circumstances there is no place like a great city when you are once in it
dont break cover too soon
lie close
wait till things slacken before you try the open even for foreign air i thanked him for his valuable advice and asked him what herbert had done
mr
herbert said wemmick after being all of a heap for half an hour struck out a plan
he mentioned to me as a secret that he is courting a young lady who has as no doubt you are aware a bedridden pa
which pa having been in the purser line of life lies abed in a bowwindow where he can see the ships sail up and down the river
you are acquainted with the young lady most probably not personally said i
the truth was that she had objected to me as an expensive companion who did herbert no good and that when herbert had first proposed to present me to her she had received the proposal with such very moderate warmth that herbert had felt himself obliged to confide the state of the case to me with a view to the lapse of a little time before i made her acquaintance
when i had begun to advance herberts prospects by stealth i had been able to bear this with cheerful philosophy he and his affianced for their part had naturally not been very anxious to introduce a third person into their interviews and thus although i was assured that i had risen in claras esteem and although the young lady and i had long regularly interchanged messages and remembrances by herbert i had never seen her
however i did not trouble wemmick with these particulars
the house with the bowwindow said wemmick being by the riverside down the pool there between limehouse and greenwich and being kept it seems by a very respectable widow who has a furnished upper floor to let mr herbert put it to me what did i think of that as a temporary tenement for tom jack or richard
now i thought very well of it for three reasons ill give you
that is to say firstly
its altogether out of all your beats and is well away from the usual heap of streets great and small
secondly
without going near it yourself you could always hear of the safety of tom jack or richard through mr herbert
thirdly
after a while and when it might be prudent if you should want to slip tom jack or richard on board a foreign packetboat there he isready much comforted by these considerations i thanked wemmick again and again and begged him to proceed
well sir
mr herbert threw himself into the business with a will and by nine oclock last night he housed tom jack or richardwhichever it may beyou and i dont want to knowquite successfully
at the old lodgings it was understood that he was summoned to dover and in fact he was taken down the dover road and cornered out of it
now another great advantage of all this is that it was done without you and when if any one was concerning himself about your movements you must be known to be ever so many miles off and quite otherwise engaged
this diverts suspicion and confuses it and for the same reason i recommended that even if you came back last night you should not go home
it brings in more confusion and you want confusion wemmick having finished his breakfast here looked at his watch and began to get his coat on
and now mr pip said he with his hands still in the sleeves i have probably done the most i can do but if i can ever do morefrom a walworth point of view and in a strictly private and personal capacityi shall be glad to do it
heres the address
there can be no harm in your going here tonight and seeing for yourself that all is well with tom jack or richard before you go homewhich is another reason for your not going home last night
but after you have gone home dont go back here
you are very welcome i am sure mr pip his hands were now out of his sleeves and i was shaking them and let me finally impress one important point upon you he laid his hands upon my shoulders and added in a solemn whisper avail yourself of this evening to lay hold of his portable property
you dont know what may happen to him
dont let anything happen to the portable property quite despairing of making my mind clear to wemmick on this point i forbore to try
times up said wemmick and i must be off
if you had nothing more pressing to do than to keep here till dark thats what i should advise
you look very much worried and it would do you good to have a perfectly quiet day with the agedhell be up presentlyand a little bit ofyou remember the pig of course said i
well and a little bit of him
that sausage you toasted was his and he was in all respects a firstrater
do try him if it is only for old acquaintance sake
goodbye aged parent in a cheery shout
all right john all right my boy piped the old man from within
i soon fell asleep before wemmicks fire and the aged and i enjoyed one anothers society by falling asleep before it more or less all day
we had loin of pork for dinner and greens grown on the estate and i nodded at the aged with a good intention whenever i failed to do it drowsily
when it was quite dark i left the aged preparing the fire for toast and i inferred from the number of teacups as well as from his glances at the two little doors in the wall that miss skiffins was expected
chapter xlvi
eight oclock had struck before i got into the air that was scented not disagreeably by the chips and shavings of the longshore boatbuilders and mast oar and block makers
all that waterside region of the upper and lower pool below bridge was unknown ground to me and when i struck down by the river i found that the spot i wanted was not where i had supposed it to be and was anything but easy to find
it was called mill pond bank chinkss basin and i had no other guide to chinkss basin than the old green copper ropewalk
it matters not what stranded ships repairing in dry docks i lost myself among what old hulls of ships in course of being knocked to pieces what ooze and slime and other dregs of tide what yards of shipbuilders and shipbreakers what rusty anchors blindly biting into the ground though for years off duty what mountainous country of accumulated casks and timber how many ropewalks that were not the old green copper
after several times falling short of my destination and as often overshooting it i came unexpectedly round a corner upon mill pond bank
it was a fresh kind of place all circumstances considered where the wind from the river had room to turn itself round and there were two or three trees in it and there was the stump of a ruined windmill and there was the old green copper ropewalkwhose long and narrow vista i could trace in the moonlight along a series of wooden frames set in the ground that looked like superannuated haymakingrakes which had grown old and lost most of their teeth
selecting from the few queer houses upon mill pond bank a house with a wooden front and three stories of bowwindow not baywindow which is another thing i looked at the plate upon the door and read there mrs whimple
that being the name i wanted i knocked and an elderly woman of a pleasant and thriving appearance responded
she was immediately deposed however by herbert who silently led me into the parlour and shut the door
it was an odd sensation to see his very familiar face established quite at home in that very unfamiliar room and region and i found myself looking at him much as i looked at the cornercupboard with the glass and china the shells upon the chimneypiece and the coloured engravings on the wall representing the death of captain cook a shiplaunch and his majesty king george the third in a state coachmans wig leatherbreeches and topboots on the terrace at windsor
all is well handel said herbert and he is quite satisfied though eager to see you
my dear girl is with her father and if youll wait till she comes down ill make you known to her and then well go upstairs
thats her father i had become aware of an alarming growling overhead and had probably expressed the fact in my countenance
i am afraid he is a sad old rascal said herbert smiling but i have never seen him
dont you smell rum
he is always at it at rum said i
yes returned herbert and you may suppose how mild it makes his gout
he persists too in keeping all the provisions upstairs in his room and serving them out
he keeps them on shelves over his head and will weigh them all
his room must be like a chandlers shop while he thus spoke the growling noise became a prolonged roar and then died away
what else can be the consequence said herbert in explanation if he will cut the cheese
a man with the gout in his right handand everywhere elsecant expect to get through a double gloucester without hurting himself he seemed to have hurt himself very much for he gave another furious roar
to have provis for an upper lodger is quite a godsend to mrs whimple said herbert for of course people in general wont stand that noise
a curious place handel isnt it it was a curious place indeed but remarkably well kept and clean
mrs
whimple said herbert when i told him so is the best of housewives and i really do not know what my clara would do without her motherly help
for clara has no mother of her own handel and no relation in the world but old gruffandgrim surely thats not his name herbert no no said herbert thats my name for him
his name is mr
barley
but what a blessing it is for the son of my father and mother to love a girl who has no relations and who can never bother herself or anybody else about her family herbert had told me on former occasions and now reminded me that he first knew miss clara barley when she was completing her education at an establishment at hammersmith and that on her being recalled home to nurse her father he and she had confided their affection to the motherly mrs whimple by whom it had been fostered and regulated with equal kindness and discretion ever since
it was understood that nothing of a tender nature could possibly be confided to old barley by reason of his being totally unequal to the consideration of any subject more psychological than gout rum and pursers stores
as we were thus conversing in a low tone while old barleys sustained growl vibrated in the beam that crossed the ceiling the room door opened and a very pretty slight darkeyed girl of twenty or so came in with a basket in her hand whom herbert tenderly relieved of the basket and presented blushing as clara she really was a most charming girl and might have passed for a captive fairy whom that truculent ogre old barley had pressed into his service
look here said herbert showing me the basket with a compassionate and tender smile after we had talked a little heres poor claras supper served out every night
heres her allowance of bread and heres her slice of cheese and heres her rumwhich i drink
this is mr barleys breakfast for tomorrow served out to be cooked
two muttonchops three potatoes some split peas a little flour two ounces of butter a pinch of salt and all this black pepper
its stewed up together and taken hot and its a nice thing for the gout i should think there was something so natural and winning in claras resigned way of looking at these stores in detail as herbert pointed them out and something so confiding loving and innocent in her modest manner of yielding herself to herberts embracing arm and something so gentle in her so much needing protection on mill pond bank by chinkss basin and the old green copper ropewalk with old barley growling in the beamthat i would not have undone the engagement between her and herbert for all the money in the pocketbook i had never opened
i was looking at her with pleasure and admiration when suddenly the growl swelled into a roar again and a frightful bumping noise was heard above as if a giant with a wooden leg were trying to bore it through the ceiling to come at us
upon this clara said to herbert papa wants me darling and ran away
there is an unconscionable old shark for you said herbert
what do you suppose he wants now handel i dont know said i
something to drink thats it cried herbert as if i had made a guess of extraordinary merit
he keeps his grog ready mixed in a little tub on the table
wait a moment and youll hear clara lift him up to take some
there he goes another roar with a prolonged shake at the end
now said herbert as it was succeeded by silence hes drinking
now said herbert as the growl resounded in the beam once more hes down again on his back clara returned soon afterwards and herbert accompanied me upstairs to see our charge
as we passed mr barleys door he was heard hoarsely muttering within in a strain that rose and fell like wind the following refrain in which i substitute good wishes for something quite the reverse ahoy
bless your eyes heres old bill barley
heres old bill barley bless your eyes
heres old bill barley on the flat of his back by the lord
lying on the flat of his back like a drifting old dead flounder heres your old bill barley bless your eyes
ahoy
bless you in this strain of consolation herbert informed me the invisible barley would commune with himself by the day and night together often while it was light having at the same time one eye at a telescope which was fitted on his bed for the convenience of sweeping the river
in his two cabin rooms at the top of the house which were fresh and airy and in which mr
barley was less audible than below i found provis comfortably settled
he expressed no alarm and seemed to feel none that was worth mentioning but it struck me that he was softenedindefinably for i could not have said how and could never afterwards recall how when i tried but certainly
the opportunity that the days rest had given me for reflection had resulted in my fully determining to say nothing to him respecting compeyson
for anything i knew his animosity towards the man might otherwise lead to his seeking him out and rushing on his own destruction
therefore when herbert and i sat down with him by his fire i asked him first of all whether he relied on wemmicks judgment and sources of information
ay ay dear boy he answered with a grave nod jaggers knows then i have talked with wemmick said i and have come to tell you what caution he gave me and what advice this i did accurately with the reservation just mentioned and i told him how wemmick had heard in newgate prison whether from officers or prisoners i could not say that he was under some suspicion and that my chambers had been watched how wemmick had recommended his keeping close for a time and my keeping away from him and what wemmick had said about getting him abroad
i added that of course when the time came i should go with him or should follow close upon him as might be safest in wemmicks judgment
what was to follow that i did not touch upon neither indeed was i at all clear or comfortable about it in my own mind now that i saw him in that softer condition and in declared peril for my sake
as to altering my way of living by enlarging my expenses i put it to him whether in our present unsettled and difficult circumstances it would not be simply ridiculous if it were no worse
he could not deny this and indeed was very reasonable throughout
his coming back was a venture he said and he had always known it to be a venture
he would do nothing to make it a desperate venture and he had very little fear of his safety with such good help
herbert who had been looking at the fire and pondering here said that something had come into his thoughts arising out of wemmicks suggestion which it might be worth while to pursue
we are both good watermen handel and could take him down the river ourselves when the right time comes
no boat would then be hired for the purpose and no boatmen that would save at least a chance of suspicion and any chance is worth saving
never mind the season dont you think it might be a good thing if you began at once to keep a boat at the temple stairs and were in the habit of rowing up and down the river
you fall into that habit and then who notices or minds
do it twenty or fifty times and there is nothing special in your doing it the twentyfirst or fiftyfirst i liked this scheme and provis was quite elated by it
we agreed that it should be carried into execution and that provis should never recognise us if we came below bridge and rowed past mill pond bank
but we further agreed that he should pull down the blind in that part of his window which gave upon the east whenever he saw us and all was right
our conference being now ended and everything arranged i rose to go remarking to herbert that he and i had better not go home together and that i would take half an hours start of him
i dont like to leave you here i said to provis though i cannot doubt your being safer here than near me
goodbye dear boy he answered clasping my hands i dont know when we may meet again and i dont like goodbye
say goodnight goodnight
herbert will go regularly between us and when the time comes you may be certain i shall be ready
goodnight goodnight we thought it best that he should stay in his own rooms and we left him on the landing outside his door holding a light over the stairrail to light us downstairs
looking back at him i thought of the first night of his return when our positions were reversed and when i little supposed my heart could ever be as heavy and anxious at parting from him as it was now
old barley was growling and swearing when we repassed his door with no appearance of having ceased or of meaning to cease
when we got to the foot of the stairs i asked herbert whether he had preserved the name of provis
he replied certainly not and that the lodger was mr campbell
he also explained that the utmost known of mr campbell there was that he herbert had mr campbell consigned to him and felt a strong personal interest in his being well cared for and living a secluded life
so when we went into the parlour where mrs whimple and clara were seated at work i said nothing of my own interest in mr campbell but kept it to myself
when i had taken leave of the pretty gentle darkeyed girl and of the motherly woman who had not outlived her honest sympathy with a little affair of true love i felt as if the old green copper ropewalk had grown quite a different place
old barley might be as old as the hills and might swear like a whole field of troopers but there were redeeming youth and trust and hope enough in chinkss basin to fill it to overflowing
and then i thought of estella and of our parting and went home very sadly
all things were as quiet in the temple as ever i had seen them
the windows of the rooms on that side lately occupied by provis were dark and still and there was no lounger in garden court
i walked past the fountain twice or thrice before i descended the steps that were between me and my rooms but i was quite alone
herbert coming to my bedside when he came infor i went straight to bed dispirited and fatiguedmade the same report
opening one of the windows after that he looked out into the moonlight and told me that the pavement was as solemnly empty as the pavement of any cathedral at that same hour
next day i set myself to get the boat
it was soon done and the boat was brought round to the temple stairs and lay where i could reach her within a minute or two
then i began to go out as for training and practice sometimes alone sometimes with herbert
i was often out in cold rain and sleet but nobody took much note of me after i had been out a few times
at first i kept above blackfriars bridge but as the hours of the tide changed i took towards london bridge
it was old london bridge in those days and at certain states of the tide there was a race and fall of water there which gave it a bad reputation
but i knew well enough how to shoot the bridge after seeing it done and so began to row about among the shipping in the pool and down to erith
the first time i passed mill pond bank herbert and i were pulling a pair of oars and both in going and returning we saw the blind towards the east come down
herbert was rarely there less frequently than three times in a week and he never brought me a single word of intelligence that was at all alarming
still i knew that there was cause for alarm and i could not get rid of the notion of being watched
once received it is a haunting idea how many undesigning persons i suspected of watching me it would be hard to calculate
in short i was always full of fears for the rash man who was in hiding
herbert had sometimes said to me that he found it pleasant to stand at one of our windows after dark when the tide was running down and to think that it was flowing with everything it bore towards clara
but i thought with dread that it was flowing towards magwitch and that any black mark on its surface might be his pursuers going swiftly silently and surely to take him
chapter xlvii
some weeks passed without bringing any change
we waited for wemmick and he made no sign
if i had never known him out of little britain and had never enjoyed the privilege of being on a familiar footing at the castle i might have doubted him not so for a moment knowing him as i did
my worldly affairs began to wear a gloomy appearance and i was pressed for money by more than one creditor
even i myself began to know the want of money i mean of ready money in my own pocket and to relieve it by converting some easily spared articles of jewelery into cash
but i had quite determined that it would be a heartless fraud to take more money from my patron in the existing state of my uncertain thoughts and plans
therefore i had sent him the unopened pocketbook by herbert to hold in his own keeping and i felt a kind of satisfactionwhether it was a false kind or a true i hardly knowin not having profited by his generosity since his revelation of himself
as the time wore on an impression settled heavily upon me that estella was married
fearful of having it confirmed though it was all but a conviction i avoided the newspapers and begged herbert to whom i had confided the circumstances of our last interview never to speak of her to me
why i hoarded up this last wretched little rag of the robe of hope that was rent and given to the winds how do i know
why did you who read this commit that not dissimilar inconsistency of your own last year last month last week
it was an unhappy life that i lived and its one dominant anxiety towering over all its other anxieties like a high mountain above a range of mountains never disappeared from my view
still no new cause for fear arose
let me start from my bed as i would with the terror fresh upon me that he was discovered let me sit listening as i would with dread for herberts returning step at night lest it should be fleeter than ordinary and winged with evil newsfor all that and much more to like purpose the round of things went on
condemned to inaction and a state of constant restlessness and suspense i rowed about in my boat and waited waited waited as i best could
there were states of the tide when having been down the river i could not get back through the eddychafed arches and starlings of old london bridge then i left my boat at a wharf near the custom house to be brought up afterwards to the temple stairs
i was not averse to doing this as it served to make me and my boat a commoner incident among the waterside people there
from this slight occasion sprang two meetings that i have now to tell of
one afternoon late in the month of february i came ashore at the wharf at dusk
i had pulled down as far as greenwich with the ebb tide and had turned with the tide
it had been a fine bright day but had become foggy as the sun dropped and i had had to feel my way back among the shipping pretty carefully
both in going and returning i had seen the signal in his window all well
as it was a raw evening and i was cold i thought i would comfort myself with dinner at once and as i had hours of dejection and solitude before me if i went home to the temple i thought i would afterwards go to the play
the theatre where mr wopsle had achieved his questionable triumph was in that waterside neighbourhood it is nowhere now and to that theatre i resolved to go
i was aware that mr wopsle had not succeeded in reviving the drama but on the contrary had rather partaken of its decline
he had been ominously heard of through the playbills as a faithful black in connection with a little girl of noble birth and a monkey
and herbert had seen him as a predatory tartar of comic propensities with a face like a red brick and an outrageous hat all over bells
i dined at what herbert and i used to call a geographical chophouse where there were maps of the world in porterpot rims on every halfyard of the tablecloths and charts of gravy on every one of the knivesto this day there is scarcely a single chophouse within the lord mayors dominions which is not geographicaland wore out the time in dozing over crumbs staring at gas and baking in a hot blast of dinners
by and by i roused myself and went to the play
there i found a virtuous boatswain in his majestys servicea most excellent man though i could have wished his trousers not quite so tight in some places and not quite so loose in otherswho knocked all the little mens hats over their eyes though he was very generous and brave and who wouldnt hear of anybodys paying taxes though he was very patriotic
he had a bag of money in his pocket like a pudding in the cloth and on that property married a young person in bedfurniture with great rejoicings the whole population of portsmouth nine in number at the last census turning out on the beach to rub their own hands and shake everybody elses and sing fill fill a certain darkcomplexioned swab however who wouldnt fill or do anything else that was proposed to him and whose heart was openly stated by the boatswain to be as black as his figurehead proposed to two other swabs to get all mankind into difficulties which was so effectually done the swab family having considerable political influence that it took half the evening to set things right and then it was only brought about through an honest little grocer with a white hat black gaiters and red nose getting into a clock with a gridiron and listening and coming out and knocking everybody down from behind with the gridiron whom he couldnt confute with what he had overheard
this led to mr wopsles who had never been heard of before coming in with a star and garter on as a plenipotentiary of great power direct from the admiralty to say that the swabs were all to go to prison on the spot and that he had brought the boatswain down the union jack as a slight acknowledgment of his public services
the boatswain unmanned for the first time respectfully dried his eyes on the jack and then cheering up and addressing mr wopsle as your honour solicited permission to take him by the fin
mr wopsle conceding his fin with a gracious dignity was immediately shoved into a dusty corner while everybody danced a hornpipe and from that corner surveying the public with a discontented eye became aware of me
the second piece was the last new grand comic christmas pantomime in the first scene of which it pained me to suspect that i detected mr wopsle with red worsted legs under a highly magnified phosphoric countenance and a shock of red curtainfringe for his hair engaged in the manufacture of thunderbolts in a mine and displaying great cowardice when his gigantic master came home very hoarse to dinner
but he presently presented himself under worthier circumstances for the genius of youthful love being in want of assistanceon account of the parental brutality of an ignorant farmer who opposed the choice of his daughters heart by purposely falling upon the object in a floursack out of the firstfloor windowsummoned a sententious enchanter and he coming up from the antipodes rather unsteadily after an apparently violent journey proved to be mr wopsle in a highcrowned hat with a necromantic work in one volume under his arm
the business of this enchanter on earth being principally to be talked at sung at butted at danced at and flashed at with fires of various colours he had a good deal of time on his hands
and i observed with great surprise that he devoted it to staring in my direction as if he were lost in amazement
there was something so remarkable in the increasing glare of mr wopsles eye and he seemed to be turning so many things over in his mind and to grow so confused that i could not make it out
i sat thinking of it long after he had ascended to the clouds in a large watchcase and still i could not make it out
i was still thinking of it when i came out of the theatre an hour afterwards and found him waiting for me near the door
how do you do said i shaking hands with him as we turned down the street together
i saw that you saw me saw you mr pip he returned
yes of course i saw you
but who else was there who else it is the strangest thing said mr wopsle drifting into his lost look again and yet i could swear to him becoming alarmed i entreated mr wopsle to explain his meaning
whether i should have noticed him at first but for your being there said mr wopsle going on in the same lost way i cant be positive yet i think i should involuntarily i looked round me as i was accustomed to look round me when i went home for these mysterious words gave me a chill
oh
he cant be in sight said mr wopsle
he went out before i went off
i saw him go having the reason that i had for being suspicious i even suspected this poor actor
i mistrusted a design to entrap me into some admission
therefore i glanced at him as we walked on together but said nothing
i had a ridiculous fancy that he must be with you mr pip till i saw that you were quite unconscious of him sitting behind you there like a ghost my former chill crept over me again but i was resolved not to speak yet for it was quite consistent with his words that he might be set on to induce me to connect these references with provis
of course i was perfectly sure and safe that provis had not been there
i dare say you wonder at me mr pip indeed i see you do
but it is so very strange
youll hardly believe what i am going to tell you
i could hardly believe it myself if you told me indeed said i
no indeed
mr pip you remember in old times a certain christmas day when you were quite a child and i dined at gargerys and some soldiers came to the door to get a pair of handcuffs mended i remember it very well and you remember that there was a chase after two convicts and that we joined in it and that gargery took you on his back and that i took the lead and you kept up with me as well as you could i remember it all very well better than he thoughtexcept the last clause
and you remember that we came up with the two in a ditch and that there was a scuffle between them and that one of them had been severely handled and much mauled about the face by the other i see it all before me and that the soldiers lighted torches and put the two in the centre and that we went on to see the last of them over the black marshes with the torchlight shining on their facesi am particular about thatwith the torchlight shining on their faces when there was an outer ring of dark night all about us yes said i
i remember all that then mr pip one of those two prisoners sat behind you tonight
i saw him over your shoulder steady i thought
i asked him then which of the two do you suppose you saw the one who had been mauled he answered readily and ill swear i saw him
the more i think of him the more certain i am of him this is very curious said i with the best assumption i could put on of its being nothing more to me
very curious indeed i cannot exaggerate the enhanced disquiet into which this conversation threw me or the special and peculiar terror i felt at compeysons having been behind me like a ghost for if he had ever been out of my thoughts for a few moments together since the hiding had begun it was in those very moments when he was closest to me and to think that i should be so unconscious and off my guard after all my care was as if i had shut an avenue of a hundred doors to keep him out and then had found him at my elbow
i could not doubt either that he was there because i was there and that however slight an appearance of danger there might be about us danger was always near and active
i put such questions to mr wopsle as when did the man come in
he could not tell me that he saw me and over my shoulder he saw the man
it was not until he had seen him for some time that he began to identify him but he had from the first vaguely associated him with me and known him as somehow belonging to me in the old village time
how was he dressed
prosperously but not noticeably otherwise he thought in black
was his face at all disfigured
no he believed not
i believed not too for although in my brooding state i had taken no especial notice of the people behind me i thought it likely that a face at all disfigured would have attracted my attention
when mr wopsle had imparted to me all that he could recall or i extract and when i had treated him to a little appropriate refreshment after the fatigues of the evening we parted
it was between twelve and one oclock when i reached the temple and the gates were shut
no one was near me when i went in and went home
herbert had come in and we held a very serious council by the fire
but there was nothing to be done saving to communicate to wemmick what i had that night found out and to remind him that we waited for his hint
as i thought that i might compromise him if i went too often to the castle i made this communication by letter
i wrote it before i went to bed and went out and posted it and again no one was near me
herbert and i agreed that we could do nothing else but be very cautious
and we were very cautious indeedmore cautious than before if that were possibleand i for my part never went near chinkss basin except when i rowed by and then i only looked at mill pond bank as i looked at anything else
chapter xlviii
the second of the two meetings referred to in the last chapter occurred about a week after the first
i had again left my boat at the wharf below bridge the time was an hour earlier in the afternoon and undecided where to dine i had strolled up into cheapside and was strolling along it surely the most unsettled person in all the busy concourse when a large hand was laid upon my shoulder by some one overtaking me
it was mr jaggerss hand and he passed it through my arm
as we are going in the same direction pip we may walk together
where are you bound for for the temple i think said i
dont you know said mr jaggers
well i returned glad for once to get the better of him in crossexamination i do not know for i have not made up my mind you are going to dine said mr jaggers
you dont mind admitting that i suppose no i returned i dont mind admitting that and are not engaged i dont mind admitting also that i am not engaged then said mr jaggers come and dine with me i was going to excuse myself when he added wemmicks coming so i changed my excuse into an acceptancethe few words i had uttered serving for the beginning of eitherand we went along cheapside and slanted off to little britain while the lights were springing up brilliantly in the shop windows and the street lamplighters scarcely finding ground enough to plant their ladders on in the midst of the afternoons bustle were skipping up and down and running in and out opening more red eyes in the gathering fog than my rushlight tower at the hummums had opened white eyes in the ghostly wall
at the office in little britain there was the usual letterwriting handwashing candlesnuffing and safelocking that closed the business of the day
as i stood idle by mr jaggerss fire its rising and falling flame made the two casts on the shelf look as if they were playing a diabolical game at bopeep with me while the pair of coarse fat office candles that dimly lighted mr jaggers as he wrote in a corner were decorated with dirty windingsheets as if in remembrance of a host of hanged clients
we went to gerrard street all three together in a hackneycoach and as soon as we got there dinner was served
although i should not have thought of making in that place the most distant reference by so much as a look to wemmicks walworth sentiments yet i should have had no objection to catching his eye now and then in a friendly way
but it was not to be done
he turned his eyes on mr jaggers whenever he raised them from the table and was as dry and distant to me as if there were twin wemmicks and this was the wrong one
did you send that note of miss havishams to mr pip wemmick mr jaggers asked soon after we began dinner
no sir returned wemmick it was going by post when you brought mr pip into the office
here it is he handed it to his principal instead of to me
its a note of two lines pip said mr jaggers handing it on sent up to me by miss havisham on account of her not being sure of your address
she tells me that she wants to see you on a little matter of business you mentioned to her
youll go down yes said i casting my eyes over the note which was exactly in those terms
when do you think of going down i have an impending engagement said i glancing at wemmick who was putting fish into the postoffice that renders me rather uncertain of my time
at once i think if mr pip has the intention of going at once said wemmick to mr jaggers he neednt write an answer you know receiving this as an intimation that it was best not to delay i settled that i would go tomorrow and said so
wemmick drank a glass of wine and looked with a grimly satisfied air at mr jaggers but not at me
so pip
our friend the spider said mr jaggers has played his cards
he has won the pool it was as much as i could do to assent
hah
he is a promising fellowin his waybut he may not have it all his own way
the stronger will win in the end but the stronger has to be found out first
if he should turn to and beat her surely i interrupted with a burning face and heart you do not seriously think that he is scoundrel enough for that mr jaggers i didnt say so pip
i am putting a case
if he should turn to and beat her he may possibly get the strength on his side if it should be a question of intellect he certainly will not
it would be chance work to give an opinion how a fellow of that sort will turn out in such circumstances because its a tossup between two results may i ask what they are a fellow like our friend the spider answered mr jaggers either beats or cringes
he may cringe and growl or cringe and not growl but he either beats or cringes
ask wemmick his opinion either beats or cringes said wemmick not at all addressing himself to me
so heres to mrs bentley drummle said mr jaggers taking a decanter of choicer wine from his dumbwaiter and filling for each of us and for himself and may the question of supremacy be settled to the ladys satisfaction
to the satisfaction of the lady and the gentleman it never will be
now molly molly molly molly how slow you are today she was at his elbow when he addressed her putting a dish upon the table
as she withdrew her hands from it she fell back a step or two nervously muttering some excuse
and a certain action of her fingers as she spoke arrested my attention
whats the matter said mr jaggers
nothing
only the subject we were speaking of said i was rather painful to me the action of her fingers was like the action of knitting
she stood looking at her master not understanding whether she was free to go or whether he had more to say to her and would call her back if she did go
her look was very intent
surely i had seen exactly such eyes and such hands on a memorable occasion very lately
he dismissed her and she glided out of the room
but she remained before me as plainly as if she were still there
i looked at those hands i looked at those eyes i looked at that flowing hair and i compared them with other hands other eyes other hair that i knew of and with what those might be after twenty years of a brutal husband and a stormy life
i looked again at those hands and eyes of the housekeeper and thought of the inexplicable feeling that had come over me when i last walkednot alonein the ruined garden and through the deserted brewery
i thought how the same feeling had come back when i saw a face looking at me and a hand waving to me from a stagecoach window and how it had come back again and had flashed about me like lightning when i had passed in a carriagenot alonethrough a sudden glare of light in a dark street
i thought how one link of association had helped that identification in the theatre and how such a link wanting before had been riveted for me now when i had passed by a chance swift from estellas name to the fingers with their knitting action and the attentive eyes
and i felt absolutely certain that this woman was estellas mother
mr jaggers had seen me with estella and was not likely to have missed the sentiments i had been at no pains to conceal
he nodded when i said the subject was painful to me clapped me on the back put round the wine again and went on with his dinner
only twice more did the housekeeper reappear and then her stay in the room was very short and mr jaggers was sharp with her
but her hands were estellas hands and her eyes were estellas eyes and if she had reappeared a hundred times i could have been neither more sure nor less sure that my conviction was the truth
it was a dull evening for wemmick drew his wine when it came round quite as a matter of businessjust as he might have drawn his salary when that came roundand with his eyes on his chief sat in a state of perpetual readiness for crossexamination
as to the quantity of wine his postoffice was as indifferent and ready as any other postoffice for its quantity of letters
from my point of view he was the wrong twin all the time and only externally like the wemmick of walworth
we took our leave early and left together
even when we were groping among mr jaggerss stock of boots for our hats i felt that the right twin was on his way back and we had not gone half a dozen yards down gerrard street in the walworth direction before i found that i was walking arm in arm with the right twin and that the wrong twin had evaporated into the evening air
well said wemmick thats over
hes a wonderful man without his living likeness but i feel that i have to screw myself up when i dine with himand i dine more comfortably unscrewed i felt that this was a good statement of the case and told him so
wouldnt say it to anybody but yourself he answered
i know that what is said between you and me goes no further i asked him if he had ever seen miss havishams adopted daughter mrs bentley drummle
he said no
to avoid being too abrupt i then spoke of the aged and of miss skiffins
he looked rather sly when i mentioned miss skiffins and stopped in the street to blow his nose with a roll of the head and a flourish not quite free from latent boastfulness
wemmick said i do you remember telling me before i first went to mr jaggerss private house to notice that housekeeper did i he replied
ah i dare say i did
deuce take me he added suddenly i know i did
i find i am not quite unscrewed yet a wild beast tamed you called her and what do you call her the same
how did mr jaggers tame her wemmick thats his secret
she has been with him many a long year i wish you would tell me her story
i feel a particular interest in being acquainted with it
you know that what is said between you and me goes no further well wemmick replied i dont know her storythat is i dont know all of it
but what i do know ill tell you
we are in our private and personal capacities of course of course a score or so of years ago that woman was tried at the old bailey for murder and was acquitted
she was a very handsome young woman and i believe had some gypsy blood in her
anyhow it was hot enough when it was up as you may suppose but she was acquitted mr
jaggers was for her pursued wemmick with a look full of meaning and worked the case in a way quite astonishing
it was a desperate case and it was comparatively early days with him then and he worked it to general admiration in fact it may almost be said to have made him
he worked it himself at the policeoffice day after day for many days contending against even a committal and at the trial where he couldnt work it himself sat under counsel andevery one knewput in all the salt and pepper
the murdered person was a womana woman a good ten years older very much larger and very much stronger
it was a case of jealousy
they both led tramping lives and this woman in gerrard street here had been married very young over the broomstick as we say to a tramping man and was a perfect fury in point of jealousy
the murdered womanmore a match for the man certainly in point of yearswas found dead in a barn near hounslow heath
there had been a violent struggle perhaps a fight
she was bruised and scratched and torn and had been held by the throat at last and choked
now there was no reasonable evidence to implicate any person but this woman and on the improbabilities of her having been able to do it mr jaggers principally rested his case
you may be sure said wemmick touching me on the sleeve that he never dwelt upon the strength of her hands then though he sometimes does now i had told wemmick of his showing us her wrists that day of the dinner party
well sir wemmick went on it happenedhappened dont you seethat this woman was so very artfully dressed from the time of her apprehension that she looked much slighter than she really was in particular her sleeves are always remembered to have been so skilfully contrived that her arms had quite a delicate look
she had only a bruise or two about hernothing for a trampbut the backs of her hands were lacerated and the question was was it with fingernails
now mr jaggers showed that she had struggled through a great lot of brambles which were not as high as her face but which she could not have got through and kept her hands out of and bits of those brambles were actually found in her skin and put in evidence as well as the fact that the brambles in question were found on examination to have been broken through and to have little shreds of her dress and little spots of blood upon them here and there
but the boldest point he made was this it was attempted to be set up in proof of her jealousy that she was under strong suspicion of having at about the time of the murder frantically destroyed her child by this mansome three years oldto revenge herself upon him
mr jaggers worked that in this way we say these are not marks of fingernails but marks of brambles and we show you the brambles
you say they are marks of fingernails and you set up the hypothesis that she destroyed her child
you must accept all consequences of that hypothesis
for anything we know she may have destroyed her child and the child in clinging to her may have scratched her hands
what then
you are not trying her for the murder of her child why dont you
as to this case if you will have scratches we say that for anything we know you may have accounted for them assuming for the sake of argument that you have not invented them to sum up sir said wemmick mr
jaggers was altogether too many for the jury and they gave in has she been in his service ever since yes but not only that said wemmick she went into his service immediately after her acquittal tamed as she is now
she has since been taught one thing and another in the way of her duties but she was tamed from the beginning do you remember the sex of the child said to have been a girl you have nothing more to say to me tonight nothing
i got your letter and destroyed it
nothing we exchanged a cordial goodnight and i went home with new matter for my thoughts though with no relief from the old
chapter xlix
putting miss havishams note in my pocket that it might serve as my credentials for so soon reappearing at satis house in case her waywardness should lead her to express any surprise at seeing me i went down again by the coach next day
but i alighted at the halfway house and breakfasted there and walked the rest of the distance for i sought to get into the town quietly by the unfrequented ways and to leave it in the same manner
the best light of the day was gone when i passed along the quiet echoing courts behind the high street
the nooks of ruin where the old monks had once had their refectories and gardens and where the strong walls were now pressed into the service of humble sheds and stables were almost as silent as the old monks in their graves
the cathedral chimes had at once a sadder and a more remote sound to me as i hurried on avoiding observation than they had ever had before so the swell of the old organ was borne to my ears like funeral music and the rooks as they hovered about the grey tower and swung in the bare high trees of the priory garden seemed to call to me that the place was changed and that estella was gone out of it for ever
an elderly woman whom i had seen before as one of the servants who lived in the supplementary house across the back courtyard opened the gate
the lighted candle stood in the dark passage within as of old and i took it up and ascended the staircase alone
miss havisham was not in her own room but was in the larger room across the landing
looking in at the door after knocking in vain i saw her sitting on the hearth in a ragged chair close before and lost in the contemplation of the ashy fire
doing as i had often done i went in and stood touching the old chimneypiece where she could see me when she raised her eyes
there was an air of utter loneliness upon her that would have moved me to pity though she had wilfully done me a deeper injury than i could charge her with
as i stood compassionating her and thinking how in the progress of time i too had come to be a part of the wrecked fortunes of that house her eyes rested on me
she stared and said in a low voice is it real it is i pip
mr jaggers gave me your note yesterday and i have lost no time thank you
thank you as i brought another of the ragged chairs to the hearth and sat down i remarked a new expression on her face as if she were afraid of me
i want she said to pursue that subject you mentioned to me when you were last here and to show you that i am not all stone
but perhaps you can never believe now that there is anything human in my heart when i said some reassuring words she stretched out her tremulous right hand as though she was going to touch me but she recalled it again before i understood the action or knew how to receive it
you said speaking for your friend that you could tell me how to do something useful and good
something that you would like done is it not something that i would like done very much what is it i began explaining to her that secret history of the partnership
i had not got far into it when i judged from her looks that she was thinking in a discursive way of me rather than of what i said
it seemed to be so for when i stopped speaking many moments passed before she showed that she was conscious of the fact
do you break off she asked then with her former air of being afraid of me because you hate me too much to bear to speak to me no no i answered how can you think so miss havisham
i stopped because i thought you were not following what i said perhaps i was not she answered putting a hand to her head
begin again and let me look at something else
stay
now tell me she set her hand upon her stick in the resolute way that sometimes was habitual to her and looked at the fire with a strong expression of forcing herself to attend
i went on with my explanation and told her how i had hoped to complete the transaction out of my means but how in this i was disappointed
that part of the subject i reminded her involved matters which could form no part of my explanation for they were the weighty secrets of another
so said she assenting with her head but not looking at me
and how much money is wanting to complete the purchase i was rather afraid of stating it for it sounded a large sum
nine hundred pounds if i give you the money for this purpose will you keep my secret as you have kept your own quite as faithfully and your mind will be more at rest much more at rest are you very unhappy now she asked this question still without looking at me but in an unwonted tone of sympathy
i could not reply at the moment for my voice failed me
she put her left arm across the head of her stick and softly laid her forehead on it
i am far from happy miss havisham but i have other causes of disquiet than any you know of
they are the secrets i have mentioned after a little while she raised her head and looked at the fire again
it is noble in you to tell me that you have other causes of unhappiness
is it true too true can i only serve you pip by serving your friend
regarding that as done is there nothing i can do for you yourself nothing
i thank you for the question
i thank you even more for the tone of the question
but there is nothing she presently rose from her seat and looked about the blighted room for the means of writing
there were none there and she took from her pocket a yellow set of ivory tablets mounted in tarnished gold and wrote upon them with a pencil in a case of tarnished gold that hung from her neck
you are still on friendly terms with mr jaggers quite
i dined with him yesterday this is an authority to him to pay you that money to lay out at your irresponsible discretion for your friend
i keep no money here but if you would rather mr jaggers knew nothing of the matter i will send it to you thank you miss havisham i have not the least objection to receiving it from him she read me what she had written and it was direct and clear and evidently intended to absolve me from any suspicion of profiting by the receipt of the money
i took the tablets from her hand and it trembled again and it trembled more as she took off the chain to which the pencil was attached and put it in mine
all this she did without looking at me
my name is on the first leaf
if you can ever write under my name i forgive her though ever so long after my broken heart is dust pray do it o miss havisham said i i can do it now
there have been sore mistakes and my life has been a blind and thankless one and i want forgiveness and direction far too much to be bitter with you she turned her face to me for the first time since she had averted it and to my amazement i may even add to my terror dropped on her knees at my feet with her folded hands raised to me in the manner in which when her poor heart was young and fresh and whole they must often have been raised to heaven from her mothers side
to see her with her white hair and her worn face kneeling at my feet gave me a shock through all my frame
i entreated her to rise and got my arms about her to help her up but she only pressed that hand of mine which was nearest to her grasp and hung her head over it and wept
i had never seen her shed a tear before and in the hope that the relief might do her good i bent over her without speaking
she was not kneeling now but was down upon the ground
o she cried despairingly
what have i done
what have i done if you mean miss havisham what have you done to injure me let me answer
very little
i should have loved her under any circumstances
is she married yes it was a needless question for a new desolation in the desolate house had told me so
what have i done
what have i done she wrung her hands and crushed her white hair and returned to this cry over and over again
what have i done i knew not how to answer or how to comfort her
that she had done a grievous thing in taking an impressionable child to mould into the form that her wild resentment spurned affection and wounded pride found vengeance in i knew full well
but that in shutting out the light of day she had shut out infinitely more that in seclusion she had secluded herself from a thousand natural and healing influences that her mind brooding solitary had grown diseased as all minds do and must and will that reverse the appointed order of their maker i knew equally well
and could i look upon her without compassion seeing her punishment in the ruin she was in her profound unfitness for this earth on which she was placed in the vanity of sorrow which had become a master mania like the vanity of penitence the vanity of remorse the vanity of unworthiness and other monstrous vanities that have been curses in this world
until you spoke to her the other day and until i saw in you a lookingglass that showed me what i once felt myself i did not know what i had done
what have i done
what have i done and so again twenty fifty times over what had she done
miss havisham i said when her cry had died away you may dismiss me from your mind and conscience
but estella is a different case and if you can ever undo any scrap of what you have done amiss in keeping a part of her right nature away from her it will be better to do that than to bemoan the past through a hundred years yes yes i know it
but pipmy dear there was an earnest womanly compassion for me in her new affection
my dear
believe this when she first came to me i meant to save her from misery like my own
at first i meant no more well well said i
i hope so but as she grew and promised to be very beautiful i gradually did worse and with my praises and with my jewels and with my teachings and with this figure of myself always before her a warning to back and point my lessons i stole her heart away and put ice in its place better i could not help saying to have left her a natural heart even to be bruised or broken with that miss havisham looked distractedly at me for a while and then burst out again what had she done
if you knew all my story she pleaded you would have some compassion for me and a better understanding of me miss havisham i answered as delicately as i could i believe i may say that i do know your story and have known it ever since i first left this neighbourhood
it has inspired me with great commiseration and i hope i understand it and its influences
does what has passed between us give me any excuse for asking you a question relative to estella
not as she is but as she was when she first came here she was seated on the ground with her arms on the ragged chair and her head leaning on them
she looked full at me when i said this and replied go on whose child was estella she shook her head
you dont know she shook her head again
but mr jaggers brought her here or sent her here brought her here will you tell me how that came about she answered in a low whisper and with caution i had been shut up in these rooms a long time i dont know how long you know what time the clocks keep here when i told him that i wanted a little girl to rear and love and save from my fate
i had first seen him when i sent for him to lay this place waste for me having read of him in the newspapers before i and the world parted
he told me that he would look about him for such an orphan child
one night he brought her here asleep and i called her estella might i ask her age then two or three
she herself knows nothing but that she was left an orphan and i adopted her so convinced i was of that womans being her mother that i wanted no evidence to establish the fact in my own mind
but to any mind i thought the connection here was clear and straight
what more could i hope to do by prolonging the interview
i had succeeded on behalf of herbert miss havisham had told me all she knew of estella i had said and done what i could to ease her mind
no matter with what other words we parted we parted
twilight was closing in when i went downstairs into the natural air
i called to the woman who had opened the gate when i entered that i would not trouble her just yet but would walk round the place before leaving
for i had a presentiment that i should never be there again and i felt that the dying light was suited to my last view of it
by the wilderness of casks that i had walked on long ago and on which the rain of years had fallen since rotting them in many places and leaving miniature swamps and pools of water upon those that stood on end i made my way to the ruined garden
i went all round it round by the corner where herbert and i had fought our battle round by the paths where estella and i had walked
so cold so lonely so dreary all
taking the brewery on my way back i raised the rusty latch of a little door at the garden end of it and walked through
i was going out at the opposite doornot easy to open now for the damp wood had started and swelled and the hinges were yielding and the threshold was encumbered with a growth of funguswhen i turned my head to look back
a childish association revived with wonderful force in the moment of the slight action and i fancied that i saw miss havisham hanging to the beam
so strong was the impression that i stood under the beam shuddering from head to foot before i knew it was a fancythough to be sure i was there in an instant
the mournfulness of the place and time and the great terror of this illusion though it was but momentary caused me to feel an indescribable awe as i came out between the open wooden gates where i had once wrung my hair after estella had wrung my heart
passing on into the front courtyard i hesitated whether to call the woman to let me out at the locked gate of which she had the key or first to go upstairs and assure myself that miss havisham was as safe and well as i had left her
i took the latter course and went up
i looked into the room where i had left her and i saw her seated in the ragged chair upon the hearth close to the fire with her back towards me
in the moment when i was withdrawing my head to go quietly away i saw a great flaming light spring up
in the same moment i saw her running at me shrieking with a whirl of fire blazing all about her and soaring at least as many feet above her head as she was high
i had a doublecaped greatcoat on and over my arm another thick coat
that i got them off closed with her threw her down and got them over her that i dragged the great cloth from the table for the same purpose and with it dragged down the heap of rottenness in the midst and all the ugly things that sheltered there that we were on the ground struggling like desperate enemies and that the closer i covered her the more wildly she shrieked and tried to free herselfthat this occurred i knew through the result but not through anything i felt or thought or knew i did
i knew nothing until i knew that we were on the floor by the great table and that patches of tinder yet alight were floating in the smoky air which a moment ago had been her faded bridal dress
then i looked round and saw the disturbed beetles and spiders running away over the floor and the servants coming in with breathless cries at the door
i still held her forcibly down with all my strength like a prisoner who might escape and i doubt if i even knew who she was or why we had struggled or that she had been in flames or that the flames were out until i saw the patches of tinder that had been her garments no longer alight but falling in a black shower around us
she was insensible and i was afraid to have her moved or even touched
assistance was sent for and i held her until it came as if i unreasonably fancied i think i did that if i let her go the fire would break out again and consume her
when i got up on the surgeons coming to her with other aid i was astonished to see that both my hands were burnt for i had no knowledge of it through the sense of feeling
on examination it was pronounced that she had received serious hurts but that they of themselves were far from hopeless the danger lay mainly in the nervous shock
by the surgeons directions her bed was carried into that room and laid upon the great table which happened to be well suited to the dressing of her injuries
when i saw her again an hour afterwards she lay indeed where i had seen her strike her stick and had heard her say that she would lie one day
though every vestige of her dress was burnt as they told me she still had something of her old ghastly bridal appearance for they had covered her to the throat with white cottonwool and as she lay with a white sheet loosely overlying that the phantom air of something that had been and was changed was still upon her
i found on questioning the servants that estella was in paris and i got a promise from the surgeon that he would write to her by the next post
miss havishams family i took upon myself intending to communicate with mr matthew pocket only and leave him to do as he liked about informing the rest
this i did next day through herbert as soon as i returned to town
there was a stage that evening when she spoke collectedly of what had happened though with a certain terrible vivacity
towards midnight she began to wander in her speech and after that it gradually set in that she said innumerable times in a low solemn voice what have i done and then when she first came i meant to save her from misery like mine and then take the pencil and write under my name i forgive her she never changed the order of these three sentences but she sometimes left out a word in one or other of them never putting in another word but always leaving a blank and going on to the next word
as i could do no service there and as i had nearer home that pressing reason for anxiety and fear which even her wanderings could not drive out of my mind i decided in the course of the night that i would return by the early morning coach walking on a mile or so and being taken up clear of the town
at about six oclock of the morning therefore i leaned over her and touched her lips with mine just as they said not stopping for being touched take the pencil and write under my name i forgive her chapter l my hands had been dressed twice or thrice in the night and again in the morning
my left arm was a good deal burned to the elbow and less severely as high as the shoulder it was very painful but the flames had set in that direction and i felt thankful it was no worse
my right hand was not so badly burnt but that i could move the fingers
it was bandaged of course but much less inconveniently than my left hand and arm those i carried in a sling and i could only wear my coat like a cloak loose over my shoulders and fastened at the neck
my hair had been caught by the fire but not my head or face
when herbert had been down to hammersmith and seen his father he came back to me at our chambers and devoted the day to attending on me
he was the kindest of nurses and at stated times took off the bandages and steeped them in the cooling liquid that was kept ready and put them on again with a patient tenderness that i was deeply grateful for
at first as i lay quiet on the sofa i found it painfully difficult i might say impossible to get rid of the impression of the glare of the flames their hurry and noise and the fierce burning smell
if i dozed for a minute i was awakened by miss havishams cries and by her running at me with all that height of fire above her head
this pain of the mind was much harder to strive against than any bodily pain i suffered and herbert seeing that did his utmost to hold my attention engaged
neither of us spoke of the boat but we both thought of it
that was made apparent by our avoidance of the subject and by our agreeingwithout agreementto make my recovery of the use of my hands a question of so many hours not of so many weeks
my first question when i saw herbert had been of course whether all was well down the river
as he replied in the affirmative with perfect confidence and cheerfulness we did not resume the subject until the day was wearing away
but then as herbert changed the bandages more by the light of the fire than by the outer light he went back to it spontaneously
i sat with provis last night handel two good hours where was clara dear little thing said herbert
she was up and down with gruffandgrim all the evening
he was perpetually pegging at the floor the moment she left his sight
i doubt if he can hold out long though
what with rum and pepperand pepper and rumi should think his pegging must be nearly over and then you will be married herbert how can i take care of the dear child otherwiselay your arm out upon the back of the sofa my dear boy and ill sit down here and get the bandage off so gradually that you shall not know when it comes
i was speaking of provis
do you know handel he improves i said to you i thought he was softened when i last saw him so you did
and so he is
he was very communicative last night and told me more of his life
you remember his breaking off here about some woman that he had had great trouble withdid i hurt you i had started but not under his touch
his words had given me a start
i had forgotten that herbert but i remember it now you speak of it well
he went into that part of his life and a dark wild part it is
shall i tell you
or would it worry you just now tell me by all means
every word herbert bent forward to look at me more nearly as if my reply had been rather more hurried or more eager than he could quite account for
your head is cool he said touching it
quite said i
tell me what provis said my dear herbert it seems said herbert theres a bandage off most charmingly and now comes the cool onemakes you shrink at first my poor dear fellow dont it
but it will be comfortable presentlyit seems that the woman was a young woman and a jealous woman and a revengeful woman revengeful handel to the last degree to what last degree murderdoes it strike too cold on that sensitive place i dont feel it
how did she murder
whom did she murder why the deed may not have merited quite so terrible a name said herbert but she was tried for it and mr jaggers defended her and the reputation of that defence first made his name known to provis
it was another and a stronger woman who was the victim and there had been a strugglein a barn
who began it or how fair it was or how unfair may be doubtful but how it ended is certainly not doubtful for the victim was found throttled was the woman brought in guilty no she was acquittedmy poor handel i hurt you it is impossible to be gentler herbert
yes
what else this acquitted young woman and provis had a little child a little child of whom provis was exceedingly fond
on the evening of the very night when the object of her jealousy was strangled as i tell you the young woman presented herself before provis for one moment and swore that she would destroy the child which was in her possession and he should never see it again then she vanishedtheres the worst arm comfortably in the sling once more and now there remains but the right hand which is a far easier job
i can do it better by this light than by a stronger for my hand is steadiest when i dont see the poor blistered patches too distinctlyyou dont think your breathing is affected my dear boy
you seem to breathe quickly perhaps i do herbert
did the woman keep her oath there comes the darkest part of proviss life
she did that is he says she did why of course my dear boy returned herbert in a tone of surprise and again bending forward to get a nearer look at me
he says it all
i have no other information no to be sure now whether pursued herbert he had used the childs mother ill or whether he had used the childs mother well provis doesnt say but she had shared some four or five years of the wretched life he described to us at this fireside and he seems to have felt pity for her and forbearance towards her
therefore fearing he should be called upon to depose about this destroyed child and so be the cause of her death he hid himself much as he grieved for the child kept himself dark as he says out of the way and out of the trial and was only vaguely talked of as a certain man called abel out of whom the jealousy arose
after the acquittal she disappeared and thus he lost the child and the childs mother i want to ask a moment my dear boy and i have done
that evil genius compeyson the worst of scoundrels among many scoundrels knowing of his keeping out of the way at that time and of his reasons for doing so of course afterwards held the knowledge over his head as a means of keeping him poorer and working him harder
it was clear last night that this barbed the point of proviss animosity i want to know said i and particularly herbert whether he told you when this happened particularly
let me remember then what he said as to that
his expression was a round score o year ago and amost directly after i took up wi compeyson how old were you when you came upon him in the little churchyard i think in my seventh year ay
it had happened some three or four years then he said and you brought into his mind the little girl so tragically lost who would have been about your age herbert said i after a short silence in a hurried way can you see me best by the light of the window or the light of the fire by the firelight answered herbert coming close again
look at me i do look at you my dear boy touch me i do touch you my dear boy you are not afraid that i am in any fever or that my head is much disordered by the accident of last night nno my dear boy said herbert after taking time to examine me
you are rather excited but you are quite yourself i know i am quite myself
and the man we have in hiding down the river is estellas father chapter li
what purpose i had in view when i was hot on tracing out and proving estellas parentage i cannot say
it will presently be seen that the question was not before me in a distinct shape until it was put before me by a wiser head than my own
but when herbert and i had held our momentous conversation i was seized with a feverish conviction that i ought to hunt the matter downthat i ought not to let it rest but that i ought to see mr jaggers and come at the bare truth
i really do not know whether i felt that i did this for estellas sake or whether i was glad to transfer to the man in whose preservation i was so much concerned some rays of the romantic interest that had so long surrounded me
perhaps the latter possibility may be the nearer to the truth
any way i could scarcely be withheld from going out to gerrard street that night
herberts representations that if i did i should probably be laid up and stricken useless when our fugitives safety would depend upon me alone restrained my impatience
on the understanding again and again reiterated that come what would i was to go to mr jaggers tomorrow i at length submitted to keep quiet and to have my hurts looked after and to stay at home
early next morning we went out together and at the corner of giltspur street by smithfield i left herbert to go his way into the city and took my way to little britain
there were periodical occasions when mr jaggers and wemmick went over the office accounts and checked off the vouchers and put all things straight
on these occasions wemmick took his books and papers into mr jaggerss room and one of the upstairs clerks came down into the outer office
finding such clerk on wemmicks post that morning i knew what was going on but i was not sorry to have mr jaggers and wemmick together as wemmick would then hear for himself that i said nothing to compromise him
my appearance with my arm bandaged and my coat loose over my shoulders favoured my object
although i had sent mr jaggers a brief account of the accident as soon as i had arrived in town yet i had to give him all the details now and the speciality of the occasion caused our talk to be less dry and hard and less strictly regulated by the rules of evidence than it had been before
while i described the disaster mr jaggers stood according to his wont before the fire
wemmick leaned back in his chair staring at me with his hands in the pockets of his trousers and his pen put horizontally into the post
the two brutal casts always inseparable in my mind from the official proceedings seemed to be congestively considering whether they didnt smell fire at the present moment
my narrative finished and their questions exhausted i then produced miss havishams authority to receive the nine hundred pounds for herbert
mr jaggerss eyes retired a little deeper into his head when i handed him the tablets but he presently handed them over to wemmick with instructions to draw the check for his signature
while that was in course of being done i looked on at wemmick as he wrote and mr jaggers poising and swaying himself on his wellpolished boots looked on at me
i am sorry pip said he as i put the check in my pocket when he had signed it that we do nothing for you miss havisham was good enough to ask me i returned whether she could do nothing for me and i told her no everybody should know his own business said mr jaggers
and i saw wemmicks lips form the words portable property i should not have told her no if i had been you said mr jaggers but every man ought to know his own business best every mans business said wemmick rather reproachfully towards me is portable property as i thought the time was now come for pursuing the theme i had at heart i said turning on mr jaggers i did ask something of miss havisham however sir
i asked her to give me some information relative to her adopted daughter and she gave me all she possessed did she said mr jaggers bending forward to look at his boots and then straightening himself
hah
i dont think i should have done so if i had been miss havisham
but she ought to know her own business best i know more of the history of miss havishams adopted child than miss havisham herself does sir
i know her mother mr jaggers looked at me inquiringly and repeated mother i have seen her mother within these three days yes said mr jaggers
and so have you sir
and you have seen her still more recently yes said mr jaggers
perhaps i know more of estellas history than even you do said i
i know her father too a certain stop that mr jaggers came to in his mannerhe was too selfpossessed to change his manner but he could not help its being brought to an indefinably attentive stopassured me that he did not know who her father was
this i had strongly suspected from proviss account as herbert had repeated it of his having kept himself dark which i pieced on to the fact that he himself was not mr jaggerss client until some four years later and when he could have no reason for claiming his identity
but i could not be sure of this unconsciousness on mr jaggerss part before though i was quite sure of it now
so
you know the young ladys father pip said mr jaggers
yes i replied and his name is provisfrom new south wales even mr jaggers started when i said those words
it was the slightest start that could escape a man the most carefully repressed and the sooner checked but he did start though he made it a part of the action of taking out his pockethandkerchief
how wemmick received the announcement i am unable to say for i was afraid to look at him just then lest mr jaggerss sharpness should detect that there had been some communication unknown to him between us
and on what evidence pip asked mr jaggers very coolly as he paused with his handkerchief half way to his nose does provis make this claim he does not make it said i and has never made it and has no knowledge or belief that his daughter is in existence for once the powerful pockethandkerchief failed
my reply was so unexpected that mr jaggers put the handkerchief back into his pocket without completing the usual performance folded his arms and looked with stern attention at me though with an immovable face
then i told him all i knew and how i knew it with the one reservation that i left him to infer that i knew from miss havisham what i in fact knew from wemmick
i was very careful indeed as to that
nor did i look towards wemmick until i had finished all i had to tell and had been for some time silently meeting mr jaggerss look
when i did at last turn my eyes in wemmicks direction i found that he had unposted his pen and was intent upon the table before him
hah said mr jaggers at last as he moved towards the papers on the table
what item was it you were at wemmick when mr pip came in but i could not submit to be thrown off in that way and i made a passionate almost an indignant appeal to him to be more frank and manly with me
i reminded him of the false hopes into which i had lapsed the length of time they had lasted and the discovery i had made and i hinted at the danger that weighed upon my spirits
i represented myself as being surely worthy of some little confidence from him in return for the confidence i had just now imparted
i said that i did not blame him or suspect him or mistrust him but i wanted assurance of the truth from him
and if he asked me why i wanted it and why i thought i had any right to it i would tell him little as he cared for such poor dreams that i had loved estella dearly and long and that although i had lost her and must live a bereaved life whatever concerned her was still nearer and dearer to me than anything else in the world
and seeing that mr jaggers stood quite still and silent and apparently quite obdurate under this appeal i turned to wemmick and said wemmick i know you to be a man with a gentle heart
i have seen your pleasant home and your old father and all the innocent cheerful playful ways with which you refresh your business life
and i entreat you to say a word for me to mr jaggers and to represent to him that all circumstances considered he ought to be more open with me i have never seen two men look more oddly at one another than mr jaggers and wemmick did after this apostrophe
at first a misgiving crossed me that wemmick would be instantly dismissed from his employment but it melted as i saw mr jaggers relax into something like a smile and wemmick become bolder
whats all this said mr jaggers
you with an old father and you with pleasant and playful ways well returned wemmick
if i dont bring em here what does it matter pip said mr jaggers laying his hand upon my arm and smiling openly this man must be the most cunning impostor in all london not a bit of it returned wemmick growing bolder and bolder
i think youre another again they exchanged their former odd looks each apparently still distrustful that the other was taking him in
you with a pleasant home said mr jaggers
since it dont interfere with business returned wemmick let it be so
now i look at you sir i shouldnt wonder if you might be planning and contriving to have a pleasant home of your own one of these days when youre tired of all this work mr jaggers nodded his head retrospectively two or three times and actually drew a sigh
pip said he we wont talk about poor dreams you know more about such things than i having much fresher experience of that kind
but now about this other matter
ill put a case to you
mind
i admit nothing he waited for me to declare that i quite understood that he expressly said that he admitted nothing
now pip said mr jaggers put this case
put the case that a woman under such circumstances as you have mentioned held her child concealed and was obliged to communicate the fact to her legal adviser on his representing to her that he must know with an eye to the latitude of his defence how the fact stood about that child
put the case that at the same time he held a trust to find a child for an eccentric rich lady to adopt and bring up i follow you sir put the case that he lived in an atmosphere of evil and that all he saw of children was their being generated in great numbers for certain destruction
put the case that he often saw children solemnly tried at a criminal bar where they were held up to be seen put the case that he habitually knew of their being imprisoned whipped transported neglected cast out qualified in all ways for the hangman and growing up to be hanged
put the case that pretty nigh all the children he saw in his daily business life he had reason to look upon as so much spawn to develop into the fish that were to come to his netto be prosecuted defended forsworn made orphans bedevilled somehow i follow you sir put the case pip that here was one pretty little child out of the heap who could be saved whom the father believed dead and dared make no stir about as to whom over the mother the legal adviser had this power i know what you did and how you did it
you came so and so you did such and such things to divert suspicion
i have tracked you through it all and i tell it you all
part with the child unless it should be necessary to produce it to clear you and then it shall be produced
give the child into my hands and i will do my best to bring you off
if you are saved your child is saved too if you are lost your child is still saved put the case that this was done and that the woman was cleared i understand you perfectly but that i make no admissions that you make no admissions and wemmick repeated no admissions put the case pip that passion and the terror of death had a little shaken the womans intellects and that when she was set at liberty she was scared out of the ways of the world and went to him to be sheltered
put the case that he took her in and that he kept down the old wild violent nature whenever he saw an inkling of its breaking out by asserting his power over her in the old way
do you comprehend the imaginary case quite put the case that the child grew up and was married for money
that the mother was still living
that the father was still living
that the mother and father unknown to one another were dwelling within so many miles furlongs yards if you like of one another
that the secret was still a secret except that you had got wind of it
put that last case to yourself very carefully i do i ask wemmick to put it to himself very carefully and wemmick said i do for whose sake would you reveal the secret
for the fathers
i think he would not be much the better for the mother
for the mothers
i think if she had done such a deed she would be safer where she was
for the daughters
i think it would hardly serve her to establish her parentage for the information of her husband and to drag her back to disgrace after an escape of twenty years pretty secure to last for life
but add the case that you had loved her pip and had made her the subject of those poor dreams which have at one time or another been in the heads of more men than you think likely then i tell you that you had betterand would much sooner when you had thought well of itchop off that bandaged left hand of yours with your bandaged right hand and then pass the chopper on to wemmick there to cut that off too i looked at wemmick whose face was very grave
he gravely touched his lips with his forefinger
i did the same
mr jaggers did the same
now wemmick said the latter then resuming his usual manner what item was it you were at when mr pip came in standing by for a little while they were at work i observed that the odd looks they had cast at one another were repeated several times with this difference now that each of them seemed suspicious not to say conscious of having shown himself in a weak and unprofessional light to the other
for this reason i suppose they were now inflexible with one another mr jaggers being highly dictatorial and wemmick obstinately justifying himself whenever there was the smallest point in abeyance for a moment
i had never seen them on such ill terms for generally they got on very well indeed together
but they were both happily relieved by the opportune appearance of mike the client with the fur cap and the habit of wiping his nose on his sleeve whom i had seen on the very first day of my appearance within those walls
this individual who either in his own person or in that of some member of his family seemed to be always in trouble which in that place meant newgate called to announce that his eldest daughter was taken up on suspicion of shoplifting
as he imparted this melancholy circumstance to wemmick mr jaggers standing magisterially before the fire and taking no share in the proceedings mikes eye happened to twinkle with a tear
what are you about demanded wemmick with the utmost indignation
what do you come snivelling here for i didnt go to do it mr wemmick you did said wemmick
how dare you
youre not in a fit state to come here if you cant come here without spluttering like a bad pen
what do you mean by it a man cant help his feelings mr wemmick pleaded mike
his what demanded wemmick quite savagely
say that again now look here my man said mr jaggers advancing a step and pointing to the door
get out of this office
ill have no feelings here
get out it serves you right said wemmick get out so the unfortunate mike very humbly withdrew and mr jaggers and wemmick appeared to have reestablished their good understanding and went to work again with an air of refreshment upon them as if they had just had lunch
chapter lii
from little britain i went with my check in my pocket to miss skiffinss brother the accountant and miss skiffinss brother the accountant going straight to clarrikers and bringing clarriker to me i had the great satisfaction of concluding that arrangement
it was the only good thing i had done and the only completed thing i had done since i was first apprised of my great expectations
clarriker informing me on that occasion that the affairs of the house were steadily progressing that he would now be able to establish a small branchhouse in the east which was much wanted for the extension of the business and that herbert in his new partnership capacity would go out and take charge of it i found that i must have prepared for a separation from my friend even though my own affairs had been more settled
and now indeed i felt as if my last anchor were loosening its hold and i should soon be driving with the winds and waves
but there was recompense in the joy with which herbert would come home of a night and tell me of these changes little imagining that he told me no news and would sketch airy pictures of himself conducting clara barley to the land of the arabian nights and of me going out to join them with a caravan of camels i believe and of our all going up the nile and seeing wonders
without being sanguine as to my own part in those bright plans i felt that herberts way was clearing fast and that old bill barley had but to stick to his pepper and rum and his daughter would soon be happily provided for
we had now got into the month of march
my left arm though it presented no bad symptoms took in the natural course so long to heal that i was still unable to get a coat on
my right arm was tolerably restored disfigured but fairly serviceable
on a monday morning when herbert and i were at breakfast i received the following letter from wemmick by the post
walworth
burn this as soon as read
early in the week or say wednesday you might do what you know of if you felt disposed to try it
now burn when i had shown this to herbert and had put it in the firebut not before we had both got it by heartwe considered what to do
for of course my being disabled could now be no longer kept out of view
i have thought it over again and again said herbert and i think i know a better course than taking a thames waterman
take startop
a good fellow a skilled hand fond of us and enthusiastic and honourable i had thought of him more than once
but how much would you tell him herbert it is necessary to tell him very little
let him suppose it a mere freak but a secret one until the morning comes then let him know that there is urgent reason for your getting provis aboard and away
you go with him no doubt where it had seemed to me in the many anxious considerations i had given the point almost indifferent what port we made forhamburg rotterdam antwerpthe place signified little so that he was out of england
any foreign steamer that fell in our way and would take us up would do
i had always proposed to myself to get him well down the river in the boat certainly well beyond gravesend which was a critical place for search or inquiry if suspicion were afoot
as foreign steamers would leave london at about the time of highwater our plan would be to get down the river by a previous ebbtide and lie by in some quiet spot until we could pull off to one
the time when one would be due where we lay wherever that might be could be calculated pretty nearly if we made inquiries beforehand
herbert assented to all this and we went out immediately after breakfast to pursue our investigations
we found that a steamer for hamburg was likely to suit our purpose best and we directed our thoughts chiefly to that vessel
but we noted down what other foreign steamers would leave london with the same tide and we satisfied ourselves that we knew the build and colour of each
we then separated for a few hours i to get at once such passports as were necessary herbert to see startop at his lodgings
we both did what we had to do without any hindrance and when we met again at one oclock reported it done
i for my part was prepared with passports herbert had seen startop and he was more than ready to join
those two should pull a pair of oars we settled and i would steer our charge would be sitter and keep quiet as speed was not our object we should make way enough
we arranged that herbert should not come home to dinner before going to mill pond bank that evening that he should not go there at all tomorrow evening tuesday that he should prepare provis to come down to some stairs hard by the house on wednesday when he saw us approach and not sooner that all the arrangements with him should be concluded that monday night and that he should be communicated with no more in any way until we took him on board
these precautions well understood by both of us i went home
on opening the outer door of our chambers with my key i found a letter in the box directed to me a very dirty letter though not illwritten
it had been delivered by hand of course since i left home and its contents were these if you are not afraid to come to the old marshes tonight or tomorrow night at nine and to come to the little sluicehouse by the limekiln you had better come
if you want information regarding your uncle provis you had much better come and tell no one and lose no time
you must come alone
bring this with you i had had load enough upon my mind before the receipt of this strange letter
what to do now i could not tell
and the worst was that i must decide quickly or i should miss the afternoon coach which would take me down in time for tonight
tomorrow night i could not think of going for it would be too close upon the time of the flight
and again for anything i knew the proffered information might have some important bearing on the flight itself
if i had had ample time for consideration i believe i should still have gone
having hardly any time for considerationmy watch showing me that the coach started within half an houri resolved to go
i should certainly not have gone but for the reference to my uncle provis
that coming on wemmicks letter and the mornings busy preparation turned the scale
it is so difficult to become clearly possessed of the contents of almost any letter in a violent hurry that i had to read this mysterious epistle again twice before its injunction to me to be secret got mechanically into my mind
yielding to it in the same mechanical kind of way i left a note in pencil for herbert telling him that as i should be so soon going away i knew not for how long i had decided to hurry down and back to ascertain for myself how miss havisham was faring
i had then barely time to get my greatcoat lock up the chambers and make for the coachoffice by the short byways
if i had taken a hackneychariot and gone by the streets i should have missed my aim going as i did i caught the coach just as it came out of the yard
i was the only inside passenger jolting away kneedeep in straw when i came to myself
for i really had not been myself since the receipt of the letter it had so bewildered me ensuing on the hurry of the morning
the morning hurry and flutter had been great for long and anxiously as i had waited for wemmick his hint had come like a surprise at last
and now i began to wonder at myself for being in the coach and to doubt whether i had sufficient reason for being there and to consider whether i should get out presently and go back and to argue against ever heeding an anonymous communication and in short to pass through all those phases of contradiction and indecision to which i suppose very few hurried people are strangers
still the reference to provis by name mastered everything
i reasoned as i had reasoned already without knowing itif that be reasoningin case any harm should befall him through my not going how could i ever forgive myself
it was dark before we got down and the journey seemed long and dreary to me who could see little of it inside and who could not go outside in my disabled state
avoiding the blue boar i put up at an inn of minor reputation down the town and ordered some dinner
while it was preparing i went to satis house and inquired for miss havisham she was still very ill though considered something better
my inn had once been a part of an ancient ecclesiastical house and i dined in a little octagonal commonroom like a font
as i was not able to cut my dinner the old landlord with a shining bald head did it for me
this bringing us into conversation he was so good as to entertain me with my own storyof course with the popular feature that pumblechook was my earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortunes
do you know the young man said i
know him repeated the landlord
ever since he wasno height at all does he ever come back to this neighbourhood ay he comes back said the landlord to his great friends now and again and gives the cold shoulder to the man that made him what man is that him that i speak of said the landlord
mr
pumblechook is he ungrateful to no one else no doubt he would be if he could returned the landlord but he cant
and why
because pumblechook done everything for him does pumblechook say so say so replied the landlord
he hant no call to say so but does he say so it would turn a mans blood to white wine winegar to hear him tell of it sir said the landlord
i thought yet joe dear joe you never tell of it
longsuffering and loving joe you never complain
nor you sweettempered biddy your appetites been touched like by your accident said the landlord glancing at the bandaged arm under my coat
try a tenderer bit no thank you i replied turning from the table to brood over the fire
i can eat no more
please take it away i had never been struck at so keenly for my thanklessness to joe as through the brazen impostor pumblechook
the falser he the truer joe the meaner he the nobler joe
my heart was deeply and most deservedly humbled as i mused over the fire for an hour or more
the striking of the clock aroused me but not from my dejection or remorse and i got up and had my coat fastened round my neck and went out
i had previously sought in my pockets for the letter that i might refer to it again but i could not find it and was uneasy to think that it must have been dropped in the straw of the coach
i knew very well however that the appointed place was the little sluicehouse by the limekiln on the marshes and the hour nine
towards the marshes i now went straight having no time to spare
illustration chapter liii
it was a dark night though the full moon rose as i left the enclosed lands and passed out upon the marshes
beyond their dark line there was a ribbon of clear sky hardly broad enough to hold the red large moon
in a few minutes she had ascended out of that clear field in among the piled mountains of cloud
there was a melancholy wind and the marshes were very dismal
a stranger would have found them insupportable and even to me they were so oppressive that i hesitated half inclined to go back
but i knew them well and could have found my way on a far darker night and had no excuse for returning being there
so having come there against my inclination i went on against it
the direction that i took was not that in which my old home lay nor that in which we had pursued the convicts
my back was turned towards the distant hulks as i walked on and though i could see the old lights away on the spits of sand i saw them over my shoulder
i knew the limekiln as well as i knew the old battery but they were miles apart so that if a light had been burning at each point that night there would have been a long strip of the blank horizon between the two bright specks
at first i had to shut some gates after me and now and then to stand still while the cattle that were lying in the bankedup pathway arose and blundered down among the grass and reeds
but after a little while i seemed to have the whole flats to myself
it was another halfhour before i drew near to the kiln
the lime was burning with a sluggish stifling smell but the fires were made up and left and no workmen were visible
hard by was a small stonequarry
it lay directly in my way and had been worked that day as i saw by the tools and barrows that were lying about
coming up again to the marsh level out of this excavationfor the rude path lay through iti saw a light in the old sluicehouse
i quickened my pace and knocked at the door with my hand
waiting for some reply i looked about me noticing how the sluice was abandoned and broken and how the houseof wood with a tiled roofwould not be proof against the weather much longer if it were so even now and how the mud and ooze were coated with lime and how the choking vapour of the kiln crept in a ghostly way towards me
still there was no answer and i knocked again
no answer still and i tried the latch
it rose under my hand and the door yielded
looking in i saw a lighted candle on a table a bench and a mattress on a truckle bedstead
as there was a loft above i called is there any one here but no voice answered
then i looked at my watch and finding that it was past nine called again is there any one here there being still no answer i went out at the door irresolute what to do
it was beginning to rain fast
seeing nothing save what i had seen already i turned back into the house and stood just within the shelter of the doorway looking out into the night
while i was considering that some one must have been there lately and must soon be coming back or the candle would not be burning it came into my head to look if the wick were long
i turned round to do so and had taken up the candle in my hand when it was extinguished by some violent shock and the next thing i comprehended was that i had been caught in a strong running noose thrown over my head from behind
now said a suppressed voice with an oath ive got you what is this i cried struggling
who is it
help help help not only were my arms pulled close to my sides but the pressure on my bad arm caused me exquisite pain
sometimes a strong mans hand sometimes a strong mans breast was set against my mouth to deaden my cries and with a hot breath always close to me i struggled ineffectually in the dark while i was fastened tight to the wall
and now said the suppressed voice with another oath call out again and ill make short work of you faint and sick with the pain of my injured arm bewildered by the surprise and yet conscious how easily this threat could be put in execution i desisted and tried to ease my arm were it ever so little
but it was bound too tight for that
i felt as if having been burnt before it were now being boiled
the sudden exclusion of the night and the substitution of black darkness in its place warned me that the man had closed a shutter
after groping about for a little he found the flint and steel he wanted and began to strike a light
i strained my sight upon the sparks that fell among the tinder and upon which he breathed and breathed match in hand but i could only see his lips and the blue point of the match even those but fitfully
the tinder was dampno wonder thereand one after another the sparks died out
the man was in no hurry and struck again with the flint and steel
as the sparks fell thick and bright about him i could see his hands and touches of his face and could make out that he was seated and bending over the table but nothing more
presently i saw his blue lips again breathing on the tinder and then a flare of light flashed up and showed me orlick
whom i had looked for i dont know
i had not looked for him
seeing him i felt that i was in a dangerous strait indeed and i kept my eyes upon him
he lighted the candle from the flaring match with great deliberation and dropped the match and trod it out
then he put the candle away from him on the table so that he could see me and sat with his arms folded on the table and looked at me
i made out that i was fastened to a stout perpendicular ladder a few inches from the walla fixture therethe means of ascent to the loft above
now said he when we had surveyed one another for some time ive got you unbind me
let me go ah he returned ill let you go
ill let you go to the moon ill let you go to the stars
all in good time why have you lured me here dont you know said he with a deadly look
why have you set upon me in the dark because i mean to do it all myself
one keeps a secret better than two
o you enemy you enemy his enjoyment of the spectacle i furnished as he sat with his arms folded on the table shaking his head at me and hugging himself had a malignity in it that made me tremble
as i watched him in silence he put his hand into the corner at his side and took up a gun with a brassbound stock
do you know this said he making as if he would take aim at me
do you know where you saw it afore
speak wolf yes i answered
illustration you cost me that place
you did
speak what else could i do you did that and that would be enough without more
how dared you to come betwixt me and a young woman i liked when did i when didnt you
it was you as always give old orlick a bad name to her you gave it to yourself you gained it for yourself
i could have done you no harm if you had done yourself none youre a liar
and youll take any pains and spend any money to drive me out of this country will you said he repeating my words to biddy in the last interview i had with her
now ill tell you a piece of information
it was never so well worth your while to get me out of this country as it is tonight
ah
if it was all your money twenty times told to the last brass farden as he shook his heavy hand at me with his mouth snarling like a tigers i felt that it was true
what are you going to do to me im agoing said he bringing his fist down upon the table with a heavy blow and rising as the blow fell to give it greater forceim agoing to have your life he leaned forward staring at me slowly unclenched his hand and drew it across his mouth as if his mouth watered for me and sat down again
you was always in old orlicks way since ever you was a child
you goes out of his way this present night
hell have no more on you
youre dead i felt that i had come to the brink of my grave
for a moment i looked wildly round my trap for any chance of escape but there was none
more than that said he folding his arms on the table again i wont have a rag of you i wont have a bone of you left on earth
ill put your body in the kilnid carry two such to it on my shouldersand let people suppose what they may of you they shall never know nothing my mind with inconceivable rapidity followed out all the consequences of such a death
estellas father would believe i had deserted him would be taken would die accusing me even herbert would doubt me when he compared the letter i had left for him with the fact that i had called at miss havishams gate for only a moment joe and biddy would never know how sorry i had been that night none would ever know what i had suffered how true i had meant to be what an agony i had passed through
the death close before me was terrible but far more terrible than death was the dread of being misremembered after death
and so quick were my thoughts that i saw myself despised by unborn generationsestellas children and their childrenwhile the wretchs words were yet on his lips
now wolf said he afore i kill you like any other beastwhich is wot i mean to do and wot i have tied you up forill have a good look at you and a good goad at you
o you enemy it had passed through my thoughts to cry out for help again though few could know better than i the solitary nature of the spot and the hopelessness of aid
but as he sat gloating over me i was supported by a scornful detestation of him that sealed my lips
above all things i resolved that i would not entreat him and that i would die making some last poor resistance to him
softened as my thoughts of all the rest of men were in that dire extremity humbly beseeching pardon as i did of heaven melted at heart as i was by the thought that i had taken no farewell and never now could take farewell of those who were dear to me or could explain myself to them or ask for their compassion on my miserable errorsstill if i could have killed him even in dying i would have done it
he had been drinking and his eyes were red and bloodshot
around his neck was slung a tin bottle as i had often seen his meat and drink slung about him in other days
he brought the bottle to his lips and took a fiery drink from it and i smelt the strong spirits that i saw flash into his face
wolf said he folding his arms again old orlicks agoing to tell you somethink
it was you as did for your shrew sister again my mind with its former inconceivable rapidity had exhausted the whole subject of the attack upon my sister her illness and her death before his slow and hesitating speech had formed these words
it was you villain said i
i tell you it was your doingi tell you it was done through you he retorted catching up the gun and making a blow with the stock at the vacant air between us
i come upon her from behind as i come upon you tonight
i giv it her
i left her for dead and if there had been a limekiln as nigh her as there is now nigh you she shouldnt have come to life again
but it warnt old orlick as did it it was you
you was favoured and he was bullied and beat
old orlick bullied and beat eh
now you pays for it
you done it now you pays for it he drank again and became more ferocious
i saw by his tilting of the bottle that there was no great quantity left in it
i distinctly understood that he was working himself up with its contents to make an end of me
i knew that every drop it held was a drop of my life
i knew that when i was changed into a part of the vapour that had crept towards me but a little while before like my own warning ghost he would do as he had done in my sisters casemake all haste to the town and be seen slouching about there drinking at the alehouses
my rapid mind pursued him to the town made a picture of the street with him in it and contrasted its lights and life with the lonely marsh and the white vapour creeping over it into which i should have dissolved
it was not only that i could have summed up years and years and years while he said a dozen words but that what he did say presented pictures to me and not mere words
in the excited and exalted state of my brain i could not think of a place without seeing it or of persons without seeing them
it is impossible to overstate the vividness of these images and yet i was so intent all the time upon him himselfwho would not be intent on the tiger crouching to springthat i knew of the slightest action of his fingers
when he had drunk this second time he rose from the bench on which he sat and pushed the table aside
then he took up the candle and shading it with his murderous hand so as to throw its light on me stood before me looking at me and enjoying the sight
wolf ill tell you something more
it was old orlick as you tumbled over on your stairs that night i saw the staircase with its extinguished lamps
i saw the shadows of the heavy stairrails thrown by the watchmans lantern on the wall
i saw the rooms that i was never to see again here a door half open there a door closed all the articles of furniture around
and why was old orlick there

some of em writes my letters when i wants em wrotedo you mindwrites my letters wolf

ive had a firm mind and a firm will to have your life since you was down here at your sisters burying
i hant seen a way to get you safe and ive looked arter you to know your ins and outs
for says old orlick to himself somehow or another ill have him what
when i looks for you i finds your uncle provis eh mill pond bank and chinkss basin and the old green copper ropewalk all so clear and plain

why i knowd you at gargerys when you was so small a wolf that i could have took your weazen betwixt this finger and thumb and chucked you away dead as id thoughts o doing odd times when i see you loitering amongst the pollards on a sunday and you hadnt found no uncles then
no not you
but when old orlick come for to hear that your uncle provis had most like wore the legiron wot old orlick had picked up filed asunder on these meshes ever so many year ago and wot he kep by him till he dropped your sister with it like a bullock as he means to drop youheywhen he come for to hear thathey in his savage taunting he flared the candle so close at me that i turned my face aside to save it from the flame
ah he cried laughing after doing it again the burnt child dreads the fire
old orlick knowed you was burnt old orlick knowed you was smuggling your uncle provis away old orlicks a match for you and knowd youd come tonight
now ill tell you something more wolf and this ends it
theres them thats as good a match for your uncle provis as old orlick has been for you
let him ware them when hes lost his nevvy
let him ware them when no man cant find a rag of his dear relations clothes nor yet a bone of his body
theres them that cant and that wont have magwitchyes i know the namealive in the same land with them and thats had such sure information of him when he was alive in another land as that he couldnt and shouldnt leave it unbeknown and put them in danger
praps its them that writes fifty hands and thats not like sneaking you as writes but one
ware compeyson magwitch and the gallows he flared the candle at me again smoking my face and hair and for an instant blinding me and turned his powerful back as he replaced the light on the table
i had thought a prayer and had been with joe and biddy and herbert before he turned towards me again
there was a clear space of a few feet between the table and the opposite wall
within this space he now slouched backwards and forwards
his great strength seemed to sit stronger upon him than ever before as he did this with his hands hanging loose and heavy at his sides and with his eyes scowling at me
i had no grain of hope left
wild as my inward hurry was and wonderful the force of the pictures that rushed by me instead of thoughts i could yet clearly understand that unless he had resolved that i was within a few moments of surely perishing out of all human knowledge he would never have told me what he had told
of a sudden he stopped took the cork out of his bottle and tossed it away
light as it was i heard it fall like a plummet
he swallowed slowly tilting up the bottle by little and little and now he looked at me no more
the last few drops of liquor he poured into the palm of his hand and licked up
then with a sudden hurry of violence and swearing horribly he threw the bottle from him and stooped and i saw in his hand a stonehammer with a long heavy handle
the resolution i had made did not desert me for without uttering one vain word of appeal to him i shouted out with all my might and struggled with all my might
it was only my head and my legs that i could move but to that extent i struggled with all the force until then unknown that was within me
in the same instant i heard responsive shouts saw figures and a gleam of light dash in at the door heard voices and tumult and saw orlick emerge from a struggle of men as if it were tumbling water clear the table at a leap and fly out into the night
after a blank i found that i was lying unbound on the floor in the same place with my head on some ones knee
my eyes were fixed on the ladder against the wall when i came to myselfhad opened on it before my mind saw itand thus as i recovered consciousness i knew that i was in the place where i had lost it
too indifferent at first even to look round and ascertain who supported me i was lying looking at the ladder when there came between me and it a face
the face of trabbs boy
i think hes all right said trabbs boy in a sober voice but aint he just pale though at these words the face of him who supported me looked over into mine and i saw my supporter to be herbert
great heaven softly said herbert
gently handel
dont be too eager and our old comrade startop i cried as he too bent over me
remember what he is going to assist us in said herbert and be calm the allusion made me spring up though i dropped again from the pain in my arm
the time has not gone by herbert has it
what night is tonight
how long have i been here for i had a strange and strong misgiving that i had been lying there a long timea day and a nighttwo days and nightsmore
the time has not gone by
it is still monday night thank god and you have all tomorrow tuesday to rest in said herbert
but you cant help groaning my dear handel
what hurt have you got
can you stand yes yes said i i can walk
i have no hurt but in this throbbing arm they laid it bare and did what they could
it was violently swollen and inflamed and i could scarcely endure to have it touched
but they tore up their handkerchiefs to make fresh bandages and carefully replaced it in the sling until we could get to the town and obtain some cooling lotion to put upon it
in a little while we had shut the door of the dark and empty sluicehouse and were passing through the quarry on our way back
trabbs boytrabbs overgrown young man nowwent before us with a lantern which was the light i had seen come in at the door
but the moon was a good two hours higher than when i had last seen the sky and the night though rainy was much lighter
the white vapour of the kiln was passing from us as we went by and as i had thought a prayer before i thought a thanksgiving now
entreating herbert to tell me how he had come to my rescuewhich at first he had flatly refused to do but had insisted on my remaining quieti learnt that i had in my hurry dropped the letter open in our chambers where he coming home to bring with him startop whom he had met in the street on his way to me found it very soon after i was gone
its tone made him uneasy and the more so because of the inconsistency between it and the hasty letter i had left for him
his uneasiness increasing instead of subsiding after a quarter of an hours consideration he set off for the coachoffice with startop who volunteered his company to make inquiry when the next coach went down
finding that the afternoon coach was gone and finding that his uneasiness grew into positive alarm as obstacles came in his way he resolved to follow in a postchaise
so he and startop arrived at the blue boar fully expecting there to find me or tidings of me but finding neither went on to miss havishams where they lost me
hereupon they went back to the hotel doubtless at about the time when i was hearing the popular local version of my own story to refresh themselves and to get some one to guide them out upon the marshes
among the loungers under the boars archway happened to be trabbs boytrue to his ancient habit of happening to be everywhere where he had no businessand trabbs boy had seen me passing from miss havishams in the direction of my diningplace
thus trabbs boy became their guide and with him they went out to the sluicehouse though by the town way to the marshes which i had avoided
now as they went along herbert reflected that i might after all have been brought there on some genuine and serviceable errand tending to proviss safety and bethinking himself that in that case interruption must be mischievous left his guide and startop on the edge of the quarry and went on by himself and stole round the house two or three times endeavouring to ascertain whether all was right within
as he could hear nothing but indistinct sounds of one deep rough voice this was while my mind was so busy he even at last began to doubt whether i was there when suddenly i cried out loudly and he answered the cries and rushed in closely followed by the other two
when i told herbert what had passed within the house he was for our immediately going before a magistrate in the town late at night as it was and getting out a warrant
but i had already considered that such a course by detaining us there or binding us to come back might be fatal to provis
there was no gainsaying this difficulty and we relinquished all thoughts of pursuing orlick at that time
for the present under the circumstances we deemed it prudent to make rather light of the matter to trabbs boy who i am convinced would have been much affected by disappointment if he had known that his intervention saved me from the limekiln
not that trabbs boy was of a malignant nature but that he had too much spare vivacity and that it was in his constitution to want variety and excitement at anybodys expense
when we parted i presented him with two guineas which seemed to meet his views and told him that i was sorry ever to have had an ill opinion of him which made no impression on him at all
wednesday being so close upon us we determined to go back to london that night three in the postchaise the rather as we should then be clear away before the nights adventure began to be talked of
herbert got a large bottle of stuff for my arm and by dint of having this stuff dropped over it all the night through i was just able to bear its pain on the journey
it was daylight when we reached the temple and i went at once to bed and lay in bed all day
my terror as i lay there of falling ill and being unfitted for tomorrow was so besetting that i wonder it did not disable me of itself
it would have done so pretty surely in conjunction with the mental wear and tear i had suffered but for the unnatural strain upon me that tomorrow was
so anxiously looked forward to charged with such consequences its results so impenetrably hidden though so near
no precaution could have been more obvious than our refraining from communication with him that day yet this again increased my restlessness
i started at every footstep and every sound believing that he was discovered and taken and this was the messenger to tell me so
i persuaded myself that i knew he was taken that there was something more upon my mind than a fear or a presentiment that the fact had occurred and i had a mysterious knowledge of it
as the days wore on and no ill news came as the day closed in and darkness fell my overshadowing dread of being disabled by illness before tomorrow morning altogether mastered me
my burning arm throbbed and my burning head throbbed and i fancied i was beginning to wander
i counted up to high numbers to make sure of myself and repeated passages that i knew in prose and verse
it happened sometimes that in the mere escape of a fatigued mind i dozed for some moments or forgot then i would say to myself with a start now it has come and i am turning delirious they kept me very quiet all day and kept my arm constantly dressed and gave me cooling drinks
whenever i fell asleep i awoke with the notion i had had in the sluicehouse that a long time had elapsed and the opportunity to save him was gone
about midnight i got out of bed and went to herbert with the conviction that i had been asleep for fourandtwenty hours and that wednesday was past
it was the last selfexhausting effort of my fretfulness for after that i slept soundly
wednesday morning was dawning when i looked out of window
the winking lights upon the bridges were already pale the coming sun was like a marsh of fire on the horizon
the river still dark and mysterious was spanned by bridges that were turning coldly grey with here and there at top a warm touch from the burning in the sky
as i looked along the clustered roofs with churchtowers and spires shooting into the unusually clear air the sun rose up and a veil seemed to be drawn from the river and millions of sparkles burst out upon its waters
from me too a veil seemed to be drawn and i felt strong and well
herbert lay asleep in his bed and our old fellowstudent lay asleep on the sofa
i could not dress myself without help but i made up the fire which was still burning and got some coffee ready for them
in good time they too started up strong and well and we admitted the sharp morning air at the windows and looked at the tide that was still flowing towards us
when it turns at nine oclock said herbert cheerfully look out for us and stand ready you over there at mill pond bank chapter liv
it was one of those march days when the sun shines hot and the wind blows cold when it is summer in the light and winter in the shade
we had our peacoats with us and i took a bag
of all my worldly possessions i took no more than the few necessaries that filled the bag
where i might go what i might do or when i might return were questions utterly unknown to me nor did i vex my mind with them for it was wholly set on proviss safety
i only wondered for the passing moment as i stopped at the door and looked back under what altered circumstances i should next see those rooms if ever
we loitered down to the temple stairs and stood loitering there as if we were not quite decided to go upon the water at all
of course i had taken care that the boat should be ready and everything in order
after a little show of indecision which there were none to see but the two or three amphibious creatures belonging to our temple stairs we went on board and cast off herbert in the bow i steering
it was then about highwaterhalfpast eight
our plan was this
the tide beginning to run down at nine and being with us until three we intended still to creep on after it had turned and row against it until dark
we should then be well in those long reaches below gravesend between kent and essex where the river is broad and solitary where the waterside inhabitants are very few and where lone publichouses are scattered here and there of which we could choose one for a restingplace
there we meant to lie by all night
the steamer for hamburg and the steamer for rotterdam would start from london at about nine on thursday morning
we should know at what time to expect them according to where we were and would hail the first so that if by any accident we were not taken abroad we should have another chance
we knew the distinguishing marks of each vessel
the relief of being at last engaged in the execution of the purpose was so great to me that i felt it difficult to realise the condition in which i had been a few hours before
the crisp air the sunlight the movement on the river and the moving river itselfthe road that ran with us seeming to sympathise with us animate us and encourage us onfreshened me with new hope
i felt mortified to be of so little use in the boat but there were few better oarsmen than my two friends and they rowed with a steady stroke that was to last all day
at that time the steamtraffic on the thames was far below its present extent and watermens boats were far more numerous
of barges sailing colliers and coastingtraders there were perhaps as many as now but of steamships great and small not a tithe or a twentieth part so many
early as it was there were plenty of scullers going here and there that morning and plenty of barges dropping down with the tide the navigation of the river between bridges in an open boat was a much easier and commoner matter in those days than it is in these and we went ahead among many skiffs and wherries briskly
old london bridge was soon passed and old billingsgate market with its oysterboats and dutchmen and the white tower and traitors gate and we were in among the tiers of shipping
here were the leith aberdeen and glasgow steamers loading and unloading goods and looking immensely high out of the water as we passed alongside here were colliers by the score and score with the coalwhippers plunging off stages on deck as counterweights to measures of coal swinging up which were then rattled over the side into barges here at her moorings was tomorrows steamer for rotterdam of which we took good notice and here tomorrows for hamburg under whose bowsprit we crossed
and now i sitting in the stern could see with a faster beating heart mill pond bank and mill pond stairs
is he there said herbert
not yet right
he was not to come down till he saw us
can you see his signal not well from here but i think i see itnow i see him
pull both
easy herbert
oars we touched the stairs lightly for a single moment and he was on board and we were off again
he had a boatcloak with him and a black canvas bag and he looked as like a riverpilot as my heart could have wished
dear boy he said putting his arm on my shoulder as he took his seat
faithful dear boy well done
thankye thankye again among the tiers of shipping in and out avoiding rusty chaincables frayed hempen hawsers and bobbing buoys sinking for the moment floating broken baskets scattering floating chips of wood and shaving cleaving floating scum of coal in and out under the figurehead of the john of sunderland making a speech to the winds as is done by many johns and the betsy of yarmouth with a firm formality of bosom and her knobby eyes starting two inches out of her head in and out hammers going in shipbuilders yards saws going at timber clashing engines going at things unknown pumps going in leaky ships capstans going ships going out to sea and unintelligible seacreatures roaring curses over the bulwarks at respondent lightermen in and outout at last upon the clearer river where the ships boys might take their fenders in no longer fishing in troubled waters with them over the side and where the festooned sails might fly out to the wind
at the stairs where we had taken him abroad and ever since i had looked warily for any token of our being suspected
i had seen none
we certainly had not been and at that time as certainly we were not either attended or followed by any boat
if we had been waited on by any boat i should have run in to shore and have obliged her to go on or to make her purpose evident
but we held our own without any appearance of molestation
he had his boatcloak on him and looked as i have said a natural part of the scene
it was remarkable but perhaps the wretched life he had led accounted for it that he was the least anxious of any of us
he was not indifferent for he told me that he hoped to live to see his gentleman one of the best of gentlemen in a foreign country he was not disposed to be passive or resigned as i understood it but he had no notion of meeting danger half way
when it came upon him he confronted it but it must come before he troubled himself
if you knowed dear boy he said to me what it is to sit here alonger my dear boy and have my smoke arter having been day by day betwixt four walls youd envy me
but you dont know what it is i think i know the delights of freedom i answered
ah said he shaking his head gravely
but you dont know it equal to me
you must have been under lock and key dear boy to know it equal to mebut i aint agoing to be low it occurred to me as inconsistent that for any mastering idea he should have endangered his freedom and even his life
but i reflected that perhaps freedom without danger was too much apart from all the habit of his existence to be to him what it would be to another man
i was not far out since he said after smoking a little you see dear boy when i was over yonder tother side the world i was always a looking to this side and it come flat to be there for all i was a growing rich
everybody knowed magwitch and magwitch could come and magwitch could go and nobodys head would be troubled about him
they aint so easy concerning me here dear boywouldnt be leastwise if they knowed where i was if all goes well said i you will be perfectly free and safe again within a few hours well he returned drawing a long breath i hope so and think so he dipped his hand in the water over the boats gunwale and said smiling with that softened air upon him which was not new to me ay i spose i think so dear boy
wed be puzzled to be more quiet and easygoing than we are at present
butits a flowing so soft and pleasant through the water praps as makes me think iti was a thinking through my smoke just then that we can no more see to the bottom of the next few hours than we can see to the bottom of this river what i catches hold of
nor yet we cant no more hold their tide than i can hold this
and its run through my fingers and gone you see holding up his dripping hand
but for your face i should think you were a little despondent said i
not a bit on it dear boy
it comes of flowing on so quiet and of that there rippling at the boats head making a sort of a sunday tune
maybe im a growing a trifle old besides he put his pipe back in his mouth with an undisturbed expression of face and sat as composed and contented as if we were already out of england
yet he was as submissive to a word of advice as if he had been in constant terror for when we ran ashore to get some bottles of beer into the boat and he was stepping out i hinted that i thought he would be safest where he was and he said
do you dear boy and quietly sat down again
the air felt cold upon the river but it was a bright day and the sunshine was very cheering
the tide ran strong i took care to lose none of it and our steady stroke carried us on thoroughly well
by imperceptible degrees as the tide ran out we lost more and more of the nearer woods and hills and dropped lower and lower between the muddy banks but the tide was yet with us when we were off gravesend
as our charge was wrapped in his cloak i purposely passed within a boat or twos length of the floating custom house and so out to catch the stream alongside of two emigrant ships and under the bows of a large transport with troops on the forecastle looking down at us
and soon the tide began to slacken and the craft lying at anchor to swing and presently they had all swung round and the ships that were taking advantage of the new tide to get up to the pool began to crowd upon us in a fleet and we kept under the shore as much out of the strength of the tide now as we could standing carefully off from low shallows and mudbanks
our oarsmen were so fresh by dint of having occasionally let her drive with the tide for a minute or two that a quarter of an hours rest proved full as much as they wanted
we got ashore among some slippery stones while we ate and drank what we had with us and looked about
it was like my own marsh country flat and monotonous and with a dim horizon while the winding river turned and turned and the great floating buoys upon it turned and turned and everything else seemed stranded and still
for now the last of the fleet of ships was round the last low point we had headed and the last green barge strawladen with a brown sail had followed and some ballastlighters shaped like a childs first rude imitation of a boat lay low in the mud and a little squat shoallighthouse on open piles stood crippled in the mud on stilts and crutches and slimy stakes stuck out of the mud and slimy stones stuck out of the mud and red landmarks and tidemarks stuck out of the mud and an old landingstage and an old roofless building slipped into the mud and all about us was stagnation and mud
we pushed off again and made what way we could
it was much harder work now but herbert and startop persevered and rowed and rowed and rowed until the sun went down
by that time the river had lifted us a little so that we could see above the bank
there was the red sun on the low level of the shore in a purple haze fast deepening into black and there was the solitary flat marsh and far away there were the rising grounds between which and us there seemed to be no life save here and there in the foreground a melancholy gull
as the night was fast falling and as the moon being past the full would not rise early we held a little council a short one for clearly our course was to lie by at the first lonely tavern we could find
so they plied their oars once more and i looked out for anything like a house
thus we held on speaking little for four or five dull miles
it was very cold and a collier coming by us with her galleyfire smoking and flaring looked like a comfortable home
the night was as dark by this time as it would be until morning and what light we had seemed to come more from the river than the sky as the oars in their dipping struck at a few reflected stars
at this dismal time we were evidently all possessed by the idea that we were followed
as the tide made it flapped heavily at irregular intervals against the shore and whenever such a sound came one or other of us was sure to start and look in that direction
here and there the set of the current had worn down the bank into a little creek and we were all suspicious of such places and eyed them nervously
sometimes what was that ripple one of us would say in a low voice
or another is that a boat yonder and afterwards we would fall into a dead silence and i would sit impatiently thinking with what an unusual amount of noise the oars worked in the thowels
at length we descried a light and a roof and presently afterwards ran alongside a little causeway made of stones that had been picked up hard by
leaving the rest in the boat i stepped ashore and found the light to be in a window of a publichouse
it was a dirty place enough and i dare say not unknown to smuggling adventurers but there was a good fire in the kitchen and there were eggs and bacon to eat and various liquors to drink
also there were two doublebedded roomssuch as they were the landlord said
no other company was in the house than the landlord his wife and a grizzled male creature the jack of the little causeway who was as slimy and smeary as if he had been lowwater mark too
with this assistant i went down to the boat again and we all came ashore and brought out the oars and rudder and boathook and all else and hauled her up for the night
we made a very good meal by the kitchen fire and then apportioned the bedrooms herbert and startop were to occupy one i and our charge the other
we found the air as carefully excluded from both as if air were fatal to life and there were more dirty clothes and bandboxes under the beds than i should have thought the family possessed
but we considered ourselves well off notwithstanding for a more solitary place we could not have found
while we were comforting ourselves by the fire after our meal the jackwho was sitting in a corner and who had a bloated pair of shoes on which he had exhibited while we were eating our eggs and bacon as interesting relics that he had taken a few days ago from the feet of a drowned seaman washed ashoreasked me if we had seen a fouroared galley going up with the tide
when i told him no he said she must have gone down then and yet she took up too when she left there
they must ha thought better ont for some reason or another said the jack and gone down a fouroared galley did you say said i
a four said the jack and two sitters did they come ashore here they put in with a stone twogallon jar for some beer
id ha been glad to pison the beer myself said the jack or put some rattling physic in it why i know why said the jack
he spoke in a slushy voice as if much mud had washed into his throat
he thinks said the landlord a weakly meditative man with a pale eye who seemed to rely greatly on his jackhe thinks they was what they wasnt i knows what i thinks observed the jack
you thinks custom us jack said the landlord
i do said the jack
then youre wrong jack am i in the infinite meaning of his reply and his boundless confidence in his views the jack took one of his bloated shoes off looked into it knocked a few stones out of it on the kitchen floor and put it on again
he did this with the air of a jack who was so right that he could afford to do anything
why what do you make out that they done with their buttons then jack asked the landlord vacillating weakly
done with their buttons returned the jack
chucked em overboard
swallered em
sowed em to come up small salad
done with their buttons dont be cheeky jack remonstrated the landlord in a melancholy and pathetic way
a custom us officer knows what to do with his buttons said the jack repeating the obnoxious word with the greatest contempt when they comes betwixt him and his own light
a four and two sitters dont go hanging and hovering up with one tide and down with another and both with and against another without there being custom us at the bottom of it saying which he went out in disdain and the landlord having no one to reply upon found it impracticable to pursue the subject
this dialogue made us all uneasy and me very uneasy
the dismal wind was muttering round the house the tide was flapping at the shore and i had a feeling that we were caged and threatened
a fouroared galley hovering about in so unusual a way as to attract this notice was an ugly circumstance that i could not get rid of
when i had induced provis to go up to bed i went outside with my two companions startop by this time knew the state of the case and held another council
whether we should remain at the house until near the steamers time which would be about one in the afternoon or whether we should put off early in the morning was the question we discussed
on the whole we deemed it the better course to lie where we were until within an hour or so of the steamers time and then to get out in her track and drift easily with the tide
having settled to do this we returned into the house and went to bed
i lay down with the greater part of my clothes on and slept well for a few hours
when i awoke the wind had risen and the sign of the house the ship was creaking and banging about with noises that startled me
rising softly for my charge lay fast asleep i looked out of the window
it commanded the causeway where we had hauled up our boat and as my eyes adapted themselves to the light of the clouded moon i saw two men looking into her
they passed by under the window looking at nothing else and they did not go down to the landingplace which i could discern to be empty but struck across the marsh in the direction of the nore
my first impulse was to call up herbert and show him the two men going away
but reflecting before i got into his room which was at the back of the house and adjoined mine that he and startop had had a harder day than i and were fatigued i forbore
going back to my window i could see the two men moving over the marsh
in that light however i soon lost them and feeling very cold lay down to think of the matter and fell asleep again
we were up early
as we walked to and fro all four together before breakfast i deemed it right to recount what i had seen
again our charge was the least anxious of the party
it was very likely that the men belonged to the custom house he said quietly and that they had no thought of us
i tried to persuade myself that it was soas indeed it might easily be
however i proposed that he and i should walk away together to a distant point we could see and that the boat should take us aboard there or as near there as might prove feasible at about noon
this being considered a good precaution soon after breakfast he and i set forth without saying anything at the tavern
he smoked his pipe as we went along and sometimes stopped to clap me on the shoulder
one would have supposed that it was i who was in danger not he and that he was reassuring me
we spoke very little
as we approached the point i begged him to remain in a sheltered place while i went on to reconnoitre for it was towards it that the men had passed in the night
he complied and i went on alone
there was no boat off the point nor any boat drawn up anywhere near it nor were there any signs of the men having embarked there
but to be sure the tide was high and there might have been some footprints under water
when he looked out from his shelter in the distance and saw that i waved my hat to him to come up he rejoined me and there we waited sometimes lying on the bank wrapped in our coats and sometimes moving about to warm ourselves until we saw our boat coming round
we got aboard easily and rowed out into the track of the steamer
by that time it wanted but ten minutes of one oclock and we began to look out for her smoke
but it was halfpast one before we saw her smoke and soon afterwards we saw behind it the smoke of another steamer
as they were coming on at full speed we got the two bags ready and took that opportunity of saying goodbye to herbert and startop
we had all shaken hands cordially and neither herberts eyes nor mine were quite dry when i saw a fouroared galley shoot out from under the bank but a little way ahead of us and row out into the same track
a stretch of shore had been as yet between us and the steamers smoke by reason of the bend and wind of the river but now she was visible coming head on
i called to herbert and startop to keep before the tide that she might see us lying by for her and i adjured provis to sit quite still wrapped in his cloak
he answered cheerily trust to me dear boy and sat like a statue
meantime the galley which was very skilfully handled had crossed us let us come up with her and fallen alongside
leaving just room enough for the play of the oars she kept alongside drifting when we drifted and pulling a stroke or two when we pulled
of the two sitters one held the rudderlines and looked at us attentivelyas did all the rowers the other sitter was wrapped up much as provis was and seemed to shrink and whisper some instruction to the steerer as he looked at us
not a word was spoken in either boat
startop could make out after a few minutes which steamer was first and gave me the word hamburg in a low voice as we sat face to face
she was nearing us very fast and the beating of her peddles grew louder and louder
i felt as if her shadow were absolutely upon us when the galley hailed us
i answered
you have a returned transport there said the man who held the lines
thats the man wrapped in the cloak
his name is abel magwitch otherwise provis
i apprehend that man and call upon him to surrender and you to assist at the same moment without giving any audible direction to his crew he ran the galley abroad of us
they had pulled one sudden stroke ahead had got their oars in had run athwart us and were holding on to our gunwale before we knew what they were doing
this caused great confusion on board the steamer and i heard them calling to us and heard the order given to stop the paddles and heard them stop but felt her driving down upon us irresistibly
in the same moment i saw the steersman of the galley lay his hand on his prisoners shoulder and saw that both boats were swinging round with the force of the tide and saw that all hands on board the steamer were running forward quite frantically
still in the same moment i saw the prisoner start up lean across his captor and pull the cloak from the neck of the shrinking sitter in the galley
still in the same moment i saw that the face disclosed was the face of the other convict of long ago
still in the same moment i saw the face tilt backward with a white terror on it that i shall never forget and heard a great cry on board the steamer and a loud splash in the water and felt the boat sink from under me
it was but for an instant that i seemed to struggle with a thousand millweirs and a thousand flashes of light that instant past i was taken on board the galley
herbert was there and startop was there but our boat was gone and the two convicts were gone
what with the cries aboard the steamer and the furious blowing off of her steam and her driving on and our driving on i could not at first distinguish sky from water or shore from shore but the crew of the galley righted her with great speed and pulling certain swift strong strokes ahead lay upon their oars every man looking silently and eagerly at the water astern
presently a dark object was seen in it bearing towards us on the tide
no man spoke but the steersman held up his hand and all softly backed water and kept the boat straight and true before it
as it came nearer i saw it to be magwitch swimming but not swimming freely
he was taken on board and instantly manacled at the wrists and ankles
the galley was kept steady and the silent eager lookout at the water was resumed
but the rotterdam steamer now came up and apparently not understanding what had happened came on at speed
by the time she had been hailed and stopped both steamers were drifting away from us and we were rising and falling in a troubled wake of water
the lookout was kept long after all was still again and the two steamers were gone but everybody knew that it was hopeless now
at length we gave it up and pulled under the shore towards the tavern we had lately left where we were received with no little surprise
here i was able to get some comforts for magwitchprovis no longerwho had received some very severe injury in the chest and a deep cut in the head
he told me that he believed himself to have gone under the keel of the steamer and to have been struck on the head in rising
the injury to his chest which rendered his breathing extremely painful he thought he had received against the side of the galley
he added that he did not pretend to say what he might or might not have done to compeyson but that in the moment of his laying his hand on his cloak to identify him that villain had staggered up and staggered back and they had both gone overboard together when the sudden wrenching of him magwitch out of our boat and the endeavour of his captor to keep him in it had capsized us
he told me in a whisper that they had gone down fiercely locked in each others arms and that there had been a struggle under water and that he had disengaged himself struck out and swum away
i never had any reason to doubt the exact truth of what he thus told me
the officer who steered the galley gave the same account of their going overboard
when i asked this officers permission to change the prisoners wet clothes by purchasing any spare garments i could get at the publichouse he gave it readily merely observing that he must take charge of everything his prisoner had about him
so the pocketbook which had once been in my hands passed into the officers
he further gave me leave to accompany the prisoner to london but declined to accord that grace to my two friends
the jack at the ship was instructed where the drowned man had gone down and undertook to search for the body in the places where it was likeliest to come ashore
his interest in its recovery seemed to me to be much heightened when he heard that it had stockings on
probably it took about a dozen drowned men to fit him out completely and that may have been the reason why the different articles of his dress were in various stages of decay
we remained at the publichouse until the tide turned and then magwitch was carried down to the galley and put on board
herbert and startop were to get to london by land as soon as they could
we had a doleful parting and when i took my place by magwitchs side i felt that that was my place henceforth while he lived
for now my repugnance to him had all melted away and in the hunted wounded shackled creature who held my hand in his i only saw a man who had meant to be my benefactor and who had felt affectionately gratefully and generously towards me with great constancy through a series of years
i only saw in him a much better man than i had been to joe
his breathing became more difficult and painful as the night drew on and often he could not repress a groan
i tried to rest him on the arm i could use in any easy position but it was dreadful to think that i could not be sorry at heart for his being badly hurt since it was unquestionably best that he should die
that there were still living people enough who were able and willing to identify him i could not doubt
that he would be leniently treated i could not hope
he who had been presented in the worst light at his trial who had since broken prison and had been tried again who had returned from transportation under a life sentence and who had occasioned the death of the man who was the cause of his arrest
as we returned towards the setting sun we had yesterday left behind us and as the stream of our hopes seemed all running back i told him how grieved i was to think that he had come home for my sake
dear boy he answered im quite content to take my chance
ive seen my boy and he can be a gentleman without me no
i had thought about that while we had been there side by side
no
apart from any inclinations of my own i understood wemmicks hint now
i foresaw that being convicted his possessions would be forfeited to the crown
lookee here dear boy said he its best as a gentleman should not be knowed to belong to me now
only come to see me as if you come by chance alonger wemmick
sit where i can see you when i am swore to for the last o many times and i dont ask no more i will never stir from your side said i when i am suffered to be near you
please god i will be as true to you as you have been to me i felt his hand tremble as it held mine and he turned his face away as he lay in the bottom of the boat and i heard that old sound in his throatsoftened now like all the rest of him
it was a good thing that he had touched this point for it put into my mind what i might not otherwise have thought of until too latethat he need never know how his hopes of enriching me had perished
chapter lv
he was taken to the police court next day and would have been immediately committed for trial but that it was necessary to send down for an old officer of the prisonship from which he had once escaped to speak to his identity
nobody doubted it but compeyson who had meant to depose to it was tumbling on the tides dead and it happened that there was not at that time any prison officer in london who could give the required evidence
i had gone direct to mr jaggers at his private house on my arrival over night to retain his assistance and mr jaggers on the prisoners behalf would admit nothing
it was the sole resource for he told me that the case must be over in five minutes when the witness was there and that no power on earth could prevent its going against us
i imparted to mr jaggers my design of keeping him in ignorance of the fate of his wealth
mr jaggers was querulous and angry with me for having let it slip through my fingers and said we must memorialise by and by and try at all events for some of it
but he did not conceal from me that although there might be many cases in which the forfeiture would not be exacted there were no circumstances in this case to make it one of them
i understood that very well
i was not related to the outlaw or connected with him by any recognisable tie he had put his hand to no writing or settlement in my favour before his apprehension and to do so now would be idle
i had no claim and i finally resolved and ever afterwards abided by the resolution that my heart should never be sickened with the hopeless task of attempting to establish one
there appeared to be reason for supposing that the drowned informer had hoped for a reward out of this forfeiture and had obtained some accurate knowledge of magwitchs affairs
when his body was found many miles from the scene of his death and so horribly disfigured that he was only recognisable by the contents of his pockets notes were still legible folded in a case he carried
among these were the name of a bankinghouse in new south wales where a sum of money was and the designation of certain lands of considerable value
both these heads of information were in a list that magwitch while in prison gave to mr jaggers of the possessions he supposed i should inherit
his ignorance poor fellow at last served him he never mistrusted but that my inheritance was quite safe with mr jaggerss aid
after three days delay during which the crown prosecution stood over for the production of the witness from the prisonship the witness came and completed the easy case
he was committed to take his trial at the next sessions which would come on in a month
it was at this dark time of my life that herbert returned home one evening a good deal cast down and said my dear handel i fear i shall soon have to leave you his partner having prepared me for that i was less surprised than he thought
we shall lose a fine opportunity if i put off going to cairo and i am very much afraid i must go handel when you most need me herbert i shall always need you because i shall always love you but my need is no greater now than at another time you will be so lonely i have not leisure to think of that said i
you know that i am always with him to the full extent of the time allowed and that i should be with him all day long if i could
and when i come away from him you know that my thoughts are with him the dreadful condition to which he was brought was so appalling to both of us that we could not refer to it in plainer words
my dear fellow said herbert let the near prospect of our separationfor it is very nearbe my justification for troubling you about yourself
have you thought of your future no for i have been afraid to think of any future but yours cannot be dismissed indeed my dear dear handel it must not be dismissed
i wish you would enter on it now as far as a few friendly words go with me i will said i
in this branch house of ours handel we must have a i saw that his delicacy was avoiding the right word so i said a clerk a clerk
and i hope it is not at all unlikely that he may expand as a clerk of your acquaintance has expanded into a partner
now handelin short my dear boy will you come to me there was something charmingly cordial and engaging in the manner in which after saying now handel as if it were the grave beginning of a portentous business exordium he had suddenly given up that tone stretched out his honest hand and spoken like a schoolboy
clara and i have talked about it again and again herbert pursued and the dear little thing begged me only this evening with tears in her eyes to say to you that if you will live with us when we come together she will do her best to make you happy and to convince her husbands friend that he is her friend too
we should get on so well handel i thanked her heartily and i thanked him heartily but said i could not yet make sure of joining him as he so kindly offered
firstly my mind was too preoccupied to be able to take in the subject clearly
secondlyyes
secondly there was a vague something lingering in my thoughts that will come out very near the end of this slight narrative
but if you thought herbert that you could without doing any injury to your business leave the question open for a little while for any while cried herbert
six months a year not so long as that said i
two or three months at most herbert was highly delighted when we shook hands on this arrangement and said he could now take courage to tell me that he believed he must go away at the end of the week
and clara said i
the dear little thing returned herbert holds dutifully to her father as long as he lasts but he wont last long
mrs whimple confides to me that he is certainly going not to say an unfeeling thing said i he cannot do better than go i am afraid that must be admitted said herbert and then i shall come back for the dear little thing and the dear little thing and i will walk quietly into the nearest church
remember
the blessed darling comes of no family my dear handel and never looked into the red book and hasnt a notion about her grandpapa
what a fortune for the son of my mother on the saturday in that same week i took my leave of herbertfull of bright hope but sad and sorry to leave meas he sat on one of the seaport mail coaches
i went into a coffeehouse to write a little note to clara telling her he had gone off sending his love to her over and over again and then went to my lonely homeif it deserved the name for it was now no home to me and i had no home anywhere
on the stairs i encountered wemmick who was coming down after an unsuccessful application of his knuckles to my door
i had not seen him alone since the disastrous issue of the attempted flight and he had come in his private and personal capacity to say a few words of explanation in reference to that failure
the late compeyson said wemmick had by little and little got at the bottom of half of the regular business now transacted and it was from the talk of some of his people in trouble some of his people being always in trouble that i heard what i did
i kept my ears open seeming to have them shut until i heard that he was absent and i thought that would be the best time for making the attempt
i can only suppose now that it was a part of his policy as a very clever man habitually to deceive his own instruments
you dont blame me i hope mr pip
i am sure i tried to serve you with all my heart i am as sure of that wemmick as you can be and i thank you most earnestly for all your interest and friendship thank you thank you very much
its a bad job said wemmick scratching his head and i assure you i havent been so cut up for a long time
what i look at is the sacrifice of so much portable property
dear me what i think of wemmick is the poor owner of the property yes to be sure said wemmick
of course there can be no objection to your being sorry for him and id put down a fivepound note myself to get him out of it
but what i look at is this
the late compeyson having been beforehand with him in intelligence of his return and being so determined to bring him to book i do not think he could have been saved
whereas the portable property certainly could have been saved
thats the difference between the property and the owner dont you see i invited wemmick to come upstairs and refresh himself with a glass of grog before walking to walworth
he accepted the invitation
while he was drinking his moderate allowance he said with nothing to lead up to it and after having appeared rather fidgety what do you think of my meaning to take a holiday on monday mr pip why i suppose you have not done such a thing these twelve months these twelve years more likely said wemmick
yes
im going to take a holiday
more than that im going to take a walk
more than that im going to ask you to take a walk with me i was about to excuse myself as being but a bad companion just then when wemmick anticipated me
i know your engagements said he and i know you are out of sorts mr pip
but if you could oblige me i should take it as a kindness
it aint a long walk and its an early one
say it might occupy you including breakfast on the walk from eight to twelve
couldnt you stretch a point and manage it he had done so much for me at various times that this was very little to do for him
i said i could manage itwould manage itand he was so very much pleased by my acquiescence that i was pleased too
at his particular request i appointed to call for him at the castle at half past eight on monday morning and so we parted for the time
punctual to my appointment i rang at the castle gate on the monday morning and was received by wemmick himself who struck me as looking tighter than usual and having a sleeker hat on
within there were two glasses of rum and milk prepared and two biscuits
the aged must have been stirring with the lark for glancing into the perspective of his bedroom i observed that his bed was empty
when we had fortified ourselves with the rum and milk and biscuits and were going out for the walk with that training preparation on us i was considerably surprised to see wemmick take up a fishingrod and put it over his shoulder
why we are not going fishing said i
no returned wemmick but i like to walk with one i thought this odd however i said nothing and we set off
we went towards camberwell green and when we were thereabouts wemmick said suddenly halloa
heres a church there was nothing very surprising in that but again i was rather surprised when he said as if he were animated by a brilliant idea lets go in we went in wemmick leaving his fishingrod in the porch and looked all round
in the mean time wemmick was diving into his coatpockets and getting something out of paper there
halloa said he
heres a couple of pair of gloves
lets put em on as the gloves were white kid gloves and as the postoffice was widened to its utmost extent i now began to have my strong suspicions
they were strengthened into certainty when i beheld the aged enter at a side door escorting a lady
halloa said wemmick
heres miss skiffins
lets have a wedding that discreet damsel was attired as usual except that she was now engaged in substituting for her green kid gloves a pair of white
the aged was likewise occupied in preparing a similar sacrifice for the altar of hymen
the old gentleman however experienced so much difficulty in getting his gloves on that wemmick found it necessary to put him with his back against a pillar and then to get behind the pillar himself and pull away at them while i for my part held the old gentleman round the waist that he might present an equal and safe resistance
by dint of this ingenious scheme his gloves were got on to perfection
the clerk and clergyman then appearing we were ranged in order at those fatal rails
true to his notion of seeming to do it all without preparation i heard wemmick say to himself as he took something out of his waistcoatpocket before the service began halloa
heres a ring i acted in the capacity of backer or bestman to the bridegroom while a little limp pewopener in a soft bonnet like a babys made a feint of being the bosom friend of miss skiffins
the responsibility of giving the lady away devolved upon the aged which led to the clergymans being unintentionally scandalised and it happened thus
when he said who giveth this woman to be married to this man the old gentleman not in the least knowing what point of the ceremony we had arrived at stood most amiably beaming at the ten commandments
upon which the clergyman said again who giveth this woman to be married to this man the old gentleman being still in a state of most estimable unconsciousness the bridegroom cried out in his accustomed voice now aged p you know who giveth to which the aged replied with great briskness before saying that he gave all right john all right my boy and the clergyman came to so gloomy a pause upon it that i had doubts for the moment whether we should get completely married that day
it was completely done however and when we were going out of church wemmick took the cover off the font and put his white gloves in it and put the cover on again
mrs wemmick more heedful of the future put her white gloves in her pocket and assumed her green
now mr pip said wemmick triumphantly shouldering the fishingrod as we came out let me ask you whether anybody would suppose this to be a weddingparty breakfast had been ordered at a pleasant little tavern a mile or so away upon the rising ground beyond the green and there was a bagatelle board in the room in case we should desire to unbend our minds after the solemnity
it was pleasant to observe that mrs wemmick no longer unwound wemmicks arm when it adapted itself to her figure but sat in a highbacked chair against the wall like a violoncello in its case and submitted to be embraced as that melodious instrument might have done
we had an excellent breakfast and when any one declined anything on table wemmick said provided by contract you know dont be afraid of it i drank to the new couple drank to the aged drank to the castle saluted the bride at parting and made myself as agreeable as i could
wemmick came down to the door with me and i again shook hands with him and wished him joy
thankee said wemmick rubbing his hands
shes such a manager of fowls you have no idea
you shall have some eggs and judge for yourself
i say mr pip calling me back and speaking low
this is altogether a walworth sentiment please i understand
not to be mentioned in little britain said i wemmick nodded
after what you let out the other day mr jaggers may as well not know of it
he might think my brain was softening or something of the kind chapter lvi
he lay in prison very ill during the whole interval between his committal for trial and the coming round of the sessions
he had broken two ribs they had wounded one of his lungs and he breathed with great pain and difficulty which increased daily
it was a consequence of his hurt that he spoke so low as to be scarcely audible therefore he spoke very little
but he was ever ready to listen to me and it became the first duty of my life to say to him and read to him what i knew he ought to hear
being far too ill to remain in the common prison he was removed after the first day or so into the infirmary
this gave me opportunities of being with him that i could not otherwise have had
and but for his illness he would have been put in irons for he was regarded as a determined prisonbreaker and i know not what else
although i saw him every day it was for only a short time hence the regularly recurring spaces of our separation were long enough to record on his face any slight changes that occurred in his physical state
i do not recollect that i once saw any change in it for the better he wasted and became slowly weaker and worse day by day from the day when the prison door closed upon him
the kind of submission or resignation that he showed was that of a man who was tired out
i sometimes derived an impression from his manner or from a whispered word or two which escaped him that he pondered over the question whether he might have been a better man under better circumstances
but he never justified himself by a hint tending that way or tried to bend the past out of its eternal shape
it happened on two or three occasions in my presence that his desperate reputation was alluded to by one or other of the people in attendance on him
a smile crossed his face then and he turned his eyes on me with a trustful look as if he were confident that i had seen some small redeeming touch in him even so long ago as when i was a little child
as to all the rest he was humble and contrite and i never knew him complain
when the sessions came round mr jaggers caused an application to be made for the postponement of his trial until the following sessions
it was obviously made with the assurance that he could not live so long and was refused
the trial came on at once and when he was put to the bar he was seated in a chair
no objection was made to my getting close to the dock on the outside of it and holding the hand that he stretched forth to me
the trial was very short and very clear
such things as could be said for him were saidhow he had taken to industrious habits and had thriven lawfully and reputably
but nothing could unsay the fact that he had returned and was there in presence of the judge and jury
it was impossible to try him for that and do otherwise than find him guilty
at that time it was the custom as i learnt from my terrible experience of that sessions to devote a concluding day to the passing of sentences and to make a finishing effect with the sentence of death
but for the indelible picture that my remembrance now holds before me i could scarcely believe even as i write these words that i saw twoandthirty men and women put before the judge to receive that sentence together
foremost among the twoandthirty was he seated that he might get breath enough to keep life in him
the whole scene starts out again in the vivid colours of the moment down to the drops of april rain on the windows of the court glittering in the rays of april sun
penned in the dock as i again stood outside it at the corner with his hand in mine were the twoandthirty men and women some defiant some stricken with terror some sobbing and weeping some covering their faces some staring gloomily about
there had been shrieks from among the women convicts but they had been stilled and a hush had succeeded
the sheriffs with their great chains and nosegays other civic gewgaws and monsters criers ushers a great gallery full of peoplea large theatrical audiencelooked on as the twoandthirty and the judge were solemnly confronted
then the judge addressed them
among the wretched creatures before him whom he must single out for special address was one who almost from his infancy had been an offender against the laws who after repeated imprisonments and punishments had been at length sentenced to exile for a term of years and who under circumstances of great violence and daring had made his escape and been resentenced to exile for life
that miserable man would seem for a time to have become convinced of his errors when far removed from the scenes of his old offences and to have lived a peaceable and honest life
but in a fatal moment yielding to those propensities and passions the indulgence of which had so long rendered him a scourge to society he had quitted his haven of rest and repentance and had come back to the country where he was proscribed
being here presently denounced he had for a time succeeded in evading the officers of justice but being at length seized while in the act of flight he had resisted them and hadhe best knew whether by express design or in the blindness of his hardihoodcaused the death of his denouncer to whom his whole career was known
the appointed punishment for his return to the land that had cast him out being death and his case being this aggravated case he must prepare himself to die
the sun was striking in at the great windows of the court through the glittering drops of rain upon the glass and it made a broad shaft of light between the twoandthirty and the judge linking both together and perhaps reminding some among the audience how both were passing on with absolute equality to the greater judgment that knoweth all things and cannot err
rising for a moment a distinct speck of face in this way of light the prisoner said my lord i have received my sentence of death from the almighty but i bow to yours and sat down again
there was some hushing and the judge went on with what he had to say to the rest
then they were all formally doomed and some of them were supported out and some of them sauntered out with a haggard look of bravery and a few nodded to the gallery and two or three shook hands and others went out chewing the fragments of herb they had taken from the sweet herbs lying about
he went last of all because of having to be helped from his chair and to go very slowly and he held my hand while all the others were removed and while the audience got up putting their dresses right as they might at church or elsewhere and pointed down at this criminal or at that and most of all at him and me
i earnestly hoped and prayed that he might die before the recorders report was made but in the dread of his lingering on i began that night to write out a petition to the home secretary of state setting forth my knowledge of him and how it was that he had come back for my sake
i wrote it as fervently and pathetically as i could and when i had finished it and sent it in i wrote out other petitions to such men in authority as i hoped were the most merciful and drew up one to the crown itself
for several days and nights after he was sentenced i took no rest except when i fell asleep in my chair but was wholly absorbed in these appeals
and after i had sent them in i could not keep away from the places where they were but felt as if they were more hopeful and less desperate when i was near them
in this unreasonable restlessness and pain of mind i would roam the streets of an evening wandering by those offices and houses where i had left the petitions
to the present hour the weary western streets of london on a cold dusty spring night with their ranges of stern shutup mansions and their long rows of lamps are melancholy to me from this association
the daily visits i could make him were shortened now and he was more strictly kept
seeing or fancying that i was suspected of an intention of carrying poison to him i asked to be searched before i sat down at his bedside and told the officer who was always there that i was willing to do anything that would assure him of the singleness of my designs
nobody was hard with him or with me
there was duty to be done and it was done but not harshly
the officer always gave me the assurance that he was worse and some other sick prisoners in the room and some other prisoners who attended on them as sick nurses malefactors but not incapable of kindness god be thanked
always joined in the same report
as the days went on i noticed more and more that he would lie placidly looking at the white ceiling with an absence of light in his face until some word of mine brightened it for an instant and then it would subside again
sometimes he was almost or quite unable to speak then he would answer me with slight pressures on my hand and i grew to understand his meaning very well
the number of the days had risen to ten when i saw a greater change in him than i had seen yet
his eyes were turned towards the door and lighted up as i entered
dear boy he said as i sat down by his bed i thought you was late
but i knowed you couldnt be that it is just the time said i
i waited for it at the gate you always waits at the gate dont you dear boy yes
not to lose a moment of the time thankee dear boy thankee
god bless you
youve never deserted me dear boy i pressed his hand in silence for i could not forget that i had once meant to desert him
and whats the best of all he said youve been more comfortable alonger me since i was under a dark cloud than when the sun shone
thats best of all he lay on his back breathing with great difficulty
do what he would and love me though he did the light left his face ever and again and a film came over the placid look at the white ceiling
are you in much pain today i dont complain of none dear boy you never do complain he had spoken his last words
he smiled and i understood his touch to mean that he wished to lift my hand and lay it on his breast
i laid it there and he smiled again and put both his hands upon it
the allotted time ran out while we were thus but looking round i found the governor of the prison standing near me and he whispered you neednt go yet i thanked him gratefully and asked might i speak to him if he can hear me the governor stepped aside and beckoned the officer away
the change though it was made without noise drew back the film from the placid look at the white ceiling and he looked most affectionately at me
dear magwitch i must tell you now at last
you understand what i say a gentle pressure on my hand
you had a child once whom you loved and lost a stronger pressure on my hand
she lived and found powerful friends
she is living now
she is a lady and very beautiful
and i love her with a last faint effort which would have been powerless but for my yielding to it and assisting it he raised my hand to his lips
then he gently let it sink upon his breast again with his own hands lying on it
the placid look at the white ceiling came back and passed away and his head dropped quietly on his breast
mindful then of what we had read together i thought of the two men who went up into the temple to pray and i knew there were no better words that i could say beside his bed than o lord be merciful to him a sinner chapter lvii
now that i was left wholly to myself i gave notice of my intention to quit the chambers in the temple as soon as my tenancy could legally determine and in the meanwhile to underlet them
at once i put bills up in the windows for i was in debt and had scarcely any money and began to be seriously alarmed by the state of my affairs
i ought rather to write that i should have been alarmed if i had had energy and concentration enough to help me to the clear perception of any truth beyond the fact that i was falling very ill
the late stress upon me had enabled me to put off illness but not to put it away i knew that it was coming on me now and i knew very little else and was even careless as to that
for a day or two i lay on the sofa or on the flooranywhere according as i happened to sink downwith a heavy head and aching limbs and no purpose and no power
then there came one night which appeared of great duration and which teemed with anxiety and horror and when in the morning i tried to sit up in my bed and think of it i found i could not do so
whether i really had been down in garden court in the dead of the night groping about for the boat that i supposed to be there whether i had two or three times come to myself on the staircase with great terror not knowing how i had got out of bed whether i had found myself lighting the lamp possessed by the idea that he was coming up the stairs and that the lights were blown out whether i had been inexpressibly harassed by the distracted talking laughing and groaning of some one and had half suspected those sounds to be of my own making whether there had been a closed iron furnace in a dark corner of the room and a voice had called out over and over again that miss havisham was consuming within itthese were things that i tried to settle with myself and get into some order as i lay that morning on my bed
but the vapour of a limekiln would come between me and them disordering them all and it was through the vapour at last that i saw two men looking at me
what do you want i asked starting i dont know you well sir returned one of them bending down and touching me on the shoulder this is a matter that youll soon arrange i dare say but youre arrested what is the debt hundred and twentythree pound fifteen six
jewellers account i think what is to be done you had better come to my house said the man
i keep a very nice house i made some attempt to get up and dress myself
when i next attended to them they were standing a little off from the bed looking at me
i still lay there
you see my state said i
i would come with you if i could but indeed i am quite unable
if you take me from here i think i shall die by the way perhaps they replied or argued the point or tried to encourage me to believe that i was better than i thought
forasmuch as they hang in my memory by only this one slender thread i dont know what they did except that they forbore to remove me
that i had a fever and was avoided that i suffered greatly that i often lost my reason that the time seemed interminable that i confounded impossible existences with my own identity that i was a brick in the housewall and yet entreating to be released from the giddy place where the builders had set me that i was a steel beam of a vast engine clashing and whirling over a gulf and yet that i implored in my own person to have the engine stopped and my part in it hammered off that i passed through these phases of disease i know of my own remembrance and did in some sort know at the time
that i sometimes struggled with real people in the belief that they were murderers and that i would all at once comprehend that they meant to do me good and would then sink exhausted in their arms and suffer them to lay me down i also knew at the time
but above all i knew that there was a constant tendency in all these peoplewho when i was very ill would present all kinds of extraordinary transformations of the human face and would be much dilated in sizeabove all i say i knew that there was an extraordinary tendency in all these people sooner or later to settle down into the likeness of joe
after i had turned the worst point of my illness i began to notice that while all its other features changed this one consistent feature did not change
whoever came about me still settled down into joe
i opened my eyes in the night and i saw in the great chair at the bedside joe
i opened my eyes in the day and sitting on the windowseat smoking his pipe in the shaded open window still i saw joe
i asked for cooling drink and the dear hand that gave it me was joes
i sank back on my pillow after drinking and the face that looked so hopefully and tenderly upon me was the face of joe
at last one day i took courage and said is it joe and the dear old homevoice answered which it air old chap o joe you break my heart
look angry at me joe
strike me joe
tell me of my ingratitude
dont be so good to me for joe had actually laid his head down on the pillow at my side and put his arm round my neck in his joy that i knew him
which dear old pip old chap said joe you and me was ever friends
and when youre well enough to go out for a ridewhat larks after which joe withdrew to the window and stood with his back towards me wiping his eyes
and as my extreme weakness prevented me from getting up and going to him i lay there penitently whispering o god bless him
o god bless this gentle christian man joes eyes were red when i next found him beside me but i was holding his hand and we both felt happy
how long dear joe which you meantersay pip how long have your illness lasted dear old chap yes joe its the end of may pip
tomorrow is the first of june and have you been here all that time dear joe pretty nigh old chap
for as i says to biddy when the news of your being ill were brought by letter which it were brought by the post and being formerly single he is now married though underpaid for a deal of walking and shoeleather but wealth were not a object on his part and marriage were the great wish of his hart it is so delightful to hear you joe
but i interrupt you in what you said to biddy which it were said joe that how you might be amongst strangers and that how you and me having been ever friends a wisit at such a moment might not prove unacceptabobble
and biddy her word were go to him without loss of time that said joe summing up with his judicial air were the word of biddy
go to him biddy say without loss of time in short i shouldnt greatly deceive you joe added after a little grave reflection if i represented to you that the word of that young woman were without a minutes loss of time there joe cut himself short and informed me that i was to be talked to in great moderation and that i was to take a little nourishment at stated frequent times whether i felt inclined for it or not and that i was to submit myself to all his orders
so i kissed his hand and lay quiet while he proceeded to indite a note to biddy with my love in it
evidently biddy had taught joe to write
as i lay in bed looking at him it made me in my weak state cry again with pleasure to see the pride with which he set about his letter
my bedstead divested of its curtains had been removed with me upon it into the sittingroom as the airiest and largest and the carpet had been taken away and the room kept always fresh and wholesome night and day
at my own writingtable pushed into a corner and cumbered with little bottles joe now sat down to his great work first choosing a pen from the pentray as if it were a chest of large tools and tucking up his sleeves as if he were going to wield a crowbar or sledgehammer
it was necessary for joe to hold on heavily to the table with his left elbow and to get his right leg well out behind him before he could begin and when he did begin he made every downstroke so slowly that it might have been six feet long while at every upstroke i could hear his pen spluttering extensively
he had a curious idea that the inkstand was on the side of him where it was not and constantly dipped his pen into space and seemed quite satisfied with the result
occasionally he was tripped up by some orthographical stumblingblock but on the whole he got on very well indeed and when he had signed his name and had removed a finishing blot from the paper to the crown of his head with his two forefingers he got up and hovered about the table trying the effect of his performance from various points of view as it lay there with unbounded satisfaction
not to make joe uneasy by talking too much even if i had been able to talk much i deferred asking him about miss havisham until next day
he shook his head when i then asked him if she had recovered
is she dead joe why you see old chap said joe in a tone of remonstrance and by way of getting at it by degrees i wouldnt go so far as to say that for thats a deal to say but she aint living joe thats nigher where it is said joe she aint living did she linger long joe arter you was took ill pretty much about what you might call if you was put to it a week said joe still determined on my account to come at everything by degrees
dear joe have you heard what becomes of her property well old chap said joe it do appear that she had settled the most of it which i meantersay tied it up on miss estella
but she had wrote out a little coddleshell in her own hand a day or two afore the accident leaving a cool four thousand to mr matthew pocket
and why do you suppose above all things pip she left that cool four thousand unto him
because of pips account of him the said matthew i am told by biddy that air the writing said joe repeating the legal turn as if it did him infinite good account of him the said matthew and a cool four thousand pip i never discovered from whom joe derived the conventional temperature of the four thousand pounds but it appeared to make the sum of money more to him and he had a manifest relish in insisting on its being cool
this account gave me great joy as it perfected the only good thing i had done
i asked joe whether he had heard if any of the other relations had any legacies
miss sarah said joe she have twentyfive pound perannium fur to buy pills on account of being bilious
miss georgiana she have twenty pound down
mrswhats the name of them wild beasts with humps old chap camels said i wondering why he could possibly want to know
joe nodded
mrs
camels by which i presently understood he meant camilla she have five pound fur to buy rushlights to put her in spirits when she wake up in the night the accuracy of these recitals was sufficiently obvious to me to give me great confidence in joes information
and now said joe you aint that strong yet old chap that you can take in more nor one additional shovelful today
old orlick hes been a bustin open a dwellingouse whose said i
not i grant you but what his manners is given to blusterous said joe apologetically still a englishmans ouse is his castle and castles must not be busted cept when done in war time
and wotsumeer the failings on his part he were a corn and seedsman in his hart is it pumblechooks house that has been broken into then thats it pip said joe and they took his till and they took his cashbox and they drinked his wine and they partook of his wittles and they slapped his face and they pulled his nose and they tied him up to his bedpust and they giv him a dozen and they stuffed his mouth full of flowering annuals to prewent his crying out
but he knowed orlick and orlicks in the county jail by these approaches we arrived at unrestricted conversation
i was slow to gain strength but i did slowly and surely become less weak and joe stayed with me and i fancied i was little pip again
for the tenderness of joe was so beautifully proportioned to my need that i was like a child in his hands
he would sit and talk to me in the old confidence and with the old simplicity and in the old unassertive protecting way so that i would half believe that all my life since the days of the old kitchen was one of the mental troubles of the fever that was gone
he did everything for me except the household work for which he had engaged a very decent woman after paying off the laundress on his first arrival
which i do assure you pip he would often say in explanation of that liberty i found her a tapping the spare bed like a cask of beer and drawing off the feathers in a bucket for sale
which she would have tapped yourn next and drawd it off with you a laying on it and was then a carrying away the coals gradiwally in the souptureen and wegetabledishes and the wine and spirits in your wellington boots we looked forward to the day when i should go out for a ride as we had once looked forward to the day of my apprenticeship
and when the day came and an open carriage was got into the lane joe wrapped me up took me in his arms carried me down to it and put me in as if i were still the small helpless creature to whom he had so abundantly given of the wealth of his great nature
and joe got in beside me and we drove away together into the country where the rich summer growth was already on the trees and on the grass and sweet summer scents filled all the air
the day happened to be sunday and when i looked on the loveliness around me and thought how it had grown and changed and how the little wildflowers had been forming and the voices of the birds had been strengthening by day and by night under the sun and under the stars while poor i lay burning and tossing on my bed the mere remembrance of having burned and tossed there came like a check upon my peace
but when i heard the sunday bells and looked around a little more upon the outspread beauty i felt that i was not nearly thankful enoughthat i was too weak yet to be even thatand i laid my head on joes shoulder as i had laid it long ago when he had taken me to the fair or where not and it was too much for my young senses
more composure came to me after a while and we talked as we used to talk lying on the grass at the old battery
there was no change whatever in joe
exactly what he had been in my eyes then he was in my eyes still just as simply faithful and as simply right
when we got back again and he lifted me out and carried meso easilyacross the court and up the stairs i thought of that eventful christmas day when he had carried me over the marshes
we had not yet made any allusion to my change of fortune nor did i know how much of my late history he was acquainted with
i was so doubtful of myself now and put so much trust in him that i could not satisfy myself whether i ought to refer to it when he did not
have you heard joe i asked him that evening upon further consideration as he smoked his pipe at the window who my patron was i heerd returned joe as it were not miss havisham old chap did you hear who it was joe well
i heerd as it were a person what sent the person what giv you the banknotes at the jolly bargemen pip so it was astonishing said joe in the placidest way
did you hear that he was dead joe i presently asked with increasing diffidence
which
him as sent the banknotes pip yes i think said joe after meditating a long time and looking rather evasively at the windowseat as i did hear tell that how he were something or another in a general way in that direction did you hear anything of his circumstances joe not partickler pip if you would like to hear joe i was beginning when joe got up and came to my sofa
lookee here old chap said joe bending over me
ever the best of friends aint us pip i was ashamed to answer him
wery good then said joe as if i had answered thats all right thats agreed upon
then why go into subjects old chap which as betwixt two sech must be for ever onnecessary
theres subjects enough as betwixt two sech without onnecessary ones
lord
to think of your poor sister and her rampages
and dont you remember tickler i do indeed joe lookee here old chap said joe
i done what i could to keep you and tickler in sunders but my power were not always fully equal to my inclinations
for when your poor sister had a mind to drop into you it were not so much said joe in his favourite argumentative way that she dropped into me too if i put myself in opposition to her but that she dropped into you always heavier for it
i noticed that
it aint a grab at a mans whisker not yet a shake or two of a man to which your sister was quite welcome that ud put a man off from getting a little child out of punishment
but when that little child is dropped into heavier for that grab of whisker or shaking then that man naterally up and says to himself where is the good as you are adoing
i grant you i see the arm says the man but i dont see the good
i call upon you sir therefore to pint out the good the man says i observed as joe waited for me to speak
the man says joe assented
is he right that man dear joe he is always right well old chap said joe then abide by your words
if hes always right which in general hes more likely wrong hes right when he says this supposing ever you kep any little matter to yourself when you was a little child you kep it mostly because you knowd as j gargerys power to part you and tickler in sunders were not fully equal to his inclinations
theerfore think no more of it as betwixt two sech and do not let us pass remarks upon onnecessary subjects
biddy giv herself a deal o trouble with me afore i left for i am almost awful dull as i should view it in this light and viewing it in this light as i should so put it
both of which said joe quite charmed with his logical arrangement being done now this to you a true friend say
namely
you mustnt go a overdoing on it but you must have your supper and your wine and water and you must be put betwixt the sheets the delicacy with which joe dismissed this theme and the sweet tact and kindness with which biddywho with her womans wit had found me out so soonhad prepared him for it made a deep impression on my mind
but whether joe knew how poor i was and how my great expectations had all dissolved like our own marsh mists before the sun i could not understand
another thing in joe that i could not understand when it first began to develop itself but which i soon arrived at a sorrowful comprehension of was this as i became stronger and better joe became a little less easy with me
in my weakness and entire dependence on him the dear fellow had fallen into the old tone and called me by the old names the dear old pip old chap that now were music in my ears
i too had fallen into the old ways only happy and thankful that he let me
but imperceptibly though i held by them fast joes hold upon them began to slacken and whereas i wondered at this at first i soon began to understand that the cause of it was in me and that the fault of it was all mine
ah
had i given joe no reason to doubt my constancy and to think that in prosperity i should grow cold to him and cast him off
had i given joes innocent heart no cause to feel instinctively that as i got stronger his hold upon me would be weaker and that he had better loosen it in time and let me go before i plucked myself away
it was on the third or fourth occasion of my going out walking in the temple gardens leaning on joes arm that i saw this change in him very plainly
we had been sitting in the bright warm sunlight looking at the river and i chanced to say as we got up see joe
i can walk quite strongly
now you shall see me walk back by myself which do not overdo it pip said joe but i shall be happy fur to see you able sir the last word grated on me but how could i remonstrate
i walked no further than the gate of the gardens and then pretended to be weaker than i was and asked joe for his arm
joe gave it me but was thoughtful
i for my part was thoughtful too for how best to check this growing change in joe was a great perplexity to my remorseful thoughts
that i was ashamed to tell him exactly how i was placed and what i had come down to i do not seek to conceal but i hope my reluctance was not quite an unworthy one
he would want to help me out of his little savings i knew and i knew that he ought not to help me and that i must not suffer him to do it
it was a thoughtful evening with both of us
but before we went to bed i had resolved that i would wait over tomorrowtomorrow being sundayand would begin my new course with the new week
on monday morning i would speak to joe about this change i would lay aside this last vestige of reserve i would tell him what i had in my thoughts that secondly not yet arrived at and why i had not decided to go out to herbert and then the change would be conquered for ever
as i cleared joe cleared and it seemed as though he had sympathetically arrived at a resolution too
we had a quiet day on the sunday and we rode out into the country and then walked in the fields
i feel thankful that i have been ill joe i said
dear old pip old chap youre amost come round sir it has been a memorable time for me joe likeways for myself sir joe returned
we have had a time together joe that i can never forget
there were days once i know that i did for a while forget but i never shall forget these pip said joe appearing a little hurried and troubled there has been larks
and dear sir what have been betwixt ushave been at night when i had gone to bed joe came into my room as he had done all through my recovery
he asked me if i felt sure that i was as well as in the morning
yes dear joe quite and are always a getting stronger old chap yes dear joe steadily joe patted the coverlet on my shoulder with his great good hand and said in what i thought a husky voice good night when i got up in the morning refreshed and stronger yet i was full of my resolution to tell joe all without delay
i would tell him before breakfast
i would dress at once and go to his room and surprise him for it was the first day i had been up early
i went to his room and he was not there
not only was he not there but his box was gone
i hurried then to the breakfasttable and on it found a letter
these were its brief contents not wishful to intrude i have departured fur you are well again dear pip and will do better without jo
ps
ever the best of friends enclosed in the letter was a receipt for the debt and costs on which i had been arrested
down to that moment i had vainly supposed that my creditor had withdrawn or suspended proceedings until i should be quite recovered
i had never dreamed of joes having paid the money but joe had paid it and the receipt was in his name
what remained for me now but to follow him to the dear old forge and there to have out my disclosure to him and my penitent remonstrance with him and there to relieve my mind and heart of that reserved secondly which had begun as a vague something lingering in my thoughts and had formed into a settled purpose
the purpose was that i would go to biddy that i would show her how humbled and repentant i came back that i would tell her how i had lost all i once hoped for that i would remind her of our old confidences in my first unhappy time
then i would say to her biddy i think you once liked me very well when my errant heart even while it strayed away from you was quieter and better with you than it ever has been since
if you can like me only half as well once more if you can take me with all my faults and disappointments on my head if you can receive me like a forgiven child and indeed i am as sorry biddy and have as much need of a hushing voice and a soothing hand i hope i am a little worthier of you that i wasnot much but a little
and biddy it shall rest with you to say whether i shall work at the forge with joe or whether i shall try for any different occupation down in this country or whether we shall go away to a distant place where an opportunity awaits me which i set aside when it was offered until i knew your answer
and now dear biddy if you can tell me that you will go through the world with me you will surely make it a better world for me and me a better man for it and i will try hard to make it a better world for you such was my purpose
after three days more of recovery i went down to the old place to put it in execution
and how i sped in it is all i have left to tell
chapter lviii
the tidings of my high fortunes having had a heavy fall had got down to my native place and its neighbourhood before i got there
i found the blue boar in possession of the intelligence and i found that it made a great change in the boars demeanour
whereas the boar had cultivated my good opinion with warm assiduity when i was coming into property the boar was exceedingly cool on the subject now that i was going out of property
it was evening when i arrived much fatigued by the journey i had so often made so easily
the boar could not put me into my usual bedroom which was engaged probably by some one who had expectations and could only assign me a very indifferent chamber among the pigeons and postchaises up the yard
but i had as sound a sleep in that lodging as in the most superior accommodation the boar could have given me and the quality of my dreams was about the same as in the best bedroom
early in the morning while my breakfast was getting ready i strolled round by satis house
there were printed bills on the gate and on bits of carpet hanging out of the windows announcing a sale by auction of the household furniture and effects next week
the house itself was to be sold as old building materials and pulled down
lot was marked in whitewashed knockknee letters on the brew house lot on that part of the main building which had been so long shut up
other lots were marked off on other parts of the structure and the ivy had been torn down to make room for the inscriptions and much of it trailed low in the dust and was withered already
stepping in for a moment at the open gate and looking around me with the uncomfortable air of a stranger who had no business there i saw the auctioneers clerk walking on the casks and telling them off for the information of a cataloguecompiler pen in hand who made a temporary desk of the wheeled chair i had so often pushed along to the tune of old clem
when i got back to my breakfast in the boars coffeeroom i found mr pumblechook conversing with the landlord
mr pumblechook not improved in appearance by his late nocturnal adventure was waiting for me and addressed me in the following terms young man i am sorry to see you brought low
but what else could be expected
what else could be expected as he extended his hand with a magnificently forgiving air and as i was broken by illness and unfit to quarrel i took it
william said mr pumblechook to the waiter put a muffin on table
and has it come to this
has it come to this i frowningly sat down to my breakfast
mr pumblechook stood over me and poured out my teabefore i could touch the teapotwith the air of a benefactor who was resolved to be true to the last
william said mr pumblechook mournfully put the salt on
in happier times addressing me i think you took sugar
and did you take milk
you did
sugar and milk
william bring a watercress thank you said i shortly but i dont eat watercresses you dont eat em returned mr pumblechook sighing and nodding his head several times as if he might have expected that and as if abstinence from watercresses were consistent with my downfall
true
the simple fruits of the earth
no
you neednt bring any william i went on with my breakfast and mr pumblechook continued to stand over me staring fishily and breathing noisily as he always did
little more than skin and bone mused mr pumblechook aloud
and yet when he went from here i may say with my blessing and i spread afore him my humble store like the bee he was as plump as a peach this reminded me of the wonderful difference between the servile manner in which he had offered his hand in my new prosperity saying may i and the ostentatious clemency with which he had just now exhibited the same fat five fingers
hah he went on handing me the bread and butter
and air you agoing to joseph in heavens name said i firing in spite of myself what does it matter to you where i am going
leave that teapot alone it was the worst course i could have taken because it gave pumblechook the opportunity he wanted
yes young man said he releasing the handle of the article in question retiring a step or two from my table and speaking for the behoof of the landlord and waiter at the door i will leave that teapot alone
you are right young man
for once you are right
i forgit myself when i take such an interest in your breakfast as to wish your frame exhausted by the debilitating effects of prodigygality to be stimilated by the olesome nourishment of your forefathers
and yet said pumblechook turning to the landlord and waiter and pointing me out at arms length this is him as i ever sported with in his days of happy infancy
tell me not it cannot be i tell you this is him a low murmur from the two replied
the waiter appeared to be particularly affected
this is him said pumblechook as i have rode in my shaycart
this is him as i have seen brought up by hand
this is him untoe the sister of which i was uncle by marriage as her name was georgiana mria from her own mother let him deny it if he can the waiter seemed convinced that i could not deny it and that it gave the case a black look
young man said pumblechook screwing his head at me in the old fashion you air agoing to joseph
what does it matter to me you ask me where you air agoing
i say to you sir you air agoing to joseph the waiter coughed as if he modestly invited me to get over that
now said pumblechook and all this with a most exasperating air of saying in the cause of virtue what was perfectly convincing and conclusive i will tell you what to say to joseph
here is squires of the boar present known and respected in this town and here is william which his fathers name was potkins if i do not deceive myself you do not sir said william
in their presence pursued pumblechook i will tell you young man what to say to joseph
says you joseph i have this day seen my earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortuns
i will name no names joseph but so they are pleased to call him up town and i have seen that man i swear i dont see him here said i
say that likewise retorted pumblechook
say you said that and even joseph will probably betray surprise there you quite mistake him said i
i know better says you pumblechook went on joseph i have seen that man and that man bears you no malice and bears me no malice
he knows your character joseph and is well acquainted with your pigheadedness and ignorance and he knows my character joseph and he knows my want of gratitoode
yes joseph says you here pumblechook shook his head and hand at me he knows my total deficiency of common human gratitoode
he knows it joseph as none can
you do not know it joseph having no call to know it but that man do windy donkey as he was it really amazed me that he could have the face to talk thus to mine
says you joseph he gave me a little message which i will now repeat
it was that in my being brought low he saw the finger of providence
he knowed that finger when he saw joseph and he saw it plain
it pinted out this writing joseph
reward of ingratitoode to his earliest benefactor and founder of fortuns
but that man said he did not repent of what he had done joseph
not at all
it was right to do it it was kind to do it it was benevolent to do it and he would do it again its pity said i scornfully as i finished my interrupted breakfast that the man did not say what he had done and would do again squires of the boar pumblechook was now addressing the landlord and william
i have no objections to your mentioning either up town or down town if such should be your wishes that it was right to do it kind to do it benevolent to do it and that i would do it again with those words the impostor shook them both by the hand with an air and left the house leaving me much more astonished than delighted by the virtues of that same indefinite it i was not long after him in leaving the house too and when i went down the high street i saw him holding forth no doubt to the same effect at his shop door to a select group who honoured me with very unfavourable glances as i passed on the opposite side of the way
but it was only the pleasanter to turn to biddy and to joe whose great forbearance shone more brightly than before if that could be contrasted with this brazen pretender
i went towards them slowly for my limbs were weak but with a sense of increasing relief as i drew nearer to them and a sense of leaving arrogance and untruthfulness further and further behind
the june weather was delicious
the sky was blue the larks were soaring high over the green corn i thought all that countryside more beautiful and peaceful by far than i had ever known it to be yet
many pleasant pictures of the life that i would lead there and of the change for the better that would come over my character when i had a guiding spirit at my side whose simple faith and clear home wisdom i had proved beguiled my way
they awakened a tender emotion in me for my heart was softened by my return and such a change had come to pass that i felt like one who was toiling home barefoot from distant travel and whose wanderings had lasted many years
the schoolhouse where biddy was mistress i had never seen but the little roundabout lane by which i entered the village for quietness sake took me past it
i was disappointed to find that the day was a holiday no children were there and biddys house was closed
some hopeful notion of seeing her busily engaged in her daily duties before she saw me had been in my mind and was defeated
but the forge was a very short distance off and i went towards it under the sweet green limes listening for the clink of joes hammer
long after i ought to have heard it and long after i had fancied i heard it and found it but a fancy all was still
the limes were there and the white thorns were there and the chestnuttrees were there and their leaves rustled harmoniously when i stopped to listen but the clink of joes hammer was not in the midsummer wind
almost fearing without knowing why to come in view of the forge i saw it at last and saw that it was closed
no gleam of fire no glittering shower of sparks no roar of bellows all shut up and still
but the house was not deserted and the best parlour seemed to be in use for there were white curtains fluttering in its window and the window was open and gay with flowers
i went softly towards it meaning to peep over the flowers when joe and biddy stood before me arm in arm
at first biddy gave a cry as if she thought it was my apparition but in another moment she was in my embrace
i wept to see her and she wept to see me i because she looked so fresh and pleasant she because i looked so worn and white
but dear biddy how smart you are yes dear pip and joe how smart you are yes dear old pip old chap i looked at both of them from one to the other and then its my weddingday cried biddy in a burst of happiness and i am married to joe they had taken me into the kitchen and i had laid my head down on the old deal table
biddy held one of my hands to her lips and joes restoring touch was on my shoulder
which he warnt strong enough my dear fur to be surprised said joe
and biddy said i ought to have thought of it dear joe but i was too happy they were both so overjoyed to see me so proud to see me so touched by my coming to them so delighted that i should have come by accident to make their day complete
my first thought was one of great thankfulness that i had never breathed this last baffled hope to joe
how often while he was with me in my illness had it risen to my lips
how irrevocable would have been his knowledge of it if he had remained with me but another hour
dear biddy said i you have the best husband in the whole world and if you could have seen him by my bed you would havebut no you couldnt love him better than you do no i couldnt indeed said biddy
and dear joe you have the best wife in the whole world and she will make you as happy as even you deserve to be you dear good noble joe joe looked at me with a quivering lip and fairly put his sleeve before his eyes
and joe and biddy both as you have been to church today and are in charity and love with all mankind receive my humble thanks for all you have done for me and all i have so ill repaid
and when i say that i am going away within the hour for i am soon going abroad and that i shall never rest until i have worked for the money with which you have kept me out of prison and have sent it to you dont think dear joe and biddy that if i could repay it a thousand times over i suppose i could cancel a farthing of the debt i owe you or that i would do so if i could they were both melted by these words and both entreated me to say no more
but i must say more
dear joe i hope you will have children to love and that some little fellow will sit in this chimneycorner of a winter night who may remind you of another little fellow gone out of it for ever
dont tell him joe that i was thankless dont tell him biddy that i was ungenerous and unjust only tell him that i honoured you both because you were both so good and true and that as your child i said it would be natural to him to grow up a much better man than i did i aint agoing said joe from behind his sleeve to tell him nothink o that natur pip
nor biddy aint
nor yet no one aint and now though i know you have already done it in your own kind hearts pray tell me both that you forgive me
pray let me hear you say the words that i may carry the sound of them away with me and then i shall be able to believe that you can trust me and think better of me in the time to come o dear old pip old chap said joe
god knows as i forgive you if i have anythink to forgive amen
and god knows i do echoed biddy
now let me go up and look at my old little room and rest there a few minutes by myself
and then when i have eaten and drunk with you go with me as far as the fingerpost dear joe and biddy before we say goodbye i sold all i had and put aside as much as i could for a composition with my creditorswho gave me ample time to pay them in fulland i went out and joined herbert
within a month i had quitted england and within two months i was clerk to clarriker and co and within four months i assumed my first undivided responsibility
for the beam across the parlour ceiling at mill pond bank had then ceased to tremble under old bill barleys growls and was at peace and herbert had gone away to marry clara and i was left in sole charge of the eastern branch until he brought her back
many a year went round before i was a partner in the house but i lived happily with herbert and his wife and lived frugally and paid my debts and maintained a constant correspondence with biddy and joe
it was not until i became third in the firm that clarriker betrayed me to herbert but he then declared that the secret of herberts partnership had been long enough upon his conscience and he must tell it
so he told it and herbert was as much moved as amazed and the dear fellow and i were not the worse friends for the long concealment
i must not leave it to be supposed that we were ever a great house or that we made mints of money
we were not in a grand way of business but we had a good name and worked for our profits and did very well
we owed so much to herberts ever cheerful industry and readiness that i often wondered how i had conceived that old idea of his inaptitude until i was one day enlightened by the reflection that perhaps the inaptitude had never been in him at all but had been in me
chapter lix
for eleven years i had not seen joe nor biddy with my bodily eyesthough they had both been often before my fancy in the eastwhen upon an evening in december an hour or two after dark i laid my hand softly on the latch of the old kitchen door
i touched it so softly that i was not heard and looked in unseen
there smoking his pipe in the old place by the kitchen firelight as hale and as strong as ever though a little grey sat joe and there fenced into the corner with joes leg and sitting on my own little stool looking at the fire wasi again
we giv him the name of pip for your sake dear old chap said joe delighted when i took another stool by the childs side but i did not rumple his hair and we hoped he might grow a little bit like you and we think he do i thought so too and i took him out for a walk next morning and we talked immensely understanding one another to perfection
and i took him down to the churchyard and set him on a certain tombstone there and he showed me from that elevation which stone was sacred to the memory of philip pirrip late of this parish and also georgiana wife of the above
biddy said i when i talked with her after dinner as her little girl lay sleeping in her lap you must give pip to me one of these days or lend him at all events no no said biddy gently
you must marry so herbert and clara say but i dont think i shall biddy
i have so settled down in their home that its not at all likely
i am already quite an old bachelor biddy looked down at her child and put its little hand to her lips and then put the good matronly hand with which she had touched it into mine
there was something in the action and in the light pressure of biddys weddingring that had a very pretty eloquence in it
dear pip said biddy you are sure you dont fret for her o noi think not biddy tell me as an old old friend
have you quite forgotten her
my dear biddy i have forgotten nothing in my life that ever had a foremost place there and little that ever had any place there
but that poor dream as i once used to call it has all gone by biddyall gone by nevertheless i knew while i said those words that i secretly intended to revisit the site of the old house that evening alone for her sake
yes even so
for estellas sake
i had heard of her as leading a most unhappy life and as being separated from her husband who had used her with great cruelty and who had become quite renowned as a compound of pride avarice brutality and meanness
and i had heard of the death of her husband from an accident consequent on his illtreatment of a horse
this release had befallen her some two years before for anything i knew she was married again
the early dinner hour at joes left me abundance of time without hurrying my talk with biddy to walk over to the old spot before dark
but what with loitering on the way to look at old objects and to think of old times the day had quite declined when i came to the place
there was no house now no brewery no building whatever left but the wall of the old garden
the cleared space had been enclosed with a rough fence and looking over it i saw that some of the old ivy had struck root anew and was growing green on low quiet mounds of ruin
a gate in the fence standing ajar i pushed it open and went in
a cold silvery mist had veiled the afternoon and the moon was not yet up to scatter it
but the stars were shining beyond the mist and the moon was coming and the evening was not dark
i could trace out where every part of the old house had been and where the brewery had been and where the gates and where the casks
i had done so and was looking along the desolate garden walk when i beheld a solitary figure in it
the figure showed itself aware of me as i advanced
it had been moving towards me but it stood still
as i drew nearer i saw it to be the figure of a woman
as i drew nearer yet it was about to turn away when it stopped and let me come up with it
then it faltered as if much surprised and uttered my name and i cried out estella i am greatly changed
i wonder you know me the freshness of her beauty was indeed gone but its indescribable majesty and its indescribable charm remained
those attractions in it i had seen before what i had never seen before was the saddened softened light of the once proud eyes what i had never felt before was the friendly touch of the once insensible hand
we sat down on a bench that was near and i said after so many years it is strange that we should thus meet again estella here where our first meeting was
do you often come back i have never been here since nor i the moon began to rise and i thought of the placid look at the white ceiling which had passed away
the moon began to rise and i thought of the pressure on my hand when i had spoken the last words he had heard on earth
estella was the next to break the silence that ensued between us
i have very often hoped and intended to come back but have been prevented by many circumstances
poor poor old place the silvery mist was touched with the first rays of the moonlight and the same rays touched the tears that dropped from her eyes
not knowing that i saw them and setting herself to get the better of them she said quietly were you wondering as you walked along how it came to be left in this condition yes estella the ground belongs to me
it is the only possession i have not relinquished
everything else has gone from me little by little but i have kept this
it was the subject of the only determined resistance i made in all the wretched years is it to be built on at last it is
i came here to take leave of it before its change
and you she said in a voice of touching interest to a wandereryou live abroad still still and do well i am sure i work pretty hard for a sufficient living and thereforeyes i do well i have often thought of you said estella
have you of late very often
there was a long hard time when i kept far from me the remembrance of what i had thrown away when i was quite ignorant of its worth
but since my duty has not been incompatible with the admission of that remembrance i have given it a place in my heart you have always held your place in my heart i answered
and we were silent again until she spoke
i little thought said estella that i should take leave of you in taking leave of this spot
i am very glad to do so glad to part again estella
to me parting is a painful thing
to me the remembrance of our last parting has been ever mournful and painful but you said to me returned estella very earnestly god bless you god forgive you and if you could say that to me then you will not hesitate to say that to me nownow when suffering has been stronger than all other teaching and has taught me to understand what your heart used to be
i have been bent and broken buti hopeinto a better shape
be as considerate and good to me as you were and tell me we are friends we are friends said i rising and bending over her as she rose from the bench
and will continue friends apart said estella
i took her hand in mine and we went out of the ruined place and as the morning mists had risen long ago when i first left the forge so the evening mists were rising now and in all the broad expanse of tranquil light they showed to me i saw no shadow of another parting from her

for a long time after it was ushered into this world of sorrow and trouble by the parish surgeon it remained a matter of considerable doubt whether the child would survive to bear any name at all in which case it is somewhat more than probable that these memoirs would never have appeared or if they had that being comprised within a couple of pages they would have possessed the inestimable merit of being the most concise and faithful specimen of biography extant in the literature of any age or country
although i am not disposed to maintain that the being born in a workhouse is in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance that can possibly befall a human being i do mean to say that in this particular instance it was the best thing for oliver twist that could by possibility have occurred
the fact is that there was considerable difficulty in inducing oliver to take upon himself the office of respirationa troublesome practice but one which custom has rendered necessary to our easy existence and for some time he lay gasping on a little flock mattress rather unequally poised between this world and the next the balance being decidedly in favour of the latter
now if during this brief period oliver had been surrounded by careful grandmothers anxious aunts experienced nurses and doctors of profound wisdom he would most inevitably and indubitably have been killed in no time
there being nobody by however but a pauper old woman who was rendered rather misty by an unwonted allowance of beer and a parish surgeon who did such matters by contract oliver and nature fought out the point between them
the result was that after a few struggles oliver breathed sneezed and proceeded to advertise to the inmates of the workhouse the fact of a new burden having been imposed upon the parish by setting up as loud a cry as could reasonably have been expected from a male infant who had not been possessed of that very useful appendage a voice for a much longer space of time than three minutes and a quarter
as oliver gave this first proof of the free and proper action of his lungs the patchwork coverlet which was carelessly flung over the iron bedstead rustled the pale face of a young woman was raised feebly from the pillow and a faint voice imperfectly articulated the words let me see the child and die the surgeon had been sitting with his face turned towards the fire giving the palms of his hands a warm and a rub alternately
as the young woman spoke he rose and advancing to the beds head said with more kindness than might have been expected of him oh you must not talk about dying yet lor bless her dear heart no interposed the nurse hastily depositing in her pocket a green glass bottle the contents of which she had been tasting in a corner with evident satisfaction
lor bless her dear heart when she has lived as long as i have sir and had thirteen children of her own and all on em dead except two and them in the wurkus with me shell know better than to take on in that way bless her dear heart
think what it is to be a mother theres a dear young lamb do apparently this consolatory perspective of a mothers prospects failed in producing its due effect
the patient shook her head and stretched out her hand towards the child
the surgeon deposited it in her arms
she imprinted her cold white lips passionately on its forehead passed her hands over her face gazed wildly round shuddered fell backand died
they chafed her breast hands and temples but the blood had stopped forever
they talked of hope and comfort
they had been strangers too long
its all over mrs thingummy said the surgeon at last
ah poor dear so it is said the nurse picking up the cork of the green bottle which had fallen out on the pillow as she stooped to take up the child
poor dear you neednt mind sending up to me if the child cries nurse said the surgeon putting on his gloves with great deliberation
its very likely it will be troublesome
give it a little gruel if it is he put on his hat and pausing by the bedside on his way to the door added she was a goodlooking girl too where did she come from she was brought here last night replied the old woman by the overseers order
she was found lying in the street
she had walked some distance for her shoes were worn to pieces but where she came from or where she was going to nobody knows the surgeon leaned over the body and raised the left hand
the old story he said shaking his head no weddingring i see
ah
goodnight the medical gentleman walked away to dinner and the nurse having once more applied herself to the green bottle sat down on a low chair before the fire and proceeded to dress the infant
what an excellent example of the power of dress young oliver twist was
wrapped in the blanket which had hitherto formed his only covering he might have been the child of a nobleman or a beggar it would have been hard for the haughtiest stranger to have assigned him his proper station in society
but now that he was enveloped in the old calico robes which had grown yellow in the same service he was badged and ticketed and fell into his place at oncea parish childthe orphan of a workhousethe humble halfstarved drudgeto be cuffed and buffeted through the worlddespised by all and pitied by none
oliver cried lustily
if he could have known that he was an orphan left to the tender mercies of churchwardens and overseers perhaps he would have cried the louder
treats of oliver twists growth education and board for the next eight or ten months oliver was the victim of a systematic course of treachery and deception
he was brought up by hand
the hungry and destitute situation of the infant orphan was duly reported by the workhouse authorities to the parish authorities
the parish authorities inquired with dignity of the workhouse authorities whether there was no female then domiciled in the house who was in a situation to impart to oliver twist the consolation and nourishment of which he stood in need
the workhouse authorities replied with humility that there was not
upon this the parish authorities magnanimously and humanely resolved that oliver should be farmed or in other words that he should be dispatched to a branchworkhouse some three miles off where twenty or thirty other juvenile offenders against the poorlaws rolled about the floor all day without the inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing under the parental superintendence of an elderly female who received the culprits at and for the consideration of sevenpencehalfpenny per small head per week
sevenpencehalfpennys worth per week is a good round diet for a child a great deal may be got for sevenpencehalfpenny quite enough to overload its stomach and make it uncomfortable
the elderly female was a woman of wisdom and experience she knew what was good for children and she had a very accurate perception of what was good for herself
so she appropriated the greater part of the weekly stipend to her own use and consigned the rising parochial generation to even a shorter allowance than was originally provided for them
thereby finding in the lowest depth a deeper still and proving herself a very great experimental philosopher
everybody knows the story of another experimental philosopher who had a great theory about a horse being able to live without eating and who demonstrated it so well that he had got his own horse down to a straw a day and would unquestionably have rendered him a very spirited and rampacious animal on nothing at all if he had not died fourandtwenty hours before he was to have had his first comfortable bait of air
unfortunately for the experimental philosophy of the female to whose protecting care oliver twist was delivered over a similar result usually attended the operation of her system for at the very moment when the child had contrived to exist upon the smallest possible portion of the weakest possible food it did perversely happen in eight and a half cases out of ten either that it sickened from want and cold or fell into the fire from neglect or got halfsmothered by accident in any one of which cases the miserable little being was usually summoned into another world and there gathered to the fathers it had never known in this
occasionally when there was some more than usually interesting inquest upon a parish child who had been overlooked in turning up a bedstead or inadvertently scalded to death when there happened to be a washingthough the latter accident was very scarce anything approaching to a washing being of rare occurrence in the farmthe jury would take it into their heads to ask troublesome questions or the parishioners would rebelliously affix their signatures to a remonstrance
but these impertinences were speedily checked by the evidence of the surgeon and the testimony of the beadle the former of whom had always opened the body and found nothing inside which was very probable indeed and the latter of whom invariably swore whatever the parish wanted which was very selfdevotional
besides the board made periodical pilgrimages to the farm and always sent the beadle the day before to say they were going
the children were neat and clean to behold when they went and what more would the people have
it cannot be expected that this system of farming would produce any very extraordinary or luxuriant crop
oliver twists ninth birthday found him a pale thin child somewhat diminutive in stature and decidedly small in circumference
but nature or inheritance had implanted a good sturdy spirit in olivers breast
it had had plenty of room to expand thanks to the spare diet of the establishment and perhaps to this circumstance may be attributed his having any ninth birthday at all
be this as it may however it was his ninth birthday and he was keeping it in the coalcellar with a select party of two other young gentleman who after participating with him in a sound thrashing had been locked up for atrociously presuming to be hungry when mrs mann the good lady of the house was unexpectedly startled by the apparition of mr bumble the beadle striving to undo the wicket of the gardengate
goodness gracious
is that you mr bumble sir said mrs mann thrusting her head out of the window in wellaffected ecstasies of joy
susan take oliver and them two brats upstairs and wash em directly
my heart alive
mr bumble how glad i am to see you surely now mr bumble was a fat man and a choleric so instead of responding to this openhearted salutation in a kindred spirit he gave the little wicket a tremendous shake and then bestowed upon it a kick which could have emanated from no leg but a beadles
lor only think said mrs mann running outfor the three boys had been removed by this timeonly think of that
that i should have forgotten that the gate was bolted on the inside on account of them dear children
walk in sir walk in pray mr bumble do sir although this invitation was accompanied with a curtsey that might have softened the heart of a churchwarden it by no means mollified the beadle
do you think this respectful or proper conduct mrs mann inquired mr bumble grasping his cane to keep the parish officers a waiting at your gardengate when they come here upon porochial business with the porochial orphans
are you aweer mrs mann that you are as i may say a porochial delegate and a stipendiary im sure mr bumble that i was only a telling one or two of the dear children as is so fond of you that it was you a coming replied mrs mann with great humility
mr bumble had a great idea of his oratorical powers and his importance
he had displayed the one and vindicated the other
he relaxed
well well mrs mann he replied in a calmer tone it may be as you say it may be
lead the way in mrs mann for i come on business and have something to say mrs mann ushered the beadle into a small parlour with a brick floor placed a seat for him and officiously deposited his cocked hat and cane on the table before him
mr bumble wiped from his forehead the perspiration which his walk had engendered glanced complacently at the cocked hat and smiled
yes he smiled
beadles are but men and mr bumble smiled
now dont you be offended at what im a going to say observed mrs mann with captivating sweetness
youve had a long walk you know or i wouldnt mention it
now will you take a little drop of somethink mr bumble not a drop
nor a drop said mr bumble waving his right hand in a dignified but placid manner
i think you will said mrs mann who had noticed the tone of the refusal and the gesture that had accompanied it
just a leetle drop with a little cold water and a lump of sugar mr bumble coughed
now just a leetle drop said mrs mann persuasively
what is it inquired the beadle
why its what im obliged to keep a little of in the house to put into the blessed infants daffy when they aint well mr bumble replied mrs mann as she opened a corner cupboard and took down a bottle and glass
its gin
ill not deceive you mr b its gin do you give the children daffy mrs mann inquired bumble following with his eyes the interesting process of mixing
ah bless em that i do dear as it is replied the nurse
i couldnt see em suffer before my very eyes you know sir no said mr bumble approvingly no you could not
you are a humane woman mrs mann here she set down the glass
i shall take a early opportunity of mentioning it to the board mrs mann he drew it towards him
you feel as a mother mrs mann he stirred the ginandwater
ii drink your health with cheerfulness mrs mann and he swallowed half of it
and now about business said the beadle taking out a leathern pocketbook
the child that was halfbaptized oliver twist is nine year old today bless him interposed mrs mann inflaming her left eye with the corner of her apron
and notwithstanding a offered reward of ten pound which was afterwards increased to twenty pound
notwithstanding the most superlative and i may say supernatral exertions on the part of this parish said bumble we have never been able to discover who is his father or what was his mothers settlement name or condition mrs mann raised her hands in astonishment but added after a moments reflection how comes he to have any name at all then the beadle drew himself up with great pride and said i inwented it you mr bumble i mrs mann
we name our fondlings in alphabetical order
the last was a sswubble i named him
this was a ttwist i named him
the next one comes will be unwin and the next vilkins
i have got names ready made to the end of the alphabet and all the way through it again when we come to z why youre quite a literary character sir said mrs mann
well well said the beadle evidently gratified with the compliment perhaps i may be
perhaps i may be mrs mann he finished the ginandwater and added oliver being now too old to remain here the board have determined to have him back into the house
i have come out myself to take him there
so let me see him at once ill fetch him directly said mrs mann leaving the room for that purpose
oliver having had by this time as much of the outer coat of dirt which encrusted his face and hands removed as could be scrubbed off in one washing was led into the room by his benevolent protectress
make a bow to the gentleman oliver said mrs mann
oliver made a bow which was divided between the beadle on the chair and the cocked hat on the table
will you go along with me oliver said mr bumble in a majestic voice
oliver was about to say that he would go along with anybody with great readiness when glancing upward he caught sight of mrs mann who had got behind the beadles chair and was shaking her fist at him with a furious countenance
he took the hint at once for the fist had been too often impressed upon his body not to be deeply impressed upon his recollection
will she go with me inquired poor oliver
no she cant replied mr bumble
but shell come and see you sometimes this was no very great consolation to the child
young as he was however he had sense enough to make a feint of feeling great regret at going away
it was no very difficult matter for the boy to call tears into his eyes
hunger and recent illusage are great assistants if you want to cry and oliver cried very naturally indeed
mrs mann gave him a thousand embraces and what oliver wanted a great deal more a piece of bread and butter less he should seem too hungry when he got to the workhouse
with the slice of bread in his hand and the little browncloth parish cap on his head oliver was then led away by mr bumble from the wretched home where one kind word or look had never lighted the gloom of his infant years
and yet he burst into an agony of childish grief as the cottagegate closed after him
wretched as were the little companions in misery he was leaving behind they were the only friends he had ever known and a sense of his loneliness in the great wide world sank into the childs heart for the first time
mr bumble walked on with long strides little oliver firmly grasping his goldlaced cuff trotted beside him inquiring at the end of every quarter of a mile whether they were nearly there to these interrogations mr bumble returned very brief and snappish replies for the temporary blandness which ginandwater awakens in some bosoms had by this time evaporated and he was once again a beadle
oliver had not been within the walls of the workhouse a quarter of an hour and had scarcely completed the demolition of a second slice of bread when mr bumble who had handed him over to the care of an old woman returned and telling him it was a board night informed him that the board had said he was to appear before it forthwith
not having a very clearly defined notion of what a live board was oliver was rather astounded by this intelligence and was not quite certain whether he ought to laugh or cry
he had no time to think about the matter however for mr bumble gave him a tap on the head with his cane to wake him up and another on the back to make him lively and bidding him to follow conducted him into a large whitewashed room where eight or ten fat gentlemen were sitting round a table
at the top of the table seated in an armchair rather higher than the rest was a particularly fat gentleman with a very round red face
bow to the board said bumble
oliver brushed away two or three tears that were lingering in his eyes and seeing no board but the table fortunately bowed to that
whats your name boy said the gentleman in the high chair
oliver was frightened at the sight of so many gentlemen which made him tremble and the beadle gave him another tap behind which made him cry
these two causes made him answer in a very low and hesitating voice whereupon a gentleman in a white waistcoat said he was a fool
which was a capital way of raising his spirits and putting him quite at his ease
boy said the gentleman in the high chair listen to me
you know youre an orphan i suppose whats that sir inquired poor oliver
the boy is a fooli thought he was said the gentleman in the white waistcoat
hush said the gentleman who had spoken first
you know youve got no father or mother and that you were brought up by the parish dont you yes sir replied oliver weeping bitterly
what are you crying for inquired the gentleman in the white waistcoat
and to be sure it was very extraordinary
what could the boy be crying for
i hope you say your prayers every night said another gentleman in a gruff voice and pray for the people who feed you and take care of youlike a christian yes sir stammered the boy
the gentleman who spoke last was unconsciously right
it would have been very like a christian and a marvellously good christian too if oliver had prayed for the people who fed and took care of him
but he hadnt because nobody had taught him
well
you have come here to be educated and taught a useful trade said the redfaced gentleman in the high chair
so youll begin to pick oakum tomorrow morning at six oclock added the surly one in the white waistcoat
for the combination of both these blessings in the one simple process of picking oakum oliver bowed low by the direction of the beadle and was then hurried away to a large ward where on a rough hard bed he sobbed himself to sleep
what a novel illustration of the tender laws of england
they let the paupers go to sleep
poor oliver
he little thought as he lay sleeping in happy unconsciousness of all around him that the board had that very day arrived at a decision which would exercise the most material influence over all his future fortunes
but they had
and this was it the members of this board were very sage deep philosophical men and when they came to turn their attention to the workhouse they found out at once what ordinary folks would never have discoveredthe poor people liked it
it was a regular place of public entertainment for the poorer classes a tavern where there was nothing to pay a public breakfast dinner tea and supper all the year round a brick and mortar elysium where it was all play and no work
oho said the board looking very knowing we are the fellows to set this to rights well stop it all in no time so they established the rule that all poor people should have the alternative for they would compel nobody not they of being starved by a gradual process in the house or by a quick one out of it
with this view they contracted with the waterworks to lay on an unlimited supply of water and with a cornfactor to supply periodically small quantities of oatmeal and issued three meals of thin gruel a day with an onion twice a week and half a roll of sundays
they made a great many other wise and humane regulations having reference to the ladies which it is not necessary to repeat kindly undertook to divorce poor married people in consequence of the great expense of a suit in doctors commons and instead of compelling a man to support his family as they had theretofore done took his family away from him and made him a bachelor
there is no saying how many applicants for relief under these last two heads might have started up in all classes of society if it had not been coupled with the workhouse but the board were longheaded men and had provided for this difficulty
the relief was inseparable from the workhouse and the gruel and that frightened people
for the first six months after oliver twist was removed the system was in full operation
it was rather expensive at first in consequence of the increase in the undertakers bill and the necessity of taking in the clothes of all the paupers which fluttered loosely on their wasted shrunken forms after a week or twos gruel
but the number of workhouse inmates got thin as well as the paupers and the board were in ecstasies
the room in which the boys were fed was a large stone hall with a copper at one end out of which the master dressed in an apron for the purpose and assisted by one or two women ladled the gruel at mealtimes
of this festive composition each boy had one porringer and no moreexcept on occasions of great public rejoicing when he had two ounces and a quarter of bread besides
the bowls never wanted washing
the boys polished them with their spoons till they shone again and when they had performed this operation which never took very long the spoons being nearly as large as the bowls they would sit staring at the copper with such eager eyes as if they could have devoured the very bricks of which it was composed employing themselves meanwhile in sucking their fingers most assiduously with the view of catching up any stray splashes of gruel that might have been cast thereon
boys have generally excellent appetites
oliver twist and his companions suffered the tortures of slow starvation for three months at last they got so voracious and wild with hunger that one boy who was tall for his age and hadnt been used to that sort of thing for his father had kept a small cookshop hinted darkly to his companions that unless he had another basin of gruel per diem he was afraid he might some night happen to eat the boy who slept next him who happened to be a weakly youth of tender age
he had a wild hungry eye and they implicitly believed him
a council was held lots were cast who should walk up to the master after supper that evening and ask for more and it fell to oliver twist
the evening arrived the boys took their places
the master in his cooks uniform stationed himself at the copper his pauper assistants ranged themselves behind him the gruel was served out and a long grace was said over the short commons
the gruel disappeared the boys whispered each other and winked at oliver while his next neighbors nudged him
child as he was he was desperate with hunger and reckless with misery
he rose from the table and advancing to the master basin and spoon in hand said somewhat alarmed at his own temerity please sir i want some more the master was a fat healthy man but he turned very pale
he gazed in stupefied astonishment on the small rebel for some seconds and then clung for support to the copper
the assistants were paralysed with wonder the boys with fear
what said the master at length in a faint voice
please sir replied oliver i want some more the master aimed a blow at olivers head with the ladle pinioned him in his arm and shrieked aloud for the beadle
the board were sitting in solemn conclave when mr bumble rushed into the room in great excitement and addressing the gentleman in the high chair said mr
limbkins i beg your pardon sir
oliver twist has asked for more there was a general start
horror was depicted on every countenance
for more said mr limbkins
compose yourself bumble and answer me distinctly
do i understand that he asked for more after he had eaten the supper allotted by the dietary he did sir replied bumble
that boy will be hung said the gentleman in the white waistcoat
i know that boy will be hung nobody controverted the prophetic gentlemans opinion
an animated discussion took place
oliver was ordered into instant confinement and a bill was next morning pasted on the outside of the gate offering a reward of five pounds to anybody who would take oliver twist off the hands of the parish
in other words five pounds and oliver twist were offered to any man or woman who wanted an apprentice to any trade business or calling
i never was more convinced of anything in my life said the gentleman in the white waistcoat as he knocked at the gate and read the bill next morning i never was more convinced of anything in my life than i am that that boy will come to be hung as i purpose to show in the sequel whether the white waistcoated gentleman was right or not i should perhaps mar the interest of this narrative supposing it to possess any at all if i ventured to hint just yet whether the life of oliver twist had this violent termination or no
relates how oliver twist was very near getting a place which would not have been a sinecure for a week after the commission of the impious and profane offence of asking for more oliver remained a close prisoner in the dark and solitary room to which he had been consigned by the wisdom and mercy of the board
it appears at first sight not unreasonable to suppose that if he had entertained a becoming feeling of respect for the prediction of the gentleman in the white waistcoat he would have established that sage individuals prophetic character once and for ever by tying one end of his pockethandkerchief to a hook in the wall and attaching himself to the other
to the performance of this feat however there was one obstacle namely that pockethandkerchiefs being decided articles of luxury had been for all future times and ages removed from the noses of paupers by the express order of the board in council assembled solemnly given and pronounced under their hands and seals
there was a still greater obstacle in olivers youth and childishness
he only cried bitterly all day and when the long dismal night came on spread his little hands before his eyes to shut out the darkness and crouching in the corner tried to sleep ever and anon waking with a start and tremble and drawing himself closer and closer to the wall as if to feel even its cold hard surface were a protection in the gloom and loneliness which surrounded him
let it not be supposed by the enemies of the system that during the period of his solitary incarceration oliver was denied the benefit of exercise the pleasure of society or the advantages of religious consolation
as for exercise it was nice cold weather and he was allowed to perform his ablutions every morning under the pump in a stone yard in the presence of mr bumble who prevented his catching cold and caused a tingling sensation to pervade his frame by repeated applications of the cane
as for society he was carried every other day into the hall where the boys dined and there sociably flogged as a public warning and example
and so far from being denied the advantages of religious consolation he was kicked into the same apartment every evening at prayertime and there permitted to listen to and console his mind with a general supplication of the boys containing a special clause therein inserted by authority of the board in which they entreated to be made good virtuous contented and obedient and to be guarded from the sins and vices of oliver twist whom the supplication distinctly set forth to be under the exclusive patronage and protection of the powers of wickedness and an article direct from the manufactory of the very devil himself
it chanced one morning while olivers affairs were in this auspicious and comfortable state that mr gamfield chimneysweep went his way down the high street deeply cogitating in his mind his ways and means of paying certain arrears of rent for which his landlord had become rather pressing
mr gamfields most sanguine estimate of his finances could not raise them within full five pounds of the desired amount and in a species of arithmetical desperation he was alternately cudgelling his brains and his donkey when passing the workhouse his eyes encountered the bill on the gate
woo said mr gamfield to the donkey
the donkey was in a state of profound abstraction wondering probably whether he was destined to be regaled with a cabbagestalk or two when he had disposed of the two sacks of soot with which the little cart was laden so without noticing the word of command he jogged onward
mr gamfield growled a fierce imprecation on the donkey generally but more particularly on his eyes and running after him bestowed a blow on his head which would inevitably have beaten in any skull but a donkeys
then catching hold of the bridle he gave his jaw a sharp wrench by way of gentle reminder that he was not his own master and by these means turned him round
he then gave him another blow on the head just to stun him till he came back again
having completed these arrangements he walked up to the gate to read the bill
the gentleman with the white waistcoat was standing at the gate with his hands behind him after having delivered himself of some profound sentiments in the boardroom
having witnessed the little dispute between mr gamfield and the donkey he smiled joyously when that person came up to read the bill for he saw at once that mr gamfield was exactly the sort of master oliver twist wanted
mr gamfield smiled too as he perused the document for five pounds was just the sum he had been wishing for and as to the boy with which it was encumbered mr gamfield knowing what the dietary of the workhouse was well knew he would be a nice small pattern just the very thing for register stoves
so he spelt the bill through again from beginning to end and then touching his fur cap in token of humility accosted the gentleman in the white waistcoat
this here boy sir wot the parish wants to prentis said mr gamfield
ay my man said the gentleman in the white waistcoat with a condescending smile
what of him if the parish vould like him to learn a right pleasant trade in a good spectable chimbleysweepin bisness said mr gamfield i wants a prentis and i am ready to take him walk in said the gentleman in the white waistcoat
mr gamfield having lingered behind to give the donkey another blow on the head and another wrench of the jaw as a caution not to run away in his absence followed the gentleman with the white waistcoat into the room where oliver had first seen him
its a nasty trade said mr limbkins when gamfield had again stated his wish
young boys have been smothered in chimneys before now said another gentleman
thats acause they damped the straw afore they lit it in the chimbley to make em come down again said gamfield thats all smoke and no blaze vereas smoke aint o no use at all in making a boy come down for it only sinds him to sleep and thats wot he likes
boys is wery obstinit and wery lazy genlmen and theres nothink like a good hot blaze to make em come down vith a run
its humane too genlmen acause even if theyve stuck in the chimbley roasting their feet makes em struggle to hextricate theirselves the gentleman in the white waistcoat appeared very much amused by this explanation but his mirth was speedily checked by a look from mr limbkins
the board then proceeded to converse among themselves for a few minutes but in so low a tone that the words saving of expenditure looked well in the accounts have a printed report published were alone audible
these only chanced to be heard indeed or account of their being very frequently repeated with great emphasis
at length the whispering ceased and the members of the board having resumed their seats and their solemnity mr limbkins said we have considered your proposition and we dont approve of it not at all said the gentleman in the white waistcoat
decidedly not added the other members
as mr gamfield did happen to labour under the slight imputation of having bruised three or four boys to death already it occurred to him that the board had perhaps in some unaccountable freak taken it into their heads that this extraneous circumstance ought to influence their proceedings
it was very unlike their general mode of doing business if they had but still as he had no particular wish to revive the rumour he twisted his cap in his hands and walked slowly from the table
so you wont let me have him genlmen said mr gamfield pausing near the door
no replied mr limbkins at least as its a nasty business we think you ought to take something less than the premium we offered mr gamfields countenance brightened as with a quick step he returned to the table and said whatll you give genlmen
come
dont be too hard on a poor man
whatll you give i should say three pound ten was plenty said mr limbkins
ten shillings too much said the gentleman in the white waistcoat
come said gamfield say four pound genlmen
say four pound and youve got rid of him for good and all
there three pound ten repeated mr limbkins firmly
come
ill split the difference genlmen urged gamfield
three pound fifteen not a farthing more was the firm reply of mr limbkins
youre desperate hard upon me genlmen said gamfield wavering
pooh
pooh
nonsense said the gentleman in the white waistcoat
hed be cheap with nothing at all as a premium
take him you silly fellow
hes just the boy for you
he wants the stick now and then itll do him good and his board neednt come very expensive for he hasnt been overfed since he was born
ha
ha
ha mr gamfield gave an arch look at the faces round the table and observing a smile on all of them gradually broke into a smile himself
the bargain was made
mr bumble was at once instructed that oliver twist and his indentures were to be conveyed before the magistrate for signature and approval that very afternoon
in pursuance of this determination little oliver to his excessive astonishment was released from bondage and ordered to put himself into a clean shirt
he had hardly achieved this very unusual gymnastic performance when mr bumble brought him with his own hands a basin of gruel and the holiday allowance of two ounces and a quarter of bread
at this tremendous sight oliver began to cry very piteously thinking not unnaturally that the board must have determined to kill him for some useful purpose or they never would have begun to fatten him up in that way
dont make your eyes red oliver but eat your food and be thankful said mr bumble in a tone of impressive pomposity
youre a going to be made a prentice of oliver a prentice sir said the child trembling
yes oliver said mr bumble
the kind and blessed gentleman which is so many parents to you oliver when you have none of your own are a going to prentice you and to set you up in life and make a man of you although the expense to the parish is three pound tenthree pound ten oliverseventy shillinsone hundred and forty sixpencesand all for a naughty orphan which nobody cant love as mr bumble paused to take breath after delivering this address in an awful voice the tears rolled down the poor childs face and he sobbed bitterly
come said mr bumble somewhat less pompously for it was gratifying to his feelings to observe the effect his eloquence had produced come oliver
wipe your eyes with the cuffs of your jacket and dont cry into your gruel thats a very foolish action oliver it certainly was for there was quite enough water in it already
on their way to the magistrate mr bumble instructed oliver that all he would have to do would be to look very happy and say when the gentleman asked him if he wanted to be apprenticed that he should like it very much indeed both of which injunctions oliver promised to obey the rather as mr bumble threw in a gentle hint that if he failed in either particular there was no telling what would be done to him
when they arrived at the office he was shut up in a little room by himself and admonished by mr bumble to stay there until he came back to fetch him
there the boy remained with a palpitating heart for half an hour
at the expiration of which time mr bumble thrust in his head unadorned with the cocked hat and said aloud now oliver my dear come to the gentleman as mr bumble said this he put on a grim and threatening look and added in a low voice mind what i told you you young rascal oliver stared innocently in mr bumbles face at this somewhat contradictory style of address but that gentleman prevented his offering any remark thereupon by leading him at once into an adjoining room the door of which was open
it was a large room with a great window
behind a desk sat two old gentleman with powdered heads one of whom was reading the newspaper while the other was perusing with the aid of a pair of tortoiseshell spectacles a small piece of parchment which lay before him
mr limbkins was standing in front of the desk on one side and mr gamfield with a partially washed face on the other while two or three blufflooking men in topboots were lounging about
the old gentleman with the spectacles gradually dozed off over the little bit of parchment and there was a short pause after oliver had been stationed by mr bumble in front of the desk
this is the boy your worship said mr bumble
the old gentleman who was reading the newspaper raised his head for a moment and pulled the other old gentleman by the sleeve whereupon the lastmentioned old gentleman woke up
oh is this the boy said the old gentleman
this is him sir replied mr bumble
bow to the magistrate my dear oliver roused himself and made his best obeisance
he had been wondering with his eyes fixed on the magistrates powder whether all boards were born with that white stuff on their heads and were boards from thenceforth on that account
well said the old gentleman i suppose hes fond of chimneysweeping he doats on it your worship replied bumble giving oliver a sly pinch to intimate that he had better not say he didnt
and he will be a sweep will he inquired the old gentleman
if we was to bind him to any other trade tomorrow hed run away simultaneous your worship replied bumble
and this man thats to be his masteryou siryoull treat him well and feed him and do all that sort of thing will you said the old gentleman
when i says i will i means i will replied mr gamfield doggedly
youre a rough speaker my friend but you look an honest openhearted man said the old gentleman turning his spectacles in the direction of the candidate for olivers premium whose villainous countenance was a regular stamped receipt for cruelty
but the magistrate was half blind and half childish so he couldnt reasonably be expected to discern what other people did
i hope i am sir said mr gamfield with an ugly leer
i have no doubt you are my friend replied the old gentleman fixing his spectacles more firmly on his nose and looking about him for the inkstand
it was the critical moment of olivers fate
if the inkstand had been where the old gentleman thought it was he would have dipped his pen into it and signed the indentures and oliver would have been straightway hurried off
but as it chanced to be immediately under his nose it followed as a matter of course that he looked all over his desk for it without finding it and happening in the course of his search to look straight before him his gaze encountered the pale and terrified face of oliver twist who despite all the admonitory looks and pinches of bumble was regarding the repulsive countenance of his future master with a mingled expression of horror and fear too palpable to be mistaken even by a halfblind magistrate
the old gentleman stopped laid down his pen and looked from oliver to mr limbkins who attempted to take snuff with a cheerful and unconcerned aspect
my boy said the old gentleman you look pale and alarmed
what is the matter stand a little away from him beadle said the other magistrate laying aside the paper and leaning forward with an expression of interest
now boy tell us whats the matter dont be afraid oliver fell on his knees and clasping his hands together prayed that they would order him back to the dark roomthat they would starve himbeat himkill him if they pleasedrather than send him away with that dreadful man
well said mr bumble raising his hands and eyes with most impressive solemnity
well
of all the artful and designing orphans that ever i see oliver you are one of the most barefacedest hold your tongue beadle said the second old gentleman when mr bumble had given vent to this compound adjective
i beg your worships pardon said mr bumble incredulous of having heard aright
did your worship speak to me yes
hold your tongue mr bumble was stupefied with astonishment
a beadle ordered to hold his tongue
a moral revolution
the old gentleman in the tortoiseshell spectacles looked at his companion he nodded significantly
we refuse to sanction these indentures said the old gentleman tossing aside the piece of parchment as he spoke
i hope stammered mr limbkins i hope the magistrates will not form the opinion that the authorities have been guilty of any improper conduct on the unsupported testimony of a child the magistrates are not called upon to pronounce any opinion on the matter said the second old gentleman sharply
take the boy back to the workhouse and treat him kindly
he seems to want it that same evening the gentleman in the white waistcoat most positively and decidedly affirmed not only that oliver would be hung but that he would be drawn and quartered into the bargain
mr bumble shook his head with gloomy mystery and said he wished he might come to good whereunto mr gamfield replied that he wished he might come to him which although he agreed with the beadle in most matters would seem to be a wish of a totally opposite description
the next morning the public were once informed that oliver twist was again to let and that five pounds would be paid to anybody who would take possession of him
oliver being offered another place makes his first entry into public life in great families when an advantageous place cannot be obtained either in possession reversion remainder or expectancy for the young man who is growing up it is a very general custom to send him to sea
the board in imitation of so wise and salutary an example took counsel together on the expediency of shipping off oliver twist in some small trading vessel bound to a good unhealthy port
this suggested itself as the very best thing that could possibly be done with him the probability being that the skipper would flog him to death in a playful mood some day after dinner or would knock his brains out with an iron bar both pastimes being as is pretty generally known very favourite and common recreations among gentleman of that class
the more the case presented itself to the board in this point of view the more manifold the advantages of the step appeared so they came to the conclusion that the only way of providing for oliver effectually was to send him to sea without delay
mr bumble had been despatched to make various preliminary inquiries with the view of finding out some captain or other who wanted a cabinboy without any friends and was returning to the workhouse to communicate the result of his mission when he encountered at the gate no less a person than mr sowerberry the parochial undertaker
mr sowerberry was a tall gaunt largejointed man attired in a suit of threadbare black with darned cotton stockings of the same colour and shoes to answer
his features were not naturally intended to wear a smiling aspect but he was in general rather given to professional jocosity
his step was elastic and his face betokened inward pleasantry as he advanced to mr bumble and shook him cordially by the hand
i have taken the measure of the two women that died last night mr bumble said the undertaker
youll make your fortune mr sowerberry said the beadle as he thrust his thumb and forefinger into the proffered snuffbox of the undertaker which was an ingenious little model of a patent coffin
i say youll make your fortune mr sowerberry repeated mr bumble tapping the undertaker on the shoulder in a friendly manner with his cane
think so said the undertaker in a tone which half admitted and half disputed the probability of the event
the prices allowed by the board are very small mr bumble so are the coffins replied the beadle with precisely as near an approach to a laugh as a great official ought to indulge in
mr sowerberry was much tickled at this as of course he ought to be and laughed a long time without cessation
well well mr bumble he said at length theres no denying that since the new system of feeding has come in the coffins are something narrower and more shallow than they used to be but we must have some profit mr bumble
wellseasoned timber is an expensive article sir and all the iron handles come by canal from birmingham well well said mr bumble every trade has its drawbacks
a fair profit is of course allowable of course of course replied the undertaker and if i dont get a profit upon this or that particular article why i make it up in the longrun you seehe
he
he just so said mr bumble
though i must say continued the undertaker resuming the current of observations which the beadle had interrupted though i must say mr bumble that i have to contend against one very great disadvantage which is that all the stout people go off the quickest
the people who have been better off and have paid rates for many years are the first to sink when they come into the house and let me tell you mr bumble that three or four inches over ones calculation makes a great hole in ones profits especially when one has a family to provide for sir as mr sowerberry said this with the becoming indignation of an illused man and as mr bumble felt that it rather tended to convey a reflection on the honour of the parish the latter gentleman thought it advisable to change the subject
oliver twist being uppermost in his mind he made him his theme
by the bye said mr bumble you dont know anybody who wants a boy do you
a porochial prentis who is at present a deadweight a millstone as i may say round the porochial throat
liberal terms mr sowerberry liberal terms as mr bumble spoke he raised his cane to the bill above him and gave three distinct raps upon the words five pounds which were printed thereon in roman capitals of gigantic size
gadso said the undertaker taking mr bumble by the giltedged lappel of his official coat thats just the very thing i wanted to speak to you about
you knowdear me what a very elegant button this is mr bumble
i never noticed it before yes i think it rather pretty said the beadle glancing proudly downwards at the large brass buttons which embellished his coat
the die is the same as the porochial sealthe good samaritan healing the sick and bruised man
the board presented it to me on newyears morning mr sowerberry
i put it on i remember for the first time to attend the inquest on that reduced tradesman who died in a doorway at midnight i recollect said the undertaker
the jury brought it in died from exposure to the cold and want of the common necessaries of life didnt they mr bumble nodded
and they made it a special verdict i think said the undertaker by adding some words to the effect that if the relieving officer had tush
foolery interposed the beadle
if the board attended to all the nonsense that ignorant jurymen talk theyd have enough to do very true said the undertaker they would indeed juries said mr bumble grasping his cane tightly as was his wont when working into a passion juries is ineddicated vulgar grovelling wretches so they are said the undertaker
they havent no more philosophy nor political economy about em than that said the beadle snapping his fingers contemptuously
no more they have acquiesced the undertaker
i despise em said the beadle growing very red in the face
so do i rejoined the undertaker
and i only wish wed a jury of the independent sort in the house for a week or two said the beadle the rules and regulations of the board would soon bring their spirit down for em let em alone for that replied the undertaker
so saying he smiled approvingly to calm the rising wrath of the indignant parish officer
mr bumble lifted off his cocked hat took a handkerchief from the inside of the crown wiped from his forehead the perspiration which his rage had engendered fixed the cocked hat on again and turning to the undertaker said in a calmer voice well what about the boy oh replied the undertaker why you know mr bumble i pay a good deal towards the poors rates hem said mr bumble
well well replied the undertaker i was thinking that if i pay so much towards em ive a right to get as much out of em as i can mr bumble and soi think ill take the boy myself mr bumble grasped the undertaker by the arm and led him into the building
mr sowerberry was closeted with the board for five minutes and it was arranged that oliver should go to him that evening upon likinga phrase which means in the case of a parish apprentice that if the master find upon a short trial that he can get enough work out of a boy without putting too much food into him he shall have him for a term of years to do what he likes with
when little oliver was taken before the gentlemen that evening and informed that he was to go that night as general houselad to a coffinmakers and that if he complained of his situation or ever came back to the parish again he would be sent to sea there to be drowned or knocked on the head as the case might be he evinced so little emotion that they by common consent pronounced him a hardened young rascal and ordered mr bumble to remove him forthwith
now although it was very natural that the board of all people in the world should feel in a great state of virtuous astonishment and horror at the smallest tokens of want of feeling on the part of anybody they were rather out in this particular instance
the simple fact was that oliver instead of possessing too little feeling possessed rather too much and was in a fair way of being reduced for life to a state of brutal stupidity and sullenness by the ill usage he had received
he heard the news of his destination in perfect silence and having had his luggage put into his handwhich was not very difficult to carry inasmuch as it was all comprised within the limits of a brown paper parcel about half a foot square by three inches deephe pulled his cap over his eyes and once more attaching himself to mr bumbles coat cuff was led away by that dignitary to a new scene of suffering
for some time mr bumble drew oliver along without notice or remark for the beadle carried his head very erect as a beadle always should and it being a windy day little oliver was completely enshrouded by the skirts of mr bumbles coat as they blew open and disclosed to great advantage his flapped waistcoat and drab plush kneebreeches
as they drew near to their destination however mr bumble thought it expedient to look down and see that the boy was in good order for inspection by his new master which he accordingly did with a fit and becoming air of gracious patronage
oliver said mr bumble
yes sir replied oliver in a low tremulous voice
pull that cap off your eyes and hold up your head sir although oliver did as he was desired at once and passed the back of his unoccupied hand briskly across his eyes he left a tear in them when he looked up at his conductor
as mr bumble gazed sternly upon him it rolled down his cheek
it was followed by another and another
the child made a strong effort but it was an unsuccessful one
withdrawing his other hand from mr bumbles he covered his face with both and wept until the tears sprung out from between his chin and bony fingers
well exclaimed mr bumble stopping short and darting at his little charge a look of intense malignity
well
of all the ungratefullest and worstdisposed boys as ever i see oliver you are the no no sir sobbed oliver clinging to the hand which held the wellknown cane no no sir i will be good indeed indeed indeed i will sir
i am a very little boy sir and it is soso so what inquired mr bumble in amazement
so lonely sir
so very lonely cried the child
everybody hates me
oh
sir dont dont pray be cross to me the child beat his hand upon his heart and looked in his companions face with tears of real agony
mr bumble regarded olivers piteous and helpless look with some astonishment for a few seconds hemmed three or four times in a husky manner and after muttering something about that troublesome cough bade oliver dry his eyes and be a good boy
then once more taking his hand he walked on with him in silence
the undertaker who had just put up the shutters of his shop was making some entries in his daybook by the light of a most appropriate dismal candle when mr bumble entered
aha said the undertaker looking up from the book and pausing in the middle of a word is that you bumble no one else mr sowerberry replied the beadle
here
ive brought the boy oliver made a bow
oh
thats the boy is it said the undertaker raising the candle above his head to get a better view of oliver
mrs
sowerberry will you have the goodness to come here a moment my dear mrs sowerberry emerged from a little room behind the shop and presented the form of a short thin squeezedup woman with a vixenish countenance
my dear said mr sowerberry deferentially this is the boy from the workhouse that i told you of oliver bowed again
dear me said the undertakers wife hes very small why he is rather small replied mr bumble looking at oliver as if it were his fault that he was no bigger he is small
theres no denying it
but hell grow mrs sowerberryhell grow ah
i dare say he will replied the lady pettishly on our victuals and our drink
i see no saving in parish children not i for they always cost more to keep than theyre worth
however men always think they know best
there
get downstairs little bag o bones with this the undertakers wife opened a side door and pushed oliver down a steep flight of stairs into a stone cell damp and dark forming the anteroom to the coalcellar and denominated kitchen wherein sat a slatternly girl in shoes down at heel and blue worsted stockings very much out of repair
here charlotte said mr sowerberry who had followed oliver down give this boy some of the cold bits that were put by for trip
he hasnt come home since the morning so he may go without em
i dare say the boy isnt too dainty to eat emare you boy oliver whose eyes had glistened at the mention of meat and who was trembling with eagerness to devour it replied in the negative and a plateful of coarse broken victuals was set before him
i wish some wellfed philosopher whose meat and drink turn to gall within him whose blood is ice whose heart is iron could have seen oliver twist clutching at the dainty viands that the dog had neglected
i wish he could have witnessed the horrible avidity with which oliver tore the bits asunder with all the ferocity of famine
there is only one thing i should like better and that would be to see the philosopher making the same sort of meal himself with the same relish
well said the undertakers wife when oliver had finished his supper which she had regarded in silent horror and with fearful auguries of his future appetite have you done there being nothing eatable within his reach oliver replied in the affirmative
then come with me said mrs sowerberry taking up a dim and dirty lamp and leading the way upstairs your beds under the counter
you dont mind sleeping among the coffins i suppose
but it doesnt much matter whether you do or dont for you cant sleep anywhere else
come dont keep me here all night oliver lingered no longer but meekly followed his new mistress
oliver mingles with new associates
going to a funeral for the first time he forms an unfavourable notion of his masters business oliver being left to himself in the undertakers shop set the lamp down on a workmans bench and gazed timidly about him with a feeling of awe and dread which many people a good deal older than he will be at no loss to understand
an unfinished coffin on black tressels which stood in the middle of the shop looked so gloomy and deathlike that a cold tremble came over him every time his eyes wandered in the direction of the dismal object from which he almost expected to see some frightful form slowly rear its head to drive him mad with terror
against the wall were ranged in regular array a long row of elm boards cut in the same shape looking in the dim light like highshouldered ghosts with their hands in their breeches pockets
coffinplates elmchips brightheaded nails and shreds of black cloth lay scattered on the floor and the wall behind the counter was ornamented with a lively representation of two mutes in very stiff neckcloths on duty at a large private door with a hearse drawn by four black steeds approaching in the distance
the shop was close and hot
the atmosphere seemed tainted with the smell of coffins
the recess beneath the counter in which his flock mattress was thrust looked like a grave
nor were these the only dismal feelings which depressed oliver
he was alone in a strange place and we all know how chilled and desolate the best of us will sometimes feel in such a situation
the boy had no friends to care for or to care for him
the regret of no recent separation was fresh in his mind the absence of no loved and wellremembered face sank heavily into his heart
but his heart was heavy notwithstanding and he wished as he crept into his narrow bed that that were his coffin and that he could be lain in a calm and lasting sleep in the churchyard ground with the tall grass waving gently above his head and the sound of the old deep bell to soothe him in his sleep
oliver was awakened in the morning by a loud kicking at the outside of the shopdoor which before he could huddle on his clothes was repeated in an angry and impetuous manner about twentyfive times
when he began to undo the chain the legs desisted and a voice began
open the door will yer cried the voice which belonged to the legs which had kicked at the door
i will directly sir replied oliver undoing the chain and turning the key
i suppose yer the new boy aint yer said the voice through the keyhole
yes sir replied oliver
how old are yer inquired the voice
ten sir replied oliver
then ill whop yer when i get in said the voice you just see if i dont thats all my workus brat and having made this obliging promise the voice began to whistle
oliver had been too often subjected to the process to which the very expressive monosyllable just recorded bears reference to entertain the smallest doubt that the owner of the voice whoever he might be would redeem his pledge most honourably
he drew back the bolts with a trembling hand and opened the door
for a second or two oliver glanced up the street and down the street and over the way impressed with the belief that the unknown who had addressed him through the keyhole had walked a few paces off to warm himself for nobody did he see but a big charityboy sitting on a post in front of the house eating a slice of bread and butter which he cut into wedges the size of his mouth with a claspknife and then consumed with great dexterity
i beg your pardon sir said oliver at length seeing that no other visitor made his appearance did you knock i kicked replied the charityboy
did you want a coffin sir inquired oliver innocently
at this the charityboy looked monstrous fierce and said that oliver would want one before long if he cut jokes with his superiors in that way
yer dont know who i am i suppose workus said the charityboy in continuation descending from the top of the post meanwhile with edifying gravity
no sir rejoined oliver
im mister noah claypole said the charityboy and youre under me
take down the shutters yer idle young ruffian with this mr claypole administered a kick to oliver and entered the shop with a dignified air which did him great credit
it is difficult for a largeheaded smalleyed youth of lumbering make and heavy countenance to look dignified under any circumstances but it is more especially so when superadded to these personal attractions are a red nose and yellow smalls
oliver having taken down the shutters and broken a pane of glass in his effort to stagger away beneath the weight of the first one to a small court at the side of the house in which they were kept during the day was graciously assisted by noah who having consoled him with the assurance that hed catch it condescended to help him
mr sowerberry came down soon after
shortly afterwards mrs sowerberry appeared
oliver having caught it in fulfilment of noahs prediction followed that young gentleman down the stairs to breakfast
come near the fire noah said charlotte
i saved a nice little bit of bacon for you from masters breakfast
oliver shut that door at mister noahs back and take them bits that ive put out on the cover of the breadpan
theres your tea take it away to that box and drink it there and make haste for theyll want you to mind the shop
dye hear dye hear workus said noah claypole
lor noah said charlotte what a rum creature you are
why dont you let the boy alone let him alone said noah
why everybody lets him alone enough for the matter of that
neither his father nor his mother will ever interfere with him
all his relations let him have his own way pretty well
eh charlotte
he
he
he oh you queer soul said charlotte bursting into a hearty laugh in which she was joined by noah after which they both looked scornfully at poor oliver twist as he sat shivering on the box in the coldest corner of the room and ate the stale pieces which had been specially reserved for him
noah was a charityboy but not a workhouse orphan
no chancechild was he for he could trace his genealogy all the way back to his parents who lived hard by his mother being a washerwoman and his father a drunken soldier discharged with a wooden leg and a diurnal pension of twopencehalfpenny and an unstateable fraction
the shopboys in the neighbourhood had long been in the habit of branding noah in the public streets with the ignominious epithets of leathers charity and the like and noah had bourne them without reply
but now that fortune had cast in his way a nameless orphan at whom even the meanest could point the finger of scorn he retorted on him with interest
this affords charming food for contemplation
it shows us what a beautiful thing human nature may be made to be and how impartially the same amiable qualities are developed in the finest lord and the dirtiest charityboy
oliver had been sojourning at the undertakers some three weeks or a month
mr and mrs sowerberrythe shop being shut upwere taking their supper in the little backparlour when mr sowerberry after several deferential glances at his wife said my dear he was going to say more but mrs sowerberry looking up with a peculiarly unpropitious aspect he stopped short
well said mrs sowerberry sharply
nothing my dear nothing said mr sowerberry
ugh you brute said mrs sowerberry
not at all my dear said mr sowerberry humbly
i thought you didnt want to hear my dear
i was only going to say oh dont tell me what you were going to say interposed mrs sowerberry
i am nobody dont consult me pray
i dont want to intrude upon your secrets as mrs sowerberry said this she gave an hysterical laugh which threatened violent consequences
but my dear said sowerberry i want to ask your advice no no dont ask mine replied mrs sowerberry in an affecting manner ask somebody elses here there was another hysterical laugh which frightened mr sowerberry very much
this is a very common and muchapproved matrimonial course of treatment which is often very effective
it at once reduced mr sowerberry to begging as a special favour to be allowed to say what mrs sowerberry was most curious to hear
after a short duration the permission was most graciously conceded
its only about young twist my dear said mr sowerberry
a very goodlooking boy that my dear he need be for he eats enough observed the lady
theres an expression of melancholy in his face my dear resumed mr sowerberry which is very interesting
he would make a delightful mute my love mrs sowerberry looked up with an expression of considerable wonderment
mr sowerberry remarked it and without allowing time for any observation on the good ladys part proceeded
i dont mean a regular mute to attend grownup people my dear but only for childrens practice
it would be very new to have a mute in proportion my dear
you may depend upon it it would have a superb effect mrs sowerberry who had a good deal of taste in the undertaking way was much struck by the novelty of this idea but as it would have been compromising her dignity to have said so under existing circumstances she merely inquired with much sharpness why such an obvious suggestion had not presented itself to her husbands mind before
mr sowerberry rightly construed this as an acquiescence in his proposition it was speedily determined therefore that oliver should be at once initiated into the mysteries of the trade and with this view that he should accompany his master on the very next occasion of his services being required
the occasion was not long in coming
half an hour after breakfast next morning mr bumble entered the shop and supporting his cane against the counter drew forth his large leathern pocketbook from which he selected a small scrap of paper which he handed over to sowerberry
aha said the undertaker glancing over it with a lively countenance an order for a coffin eh for a coffin first and a porochial funeral afterwards replied mr bumble fastening the strap of the leathern pocketbook which like himself was very corpulent
bayton said the undertaker looking from the scrap of paper to mr bumble
i never heard the name before bumble shook his head as he replied obstinate people mr sowerberry very obstinate
proud too im afraid sir proud eh exclaimed mr sowerberry with a sneer
come thats too much oh its sickening replied the beadle
antimonial mr sowerberry so it is acquiesced the undertaker
we only heard of the family the night before last said the beadle and we shouldnt have known anything about them then only a woman who lodges in the same house made an application to the porochial committee for them to send the porochial surgeon to see a woman as was very bad
he had gone out to dinner but his prentice which is a very clever lad sent em some medicine in a blackingbottle offhand ah theres promptness said the undertaker
promptness indeed replied the beadle
but whats the consequence whats the ungrateful behaviour of these rebels sir
why the husband sends back word that the medicine wont suit his wifes complaint and so she shant take itsays she shant take it sir
good strong wholesome medicine as was given with great success to two irish labourers and a coalheaver only a week beforesent em for nothing with a blackinbottle inand he sends back word that she shant take it sir as the atrocity presented itself to mr bumbles mind in full force he struck the counter sharply with his cane and became flushed with indignation
well said the undertaker i neverdid never did sir ejaculated the beadle
no nor nobody never did but now shes dead weve got to bury her and thats the direction and the sooner its done the better thus saying mr bumble put on his cocked hat wrong side first in a fever of parochial excitement and flounced out of the shop
why he was so angry oliver that he forgot even to ask after you said mr sowerberry looking after the beadle as he strode down the street
yes sir replied oliver who had carefully kept himself out of sight during the interview and who was shaking from head to foot at the mere recollection of the sound of mr bumbles voice
he neednt haven taken the trouble to shrink from mr bumbles glance however for that functionary on whom the prediction of the gentleman in the white waistcoat had made a very strong impression thought that now the undertaker had got oliver upon trial the subject was better avoided until such time as he should be firmly bound for seven years and all danger of his being returned upon the hands of the parish should be thus effectually and legally overcome
well said mr sowerberry taking up his hat the sooner this job is done the better
noah look after the shop
oliver put on your cap and come with me oliver obeyed and followed his master on his professional mission
they walked on for some time through the most crowded and densely inhabited part of the town and then striking down a narrow street more dirty and miserable than any they had yet passed through paused to look for the house which was the object of their search
the houses on either side were high and large but very old and tenanted by people of the poorest class as their neglected appearance would have sufficiently denoted without the concurrent testimony afforded by the squalid looks of the few men and women who with folded arms and bodies half doubled occasionally skulked along
a great many of the tenements had shopfronts but these were fast closed and mouldering away only the upper rooms being inhabited
some houses which had become insecure from age and decay were prevented from falling into the street by huge beams of wood reared against the walls and firmly planted in the road but even these crazy dens seemed to have been selected as the nightly haunts of some houseless wretches for many of the rough boards which supplied the place of door and window were wrenched from their positions to afford an aperture wide enough for the passage of a human body
the kennel was stagnant and filthy
the very rats which here and there lay putrefying in its rottenness were hideous with famine
there was neither knocker nor bellhandle at the open door where oliver and his master stopped so groping his way cautiously through the dark passage and bidding oliver keep close to him and not be afraid the undertaker mounted to the top of the first flight of stairs
stumbling against a door on the landing he rapped at it with his knuckles
it was opened by a young girl of thirteen or fourteen
the undertaker at once saw enough of what the room contained to know it was the apartment to which he had been directed
he stepped in oliver followed him
there was no fire in the room but a man was crouching mechanically over the empty stove
an old woman too had drawn a low stool to the cold hearth and was sitting beside him
there were some ragged children in another corner and in a small recess opposite the door there lay upon the ground something covered with an old blanket
oliver shuddered as he cast his eyes toward the place and crept involuntarily closer to his master for though it was covered up the boy felt that it was a corpse
the mans face was thin and very pale his hair and beard were grizzly his eyes were bloodshot
the old womans face was wrinkled her two remaining teeth protruded over her under lip and her eyes were bright and piercing
oliver was afraid to look at either her or the man
they seemed so like the rats he had seen outside
nobody shall go near her said the man starting fiercely up as the undertaker approached the recess
keep back
damn you keep back if youve a life to lose nonsense my good man said the undertaker who was pretty well used to misery in all its shapes
nonsense i tell you said the man clenching his hands and stamping furiously on the floori tell you i wont have her put into the ground
she couldnt rest there
the worms would worry hernot eat hershe is so worn away the undertaker offered no reply to this raving but producing a tape from his pocket knelt down for a moment by the side of the body
ah said the man bursting into tears and sinking on his knees at the feet of the dead woman kneel down kneel downkneel round her every one of you and mark my words
i say she was starved to death
i never knew how bad she was till the fever came upon her and then her bones were starting through the skin
there was neither fire nor candle she died in the darkin the dark
she couldnt even see her childrens faces though we heard her gasping out their names
i begged for her in the streets and they sent me to prison
when i came back she was dying and all the blood in my heart has dried up for they starved her to death
i swear it before the god that saw it
they starved her he twined his hands in his hair and with a loud scream rolled grovelling upon the floor his eyes fixed and the foam covering his lips
the terrified children cried bitterly but the old woman who had hitherto remained as quiet as if she had been wholly deaf to all that passed menaced them into silence
having unloosened the cravat of the man who still remained extended on the ground she tottered towards the undertaker
she was my daughter said the old woman nodding her head in the direction of the corpse and speaking with an idiotic leer more ghastly than even the presence of death in such a place
lord lord
well it is strange that i who gave birth to her and was a woman then should be alive and merry now and she lying there so cold and stiff
lord lordto think of it its as good as a playas good as a play as the wretched creature mumbled and chuckled in her hideous merriment the undertaker turned to go away
stop stop said the old woman in a loud whisper
will she be buried tomorrow or next day or tonight
i laid her out and i must walk you know
send me a large cloak a good warm one for it is bitter cold
we should have cake and wine too before we go
never mind send some breadonly a loaf of bread and a cup of water
shall we have some bread dear she said eagerly catching at the undertakers coat as he once more moved towards the door
yes yes said the undertaker of course
anything you like he disengaged himself from the old womans grasp and drawing oliver after him hurried away
the next day the family having been meanwhile relieved with a halfquartern loaf and a piece of cheese left with them by mr bumble himself oliver and his master returned to the miserable abode where mr bumble had already arrived accompanied by four men from the workhouse who were to act as bearers
an old black cloak had been thrown over the rags of the old woman and the man and the bare coffin having been screwed down was hoisted on the shoulders of the bearers and carried into the street
now you must put your best leg foremost old lady whispered sowerberry in the old womans ear we are rather late and it wont do to keep the clergyman waiting
move on my menas quick as you like thus directed the bearers trotted on under their light burden and the two mourners kept as near them as they could
mr bumble and sowerberry walked at a good smart pace in front and oliver whose legs were not so long as his masters ran by the side
there was not so great a necessity for hurrying as mr sowerberry had anticipated however for when they reached the obscure corner of the churchyard in which the nettles grew and where the parish graves were made the clergyman had not arrived and the clerk who was sitting by the vestryroom fire seemed to think it by no means improbable that it might be an hour or so before he came
so they put the bier on the brink of the grave and the two mourners waited patiently in the damp clay with a cold rain drizzling down while the ragged boys whom the spectacle had attracted into the churchyard played a noisy game at hideandseek among the tombstones or varied their amusements by jumping backwards and forwards over the coffin
mr sowerberry and bumble being personal friends of the clerk sat by the fire with him and read the paper
at length after a lapse of something more than an hour mr bumble and sowerberry and the clerk were seen running towards the grave
immediately afterwards the clergyman appeared putting on his surplice as he came along
mr bumble then thrashed a boy or two to keep up appearances and the reverend gentleman having read as much of the burial service as could be compressed into four minutes gave his surplice to the clerk and walked away again
now bill said sowerberry to the gravedigger
fill up it was no very difficult task for the grave was so full that the uppermost coffin was within a few feet of the surface
the gravedigger shovelled in the earth stamped it loosely down with his feet shouldered his spade and walked off followed by the boys who murmured very loud complaints at the fun being over so soon
come my good fellow said bumble tapping the man on the back
they want to shut up the yard the man who had never once moved since he had taken his station by the grave side started raised his head stared at the person who had addressed him walked forward for a few paces and fell down in a swoon
the crazy old woman was too much occupied in bewailing the loss of her cloak which the undertaker had taken off to pay him any attention so they threw a can of cold water over him and when he came to saw him safely out of the churchyard locked the gate and departed on their different ways
well oliver said sowerberry as they walked home how do you like it pretty well thank you sir replied oliver with considerable hesitation
not very much sir ah youll get used to it in time oliver said sowerberry
nothing when you are used to it my boy oliver wondered in his own mind whether it had taken a very long time to get mr sowerberry used to it
but he thought it better not to ask the question and walked back to the shop thinking over all he had seen and heard
oliver being goaded by the taunts of noah rouses into action and rather astonishes him the months trial over oliver was formally apprenticed
it was a nice sickly season just at this time
in commercial phrase coffins were looking up and in the course of a few weeks oliver acquired a great deal of experience
the success of mr sowerberrys ingenious speculation exceeded even his most sanguine hopes
the oldest inhabitants recollected no period at which measles had been so prevalent or so fatal to infant existence and many were the mournful processions which little oliver headed in a hatband reaching down to his knees to the indescribable admiration and emotion of all the mothers in the town
as oliver accompanied his master in most of his adult expeditions too in order that he might acquire that equanimity of demeanour and full command of nerve which was essential to a finished undertaker he had many opportunities of observing the beautiful resignation and fortitude with which some strongminded people bear their trials and losses
for instance when sowerberry had an order for the burial of some rich old lady or gentleman who was surrounded by a great number of nephews and nieces who had been perfectly inconsolable during the previous illness and whose grief had been wholly irrepressible even on the most public occasions they would be as happy among themselves as need bequite cheerful and contentedconversing together with as much freedom and gaiety as if nothing whatever had happened to disturb them
husbands too bore the loss of their wives with the most heroic calmness
wives again put on weeds for their husbands as if so far from grieving in the garb of sorrow they had made up their minds to render it as becoming and attractive as possible
it was observable too that ladies and gentlemen who were in passions of anguish during the ceremony of interment recovered almost as soon as they reached home and became quite composed before the teadrinking was over
all this was very pleasant and improving to see and oliver beheld it with great admiration
that oliver twist was moved to resignation by the example of these good people i cannot although i am his biographer undertake to affirm with any degree of confidence but i can most distinctly say that for many months he continued meekly to submit to the domination and illtreatment of noah claypole who used him far worse than before now that his jealousy was roused by seeing the new boy promoted to the black stick and hatband while he the old one remained stationary in the muffincap and leathers
charlotte treated him ill because noah did and mrs sowerberry was his decided enemy because mr sowerberry was disposed to be his friend so between these three on one side and a glut of funerals on the other oliver was not altogether as comfortable as the hungry pig was when he was shut up by mistake in the grain department of a brewery
and now i come to a very important passage in olivers history for i have to record an act slight and unimportant perhaps in appearance but which indirectly produced a material change in all his future prospects and proceedings
one day oliver and noah had descended into the kitchen at the usual dinnerhour to banquet upon a small joint of muttona pound and a half of the worst end of the neckwhen charlotte being called out of the way there ensued a brief interval of time which noah claypole being hungry and vicious considered he could not possibly devote to a worthier purpose than aggravating and tantalising young oliver twist
intent upon this innocent amusement noah put his feet on the tablecloth and pulled olivers hair and twitched his ears and expressed his opinion that he was a sneak and furthermore announced his intention of coming to see him hanged whenever that desirable event should take place and entered upon various topics of petty annoyance like a malicious and illconditioned charityboy as he was
but making oliver cry noah attempted to be more facetious still and in his attempt did what many sometimes do to this day when they want to be funny
he got rather personal
workus said noah hows your mother shes dead replied oliver dont you say anything about her to me olivers colour rose as he said this he breathed quickly and there was a curious working of the mouth and nostrils which mr claypole thought must be the immediate precursor of a violent fit of crying
under this impression he returned to the charge
what did she die of workus said noah
of a broken heart some of our old nurses told me replied oliver more as if he were talking to himself than answering noah
i think i know what it must be to die of that tol de rol lol lol right fol lairy workus said noah as a tear rolled down olivers cheek
whats set you a snivelling now not you replied oliver sharply
there thats enough
dont say anything more to me about her youd better not better not exclaimed noah
well
better not
workus dont be impudent
your mother too
she was a nice un she was
oh lor and here noah nodded his head expressively and curled up as much of his small red nose as muscular action could collect together for the occasion
yer know workus continued noah emboldened by olivers silence and speaking in a jeering tone of affected pity of all tones the most annoying yer know workus it cant be helped now and of course yer couldnt help it then and i am very sorry for it and im sure we all are and pity yer very much
but yer must know workus yer mother was a regular rightdown bad un what did you say inquired oliver looking up very quickly
a regular rightdown bad un workus replied noah coolly
and its a great deal better workus that she died when she did or else shed have been hard labouring in bridewell or transported or hung which is more likely than either isnt it crimson with fury oliver started up overthrew the chair and table seized noah by the throat shook him in the violence of his rage till his teeth chattered in his head and collecting his whole force into one heavy blow felled him to the ground
a minute ago the boy had looked the quiet child mild dejected creature that harsh treatment had made him
but his spirit was roused at last the cruel insult to his dead mother had set his blood on fire
his breast heaved his attitude was erect his eye bright and vivid his whole person changed as he stood glaring over the cowardly tormentor who now lay crouching at his feet and defied him with an energy he had never known before
hell murder me blubbered noah
charlotte
missis
heres the new boy a murdering of me
help
help
olivers gone mad
charlotte noahs shouts were responded to by a loud scream from charlotte and a louder from mrs sowerberry the former of whom rushed into the kitchen by a sidedoor while the latter paused on the staircase till she was quite certain that it was consistent with the preservation of human life to come further down
oh you little wretch screamed charlotte seizing oliver with her utmost force which was about equal to that of a moderately strong man in particularly good training
oh you little ungrateful murderous horrid villain and between every syllable charlotte gave oliver a blow with all her might accompanying it with a scream for the benefit of society
charlottes fist was by no means a light one but lest it should not be effectual in calming olivers wrath mrs sowerberry plunged into the kitchen and assisted to hold him with one hand while she scratched his face with the other
in this favourable position of affairs noah rose from the ground and pommelled him behind
this was rather too violent exercise to last long
when they were all wearied out and could tear and beat no longer they dragged oliver struggling and shouting but nothing daunted into the dustcellar and there locked him up
this being done mrs sowerberry sunk into a chair and burst into tears
bless her shes going off said charlotte
a glass of water noah dear
make haste oh
charlotte said mrs sowerberry speaking as well as she could through a deficiency of breath and a sufficiency of cold water which noah had poured over her head and shoulders
oh
charlotte what a mercy we have not all been murdered in our beds ah
mercy indeed maam was the reply
i only hope thisll teach master not to have any more of these dreadful creatures that are born to be murderers and robbers from their very cradle
poor noah
he was all but killed maam when i come in poor fellow said mrs sowerberry looking piteously on the charityboy
noah whose top waistcoatbutton might have been somewhere on a level with the crown of olivers head rubbed his eyes with the inside of his wrists while this commiseration was bestowed upon him and performed some affecting tears and sniffs
whats to be done exclaimed mrs sowerberry
your masters not at home theres not a man in the house and hell kick that door down in ten minutes olivers vigorous plunges against the bit of timber in question rendered this occurance highly probable
dear dear
i dont know maam said charlotte unless we send for the policeofficers or the millingtary suggested mr claypole
no no said mrs sowerberry bethinking herself of olivers old friend
run to mr bumble noah and tell him to come here directly and not to lose a minute never mind your cap
make haste
you can hold a knife to that black eye as you run along
itll keep the swelling down noah stopped to make no reply but started off at his fullest speed and very much it astonished the people who were out walking to see a charityboy tearing through the streets pellmell with no cap on his head and a claspknife at his eye
oliver continues refractory noah claypole ran along the streets at his swiftest pace and paused not once for breath until he reached the workhousegate
having rested here for a minute or so to collect a good burst of sobs and an imposing show of tears and terror he knocked loudly at the wicket and presented such a rueful face to the aged pauper who opened it that even he who saw nothing but rueful faces about him at the best of times started back in astonishment
why whats the matter with the boy said the old pauper
mr
bumble
mr bumble cried noah with wellaffected dismay and in tones so loud and agitated that they not only caught the ear of mr bumble himself who happened to be hard by but alarmed him so much that he rushed into the yard without his cocked hatwhich is a very curious and remarkable circumstance as showing that even a beadle acted upon a sudden and powerful impulse may be afflicted with a momentary visitation of loss of selfpossession and forgetfulness of personal dignity
oh mr bumble sir said noah oliver siroliver has what
what interposed mr bumble with a gleam of pleasure in his metallic eyes
not run away he hasnt run away has he noah no sir no
not run away sir but hes turned wicious replied noah
he tried to murder me sir and then he tried to murder charlotte and then missis
oh
what dreadful pain it is
such agony please sir and here noah writhed and twisted his body into an extensive variety of eellike positions thereby giving mr bumble to understand that from the violent and sanguinary onset of oliver twist he had sustained severe internal injury and damage from which he was at that moment suffering the acutest torture
when noah saw that the intelligence he communicated perfectly paralysed mr bumble he imparted additional effect thereunto by bewailing his dreadful wounds ten times louder than before and when he observed a gentleman in a white waistcoat crossing the yard he was more tragic in his lamentations than ever rightly conceiving it highly expedient to attract the notice and rouse the indignation of the gentleman aforesaid
the gentlemans notice was very soon attracted for he had not walked three paces when he turned angrily round and inquired what that young cur was howling for and why mr bumble did not favour him with something which would render the series of vocular exclamations so designated an involuntary process
its a poor boy from the freeschool sir replied mr bumble who has been nearly murderedall but murdered sirby young twist by jove exclaimed the gentleman in the white waistcoat stopping short
i knew it
i felt a strange presentiment from the very first that that audacious young savage would come to be hung he has likewise attempted sir to murder the female servant said mr bumble with a face of ashy paleness
and his missis interposed mr claypole
and his master too i think you said noah added mr bumble
no
hes out or he would have murdered him replied noah
he said he wanted to ah
said he wanted to did he my boy inquired the gentleman in the white waistcoat
yes sir replied noah
and please sir missis wants to know whether mr bumble can spare time to step up there directly and flog himcause masters out certainly my boy certainly said the gentleman in the white waistcoat smiling benignly and patting noahs head which was about three inches higher than his own
youre a good boya very good boy
heres a penny for you
bumble just step up to sowerberrys with your cane and see whats best to be done
dont spare him bumble no i will not sir replied the beadle
and the cocked hat and cane having been by this time adjusted to their owners satisfaction mr bumble and noah claypole betook themselves with all speed to the undertakers shop
here the position of affairs had not at all improved
sowerberry had not yet returned and oliver continued to kick with undiminished vigour at the cellardoor
the accounts of his ferocity as related by mrs sowerberry and charlotte were of so startling a nature that mr bumble judged it prudent to parley before opening the door
with this view he gave a kick at the outside by way of prelude and then applying his mouth to the keyhole said in a deep and impressive tone oliver come you let me out replied oliver from the inside
do you know this here voice oliver said mr bumble
yes replied oliver
aint you afraid of it sir
aint you atrembling while i speak sir said mr bumble
no replied oliver boldly
an answer so different from the one he had expected to elicit and was in the habit of receiving staggered mr bumble not a little
he stepped back from the keyhole drew himself up to his full height and looked from one to another of the three bystanders in mute astonishment
oh you know mr bumble he must be mad said mrs sowerberry
no boy in half his senses could venture to speak so to you its not madness maam replied mr bumble after a few moments of deep meditation
its meat what exclaimed mrs sowerberry
meat maam meat replied bumble with stern emphasis
youve overfed him maam
youve raised a artificial soul and spirit in him maam unbecoming a person of his condition as the board mrs sowerberry who are practical philosophers will tell you
what have paupers to do with soul or spirit
its quite enough that we let em have live bodies
if you had kept the boy on gruel maam this would never have happened dear dear ejaculated mrs sowerberry piously raising her eyes to the kitchen ceiling this comes of being liberal the liberality of mrs sowerberry to oliver had consisted of a profuse bestowal upon him of all the dirty odds and ends which nobody else would eat so there was a great deal of meekness and selfdevotion in her voluntarily remaining under mr bumbles heavy accusation
of which to do her justice she was wholly innocent in thought word or deed
ah said mr bumble when the lady brought her eyes down to earth again the only thing that can be done now that i know of is to leave him in the cellar for a day or so till hes a little starved down and then to take him out and keep him on gruel all through the apprenticeship
he comes of a bad family
excitable natures mrs sowerberry
both the nurse and doctor said that that mother of his made her way here against difficulties and pain that would have killed any welldisposed woman weeks before at this point of mr bumbles discourse oliver just hearing enough to know that some allusion was being made to his mother recommenced kicking with a violence that rendered every other sound inaudible
sowerberry returned at this juncture
olivers offence having been explained to him with such exaggerations as the ladies thought best calculated to rouse his ire he unlocked the cellardoor in a twinkling and dragged his rebellious apprentice out by the collar
olivers clothes had been torn in the beating he had received his face was bruised and scratched and his hair scattered over his forehead
the angry flush had not disappeared however and when he was pulled out of his prison he scowled boldly on noah and looked quite undismayed
now you are a nice young fellow aint you said sowerberry giving oliver a shake and a box on the ear
he called my mother names replied oliver
well and what if he did you little ungrateful wretch said mrs sowerberry
she deserved what he said and worse she didnt said oliver
she did said mrs sowerberry
its a lie said oliver
mrs sowerberry burst into a flood of tears
this flood of tears left mr sowerberry no alternative
if he had hesitated for one instant to punish oliver most severely it must be quite clear to every experienced reader that he would have been according to all precedents in disputes of matrimony established a brute an unnatural husband an insulting creature a base imitation of a man and various other agreeable characters too numerous for recital within the limits of this chapter
to do him justice he was as far as his power wentit was not very extensivekindly disposed towards the boy perhaps because it was his interest to be so perhaps because his wife disliked him
the flood of tears however left him no resource so he at once gave him a drubbing which satisfied even mrs sowerberry herself and rendered mr bumbles subsequent application of the parochial cane rather unnecessary
for the rest of the day he was shut up in the back kitchen in company with a pump and a slice of bread and at night mrs sowerberry after making various remarks outside the door by no means complimentary to the memory of his mother looked into the room and amidst the jeers and pointings of noah and charlotte ordered him upstairs to his dismal bed
it was not until he was left alone in the silence and stillness of the gloomy workshop of the undertaker that oliver gave way to the feelings which the days treatment may be supposed likely to have awakened in a mere child
he had listened to their taunts with a look of contempt he had borne the lash without a cry for he felt that pride swelling in his heart which would have kept down a shriek to the last though they had roasted him alive
but now when there were none to see or hear him he fell upon his knees on the floor and hiding his face in his hands wept such tears as god send for the credit of our nature few so young may ever have cause to pour out before him
for a long time oliver remained motionless in this attitude
the candle was burning low in the socket when he rose to his feet
having gazed cautiously round him and listened intently he gently undid the fastenings of the door and looked abroad
it was a cold dark night
the stars seemed to the boys eyes farther from the earth than he had ever seen them before there was no wind and the sombre shadows thrown by the trees upon the ground looked sepulchral and deathlike from being so still
he softly reclosed the door
having availed himself of the expiring light of the candle to tie up in a handkerchief the few articles of wearing apparel he had sat himself down upon a bench to wait for morning
with the first ray of light that struggled through the crevices in the shutters oliver arose and again unbarred the door
one timid look aroundone moments pause of hesitationhe had closed it behind him and was in the open street
he looked to the right and to the left uncertain whither to fly
he remembered to have seen the waggons as they went out toiling up the hill
he took the same route and arriving at a footpath across the fields which he knew after some distance led out again into the road struck into it and walked quickly on
along this same footpath oliver wellremembered he had trotted beside mr bumble when he first carried him to the workhouse from the farm
his way lay directly in front of the cottage
his heart beat quickly when he bethought himself of this and he half resolved to turn back
he had come a long way though and should lose a great deal of time by doing so
besides it was so early that there was very little fear of his being seen so he walked on
he reached the house
there was no appearance of its inmates stirring at that early hour
oliver stopped and peeped into the garden
a child was weeding one of the little beds as he stopped he raised his pale face and disclosed the features of one of his former companions
oliver felt glad to see him before he went for though younger than himself he had been his little friend and playmate
they had been beaten and starved and shut up together many and many a time
hush dick said oliver as the boy ran to the gate and thrust his thin arm between the rails to greet him
is any one up nobody but me replied the child
you musnt say you saw me dick said oliver
i am running away
they beat and illuse me dick and i am going to seek my fortune some long way off
i dont know where
how pale you are i heard the doctor tell them i was dying replied the child with a faint smile
i am very glad to see you dear but dont stop dont stop yes yes i will to say goodbye to you replied oliver
i shall see you again dick
i know i shall
you will be well and happy i hope so replied the child
after i am dead but not before
i know the doctor must be right oliver because i dream so much of heaven and angels and kind faces that i never see when i am awake
kiss me said the child climbing up the low gate and flinging his little arms round olivers neck
goodbye dear
god bless you the blessing was from a young childs lips but it was the first that oliver had ever heard invoked upon his head and through the struggles and sufferings and troubles and changes of his after life he never once forgot it
oliver walks to london
he encounters on the road a strange sort of young gentleman oliver reached the stile at which the bypath terminated and once more gained the highroad
it was eight oclock now
though he was nearly five miles away from the town he ran and hid behind the hedges by turns till noon fearing that he might be pursued and overtaken
then he sat down to rest by the side of the milestone and began to think for the first time where he had better go and try to live
the stone by which he was seated bore in large characters an intimation that it was just seventy miles from that spot to london
the name awakened a new train of ideas in the boys mind
londonthat great placenobodynot even mr bumblecould ever find him there
he had often heard the old men in the workhouse too say that no lad of spirit need want in london and that there were ways of living in that vast city which those who had been bred up in country parts had no idea of
it was the very place for a homeless boy who must die in the streets unless some one helped him
as these things passed through his thoughts he jumped upon his feet and again walked forward
he had diminished the distance between himself and london by full four miles more before he recollected how much he must undergo ere he could hope to reach his place of destination
as this consideration forced itself upon him he slackened his pace a little and meditated upon his means of getting there
he had a crust of bread a coarse shirt and two pairs of stockings in his bundle
he had a penny tooa gift of sowerberrys after some funeral in which he had acquitted himself more than ordinarily wellin his pocket
a clean shirt thought oliver is a very comfortable thing and so are two pairs of darned stockings and so is a penny but they are small helps to a sixtyfive miles walk in winter time but olivers thoughts like those of most other people although they were extremely ready and active to point out his difficulties were wholly at a loss to suggest any feasible mode of surmounting them so after a good deal of thinking to no particular purpose he changed his little bundle over to the other shoulder and trudged on
oliver walked twenty miles that day and all that time tasted nothing but the crust of dry bread and a few draughts of water which he begged at the cottagedoors by the roadside
when the night came he turned into a meadow and creeping close under a hayrick determined to lie there till morning
he felt frightened at first for the wind moaned dismally over the empty fields and he was cold and hungry and more alone than he had ever felt before
being very tired with his walk however he soon fell asleep and forgot his troubles
he felt cold and stiff when he got up next morning and so hungry that he was obliged to exchange the penny for a small loaf in the very first village through which he passed
he had walked no more than twelve miles when night closed in again
his feet were sore and his legs so weak that they trembled beneath him
another night passed in the bleak damp air made him worse when he set forward on his journey next morning he could hardly crawl along
he waited at the bottom of a steep hill till a stagecoach came up and then begged of the outside passengers but there were very few who took any notice of him and even those told him to wait till they got to the top of the hill and then let them see how far he could run for a halfpenny
poor oliver tried to keep up with the coach a little way but was unable to do it by reason of his fatigue and sore feet
when the outsides saw this they put their halfpence back into their pockets again declaring that he was an idle young dog and didnt deserve anything and the coach rattled away and left only a cloud of dust behind
in some villages large painted boards were fixed up warning all persons who begged within the district that they would be sent to jail
this frightened oliver very much and made him glad to get out of those villages with all possible expedition
in others he would stand about the innyards and look mournfully at every one who passed a proceeding which generally terminated in the landladys ordering one of the postboys who were lounging about to drive that strange boy out of the place for she was sure he had come to steal something
if he begged at a farmers house ten to one but they threatened to set the dog on him and when he showed his nose in a shop they talked about the beadlewhich brought olivers heart into his mouthvery often the only thing he had there for many hours together
in fact if it had not been for a goodhearted turnpikeman and a benevolent old lady olivers troubles would have been shortened by the very same process which had put an end to his mothers in other words he would most assuredly have fallen dead upon the kings highway
but the turnpikeman gave him a meal of bread and cheese and the old lady who had a shipwrecked grandson wandering barefoot in some distant part of the earth took pity upon the poor orphan and gave him what little she could affordand morewith such kind and gentle words and such tears of sympathy and compassion that they sank deeper into olivers soul than all the sufferings he had ever undergone
early on the seventh morning after he had left his native place oliver limped slowly into the little town of barnet
the windowshutters were closed the street was empty not a soul had awakened to the business of the day
the sun was rising in all its splendid beauty but the light only served to show the boy his own lonesomeness and desolation as he sat with bleeding feet and covered with dust upon a doorstep
by degrees the shutters were opened the windowblinds were drawn up and people began passing to and fro
some few stopped to gaze at oliver for a moment or two or turned round to stare at him as they hurried by but none relieved him or troubled themselves to inquire how he came there
he had no heart to beg
and there he sat
he had been crouching on the step for some time wondering at the great number of publichouses every other house in barnet was a tavern large or small gazing listlessly at the coaches as they passed through and thinking how strange it seemed that they could do with ease in a few hours what it had taken him a whole week of courage and determination beyond his years to accomplish when he was roused by observing that a boy who had passed him carelessly some minutes before had returned and was now surveying him most earnestly from the opposite side of the way
he took little heed of this at first but the boy remained in the same attitude of close observation so long that oliver raised his head and returned his steady look
upon this the boy crossed over and walking close up to oliver said hullo my covey
whats the row the boy who addressed this inquiry to the young wayfarer was about his own age but one of the queerest looking boys that oliver had even seen
he was a snubnosed flatbrowed commonfaced boy enough and as dirty a juvenile as one would wish to see but he had about him all the airs and manners of a man
he was short of his age with rather bowlegs and little sharp ugly eyes
his hat was stuck on the top of his head so lightly that it threatened to fall off every momentand would have done so very often if the wearer had not had a knack of every now and then giving his head a sudden twitch which brought it back to its old place again
he wore a mans coat which reached nearly to his heels
he had turned the cuffs back halfway up his arm to get his hands out of the sleeves apparently with the ultimate view of thrusting them into the pockets of his corduroy trousers for there he kept them
he was altogether as roystering and swaggering a young gentleman as ever stood four feet six or something less in the bluchers
hullo my covey
whats the row said this strange young gentleman to oliver
i am very hungry and tired replied oliver the tears standing in his eyes as he spoke
i have walked a long way
i have been walking these seven days walking for sivin days said the young gentleman
oh i see
beaks order eh
but he added noticing olivers look of surprise i suppose you dont know what a beak is my flash companion oliver mildly replied that he had always heard a birds mouth described by the term in question
my eyes how green exclaimed the young gentleman
why a beaks a madgstrate and when you walk by a beaks order its not straight forerd but always agoing up and niver a coming down agin
was you never on the mill what mill inquired oliver
what mill
why the millthe mill as takes up so little room that itll work inside a stone jug and always goes better when the winds low with people than when its high acos then they cant get workmen
but come said the young gentleman you want grub and you shall have it
im at lowwatermark myselfonly one bob and a magpie but as far as it goes ill fork out and stump
up with you on your pins
there
now then
morrice assisting oliver to rise the young gentleman took him to an adjacent chandlers shop where he purchased a sufficiency of readydressed ham and a halfquartern loaf or as he himself expressed it a fourpenny bran the ham being kept clean and preserved from dust by the ingenious expedient of making a hole in the loaf by pulling out a portion of the crumb and stuffing it therein
taking the bread under his arm the young gentlman turned into a small publichouse and led the way to a taproom in the rear of the premises
here a pot of beer was brought in by direction of the mysterious youth and oliver falling to at his new friends bidding made a long and hearty meal during the progress of which the strange boy eyed him from time to time with great attention
going to london said the strange boy when oliver had at length concluded
yes got any lodgings no money no the strange boy whistled and put his arms into his pockets as far as the big coatsleeves would let them go
do you live in london inquired oliver
yes
i do when im at home replied the boy
i suppose you want some place to sleep in tonight dont you i do indeed answered oliver
i have not slept under a roof since i left the country dont fret your eyelids on that score said the young gentleman
ive got to be in london tonight and i know a spectable old gentleman as lives there wotll give you lodgings for nothink and never ask for the changethat is if any genelman he knows interduces you
and dont he know me
oh no
not in the least
by no means
certainly not the young gentleman smiled as if to intimate that the latter fragments of discourse were playfully ironical and finished the beer as he did so
this unexpected offer of shelter was too tempting to be resisted especially as it was immediately followed up by the assurance that the old gentleman referred to would doubtless provide oliver with a comfortable place without loss of time
this led to a more friendly and confidential dialogue from which oliver discovered that his friends name was jack dawkins and that he was a peculiar pet and protege of the elderly gentleman before mentioned
mr dawkins appearance did not say a vast deal in favour of the comforts which his patrons interest obtained for those whom he took under his protection but as he had a rather flightly and dissolute mode of conversing and furthermore avowed that among his intimate friends he was better known by the sobriquet of the artful dodger oliver concluded that being of a dissipated and careless turn the moral precepts of his benefactor had hitherto been thrown away upon him
under this impression he secretly resolved to cultivate the good opinion of the old gentleman as quickly as possible and if he found the dodger incorrigible as he more than half suspected he should to decline the honour of his farther acquaintance
as john dawkins objected to their entering london before nightfall it was nearly eleven oclock when they reached the turnpike at islington
they crossed from the angel into st johns road struck down the small street which terminates at sadlers wells theatre through exmouth street and coppice row down the little court by the side of the workhouse across the classic ground which once bore the name of hockleyinthehole thence into little saffron hill and so into saffron hill the great along which the dodger scudded at a rapid pace directing oliver to follow close at his heels
although oliver had enough to occupy his attention in keeping sight of his leader he could not help bestowing a few hasty glances on either side of the way as he passed along
a dirtier or more wretched place he had never seen
the street was very narrow and muddy and the air was impregnated with filthy odours
there were a good many small shops but the only stock in trade appeared to be heaps of children who even at that time of night were crawling in and out at the doors or screaming from the inside
the sole places that seemed to prosper amid the general blight of the place were the publichouses and in them the lowest orders of irish were wrangling with might and main
covered ways and yards which here and there diverged from the main street disclosed little knots of houses where drunken men and women were positively wallowing in filth and from several of the doorways great illlooking fellows were cautiously emerging bound to all appearance on no very welldisposed or harmless errands
oliver was just considering whether he hadnt better run away when they reached the bottom of the hill
his conductor catching him by the arm pushed open the door of a house near field lane and drawing him into the passage closed it behind them
now then cried a voice from below in reply to a whistle from the dodger
plummy and slam was the reply
this seemed to be some watchword or signal that all was right for the light of a feeble candle gleamed on the wall at the remote end of the passage and a mans face peeped out from where a balustrade of the old kitchen staircase had been broken away
theres two on you said the man thrusting the candle farther out and shielding his eyes with his hand
whos the tother one a new pal replied jack dawkins pulling oliver forward
where did he come from greenland
is fagin upstairs yes hes a sortin the wipes
up with you the candle was drawn back and the face disappeared
oliver groping his way with one hand and having the other firmly grasped by his companion ascended with much difficulty the dark and broken stairs which his conductor mounted with an ease and expedition that showed he was well acquainted with them
he threw open the door of a backroom and drew oliver in after him
the walls and ceiling of the room were perfectly black with age and dirt
there was a deal table before the fire upon which were a candle stuck in a gingerbeer bottle two or three pewter pots a loaf and butter and a plate
in a fryingpan which was on the fire and which was secured to the mantelshelf by a string some sausages were cooking and standing over them with a toastingfork in his hand was a very old shrivelled jew whose villainouslooking and repulsive face was obscured by a quantity of matted red hair
he was dressed in a greasy flannel gown with his throat bare and seemed to be dividing his attention between the fryingpan and the clotheshorse over which a great number of silk handkerchiefs were hanging
several rough beds made of old sacks were huddled side by side on the floor
seated round the table were four or five boys none older than the dodger smoking long clay pipes and drinking spirits with the air of middleaged men
these all crowded about their associate as he whispered a few words to the jew and then turned round and grinned at oliver
so did the jew himself toastingfork in hand
this is him fagin said jack dawkins my friend oliver twist the jew grinned and making a low obeisance to oliver took him by the hand and hoped he should have the honour of his intimate acquaintance
upon this the young gentleman with the pipes came round him and shook both his hands very hardespecially the one in which he held his little bundle
one young gentleman was very anxious to hang up his cap for him and another was so obliging as to put his hands in his pockets in order that as he was very tired he might not have the trouble of emptying them himself when he went to bed
these civilities would probably be extended much farther but for a liberal exercise of the jews toastingfork on the heads and shoulders of the affectionate youths who offered them
we are very glad to see you oliver very said the jew
dodger take off the sausages and draw a tub near the fire for oliver
ah youre astaring at the pockethandkerchiefs
eh my dear
there are a good many of em aint there
weve just looked em out ready for the wash thats all oliver thats all
ha
ha
ha the latter part of this speech was hailed by a boisterous shout from all the hopeful pupils of the merry old gentleman
in the midst of which they went to supper
oliver ate his share and the jew then mixed him a glass of hot ginandwater telling him he must drink it off directly because another gentleman wanted the tumbler
oliver did as he was desired
immediately afterwards he felt himself gently lifted on to one of the sacks and then he sunk into a deep sleep
containing further particulars concerning the pleasant old gentleman and his hopeful pupils it was late next morning when oliver awoke from a sound long sleep
there was no other person in the room but the old jew who was boiling some coffee in a saucepan for breakfast and whistling softly to himself as he stirred it round and round with an iron spoon
he would stop every now and then to listen when there was the least noise below and when he had satisfied himself he would go on whistling and stirring again as before
although oliver had roused himself from sleep he was not thoroughly awake
there is a drowsy state between sleeping and waking when you dream more in five minutes with your eyes half open and yourself half conscious of everything that is passing around you than you would in five nights with your eyes fast closed and your senses wrapt in perfect unconsciousness
at such time a mortal knows just enough of what his mind is doing to form some glimmering conception of its mighty powers its bounding from earth and spurning time and space when freed from the restraint of its corporeal associate
oliver was precisely in this condition
he saw the jew with his halfclosed eyes heard his low whistling and recognised the sound of the spoon grating against the saucepans sides and yet the selfsame senses were mentally engaged at the same time in busy action with almost everybody he had ever known
when the coffee was done the jew drew the saucepan to the hob
standing then in an irresolute attitude for a few minutes as if he did not well know how to employ himself he turned round and looked at oliver and called him by his name
he did not answer and was to all appearances asleep
after satisfying himself upon this head the jew stepped gently to the door which he fastened
he then drew forth as it seemed to oliver from some trap in the floor a small box which he placed carefully on the table
his eyes glistened as he raised the lid and looked in
dragging an old chair to the table he sat down and took from it a magnificent gold watch sparkling with jewels
aha said the jew shrugging up his shoulders and distorting every feature with a hideous grin
clever dogs
clever dogs
staunch to the last
never told the old parson where they were
never poached upon old fagin
and why should they
it wouldnt have loosened the knot or kept the drop up a minute longer
no no no
fine fellows
fine fellows with these and other muttered reflections of the like nature the jew once more deposited the watch in its place of safety
at least half a dozen more were severally drawn forth from the same box and surveyed with equal pleasure besides rings brooches bracelets and other articles of jewellery of such magnificent materials and costly workmanship that oliver had no idea even of their names
having replaced these trinkets the jew took out another so small that it lay in the palm of his hand
there seemed to be some very minute inscription on it for the jew laid it flat upon the table and shading it with his hand pored over it long and earnestly
at length he put it down as if despairing of success and leaning back in his chair muttered what a fine thing capital punishment is
dead men never repent dead men never bring awkward stories to light
ah its a fine thing for the trade
five of em strung up in a row and none left to play booty or turn whitelivered as the jew uttered these words his bright dark eyes which had been staring vacantly before him fell on olivers face the boys eyes were fixed on his in mute curiousity and although the recognition was only for an instantfor the briefest space of time that can possibly be conceivedit was enough to show the old man that he had been observed
he closed the lid of the box with a loud crash and laying his hand on a bread knife which was on the table started furiously up
he trembled very much though for even in his terror oliver could see that the knife quivered in the air
whats that said the jew
what do you watch me for
why are you awake
what have you seen
speak out boy
quickquick
for your life i wasnt able to sleep any longer sir replied oliver meekly
i am very sorry if i have disturbed you sir you were not awake an hour ago said the jew scowling fiercely on the boy
no
no indeed replied oliver
are you sure cried the jew with a still fiercer look than before and a threatening attitude
upon my word i was not sir replied oliver earnestly
i was not indeed sir tush tush my dear said the jew abruptly resuming his old manner and playing with the knife a little before he laid it down as if to induce the belief that he had caught it up in mere sport
of course i know that my dear
i only tried to frighten you
youre a brave boy
ha
ha
youre a brave boy oliver the jew rubbed his hands with a chuckle but glanced uneasily at the box notwithstanding
did you see any of these pretty things my dear said the jew laying his hand upon it after a short pause
yes sir replied oliver
ah said the jew turning rather pale
theytheyre mine oliver my little property
all i have to live upon in my old age
the folks call me a miser my dear
only a miser thats all oliver thought the old gentleman must be a decided miser to live in such a dirty place with so many watches but thinking that perhaps his fondness for the dodger and the other boys cost him a good deal of money he only cast a deferential look at the jew and asked if he might get up
certainly my dear certainly replied the old gentleman
stay
theres a pitcher of water in the corner by the door
bring it here and ill give you a basin to wash in my dear oliver got up walked across the room and stooped for an instant to raise the pitcher
when he turned his head the box was gone
he had scarcely washed himself and made everything tidy by emptying the basin out of the window agreeably to the jews directions when the dodger returned accompanied by a very sprightly young friend whom oliver had seen smoking on the previous night and who was now formally introduced to him as charley bates
the four sat down to breakfast on the coffee and some hot rolls and ham which the dodger had brought home in the crown of his hat
well said the jew glancing slyly at oliver and addressing himself to the dodger i hope youve been at work this morning my dears hard replied the dodger
as nails added charley bates
good boys good boys said the jew
what have you got dodger a couple of pocketbooks replied that young gentlman
lined inquired the jew with eagerness
pretty well replied the dodger producing two pocketbooks one green and the other red
not so heavy as they might be said the jew after looking at the insides carefully but very neat and nicely made
ingenious workman aint he oliver very indeed sir said oliver
at which mr charles bates laughed uproariously very much to the amazement of oliver who saw nothing to laugh at in anything that had passed
and what have you got my dear said fagin to charley bates
wipes replied master bates at the same time producing four pockethandkerchiefs
well said the jew inspecting them closely theyre very good ones very
you havent marked them well though charley so the marks shall be picked out with a needle and well teach oliver how to do it
shall us oliver eh
ha
ha
ha if you please sir said oliver
youd like to be able to make pockethandkerchiefs as easy as charley bates wouldnt you my dear said the jew
very much indeed if youll teach me sir replied oliver
master bates saw something so exquisitely ludicrous in this reply that he burst into another laugh which laugh meeting the coffee he was drinking and carrying it down some wrong channel very nearly terminated in his premature suffocation
he is so jolly green said charley when he recovered as an apology to the company for his unpolite behaviour
the dodger said nothing but he smoothed olivers hair over his eyes and said hed know better by and by upon which the old gentleman observing olivers colour mounting changed the subject by asking whether there had been much of a crowd at the execution that morning
this made him wonder more and more for it was plain from the replies of the two boys that they had both been there and oliver naturally wondered how they could possibly have found time to be so very industrious
when the breakfast was cleared away the merry old gentlman and the two boys played at a very curious and uncommon game which was performed in this way
the merry old gentleman placing a snuffbox in one pocket of his trousers a notecase in the other and a watch in his waistcoat pocket with a guardchain round his neck and sticking a mock diamond pin in his shirt buttoned his coat tight round him and putting his spectaclecase and handkerchief in his pockets trotted up and down the room with a stick in imitation of the manner in which old gentlemen walk about the streets any hour in the day
sometimes he stopped at the fireplace and sometimes at the door making believe that he was staring with all his might into shopwindows
at such times he would look constantly round him for fear of thieves and would keep slapping all his pockets in turn to see that he hadnt lost anything in such a very funny and natural manner that oliver laughed till the tears ran down his face
all this time the two boys followed him closely about getting out of his sight so nimbly every time he turned round that it was impossible to follow their motions
at last the dodger trod upon his toes or ran upon his boot accidently while charley bates stumbled up against him behind and in that one moment they took from him with the most extraordinary rapidity snuffbox notecase watchguard chain shirtpin pockethandkerchief even the spectaclecase
if the old gentlman felt a hand in any one of his pockets he cried out where it was and then the game began all over again
when this game had been played a great many times a couple of young ladies called to see the young gentleman one of whom was named bet and the other nancy
they wore a good deal of hair not very neatly turned up behind and were rather untidy about the shoes and stockings
they were not exactly pretty perhaps but they had a great deal of colour in their faces and looked quite stout and hearty
being remarkably free and agreeable in their manners oliver thought them very nice girls indeed
as there is no doubt they were
the visitors stopped a long time
spirits were produced in consequence of one of the young ladies complaining of a coldness in her inside and the conversation took a very convivial and improving turn
at length charley bates expressed his opinion that it was time to pad the hoof
this it occurred to oliver must be french for going out for directly afterwards the dodger and charley and the two young ladies went away together having been kindly furnished by the amiable old jew with money to spend
there my dear said fagin
thats a pleasant life isnt it
they have gone out for the day have they done work sir inquired oliver
yes said the jew that is unless they should unexpectedly come across any when they are out and they wont neglect it if they do my dear depend upon it
make em your models my dear
make em your models tapping the fireshovel on the hearth to add force to his words do everything they bid you and take their advice in all mattersespecially the dodgers my dear
hell be a great man himself and will make you one too if you take pattern by himis my handkerchief hanging out of my pocket my dear said the jew stopping short
yes sir said oliver
see if you can take it out without my feeling it as you saw them do when we were at play this morning oliver held up the bottom of the pocket with one hand as he had seen the dodger hold it and drew the handkerchief lightly out of it with the other
is it gone cried the jew
here it is sir said oliver showing it in his hand
youre a clever boy my dear said the playful old gentleman patting oliver on the head approvingly
i never saw a sharper lad
heres a shilling for you
if you go on in this way youll be the greatest man of the time
and now come here and ill show you how to take the marks out of the handkerchiefs oliver wondered what picking the old gentlemans pocket in play had to do with his chances of being a great man
but thinking that the jew being so much his senior must know best he followed him quietly to the table and was soon deeply involved in his new study
oliver becomes better acquainted with the characters of his new associates and purchases experience at a high price
being a short for many days oliver remained in the jews room picking the marks out of the pockethandkerchief of which a great number were brought home and sometimes taking part in the game already described which the two boys and the jew played regularly every morning
at length he began to languish for fresh air and took many occasions of earnestly entreating the old gentleman to allow him to go out to work with his two companions
oliver was rendered the more anxious to be actively employed by what he had seen of the stern morality of the old gentlemans character
whenever the dodger or charley bates came home at night emptyhanded he would expatiate with great vehemence on the misery of idle and lazy habits and would enforce upon them the necessity of an active life by sending them supperless to bed
on one occasion indeed he even went so far as to knock them both down a flight of stairs but this was carrying out his virtuous precepts to an unusual extent
at length one morning oliver obtained the permission he had so eagerly sought
there had been no handkerchiefs to work upon for two or three days and the dinners had been rather meagre
perhaps these were reasons for the old gentlemans giving his assent but whether they were or no he told oliver he might go and placed him under the joint guardianship of charley bates and his friend the dodger
the three boys sallied out the dodger with his coatsleeves tucked up and his hat cocked as usual master bates sauntering along with his hands in his pockets and oliver between them wondering where they were going and what branch of manufacture he would be instructed in first
the pace at which they went was such a very lazy illlooking saunter that oliver soon began to think his companions were going to deceive the old gentleman by not going to work at all
the dodger had a vicious propensity too of pulling the caps from the heads of small boys and tossing them down areas while charley bates exhibited some very loose notions concerning the rights of property by pilfering divers apples and onions from the stalls at the kennel sides and thrusting them into pockets which were so surprisingly capacious that they seemed to undermine his whole suit of clothes in every direction
these things looked so bad that oliver was on the point of declaring his intention of seeking his way back in the best way he could when his thoughts were suddenly directed into another channel by a very mysterious change of behaviour on the part of the dodger
they were just emerging from a narrow court not far from the open square in clerkenwell which is yet called by some strange perversion of terms the green when the dodger made a sudden stop and laying his finger on his lip drew his companions back again with the greatest caution and circumspection
whats the matter demanded oliver
hush replied the dodger
do you see that old cove at the bookstall the old gentleman over the way said oliver
yes i see him hell do said the dodger
a prime plant observed master charley bates
oliver looked from one to the other with the greatest surprise but he was not permitted to make any inquiries for the two boys walked stealthily across the road and slunk close behind the old gentleman towards whom his attention had been directed
oliver walked a few paces after them and not knowing whether to advance or retire stood looking on in silent amazement
the old gentleman was a very respectablelooking personage with a powdered head and gold spectacles
he was dressed in a bottlegreen coat with a black velvet collar wore white trousers and carried a smart bamboo cane under his arm
he had taken up a book from the stall and there he stood reading away as hard as if he were in his elbowchair in his own study
it is very possible that he fancied himself there indeed for it was plain from his abstraction that he saw not the bookstall nor the street nor the boys nor in short anything but the book itself which he was reading straight through turning over the leaf when he got to the bottom of a page beginning at the top line of the next one and going regularly on with the greatest interest and eagerness
what was olivers horror and alarm as he stood a few paces off looking on with his eyelids as wide open as they would possibly go to see the dodger plunge his hand into the old gentlemans pocket and draw from thence a handkerchief
to see him hand the same to charley bates and finally to behold them both running away round the corner at full speed
in an instant the whole mystery of the hankerchiefs and the watches and the jewels and the jew rushed upon the boys mind
he stood for a moment with the blood so tingling through all his veins from terror that he felt as if he were in a burning fire then confused and frightened he took to his heels and not knowing what he did made off as fast as he could lay his feet to the ground
this was all done in a minutes space
in the very instant when oliver began to run the old gentleman putting his hand to his pocket and missing his handkerchief turned sharp round
seeing the boy scudding away at such a rapid pace he very naturally concluded him to be the depredator and shouting stop thief with all his might made off after him book in hand
but the old gentleman was not the only person who raised the hueandcry
the dodger and master bates unwilling to attract public attention by running down the open street had merely retired into the very first doorway round the corner
they no sooner heard the cry and saw oliver running than guessing exactly how the matter stood they issued forth with great promptitude and shouting stop thief too joined in the pursuit like good citizens
although oliver had been brought up by philosophers he was not theoretically acquainted with the beautiful axiom that selfpreservation is the first law of nature
if he had been perhaps he would have been prepared for this
not being prepared however it alarmed him the more so away he went like the wind with the old gentleman and the two boys roaring and shouting behind him
stop thief
stop thief there is a magic in the sound
the tradesman leaves his counter and the carman his waggon the butcher throws down his tray the baker his basket the milkman his pail the errandboy his parcels the schoolboy his marbles the paviour his pickaxe the child his battledore
away they run pellmell helterskelter slapdash tearing yelling screaming knocking down the passengers as they turn the corners rousing up the dogs and astonishing the fowls and streets squares and courts reecho with the sound
stop thief
stop thief the cry is taken up by a hundred voices and the crowd accumulate at every turning
away they fly splashing through the mud and rattling along the pavements up go the windows out run the people onward bear the mob a whole audience desert punch in the very thickest of the plot and joining the rushing throng swell the shout and lend fresh vigour to the cry stop thief
stop thief stop thief
stop thief there is a passion for hunting something deeply implanted in the human breast
one wretched breathless child panting with exhaustion terror in his looks agony in his eyes large drops of perspiration streaming down his face strains every nerve to make head upon his pursuers and as they follow on his track and gain upon him every instant they hail his decreasing strength with joy
stop thief ay stop him for gods sake were it only in mercy
stopped at last
a clever blow
he is down upon the pavement and the crowd eagerly gather round him each new comer jostling and struggling with the others to catch a glimpse
stand aside give him a little air nonsense
he dont deserve it wheres the gentleman here his is coming down the street make room there for the gentleman is this the boy sir yes oliver lay covered with mud and dust and bleeding from the mouth looking wildly round upon the heap of faces that surrounded him when the old gentleman was officiously dragged and pushed into the circle by the foremost of the pursuers
yes said the gentleman i am afraid it is the boy afraid murmured the crowd
thats a good un poor fellow said the gentleman he has hurt himself i did that sir said a great lubberly fellow stepping forward and preciously i cut my knuckle agin his mouth
i stopped him sir the fellow touched his hat with a grin expecting something for his pains but the old gentleman eyeing him with an expression of dislike look anxiously round as if he contemplated running away himself which it is very possible he might have attempted to do and thus have afforded another chase had not a police officer who is generally the last person to arrive in such cases at that moment made his way through the crowd and seized oliver by the collar
come get up said the man roughly
it wasnt me indeed sir
indeed indeed it was two other boys said oliver clasping his hands passionately and looking round
they are here somewhere oh no they aint said the officer
he meant this to be ironical but it was true besides for the dodger and charley bates had filed off down the first convenient court they came to
come get up dont hurt him said the old gentleman compassionately
oh no i wont hurt him replied the officer tearing his jacket half off his back in proof thereof
come i know you it wont do
will you stand upon your legs you young devil oliver who could hardly stand made a shift to raise himself on his feet and was at once lugged along the streets by the jacketcollar at a rapid pace
the gentleman walked on with them by the officers side and as many of the crowd as could achieve the feat got a little ahead and stared back at oliver from time to time
the boys shouted in triumph and on they went
treats of mr fang the police magistrate and furnishes a slight specimen of his mode of administering justice the offence had been committed within the district and indeed in the immediate neighborhood of a very notorious metropolitan police office
the crowd had only the satisfaction of accompanying oliver through two or three streets and down a place called mutton hill when he was led beneath a low archway and up a dirty court into this dispensary of summary justice by the back way
it was a small paved yard into which they turned and here they encountered a stout man with a bunch of whiskers on his face and a bunch of keys in his hand
whats the matter now said the man carelessly
a young foglehunter replied the man who had oliver in charge
are you the party thats been robbed sir inquired the man with the keys
yes i am replied the old gentleman but i am not sure that this boy actually took the handkerchief
ii would rather not press the case must go before the magistrate now sir replied the man
his worship will be disengaged in half a minute
now young gallows this was an invitation for oliver to enter through a door which he unlocked as he spoke and which led into a stone cell
here he was searched and nothing being found upon him locked up
this cell was in shape and size something like an area cellar only not so light
it was most intolerably dirty for it was monday morning and it had been tenanted by six drunken people who had been locked up elsewhere since saturday night
but this is little
in our stationhouses men and women are every night confined on the most trivial chargesthe word is worth notingin dungeons compared with which those in newgate occupied by the most atrocious felons tried found guilty and under sentence of death are palaces
let any one who doubts this compare the two
the old gentleman looked almost as rueful as oliver when the key grated in the lock
he turned with a sigh to the book which had been the innocent cause of all this disturbance
there is something in that boys face said the old gentleman to himself as he walked slowly away tapping his chin with the cover of the book in a thoughtful manner something that touches and interests me
can he be innocent
he looked likebye the bye exclaimed the old gentleman halting very abruptly and staring up into the sky bless my soulwhere have i seen something like that look before after musing for some minutes the old gentleman walked with the same meditative face into a back anteroom opening from the yard and there retiring into a corner called up before his minds eye a vast amphitheatre of faces over which a dusky curtain had hung for many years
no said the old gentleman shaking his head it must be imagination he wandered over them again
he had called them into view and it was not easy to replace the shroud that had so long concealed them
there were the faces of friends and foes and of many that had been almost strangers peering intrusively from the crowd there were the faces of young and blooming girls that were now old women there were faces that the grave had changed and closed upon but which the mind superior to its power still dressed in their old freshness and beauty calling back the lustre of the eyes the brightness of the smile the beaming of the soul through its mask of clay and whispering of beauty beyond the tomb changed but to be heightened and taken from earth only to be set up as a light to shed a soft and gentle glow upon the path to heaven
but the old gentleman could recall no one countenance of which olivers features bore a trace
so he heaved a sigh over the recollections he awakened and being happily for himself an absent old gentleman buried them again in the pages of the musty book
he was roused by a touch on the shoulder and a request from the man with the keys to follow him into the office
he closed his book hastily and was at once ushered into the imposing presence of the renowned mr fang
the office was a front parlour with a panelled wall
mr fang sat behind a bar at the upper end and on one side the door was a sort of wooden pen in which poor little oliver was already deposited trembling very much at the awfulness of the scene
mr fang was a lean longbacked stiffnecked middlesized man with no great quantity of hair and what he had growing on the back and sides of his head
his face was stern and much flushed
if he were really not in the habit of drinking rather more than was exactly good for him he might have brought action against his countenance for libel and have recovered heavy damages
the old gentleman bowed respectfully and advancing to the magistrates desk said suiting the action to the word that is my name and address sir he then withdrew a pace or two and with another polite and gentlemanly inclination of the head waited to be questioned
now it so happened that mr fang was at that moment perusing a leading article in a newspaper of the morning adverting to some recent decision of his and commending him for the three hundred and fiftieth time to the special and particular notice of the secretary of state for the home department
he was out of temper and he looked up with an angry scowl
who are you said mr fang
the old gentleman pointed with some surprise to his card
officer said mr fang tossing the card contemptuously away with the newspaper
who is this fellow my name sir said the old gentleman speaking like a gentleman my name sir is brownlow
permit me to inquire the name of the magistrate who offers a gratuitous and unprovoked insult to a respectable person under the protection of the bench saying this mr brownlow looked around the office as if in search of some person who would afford him the required information
officer said mr fang throwing the paper on one side whats this fellow charged with hes not charged at all your worship replied the officer
he appears against this boy your worship his worship knew this perfectly well but it was a good annoyance and a safe one
appears against the boy does he said mr fang surveying mr brownlow contemptuously from head to foot
swear him before i am sworn i must beg to say one word said mr brownlow and that is that i really never without actual experience could have believed hold your tongue sir said mr fang peremptorily
i will not sir replied the old gentleman
hold your tongue this instant or ill have you turned out of the office said mr fang
youre an insolent impertinent fellow
how dare you bully a magistrate what exclaimed the old gentleman reddening
swear this person said fang to the clerk
ill not hear another word
swear him mr brownlows indignation was greatly roused but reflecting perhaps that he might only injure the boy by giving vent to it he suppressed his feelings and submitted to be sworn at once
now said fang whats the charge against this boy
what have you got to say sir i was standing at a bookstall mr brownlow began
hold your tongue sir said mr fang
policeman
wheres the policeman
here swear this policeman
now policeman what is this the policeman with becoming humility related how he had taken the charge how he had searched oliver and found nothing on his person and how that was all he knew about it
are there any witnesses inquired mr fang
none your worship replied the policeman
mr fang sat silent for some minutes and then turning round to the prosecutor said in a towering passion
do you mean to state what your complaint against this boy is man or do you not
you have been sworn
now if you stand there refusing to give evidence ill punish you for disrespect to the bench i will by by what or by whom nobody knows for the clerk and jailor coughed very loud just at the right moment and the former dropped a heavy book upon the floor thus preventing the word from being heardaccidently of course
with many interruptions and repeated insults mr brownlow contrived to state his case observing that in the surprise of the moment he had run after the boy because he had saw him running away and expressing his hope that if the magistrate should believe him although not actually the thief to be connected with the thieves he would deal as leniently with him as justice would allow
he has been hurt already said the old gentleman in conclusion
and i fear he added with great energy looking towards the bar i really fear that he is ill oh
yes i dare say said mr fang with a sneer
come none of your tricks here you young vagabond they wont do
whats your name oliver tried to reply but his tongue failed him
he was deadly pale and the whole place seemed turning round and round
whats your name you hardened scoundrel demanded mr fang
officer whats his name this was addressed to a bluff old fellow in a striped waistcoat who was standing by the bar
he bent over oliver and repeated the inquiry but finding him really incapable of understanding the question and knowing that his not replying would only infuriate the magistrate the more and add to the severity of his sentence he hazarded a guess
he says his names tom white your worship said the kindhearted thieftaker
oh he wont speak out wont he said fang
very well very well
where does he live where he can your worship replied the officer again pretending to receive olivers answer
has he any parents inquired mr fang
he says they died in his infancy your worship replied the officer hazarding the usual reply
at this point of the inquiry oliver raised his head and looking round with imploring eyes murmured a feeble prayer for a draught of water
stuff and nonsense said mr fang dont try to make a fool of me i think he really is ill your worship remonstrated the officer
i know better said mr fang
take care of him officer said the old gentleman raising his hands instinctively hell fall down stand away officer cried fang let him if he likes oliver availed himself of the kind permission and fell to the floor in a fainting fit
the men in the office looked at each other but no one dared to stir
i knew he was shamming said fang as if this were incontestable proof of the fact
let him lie there hell soon be tired of that how do you propose to deal with the case sir inquired the clerk in a low voice
summarily replied mr fang
he stands committed for three monthshard labour of course
clear the office the door was opened for this purpose and a couple of men were preparing to carry the insensible boy to his cell when an elderly man of decent but poor appearance clad in an old suit of black rushed hastily into the office and advanced towards the bench
stop stop
dont take him away
for heavens sake stop a moment cried the new comer breathless with haste
although the presiding genii in such an office as this exercise a summary and arbitrary power over the liberties the good name the character almost the lives of her majestys subjects especially of the poorer class and although within such walls enough fantastic tricks are daily played to make the angels blind with weeping they are closed to the public save through the medium of the daily press
footnote or were virtually then
mr fang was consequently not a little indignant to see an unbidden guest enter in such irreverent disorder
what is this
who is this
turn this man out
clear the office cried mr fang
i will speak cried the man i will not be turned out
i saw it all
i keep the bookstall
i demand to be sworn
i will not be put down
mr fang you must hear me
you must not refuse sir the man was right
his manner was determined and the matter was growing rather too serious to be hushed up
swear the man growled mr fang with a very ill grace
now man what have you got to say this said the man i saw three boys two others and the prisoner here loitering on the opposite side of the way when this gentleman was reading
the robbery was committed by another boy
i saw it done and i saw that this boy was perfectly amazed and stupified by it having by this time recovered a little breath the worthy bookstall keeper proceeded to relate in a more coherent manner the exact circumstances of the robbery
why didnt you come here before said fang after a pause
i hadnt a soul to mind the shop replied the man
everybody who could have helped me had joined in the pursuit
i could get nobody till five minutes ago and ive run here all the way the prosecutor was reading was he inquired fang after another pause
yes replied the man
the very book he has in his hand oh that book eh said fang
is it paid for no it is not replied the man with a smile
dear me i forgot all about it exclaimed the absent old gentleman innocently
a nice person to prefer a charge against a poor boy said fang with a comical effort to look humane
i consider sir that you have obtained possession of that book under very suspicious and disreputable circumstances and you may think yourself very fortunate that the owner of the property declines to prosecute
let this be a lesson to you my man or the law will overtake you yet
the boy is discharged
clear the office dn me cried the old gentleman bursting out with the rage he had kept down so long dn me
ill clear the office said the magistrate
officers do you hear
clear the office the mandate was obeyed and the indignant mr brownlow was conveyed out with the book in one hand and the bamboo cane in the other in a perfect phrenzy of rage and defiance
he reached the yard and his passion vanished in a moment
little oliver twist lay on his back on the pavement with his shirt unbuttoned and his temples bathed with water his face a deadly white and a cold tremble convulsing his whole frame
poor boy poor boy said mr brownlow bending over him
call a coach somebody pray
directly a coach was obtained and oliver having been carefully laid on the seat the old gentleman got in and sat himself on the other
may i accompany you said the bookstall keeper looking in
bless me yes my dear sir said mr brownlow quickly
i forgot you
dear dear
i have this unhappy book still
jump in
poor fellow
theres no time to lose the bookstall keeper got into the coach and away they drove
in which oliver is taken better care of than he ever was before
and in which the narrative reverts to the merry old gentleman and his youthful friends
the coach rattled away over nearly the same ground as that which oliver had traversed when he first entered london in company with the dodger and turning a different way when it reached the angel at islington stopped at length before a neat house in a quiet shady street near pentonville
here a bed was prepared without loss of time in which mr brownlow saw his young charge carefully and comfortably deposited and here he was tended with a kindness and solicitude that knew no bounds
but for many days oliver remained insensible to all the goodness of his new friends
the sun rose and sank and rose and sank again and many times after that and still the boy lay stretched on his uneasy bed dwindling away beneath the dry and wasting heat of fever
the worm does not work more surely on the dead body than does this slow creeping fire upon the living frame
weak and thin and pallid he awoke at last from what seemed to have been a long and troubled dream
feebly raising himself in the bed with his head resting on his trembling arm he looked anxiously around
what room is this
where have i been brought to said oliver
this is not the place i went to sleep in he uttered these words in a feeble voice being very faint and weak but they were overheard at once
the curtain at the beds head was hastily drawn back and a motherly old lady very neatly and precisely dressed rose as she undrew it from an armchair close by in which she had been sitting at needlework
hush my dear said the old lady softly
you must be very quiet or you will be ill again and you have been very badas bad as bad could be pretty nigh
lie down again theres a dear with those words the old lady very gently placed olivers head upon the pillow and smoothing back his hair from his forehead looked so kindly and loving in his face that he could not help placing his little withered hand in hers and drawing it round his neck
save us said the old lady with tears in her eyes
what a grateful little dear it is
pretty creetur
what would his mother feel if she had sat by him as i have and could see him now perhaps she does see me whispered oliver folding his hands together perhaps she has sat by me
i almost feel as if she had that was the fever my dear said the old lady mildly
i suppose it was replied oliver because heaven is a long way off and they are too happy there to come down to the bedside of a poor boy
but if she knew i was ill she must have pitied me even there for she was very ill herself before she died
she cant know anything about me though added oliver after a moments silence
if she had seen me hurt it would have made her sorrowful and her face has always looked sweet and happy when i have dreamed of her the old lady made no reply to this but wiping her eyes first and her spectacles which lay on the counterpane afterwards as if they were part and parcel of those features brought some cool stuff for oliver to drink and then patting him on the cheek told him he must lie very quiet or he would be ill again
so oliver kept very still partly because he was anxious to obey the kind old lady in all things and partly to tell the truth because he was completely exhausted with what he had already said
he soon fell into a gentle doze from which he was awakened by the light of a candle which being brought near the bed showed him a gentleman with a very large and loudticking gold watch in his hand who felt his pulse and said he was a great deal better
you are a great deal better are you not my dear said the gentleman
yes thank you sir replied oliver
yes i know you are said the gentleman youre hungry too ant you no sir answered oliver
hem said the gentleman
no i know youre not
he is not hungry mrs bedwin said the gentleman looking very wise
the old lady made a respectful inclination of the head which seemed to say that she thought the doctor was a very clever man
the doctor appeared much of the same opinion himself
you feel sleepy dont you my dear said the doctor
no sir replied oliver
no said the doctor with a very shrewd and satisfied look
youre not sleepy
nor thirsty
are you yes sir rather thirsty answered oliver
just as i expected mrs bedwin said the doctor
its very natural that he should be thirsty
you may give him a little tea maam and some dry toast without any butter
dont keep him too warm maam but be careful that you dont let him be too cold will you have the goodness the old lady dropped a curtsey
the doctor after tasting the cool stuff and expressing a qualified approval of it hurried away his boots creaking in a very important and wealthy manner as he went downstairs
oliver dozed off again soon after this when he awoke it was nearly twelve oclock
the old lady tenderly bade him goodnight shortly afterwards and left him in charge of a fat old woman who had just come bringing with her in a little bundle a small prayer book and a large nightcap
putting the latter on her head and the former on the table the old woman after telling oliver that she had come to sit up with him drew her chair close to the fire and went off into a series of short naps chequered at frequent intervals with sundry tumblings forward and divers moans and chokings
these however had no worse effect than causing her to rub her nose very hard and then fall asleep again
and thus the night crept slowly on
oliver lay awake for some time counting the little circles of light which the reflection of the rushlightshade threw upon the ceiling or tracing with his languid eyes the intricate pattern of the paper on the wall
the darkness and the deep stillness of the room were very solemn as they brought into the boys mind the thought that death had been hovering there for many days and nights and might yet fill it with the gloom and dread of his awful presence he turned his face upon the pillow and fervently prayed to heaven
gradually he fell into that deep tranquil sleep which ease from recent suffering alone imparts that calm and peaceful rest which it is pain to wake from
who if this were death would be roused again to all the struggles and turmoils of life to all its cares for the present its anxieties for the future more than all its weary recollections of the past
it had been bright day for hours when oliver opened his eyes he felt cheerful and happy
the crisis of the disease was safely past
he belonged to the world again
in three days time he was able to sit in an easychair well propped up with pillows and as he was still too weak to walk mrs bedwin had him carried downstairs into the little housekeepers room which belonged to her
having him set here by the fireside the good old lady sat herself down too and being in a state of considerable delight at seeing him so much better forthwith began to cry most violently
never mind me my dear said the old lady im only having a regular good cry
there its all over now and im quite comfortable youre very very kind to me maam said oliver
well never you mind that my dear said the old lady thats got nothing to do with your broth and its full time you had it for the doctor says mr brownlow may come in to see you this morning and we must get up our best looks because the better we look the more hell be pleased and with this the old lady applied herself to warming up in a little saucepan a basin full of broth strong enough oliver thought to furnish an ample dinner when reduced to the regulation strength for three hundred and fifty paupers at the lowest computation
are you fond of pictures dear inquired the old lady seeing that oliver had fixed his eyes most intently on a portrait which hung against the wall just opposite his chair
i dont quite know maam said oliver without taking his eyes from the canvas i have seen so few that i hardly know
what a beautiful mild face that ladys is ah said the old lady painters always make ladies out prettier than they are or they wouldnt get any custom child
the man that invented the machine for taking likenesses might have known that would never succeed its a deal too honest
a deal said the old lady laughing very heartily at her own acuteness
isis that a likeness maam said oliver
yes said the old lady looking up for a moment from the broth thats a portrait whose maam asked oliver
why really my dear i dont know answered the old lady in a goodhumoured manner
its not a likeness of anybody that you or i know i expect
it seems to strike your fancy dear it is so pretty replied oliver
why sure youre not afraid of it said the old lady observing in great surprise the look of awe with which the child regarded the painting
oh no no returned oliver quickly but the eyes look so sorrowful and where i sit they seem fixed upon me
it makes my heart beat added oliver in a low voice as if it was alive and wanted to speak to me but couldnt lord save us exclaimed the old lady starting dont talk in that way child
youre weak and nervous after your illness
let me wheel your chair round to the other side and then you wont see it
there said the old lady suiting the action to the word you dont see it now at all events oliver did see it in his minds eye as distinctly as if he had not altered his position but he thought it better not to worry the kind old lady so he smiled gently when she looked at him and mrs bedwin satisfied that he felt more comfortable salted and broke bits of toasted bread into the broth with all the bustle befitting so solemn a preparation
oliver got through it with extraordinary expedition
he had scarcely swallowed the last spoonful when there came a soft rap at the door
come in said the old lady and in walked mr brownlow
now the old gentleman came in as brisk as need be but he had no sooner raised his spectacles on his forehead and thrust his hands behind the skirts of his dressinggown to take a good long look at oliver than his countenance underwent a very great variety of odd contortions
oliver looked very worn and shadowy from sickness and made an ineffectual attempt to stand up out of respect to his benefactor which terminated in his sinking back into the chair again and the fact is if the truth must be told that mr brownlows heart being large enough for any six ordinary old gentlemen of humane disposition forced a supply of tears into his eyes by some hydraulic process which we are not sufficiently philosophical to be in a condition to explain
poor boy poor boy said mr brownlow clearing his throat
im rather hoarse this morning mrs bedwin
im afraid i have caught cold i hope not sir said mrs bedwin
everything you have had has been well aired sir i dont know bedwin
i dont know said mr brownlow i rather think i had a damp napkin at dinnertime yesterday but never mind that
how do you feel my dear very happy sir replied oliver
and very grateful indeed sir for your goodness to me good by said mr brownlow stoutly
have you given him any nourishment bedwin
any slops eh he has just had a basin of beautiful strong broth sir replied mrs bedwin drawing herself up slightly and laying strong emphasis on the last word to intimate that between slops and broth will compounded there existed no affinity or connection whatsoever
ugh said mr brownlow with a slight shudder a couple of glasses of port wine would have done him a great deal more good
wouldnt they tom white eh my name is oliver sir replied the little invalid with a look of great astonishment
oliver said mr brownlow oliver what
oliver white eh no sir twist oliver twist queer name said the old gentleman
what made you tell the magistrate your name was white i never told him so sir returned oliver in amazement
this sounded so like a falsehood that the old gentleman looked somewhat sternly in olivers face
it was impossible to doubt him there was truth in every one of its thin and sharpened lineaments
some mistake said mr brownlow
but although his motive for looking steadily at oliver no longer existed the old idea of the resemblance between his features and some familiar face came upon him so strongly that he could not withdraw his gaze
i hope you are not angry with me sir said oliver raising his eyes beseechingly
no no replied the old gentleman
why
whats this
bedwin look there as he spoke he pointed hastily to the picture over olivers head and then to the boys face
there was its living copy
the eyes the head the mouth every feature was the same
the expression was for the instant so precisely alike that the minutest line seemed copied with startling accuracy
oliver knew not the cause of this sudden exclamation for not being strong enough to bear the start it gave him he fainted away
a weakness on his part which affords the narrative an opportunity of relieving the reader from suspense in behalf of the two young pupils of the merry old gentleman and of recording that when the dodger and his accomplished friend master bates joined in the hueandcry which was raised at olivers heels in consequence of their executing an illegal conveyance of mr brownlows personal property as has been already described they were actuated by a very laudable and becoming regard for themselves and forasmuch as the freedom of the subject and the liberty of the individual are among the first and proudest boasts of a truehearted englishman so i need hardly beg the reader to observe that this action should tend to exalt them in the opinion of all public and patriotic men in almost as great a degree as this strong proof of their anxiety for their own preservation and safety goes to corroborate and confirm the little code of laws which certain profound and soundjudging philosophers have laid down as the mainsprings of all natures deeds and actions the said philosophers very wisely reducing the good ladys proceedings to matters of maxim and theory and by a very neat and pretty compliment to her exalted wisdom and understanding putting entirely out of sight any considerations of heart or generous impulse and feeling
for these are matters totally beneath a female who is acknowledged by universal admission to be far above the numerous little foibles and weaknesses of her sex
if i wanted any further proof of the strictly philosophical nature of the conduct of these young gentlemen in their very delicate predicament i should at once find it in the fact also recorded in a foregoing part of this narrative of their quitting the pursuit when the general attention was fixed upon oliver and making immediately for their home by the shortest possible cut
although i do not mean to assert that it is usually the practice of renowned and learned sages to shorten the road to any great conclusion their course indeed being rather to lengthen the distance by various circumlocutions and discursive staggerings like unto those in which drunken men under the pressure of a too mighty flow of ideas are prone to indulge still i do mean to say and do say distinctly that it is the invariable practice of many mighty philosophers in carrying out their theories to evince great wisdom and foresight in providing against every possible contingency which can be supposed at all likely to affect themselves
thus to do a great right you may do a little wrong and you may take any means which the end to be attained will justify the amount of the right or the amount of the wrong or indeed the distinction between the two being left entirely to the philosopher concerned to be settled and determined by his clear comprehensive and impartial view of his own particular case
it was not until the two boys had scoured with great rapidity through a most intricate maze of narrow streets and courts that they ventured to halt beneath a low and dark archway
having remained silent here just long enough to recover breath to speak master bates uttered an exclamation of amusement and delight and bursting into an uncontrollable fit of laughter flung himself upon a doorstep and rolled thereon in a transport of mirth
whats the matter inquired the dodger
ha
ha
ha roared charley bates
hold your noise remonstrated the dodger looking cautiously round
do you want to be grabbed stupid i cant help it said charley i cant help it
to see him splitting away at that pace and cutting round the corners and knocking up again the posts and starting on again as if he was made of iron as well as them and me with the wipe in my pocket singing out arter himoh my eye the vivid imagination of master bates presented the scene before him in too strong colours
as he arrived at this apostrophe he again rolled upon the doorstep and laughed louder than before
whatll fagin say inquired the dodger taking advantage of the next interval of breathlessness on the part of his friend to propound the question
what repeated charley bates
ah what said the dodger
why what should he say inquired charley stopping rather suddenly in his merriment for the dodgers manner was impressive
what should he say mr dawkins whistled for a couple of minutes then taking off his hat scratched his head and nodded thrice
what do you mean said charley
toor rul lol loo gammon and spinnage the frog he wouldnt and high cockolorum said the dodger with a slight sneer on his intellectual countenance
this was explanatory but not satisfactory
master bates felt it so and again said what do you mean the dodger made no reply but putting his hat on again and gathering the skirts of his longtailed coat under his arm thrust his tongue into his cheek slapped the bridge of his nose some halfdozen times in a familiar but expressive manner and turning on his heel slunk down the court
master bates followed with a thoughtful countenance
the noise of footsteps on the creaking stairs a few minutes after the occurrence of this conversation roused the merry old gentleman as he sat over the fire with a saveloy and a small loaf in his hand a pocketknife in his right and a pewter pot on the trivet
there was a rascally smile on his white face as he turned round and looking sharply out from under his thick red eyebrows bent his ear towards the door and listened
why hows this muttered the jew changing countenance only two of em
wheres the third
they cant have got into trouble
hark the footsteps approached nearer they reached the landing
the door was slowly opened and the dodger and charley bates entered closing it behind them
some new acquaintances are introduced to the intelligent reader connected with whom various pleasant matters are related appertaining to this history wheres oliver said the jew rising with a menacing look
wheres the boy the young thieves eyed their preceptor as if they were alarmed at his violence and looked uneasily at each other
but they made no reply
whats become of the boy said the jew seizing the dodger tightly by the collar and threatening him with horrid imprecations
speak out or ill throttle you mr fagin looked so very much in earnest that charley bates who deemed it prudent in all cases to be on the safe side and who conceived it by no means improbable that it might be his turn to be throttled second dropped upon his knees and raised a loud wellsustained and continuous roarsomething between a mad bull and a speaking trumpet
will you speak thundered the jew shaking the dodger so much that his keeping in the big coat at all seemed perfectly miraculous
why the traps have got him and thats all about it said the dodger sullenly
come let go o me will you and swinging himself at one jerk clean out of the big coat which he left in the jews hands the dodger snatched up the toasting fork and made a pass at the merry old gentlemans waistcoat which if it had taken effect would have let a little more merriment out than could have been easily replaced
the jew stepped back in this emergency with more agility than could have been anticipated in a man of his apparent decrepitude and seizing up the pot prepared to hurl it at his assailants head
but charley bates at this moment calling his attention by a perfectly terrific howl he suddenly altered its destination and flung it full at that young gentleman
why what the blazes is in the wind now growled a deep voice
who pitched that ere at me
its well its the beer and not the pot as hit me or id have settled somebody
i might have knowd as nobody but an infernal rich plundering thundering old jew could afford to throw away any drink but waterand not that unless he done the river company every quarter
wots it all about fagin
dme if my neckhandkercher ant lined with beer
come in you sneaking warmint wot are you stopping outside for as if you was ashamed of your master
come in the man who growled out these words was a stoutlybuilt fellow of about fiveandthirty in a black velveteen coat very soiled drab breeches laceup half boots and grey cotton stockings which inclosed a bulky pair of legs with large swelling calvesthe kind of legs which in such costume always look in an unfinished and incomplete state without a set of fetters to garnish them
he had a brown hat on his head and a dirty belcher handkerchief round his neck with the long frayed ends of which he smeared the beer from his face as he spoke
he disclosed when he had done so a broad heavy countenance with a beard of three days growth and two scowling eyes one of which displayed various particoloured symptoms of having been recently damaged by a blow
come in dye hear growled this engaging ruffian
a white shaggy dog with his face scratched and torn in twenty different places skulked into the room
why didnt you come in afore said the man
youre getting too proud to own me afore company are you
lie down this command was accompanied with a kick which sent the animal to the other end of the room
he appeared well used to it however for he coiled himself up in a corner very quietly without uttering a sound and winking his very illlooking eyes twenty times in a minute appeared to occupy himself in taking a survey of the apartment
what are you up to
illtreating the boys you covetous avaricious insatiable old fence said the man seating himself deliberately
i wonder they dont murder you
i would if i was them
if id been your prentice id have done it long ago andno i couldnt have sold you afterwards for youre fit for nothing but keeping as a curiousity of ugliness in a glass bottle and i suppose they dont blow glass bottles large enough hush
hush
mr sikes said the jew trembling dont speak so loud none of your mistering replied the ruffian you always mean mischief when you come that
you know my name out with it
i shant disgrace it when the time comes well well thenbill sikes said the jew with abject humility
you seem out of humour bill perhaps i am replied sikes i should think you was rather out of sorts too unless you mean as little harm when you throw pewter pots about as you do when you blab and are you mad said the jew catching the man by the sleeve and pointing towards the boys
mr sikes contented himself with tying an imaginary knot under his left ear and jerking his head over on the right shoulder a piece of dumb show which the jew appeared to understand perfectly
he then in cant terms with which his whole conversation was plentifully besprinkled but which would be quite unintelligible if they were recorded here demanded a glass of liquor
and mind you dont poison it said mr sikes laying his hat upon the table
this was said in jest but if the speaker could have seen the evil leer with which the jew bit his pale lip as he turned round to the cupboard he might have thought the caution not wholly unnecessary or the wish at all events to improve upon the distillers ingenuity not very far from the old gentlemans merry heart
after swallowing two of three glasses of spirits mr sikes condescended to take some notice of the young gentlemen which gracious act led to a conversation in which the cause and manner of olivers capture were circumstantially detailed with such alterations and improvements on the truth as to the dodger appeared most advisable under the circumstances
im afraid said the jew that he may say something which will get us into trouble thats very likely returned sikes with a malicious grin
youre blowed upon fagin and im afraid you see added the jew speaking as if he had not noticed the interruption and regarding the other closely as he did soim afraid that if the game was up with us it might be up with a good many more and that it would come out rather worse for you than it would for me my dear the man started and turned round upon the jew
but the old gentlemans shoulders were shrugged up to his ears and his eyes were vacantly staring on the opposite wall
there was a long pause
every member of the respectable coterie appeared plunged in his own reflections not excepting the dog who by a certain malicious licking of his lips seemed to be meditating an attack upon the legs of the first gentleman or lady he might encounter in the streets when he went out
somebody must find out wots been done at the office said mr sikes in a much lower tone than he had taken since he came in
the jew nodded assent
if he hasnt peached and is committed theres no fear till he comes out again said mr sikes and then he must be taken care on
you must get hold of him somehow again the jew nodded
the prudence of this line of action indeed was obvious but unfortunately there was one very strong objection to its being adopted
this was that the dodger and charley bates and fagin and mr william sikes happened one and all to entertain a violent and deeplyrooted antipathy to going near a policeoffice on any ground or pretext whatever
how long they might have sat and looked at each other in a state of uncertainty not the most pleasant of its kind it is difficult to guess
it is not necessary to make any guesses on the subject however for the sudden entrance of the two young ladies whom oliver had seen on a former occasion caused the conversation to flow afresh
the very thing said the jew
bet will go wont you my dear wheres inquired the young lady
only just up to the office my dear said the jew coaxingly
it is due to the young lady to say that she did not positively affirm that she would not but that she merely expressed an emphatic and earnest desire to be blessed if she would a polite and delicate evasion of the request which shows the young lady to have been possessed of that natural good breeding which cannot bear to inflict upon a fellowcreature the pain of a direct and pointed refusal
the jews countenance fell
he turned from this young lady who was gaily not to say gorgeously attired in a red gown green boots and yellow curlpapers to the other female
nancy my dear said the jew in a soothing manner what do you say that it wont do so its no use atrying it on fagin replied nancy
what do you mean by that said mr sikes looking up in a surly manner
what i say bill replied the lady collectedly
why youre just the very person for it reasoned mr sikes nobody about here knows anything of you and as i dont want em to neither replied nancy in the same composed manner its rather more no than yes with me bill shell go fagin said sikes
no she wont fagin said nancy
yes she will fagin said sikes
and mr sikes was right
by dint of alternate threats promises and bribes the lady in question was ultimately prevailed upon to undertake the commission
she was not indeed withheld by the same considerations as her agreeable friend for having recently removed into the neighborhood of field lane from the remote but genteel suburb of ratcliffe she was not under the same apprehension of being recognised by any of her numerous acquaintances
accordingly with a clean white apron tied over her gown and her curlpapers tucked up under a straw bonnetboth articles of dress being provided from the jews inexhaustible stockmiss nancy prepared to issue forth on her errand
stop a minute my dear said the jew producing a little covered basket
carry that in one hand
it looks more respectable my dear give her a doorkey to carry in her tother one fagin said sikes it looks real and genivine like yes yes my dear so it does said the jew hanging a large streetdoor key on the forefinger of the young ladys right hand
there very good
very good indeed my dear said the jew rubbing his hands
oh my brother
my poor dear sweet innocent little brother exclaimed nancy bursting into tears and wringing the little basket and the streetdoor key in an agony of distress
what has become of him
where have they taken him to
oh do have pity and tell me whats been done with the dear boy gentlemen do gentlemen if you please gentlemen having uttered those words in a most lamentable and heartbroken tone to the immeasurable delight of her hearers miss nancy paused winked to the company nodded smilingly round and disappeared
ah shes a clever girl my dears said the jew turning round to his young friends and shaking his head gravely as if in mute admonition to them to follow the bright example they had just beheld
shes a honour to her sex said mr sikes filling his glass and smiting the table with his enormous fist
heres her health and wishing they was all like her while these and many other encomiums were being passed on the accomplished nancy that young lady made the best of her way to the policeoffice whither notwithstanding a little natural timidity consequent upon walking through the streets alone and unprotected she arrived in perfect safety shortly afterwards
entering by the back way she tapped softly with the key at one of the celldoors and listened
there was no sound within so she coughed and listened again
still there was no reply so she spoke
nolly dear murmured nancy in a gentle voice nolly there was nobody inside but a miserable shoeless criminal who had been taken up for playing the flute and who the offence against society having been clearly proved had been very properly committed by mr fang to the house of correction for one month with the appropriate and amusing remark that since he had so much breath to spare it would be more wholesomely expended on the treadmill than in a musical instrument
he made no answer being occupied mentally bewailing the loss of the flute which had been confiscated for the use of the county so nancy passed on to the next cell and knocked there
well cried a faint and feeble voice
is there a little boy here inquired nancy with a preliminary sob
no replied the voice god forbid this was a vagrant of sixtyfive who was going to prison for not playing the flute or in other words for begging in the streets and doing nothing for his livelihood
in the next cell was another man who was going to the same prison for hawking tin saucepans without license thereby doing something for his living in defiance of the stampoffice
but as neither of these criminals answered to the name of oliver or knew anything about him nancy made straight up to the bluff officer in the striped waistcoat and with the most piteous wailings and lamentations rendered more piteous by a prompt and efficient use of the streetdoor key and the little basket demanded her own dear brother
i havent got him my dear said the old man
where is he screamed nancy in a distracted manner
why the gentlemans got him replied the officer
what gentleman
oh gracious heavens
what gentleman exclaimed nancy
in reply to this incoherent questioning the old man informed the deeply affected sister that oliver had been taken ill in the office and discharged in consequence of a witness having proved the robbery to have been committed by another boy not in custody and that the prosecutor had carried him away in an insensible condition to his own residence of and concerning which all the informant knew was that it was somewhere in pentonville he having heard that word mentioned in the directions to the coachman
in a dreadful state of doubt and uncertainty the agonised young woman staggered to the gate and then exchanging her faltering walk for a swift run returned by the most devious and complicated route she could think of to the domicile of the jew
mr bill sikes no sooner heard the account of the expedition delivered than he very hastily called up the white dog and putting on his hat expeditiously departed without devoting any time to the formality of wishing the company goodmorning
we must know where he is my dears he must be found said the jew greatly excited
charley do nothing but skulk about till you bring home some news of him
nancy my dear i must have him found
i trust to you my dearto you and the artful for everything
stay stay added the jew unlocking a drawer with a shaking hand theres money my dears
i shall shut up this shop tonight
youll know where to find me
dont stop here a minute
not an instant my dears with these words he pushed them from the room and carefully doublelocking and barring the door behind them drew from its place of concealment the box which he had unintentionally disclosed to oliver
then he hastily proceeded to dispose the watches and jewellery beneath his clothing
a rap at the door startled him in this occupation
whos there he cried in a shrill tone
me replied the voice of the dodger through the keyhole
what now cried the jew impatiently
is he to be kidnapped to the other ken nancy says inquired the dodger
yes replied the jew wherever she lays hands on him
find him find him out thats all
i shall know what to do next never fear the boy murmured a reply of intelligence and hurried downstairs after his companions
he has not peached so far said the jew as he pursued his occupation
if he means to blab us among his new friends we may stop his mouth yet comprising further particulars of olivers stay at mr brownlows with the remarkable prediction which one mr grimwig uttered concerning him when he went out on an errand oliver soon recovering from the faintingfit into which mr brownlows abrupt exclamation had thrown him the subject of the picture was carefully avoided both by the old gentleman and mrs bedwin in the conversation that ensued which indeed bore no reference to olivers history or prospects but was confined to such topics as might amuse without exciting him
he was still too weak to get up to breakfast but when he came down into the housekeepers room next day his first act was to cast an eager glance at the wall in the hope of again looking on the face of the beautiful lady
his expectations were disappointed however for the picture had been removed
ah said the housekeeper watching the direction of olivers eyes
it is gone you see i see it is maam replied oliver
why have they taken it away it has been taken down child because mr brownlow said that as it seemed to worry you perhaps it might prevent your getting well you know rejoined the old lady
oh no indeed
it didnt worry me maam said oliver
i liked to see it
i quite loved it well well said the old lady goodhumouredly you get well as fast as ever you can dear and it shall be hung up again
there
i promise you that
now let us talk about something else this was all the information oliver could obtain about the picture at that time
as the old lady had been so kind to him in his illness he endeavoured to think no more of the subject just then so he listened attentively to a great many stories she told him about an amiable and handsome daughter of hers who was married to an amiable and handsome man and lived in the country and about a son who was clerk to a merchant in the west indies and who was also such a good young man and wrote such dutiful letters home four times ayear that it brought the tears into her eyes to talk about them
when the old lady had expatiated a long time on the excellences of her children and the merits of her kind good husband besides who had been dead and gone poor dear soul
just sixandtwenty years it was time to have tea
after tea she began to teach oliver cribbage which he learnt as quickly as she could teach and at which game they played with great interest and gravity until it was time for the invalid to have some warm wine and water with a slice of dry toast and then to go cosily to bed
they were happy days those of olivers recovery
everything was so quiet and neat and orderly everybody so kind and gentle that after the noise and turbulence in the midst of which he had always lived it seemed like heaven itself
he was no sooner strong enough to put his clothes on properly than mr brownlow caused a complete new suit and a new cap and a new pair of shoes to be provided for him
as oliver was told that he might do what he liked with the old clothes he gave them to a servant who had been very kind to him and asked her to sell them to a jew and keep the money for herself
this she very readily did and as oliver looked out of the parlour window and saw the jew roll them up in his bag and walk away he felt quite delighted to think that they were safely gone and that there was now no possible danger of his ever being able to wear them again
they were sad rags to tell the truth and oliver had never had a new suit before
one evening about a week after the affair of the picture as he was sitting talking to mrs bedwin there came a message down from mr brownlow that if oliver twist felt pretty well he should like to see him in his study and talk to him a little while
bless us and save us
wash your hands and let me part your hair nicely for you child said mrs bedwin
dear heart alive
if we had known he would have asked for you we would have put you a clean collar on and made you as smart as sixpence oliver did as the old lady bade him and although she lamented grievously meanwhile that there was not even time to crimp the little frill that bordered his shirtcollar he looked so delicate and handsome despite that important personal advantage that she went so far as to say looking at him with great complacency from head to foot that she really didnt think it would have been possible on the longest notice to have made much difference in him for the better
thus encouraged oliver tapped at the study door
on mr brownlow calling to him to come in he found himself in a little back room quite full of books with a window looking into some pleasant little gardens
there was a table drawn up before the window at which mr brownlow was seated reading
when he saw oliver he pushed the book away from him and told him to come near the table and sit down
oliver complied marvelling where the people could be found to read such a great number of books as seemed to be written to make the world wiser
which is still a marvel to more experienced people than oliver twist every day of their lives
there are a good many books are there not my boy said mr brownlow observing the curiosity with which oliver surveyed the shelves that reached from the floor to the ceiling
a great number sir replied oliver
i never saw so many you shall read them if you behave well said the old gentleman kindly and you will like that better than looking at the outsidesthat is some cases because there are books of which the backs and covers are by far the best parts i suppose they are those heavy ones sir said oliver pointing to some large quartos with a good deal of gilding about the binding
not always those said the old gentleman patting oliver on the head and smiling as he did so there are other equally heavy ones though of a much smaller size
how should you like to grow up a clever man and write books eh i think i would rather read them sir replied oliver
what
wouldnt you like to be a bookwriter said the old gentleman
oliver considered a little while and at last said he should think it would be a much better thing to be a bookseller upon which the old gentleman laughed heartily and declared he had said a very good thing
which oliver felt glad to have done though he by no means knew what it was
well well said the old gentleman composing his features
dont be afraid
we wont make an author of you while theres an honest trade to be learnt or brickmaking to turn to thank you sir said oliver
at the earnest manner of his reply the old gentleman laughed again and said something about a curious instinct which oliver not understanding paid no very great attention to
now said mr brownlow speaking if possible in a kinder but at the same time in a much more serious manner than oliver had ever known him assume yet i want you to pay great attention my boy to what i am going to say
i shall talk to you without any reserve because i am sure you are well able to understand me as many older persons would be oh dont tell you are going to send me away sir pray exclaimed oliver alarmed at the serious tone of the old gentlemans commencement
dont turn me out of doors to wander in the streets again
let me stay here and be a servant
dont send me back to the wretched place i came from
have mercy upon a poor boy sir my dear child said the old gentleman moved by the warmth of olivers sudden appeal you need not be afraid of my deserting you unless you give me cause i never never will sir interposed oliver
i hope not rejoined the old gentleman
i do not think you ever will
i have been deceived before in the objects whom i have endeavoured to benefit but i feel strongly disposed to trust you nevertheless and i am more interested in your behalf than i can well account for even to myself
the persons on whom i have bestowed my dearest love lie deep in their graves but although the happiness and delight of my life lie buried there too i have not made a coffin of my heart and sealed it up forever on my best affections
deep affliction has but strengthened and refined them as the old gentleman said this in a low voice more to himself than to his companion and as he remained silent for a short time afterwards oliver sat quite still
well well said the old gentleman at length in a more cheerful tone i only say this because you have a young heart and knowing that i have suffered great pain and sorrow you will be more careful perhaps not to wound me again
you say you are an orphan without a friend in the world all the inquiries i have been able to make confirm the statement
let me hear your story where you come from who brought you up and how you got into the company in which i found you
speak the truth and you shall not be friendless while i live olivers sobs checked his utterance for some minutes when he was on the point of beginning to relate how he had been brought up at the farm and carried to the workhouse by mr bumble a peculiarly impatient little doubleknock was heard at the streetdoor and the servant running upstairs announced mr grimwig
is he coming up inquired mr brownlow
yes sir replied the servant
he asked if there were any muffins in the house and when i told him yes he said he had come to tea mr brownlow smiled and turning to oliver said that mr grimwig was an old friend of his and he must not mind his being a little rough in his manners for he was a worthy creature at bottom as he had reason to know
shall i go downstairs sir inquired oliver
no replied mr brownlow i would rather you remained here at this moment there walked into the room supporting himself by a thick stick a stout old gentleman rather lame in one leg who was dressed in a blue coat striped waistcoat nankeen breeches and gaiters and a broadbrimmed white hat with the sides turned up with green
a very smallplaited shirt frill stuck out from his waistcoat and a very long steel watchchain with nothing but a key at the end dangled loosely below it
the ends of his white neckerchief were twisted into a ball about the size of an orange the variety of shapes into which his countenance was twisted defy description
he had a manner of screwing his head on one side when he spoke and of looking out of the corners of his eyes at the same time which irresistibly reminded the beholder of a parrot
in this attitude he fixed himself the moment he made his appearance and holding out a small piece of orangepeel at arms length exclaimed in a growling discontented voice
look here
do you see this
isnt it a most wonderful and extraordinary thing that i cant call at a mans house but i find a piece of this poor surgeons friend on the staircase
ive been lamed with orangepeel once and i know orangepeel will be my death or ill be content to eat my own head sir this was the handsome offer with which mr grimwig backed and confirmed nearly every assertion he made and it was the more singular in his case because even admitting for the sake of argument the possibility of scientific improvements being brought to that pass which will enable a gentleman to eat his own head in the event of his being so disposed mr grimwigs head was such a particularly large one that the most sanguine man alive could hardly entertain a hope of being able to get through it at a sittingto put entirely out of the question a very thick coating of powder
ill eat my head sir repeated mr grimwig striking his stick upon the ground
hallo
whats that looking at oliver and retreating a pace or two
this is young oliver twist whom we were speaking about said mr brownlow
oliver bowed
you dont mean to say thats the boy who had the fever i hope said mr grimwig recoiling a little more
wait a minute
dont speak
stop continued mr grimwig abruptly losing all dread of the fever in his triumph at the discovery thats the boy who had the orange
if thats not the boy sir who had the orange and threw this bit of peel upon the staircase ill eat my head and his too no no he has not had one said mr brownlow laughing
come
put down your hat and speak to my young friend i feel strongly on this subject sir said the irritable old gentleman drawing off his gloves
theres always more or less orangepeel on the pavement in our street and i know its put there by the surgeons boy at the corner
a young woman stumbled over a bit last night and fell against my gardenrailings directly she got up i saw her look towards his infernal red lamp with the pantomimelight
dont go to him i called out of the window hes an assassin
a mantrap so he is
if he is not here the irascible old gentleman gave a great knock on the ground with his stick which was always understood by his friends to imply the customary offer whenever it was not expressed in words
then still keeping his stick in his hand he sat down and opening a double eyeglass which he wore attached to a broad black riband took a view of oliver who seeing that he was the object of inspection coloured and bowed again
thats the boy is it said mr grimwig at length
thats the boy replied mr brownlow
how are you boy said mr grimwig
a great deal better thank you sir replied oliver
mr brownlow seeming to apprehend that his singular friend was about to say something disagreeable asked oliver to step downstairs and tell mrs bedwin they were ready for tea which as he did not half like the visitors manner he was very happy to do
he is a nicelooking boy is he not inquired mr brownlow
i dont know replied mr grimwig pettishly
dont know no
i dont know
i never see any difference in boys
i only knew two sort of boys
mealy boys and beeffaced boys and which is oliver mealy
i know a friend who has a beeffaced boy a fine boy they call him with a round head and red cheeks and glaring eyes a horrid boy with a body and limbs that appear to be swelling out of the seams of his blue clothes with the voice of a pilot and the appetite of a wolf
i know him
the wretch come said mr brownlow these are not the characteristics of young oliver twist so he neednt excite your wrath they are not replied mr grimwig
he may have worse here mr brownlow coughed impatiently which appeared to afford mr grimwig the most exquisite delight
he may have worse i say repeated mr grimwig
where does he come from
who is he
what is he
he has had a fever
what of that
fevers are not peculiar to good people are they
bad people have fevers sometimes havent they eh
i knew a man who was hung in jamaica for murdering his master
he had had a fever six times he wasnt recommended to mercy on that account
pooh
nonsense now the fact was that in the inmost recesses of his own heart mr grimwig was strongly disposed to admit that olivers appearance and manner were unusually prepossessing but he had a strong appetite for contradiction sharpened on this occasion by the finding of the orangepeel and inwardly determining that no man should dictate to him whether a boy was welllooking or not he had resolved from the first to oppose his friend
when mr brownlow admitted that on no one point of inquiry could he yet return a satisfactory answer and that he had postponed any investigation into olivers previous history until he thought the boy was strong enough to hear it mr grimwig chuckled maliciously
and he demanded with a sneer whether the housekeeper was in the habit of counting the plate at night because if she didnt find a tablespoon or two missing some sunshiny morning why he would be content toand so forth
all this mr brownlow although himself somewhat of an impetuous gentleman knowing his friends peculiarities bore with great good humour as mr grimwig at tea was graciously pleased to express his entire approval of the muffins matters went on very smoothly and oliver who made one of the party began to feel more at his ease than he had yet done in the fierce old gentlemans presence
and when are you going to hear a full true and particular account of the life and adventures of oliver twist asked grimwig of mr brownlow at the conclusion of the meal looking sideways at oliver as he resumed his subject
tomorrow morning replied mr brownlow
i would rather he was alone with me at the time
come up to me tomorrow morning at ten oclock my dear yes sir replied oliver
he answered with some hesitation because he was confused by mr grimwigs looking so hard at him
ill tell you what whispered that gentleman to mr brownlow he wont come up to you tomorrow morning
i saw him hesitate
he is deceiving you my good friend ill swear he is not replied mr brownlow warmly
if he is not said mr grimwig ill and down went the stick
ill answer for that boys truth with my life said mr brownlow knocking the table
and i for his falsehood with my head rejoined mr grimwig knocking the table also
we shall see said mr brownlow checking his rising anger
we will replied mr grimwig with a provoking smile we will as fate would have it mrs bedwin chanced to bring in at this moment a small parcel of books which mr brownlow had that morning purchased of the identical bookstallkeeper who has already figured in this history having laid them on the table she prepared to leave the room
stop the boy mrs bedwin said mr brownlow there is something to go back he has gone sir replied mrs bedwin
call after him said mr brownlow its particular
he is a poor man and they are not paid for
there are some books to be taken back too the streetdoor was opened
oliver ran one way and the girl ran another and mrs bedwin stood on the step and screamed for the boy but there was no boy in sight
oliver and the girl returned in a breathless state to report that there were no tidings of him
dear me i am very sorry for that exclaimed mr brownlow i particularly wished those books to be returned tonight send oliver with them said mr grimwig with an ironical smile he will be sure to deliver them safely you know yes do let me take them if you please sir said oliver
ill run all the way sir the old gentleman was just going to say that oliver should not go out on any account when a most malicious cough from mr grimwig determined him that he should and that by his prompt discharge of the commission he should prove to him the injustice of his suspicions on this head at least at once
you shall go my dear said the old gentleman
the books are on a chair by my table
fetch them down oliver delighted to be of use brought down the books under his arm in a great bustle and waited cap in hand to hear what message he was to take
you are to say said mr brownlow glancing steadily at grimwig you are to say that you have brought those books back and that you have come to pay the four pound ten i owe him
this is a fivepound note so you will have to bring me back ten shillings change i wont be ten minutes sir said oliver eagerly
having buttoned up the banknote in his jacket pocket and placed the books carefully under his arm he made a respectful bow and left the room
mrs bedwin followed him to the streetdoor giving him many directions about the nearest way and the name of the bookseller and the name of the street all of which oliver said he clearly understood
having superadded many injunctions to be sure and not take cold the old lady at length permitted him to depart
bless his sweet face said the old lady looking after him
i cant bear somehow to let him go out of my sight at this moment oliver looked gaily round and nodded before he turned the corner
the old lady smilingly returned his salutation and closing the door went back to her own room
let me see hell be back in twenty minutes at the longest said mr brownlow pulling out his watch and placing it on the table
it will be dark by that time oh
you really expect him to come back do you inquired mr grimwig
dont you asked mr brownlow smiling
the spirit of contradiction was strong in mr grimwigs breast at the moment and it was rendered stronger by his friends confident smile
no he said smiting the table with his fist i do not
the boy has a new suit of clothes on his back a set of valuable books under his arm and a fivepound note in his pocket
hell join his old friends the thieves and laugh at you
if ever that boy returns to this house sir ill eat my head with these words he drew his chair closer to the table and there the two friends sat in silent expectation with the watch between them
it is worthy of remark as illustrating the importance we attach to our own judgments and the pride with which we put forth our most rash and hasty conclusions that although mr grimwig was not by any means a badhearted man and though he would have been unfeignedly sorry to see his respected friend duped and deceived he really did most earnestly and strongly hope at that moment that oliver twist might not come back
it grew so dark that the figures on the dialplate were scarcely discernible but there the two old gentlemen continued to sit in silence with the watch between them
showing how very fond of oliver twist the merry old jew and miss nancy were in the obscure parlour of a low publichouse in the filthiest part of little saffron hill a dark and gloomy den where a flaring gaslight burnt all day in the wintertime and where no ray of sun ever shone in the summer there sat brooding over a little pewter measure and a small glass strongly impregnated with the smell of liquor a man in a velveteen coat drab shorts halfboots and stockings whom even by that dim light no experienced agent of the police would have hesitated to recognise as mr william sikes
at his feet sat a whitecoated redeyed dog who occupied himself alternately in winking at his master with both eyes at the same time and in licking a large fresh cut on one side of his mouth which appeared to be the result of some recent conflict
keep quiet you warmint
keep quiet said mr sikes suddenly breaking silence
whether his meditations were so intense as to be disturbed by the dogs winking or whether his feelings were so wrought upon by his reflections that they required all the relief derivable from kicking an unoffending animal to allay them is matter for argument and consideration
whatever was the cause the effect was a kick and a curse bestowed upon the dog simultaneously
dogs are not generally apt to revenge injuries inflicted upon them by their masters but mr sikess dog having faults of temper in common with his owner and labouring perhaps at this moment under a powerful sense of injury made no more ado but at once fixed his teeth in one of the halfboots
having given in a hearty shake he retired growling under a form just escaping the pewter measure which mr sikes levelled at his head
you would would you said sikes seizing the poker in one hand and deliberately opening with the other a large claspknife which he drew from his pocket
come here you born devil
come here
dye hear the dog no doubt heard because mr sikes spoke in the very harshest key of a very harsh voice but appearing to entertain some unaccountable objection to having his throat cut he remained where he was and growled more fiercely than before at the same time grasping the end of the poker between his teeth and biting at it like a wild beast
this resistance only infuriated mr sikes the more who dropping on his knees began to assail the animal most furiously
the dog jumped from right to left and from left to right snapping growling and barking the man thrust and swore and struck and blasphemed and the struggle was reaching a most critical point for one or other when the door suddenly opening the dog darted out leaving bill sikes with the poker and the claspknife in his hands
there must always be two parties to a quarrel says the old adage
mr sikes being disappointed of the dogs participation at once transferred his share in the quarrel to the new comer
what the devil do you come in between me and my dog for said sikes with a fierce gesture
i didnt know my dear i didnt know replied fagin humbly for the jew was the new comer
didnt know you whitelivered thief growled sikes
couldnt you hear the noise not a sound of it as im a living man bill replied the jew
oh no
you hear nothing you dont retorted sikes with a fierce sneer
sneaking in and out so as nobody hears how you come or go
i wish you had been the dog fagin half a minute ago why inquired the jew with a forced smile
cause the government as cares for the lives of such men as you as havent half the pluck of curs lets a man kill a dog how he likes replied sikes shutting up the knife with a very expressive look thats why the jew rubbed his hands and sitting down at the table affected to laugh at the pleasantry of his friend
he was obviously very ill at ease however
grin away said sikes replacing the poker and surveying him with savage contempt grin away
youll never have the laugh at me though unless its behind a nightcap
ive got the upper hand over you fagin and dme ill keep it
there
if i go you go so take care of me well well my dear said the jew i know all that wewehave a mutual interest billa mutual interest humph said sikes as if he thought the interest lay rather more on the jews side than on his
well what have you got to say to me its all passed safe through the meltingpot replied fagin and this is your share
its rather more than it ought to be my dear but as i know youll do me a good turn another time and stow that gammon interposed the robber impatiently
where is it
hand over yes yes bill give me time give me time replied the jew soothingly
here it is
all safe as he spoke he drew forth an old cotton handkerchief from his breast and untying a large knot in one corner produced a small brownpaper packet
sikes snatching it from him hastily opened it and proceeded to count the sovereigns it contained
this is all is it inquired sikes
all replied the jew
you havent opened the parcel and swallowed one or two as you come along have you inquired sikes suspiciously
dont put on an injured look at the question youve done it many a time
jerk the tinkler these words in plain english conveyed an injunction to ring the bell
it was answered by another jew younger than fagin but nearly as vile and repulsive in appearance
bill sikes merely pointed to the empty measure
the jew perfectly understanding the hint retired to fill it previously exchanging a remarkable look with fagin who raised his eyes for an instant as if in expectation of it and shook his head in reply so slightly that the action would have been almost imperceptible to an observant third person
it was lost upon sikes who was stooping at the moment to tie the bootlace which the dog had torn
possibly if he had observed the brief interchange of signals he might have thought that it boded no good to him
is anybody here barney inquired fagin speaking now that sikes was looking on without raising his eyes from the ground
dot a shoul replied barney whose words whether they came from the heart or not made their way through the nose
nobody inquired fagin in a tone of surprise which perhaps might mean that barney was at liberty to tell the truth
dobody but biss dadsy replied barney
nancy exclaimed sikes
where
strike me blind if i dont honour that ere girl for her native talents shes bid havid a plate of boiled beef id the bar replied barney
send her here said sikes pouring out a glass of liquor
send her here barney looked timidly at fagin as if for permission the jew remaining silent and not lifting his eyes from the ground he retired and presently returned ushering in nancy who was decorated with the bonnet apron basket and streetdoor key complete
you are on the scent are you nancy inquired sikes proffering the glass
yes i am bill replied the young lady disposing of its contents and tired enough of it i am too
the young brats been ill and confined to the crib and ah nancy dear said fagin looking up
now whether a peculiar contraction of the jews red eyebrows and a half closing of his deeplyset eyes warned miss nancy that she was disposed to be too communicative is not a matter of much importance
the fact is all we need care for here and the fact is that she suddenly checked herself and with several gracious smiles upon mr sikes turned the conversation to other matters
in about ten minutes time mr fagin was seized with a fit of coughing upon which nancy pulled her shawl over her shoulders and declared it was time to go
mr sikes finding that he was walking a short part of her way himself expressed his intention of accompanying her they went away together followed at a little distant by the dog who slunk out of a backyard as soon as his master was out of sight
the jew thrust his head out of the room door when sikes had left it looked after him as he walked up the dark passage shook his clenched fist muttered a deep curse and then with a horrible grin reseated himself at the table where he was soon deeply absorbed in the interesting pages of the hueandcry
meanwhile oliver twist little dreaming that he was within so very short a distance of the merry old gentleman was on his way to the bookstall
when he got into clerkenwell he accidently turned down a bystreet which was not exactly in his way but not discovering his mistake until he had got halfway down it and knowing it must lead in the right direction he did not think it worth while to turn back and so marched on as quickly as he could with the books under his arm
he was walking along thinking how happy and contented he ought to feel and how much he would give for only one look at poor little dick who starved and beaten might be weeping bitterly at that very moment when he was startled by a young woman screaming out very loud
oh my dear brother and he had hardly looked up to see what the matter was when he was stopped by having a pair of arms thrown tight round his neck
dont cried oliver struggling
let go of me
who is it
what are you stopping me for the only reply to this was a great number of loud lamentations from the young woman who had embraced him and who had a little basket and a streetdoor key in her hand
oh my gracious said the young woman i have found him
oh
oliver
oliver
oh you naughty boy to make me suffer such distress on your account
come home dear come
oh ive found him
thank gracious goodness heavins ive found him with these incoherent exclamations the young woman burst into another fit of crying and got so dreadfully hysterical that a couple of women who came up at the moment asked a butchers boy with a shiny head of hair anointed with suet who was also looking on whether he didnt think he had better run for the doctor
to which the butchers boy who appeared of a lounging not to say indolent disposition replied that he thought not
oh no no never mind said the young woman grasping olivers hand im better now
come home directly you cruel boy
come oh maam replied the young woman he ran away near a month ago from his parents who are hardworking and respectable people and went and joined a set of thieves and bad characters and almost broke his mothers heart young wretch said one woman
go home do you little brute said the other
i am not replied oliver greatly alarmed
i dont know her
i havent any sister or father and mother either
im an orphan i live at pentonville only hear him how he braves it out cried the young woman
why its nancy exclaimed oliver who now saw her face for the first time and started back in irrepressible astonishment
you see he knows me cried nancy appealing to the bystanders
he cant help himself
make him come home theres good people or hell kill his dear mother and father and break my heart what the devils this said a man bursting out of a beershop with a white dog at his heels young oliver
come home to your poor mother you young dog
come home directly i dont belong to them
i dont know them
help
help cried oliver struggling in the mans powerful grasp
help repeated the man
yes ill help you you young rascal
what books are these
youve been a stealing em have you
give em here with these words the man tore the volumes from his grasp and struck him on the head
thats right cried a lookeron from a garretwindow
thats the only way of bringing him to his senses to be sure cried a sleepyfaced carpenter casting an approving look at the garretwindow
itll do him good said the two women
and he shall have it too rejoined the man administering another blow and seizing oliver by the collar
come on you young villain
here bullseye mind him boy
mind him weak with recent illness stupified by the blows and the suddenness of the attack terrified by the fierce growling of the dog and the brutality of the man overpowered by the conviction of the bystanders that he really was the hardened little wretch he was described to be what could one poor child do
darkness had set in it was a low neighborhood no help was near resistance was useless
in another moment he was dragged into a labyrinth of dark narrow courts and was forced along them at a pace which rendered the few cries he dared to give utterance to unintelligible
it was of little moment indeed whether they were intelligible or no for there was nobody to care for them had they been ever so plain
the gaslamps were lighted mrs bedwin was waiting anxiously at the open door the servant had run up the street twenty times to see if there were any traces of oliver and still the two old gentlemen sat perseveringly in the dark parlour with the watch between them
relates what became of oliver twist after he had been claimed by nancy the narrow streets and courts at length terminated in a large open space scattered about which were pens for beasts and other indications of a cattlemarket
sikes slackened his pace when they reached this spot the girl being quite unable to support any longer the rapid rate at which they had hitherto walked
turning to oliver he roughly commanded him to take hold of nancys hand
do you hear growled sikes as oliver hesitated and looked round
they were in a dark corner quite out of the track of passengers
oliver saw but too plainly that resistance would be of no avail
he held out his hand which nancy clasped tight in hers
give me the other said sikes seizing olivers unoccupied hand
here bullseye the dog looked up and growled
see here boy said sikes putting his other hand to olivers throat if he speaks ever so soft a word hold him
dye mind the dog growled again and licking his lips eyed oliver as if he were anxious to attach himself to his windpipe without delay
hes as willing as a christian strike me blind if he isnt said sikes regarding the animal with a kind of grim and ferocious approval
now you know what youve got to expect master so call away as quick as you like the dog will soon stop that game
get on youngun bullseye wagged his tail in acknowledgment of this unusually endearing form of speech and giving vent to another admonitory growl for the benefit of oliver led the way onward
it was smithfield that they were crossing although it might have been grosvenor square for anything oliver knew to the contrary
the night was dark and foggy
the lights in the shops could scarecely struggle through the heavy mist which thickened every moment and shrouded the streets and houses in gloom rendering the strange place still stranger in olivers eyes and making his uncertainty the more dismal and depressing
they had hurried on a few paces when a deep churchbell struck the hour
with its first stroke his two conductors stopped and turned their heads in the direction whence the sound proceeded
eight oclock bill said nancy when the bell ceased
whats the good of telling me that i can hear it cant i replied sikes
i wonder whether they can hear it said nancy
of course they can replied sikes
it was bartlemy time when i was shopped and there warnt a penny trumpet in the fair as i couldnt hear the squeaking on
arter i was locked up for the night the row and din outside made the thundering old jail so silent that i could almost have beat my brains out against the iron plates of the door poor fellow said nancy who still had her face turned towards the quarter in which the bell had sounded
oh bill such fine young chaps as them yes thats all you women think of answered sikes
fine young chaps
well theyre as good as dead so it dont much matter with this consolation mr sikes appeared to repress a rising tendency to jealousy and clasping olivers wrist more firmly told him to step out again
wait a minute said the girl i wouldnt hurry by if it was you that was coming out to be hung the next time eight oclock struck bill
id walk round and round the place till i dropped if the snow was on the ground and i hadnt a shawl to cover me and what good would that do inquired the unsentimental mr sikes
unless you could pitch over a file and twenty yards of good stout rope you might as well be walking fifty mile off or not walking at all for all the good it would do me
come on and dont stand preaching there the girl burst into a laugh drew her shawl more closely round her and they walked away
but oliver felt her hand tremble and looking up in her face as they passed a gaslamp saw that it had turned a deadly white
they walked on by littlefrequented and dirty ways for a full halfhour meeting very few people and those appearing from their looks to hold much the same position in society as mr sikes himself
at length they turned into a very filthy narrow street nearly full of oldclothes shops the dog running forward as if conscious that there was no further occasion for his keeping on guard stopped before the door of a shop that was closed and apparently untenanted the house was in a ruinous condition and on the door was nailed a board intimating that it was to let which looked as if it had hung there for many years
all right cried sikes glancing cautiously about
nancy stooped below the shutters and oliver heard the sound of a bell
they crossed to the opposite side of the street and stood for a few moments under a lamp
a noise as if a sash window were gently raised was heard and soon afterwards the door softly opened
mr sikes then seized the terrified boy by the collar with very little ceremony and all three were quickly inside the house
the passage was perfectly dark
they waited while the person who had let them in chained and barred the door
anybody here inquired sikes
no replied a voice which oliver thought he had heard before
is the old un here asked the robber
yes replied the voice and precious down in the mouth he has been
wont he be glad to see you
oh no the style of this reply as well as the voice which delivered it seemed familiar to olivers ears but it was impossible to distinguish even the form of the speaker in the darkness
lets have a glim said sikes or we shall go breaking our necks or treading on the dog
look after your legs if you do stand still a moment and ill get you one replied the voice
the receding footsteps of the speaker were heard and in another minute the form of mr john dawkins otherwise the artful dodger appeared
he bore in his right hand a tallow candle stuck in the end of a cleft stick
the young gentleman did not stop to bestow any other mark of recognition upon oliver than a humourous grin but turning away beckoned the visitors to follow him down a flight of stairs
they crossed an empty kitchen and opening the door of a low earthysmelling room which seemed to have been built in a small backyard were received with a shout of laughter
oh my wig my wig cried master charles bates from whose lungs the laughter had proceeded here he is
oh cry here he is
oh fagin look at him
fagin do look at him
i cant bear it it is such a jolly game i cant bear it
hold me somebody while i laugh it out with this irrepressible ebullition of mirth master bates laid himself flat on the floor and kicked convulsively for five minutes in an ectasy of facetious joy
then jumping to his feet he snatched the cleft stick from the dodger and advancing to oliver viewed him round and round while the jew taking off his nightcap made a great number of low bows to the bewildered boy
the artful meantime who was of a rather saturnine disposition and seldom gave way to merriment when it interfered with business rifled olivers pockets with steady assiduity
look at his togs fagin said charley putting the light so close to his new jacket as nearly to set him on fire
look at his togs
superfine cloth and the heavy swell cut
oh my eye what a game
and his books too
nothing but a gentleman fagin delighted to see you looking so well my dear said the jew bowing with mock humility
the artful shall give you another suit my dear for fear you should spoil that sunday one
why didnt you write my dear and say you were coming
wed have got something warm for supper at his master bates roared again so loud that fagin himself relaxed and even the dodger smiled but as the artful drew forth the fivepound note at that instant it is doubtful whether the sally of the discovery awakened his merriment
hallo whats that inquired sikes stepping forward as the jew seized the note
thats mine fagin no no my dear said the jew
mine bill mine
you shall have the books if that aint mine said bill sikes putting on his hat with a determined air mine and nancys that is ill take the boy back again the jew started
oliver started too though from a very different cause for he hoped that the dispute might really end in his being taken back
come
hand over will you said sikes
this is hardly fair bill hardly fair is it nancy inquired the jew
fair or not fair retorted sikes hand over i tell you
do you think nancy and me has got nothing else to do with our precious time but to spend it in scouting arter and kidnapping every young boy as gets grabbed through you
give it here you avaricious old skeleton give it here with this gentle remonstrance mr sikes plucked the note from between the jews finger and thumb and looking the old man coolly in the face folded it up small and tied it in his neckerchief
thats for our share of the trouble said sikes and not half enough neither
you may keep the books if youre fond of reading
if you aint sell em theyre very pretty said charley bates who with sundry grimaces had been affecting to read one of the volumes in question beautiful writing isnt is oliver at sight of the dismayed look with which oliver regarded his tormentors master bates who was blessed with a lively sense of the ludicrous fell into another ectasy more boisterous than the first
they belong to the old gentleman said oliver wringing his hands to the good kind old gentleman who took me into his house and had me nursed when i was near dying of the fever
oh pray send them back send him back the books and money
keep me here all my life long but pray pray send them back
hell think i stole them the old lady all of them who were so kind to me will think i stole them
oh do have mercy upon me and send them back with these words which were uttered with all the energy of passionate grief oliver fell upon his knees at the jews feet and beat his hands together in perfect desperation
the boys right remarked fagin looking covertly round and knitting his shaggy eyebrows into a hard knot
youre right oliver youre right they will think you have stolen em
ha
ha chuckled the jew rubbing his hands it couldnt have happened better if we had chosen our time of course it couldnt replied sikes i knowd that directly i see him coming through clerkenwell with the books under his arm
its all right enough
theyre softhearted psalmsingers or they wouldnt have taken him in at all and theyll ask no questions after him fear they should be obliged to prosecute and so get him lagged
hes safe enough oliver had looked from one to the other while these words were being spoken as if he were bewildered and could scarecely understand what passed but when bill sikes concluded he jumped suddenly to his feet and tore wildly from the room uttering shrieks for help which made the bare old house echo to the roof
keep back the dog bill cried nancy springing before the door and closing it as the jew and his two pupils darted out in pursuit
keep back the dog hell tear the boy to pieces serve him right cried sikes struggling to disengage himself from the girls grasp
stand off from me or ill split your head against the wall i dont care for that bill i dont care for that screamed the girl struggling violently with the man the child shant be torn down by the dog unless you kill me first shant he said sikes setting his teeth
ill soon do that if you dont keep off the housebreaker flung the girl from him to the further end of the room just as the jew and the two boys returned dragging oliver among them
whats the matter here said fagin looking round
the girls gone mad i think replied sikes savagely
no she hasnt said nancy pale and breathless from the scuffle no she hasnt fagin dont think it then keep quiet will you said the jew with a threatening look
no i wont do that neither replied nancy speaking very loud
come
what do you think of that mr fagin was sufficiently well acquainted with the manners and customs of that particular species of humanity to which nancy belonged to feel tolerably certain that it would be rather unsafe to prolong any conversation with her at present
with the view of diverting the attention of the company he turned to oliver
so you wanted to get away my dear did you said the jew taking up a jagged and knotted club which lay in a corner of the fireplace eh oliver made no reply
but he watched the jews motions and breathed quickly
wanted to get assistance called for the police did you sneered the jew catching the boy by the arm
well cure you of that my young master the jew inflicted a smart blow on olivers shoulders with the club and was raising it for a second when the girl rushing forward wrested it from his hand
she flung it into the fire with a force that brought some of the glowing coals whirling out into the room
i wont stand by and see it done fagin cried the girl
youve got the boy and what more would you havelet him belet him beor i shall put that mark on some of you that will bring me to the gallows before my time the girl stamped her foot violently on the floor as she vented this threat and with her lips compressed and her hands clenched looked alternately at the jew and the other robber her face quite colourless from the passion of rage into which she had gradually worked herself
why nancy said the jew in a soothing tone after a pause during which he and mr sikes had stared at one another in a disconcerted manner youyoure more clever than ever tonight
ha
ha
my dear you are acting beautifully am i said the girl
take care i dont overdo it
you will be the worse for it fagin if i do and so i tell you in good time to keep clear of me there is something about a roused woman especially if she add to all her other strong passions the fierce impulses of recklessness and despair which few men like to provoke
the jew saw that it would be hopeless to affect any further mistake regarding the reality of miss nancys rage and shrinking involuntarily back a few paces cast a glance half imploring and half cowardly at sikes as if to hint that he was the fittest person to pursue the dialogue
mr sikes thus mutely appealed to and possibly feeling his personal pride and influence interested in the immediate reduction of miss nancy to reason gave utterance to about a couple of score of curses and threats the rapid production of which reflected great credit on the fertility of his invention
as they produced no visible effect on the object against whom they were discharged however he resorted to more tangible arguments
what do you mean by this said sikes backing the inquiry with a very common imprecation concerning the most beautiful of human features which if it were heard above only once out of every fifty thousand times that it is uttered below would render blindness as common a disorder as measles what do you mean by it
burn my body
do you know who you are and what you are oh yes i know all about it replied the girl laughing hysterically and shaking her head from side to side with a poor assumption of indifference
well then keep quiet rejoined sikes with a growl like that he was accustomed to use when addressing his dog or ill quiet you for a good long time to come the girl laughed again even less composedly than before and darting a hasty look at sikes turned her face aside and bit her lip till the blood came
youre a nice one added sikes as he surveyed her with a contemptuous air to take up the humane and genteel side
a pretty subject for the child as you call him to make a friend of god almighty help me i am cried the girl passionately and i wish i had been struck dead in the street or had changed places with them we passed so near tonight before i had lent a hand in bringing him here
hes a thief a liar a devil all thats bad from this night forth
isnt that enough for the old wretch without blows come come sikes said the jew appealing to him in a remonstratory tone and motioning towards the boys who were eagerly attentive to all that passed we must have civil words civil words bill civil words cried the girl whose passion was frightful to see
civil words you villain
yes you deserve em from me
i thieved for you when i was a child not half as old as this pointing to oliver
i have been in the same trade and in the same service for twelve years since
dont you know it
speak out
dont you know it well well replied the jew with an attempt at pacification and if you have its your living aye it is returned the girl not speaking but pouring out the words in one continuous and vehement scream
it is my living and the cold wet dirty streets are my home and youre the wretch that drove me to them long ago and thatll keep me there day and night day and night till i die i shall do you a mischief interposed the jew goaded by these reproaches a mischief worse than that if you say much more the girl said nothing more but tearing her hair and dress in a transport of passion made such a rush at the jew as would probably have left signal marks of her revenge upon him had not her wrists been seized by sikes at the right moment upon which she made a few ineffectual struggles and fainted
shes all right now said sikes laying her down in a corner
shes uncommon strong in the arms when shes up in this way the jew wiped his forehead and smiled as if it were a relief to have the disturbance over but neither he nor sikes nor the dog nor the boys seemed to consider it in any other light than a common occurance incidental to business
its the worst of having to do with women said the jew replacing his club but theyre clever and we cant get on in our line without em
charley show oliver to bed i suppose hed better not wear his best clothes tomorrow fagin had he inquired charley bates
certainly not replied the jew reciprocating the grin with which charley put the question
master bates apparently much delighted with his commission took the cleft stick and led oliver into an adjacent kitchen where there were two or three of the beds on which he had slept before and here with many uncontrollable bursts of laughter he produced the identical old suit of clothes which oliver had so much congratulated himself upon leaving off at mr brownlows and the accidental display of which to fagin by the jew who purchased them had been the very first clue received of his whereabout
put off the smart ones said charley and ill give em to fagin to take care of
what fun it is poor oliver unwillingly complied
master bates rolling up the new clothes under his arm departed from the room leaving oliver in the dark and locking the door behind him
the noise of charleys laughter and the voice of miss betsy who opportunely arrived to throw water over her friend and perform other feminine offices for the promotion of her recovery might have kept many people awake under more happy circumstances than those in which oliver was placed
but he was sick and weary and he soon fell sound asleep
olivers destiny continuing unpropitious brings a great man to london to injure his reputation it is the custom on the stage in all good murderous melodramas to present the tragic and the comic scenes in as regular alternation as the layers of red and white in a side of streaky bacon
the hero sinks upon his straw bed weighed down by fetters and misfortunes in the next scene his faithful but unconscious squire regales the audience with a comic song
we behold with throbbing bosoms the heroine in the grasp of a proud and ruthless baron her virtue and her life alike in danger drawing forth her dagger to preserve the one at the cost of the other and just as our expectations are wrought up to the highest pitch a whistle is heard and we are straightway transported to the great hall of the castle where a greyheaded seneschal sings a funny chorus with a funnier body of vassals who are free of all sorts of places from church vaults to palaces and roam about in company carolling perpetually
such changes appear absurd but they are not so unnatural as they would seem at first sight
the transitions in real life from wellspread boards to deathbeds and from mourningweeds to holiday garments are not a whit less startling only there we are busy actors instead of passive lookerson which makes a vast difference
the actors in the mimic life of the theatre are blind to violent transitions and abrupt impulses of passion or feeling which presented before the eyes of mere spectators are at once condemned as outrageous and preposterous
as sudden shiftings of the scene and rapid changes of time and place are not only sanctioned in books by long usage but are by many considered as the great art of authorship an authors skill in his craft being by such critics chiefly estimated with relation to the dilemmas in which he leaves his characters at the end of every chapter this brief introduction to the present one may perhaps be deemed unnecessary
if so let it be considered a delicate intimation on the part of the historian that he is going back to the town in which oliver twist was born the reader taking it for granted that there are good and substantial reasons for making the journey or he would not be invited to proceed upon such an expedition
mr bumble emerged at early morning from the workhousegate and walked with portly carriage and commanding steps up the high street
he was in the full bloom and pride of beadlehood his cocked hat and coat were dazzling in the morning sun he clutched his cane with the vigorous tenacity of health and power
mr bumble always carried his head high but this morning it was higher than usual
there was an abstraction in his eye an elevation in his air which might have warned an observant stranger that thoughts were passing in the beadles mind too great for utterance
mr bumble stopped not to converse with the small shopkeepers and others who spoke to him deferentially as he passed along
he merely returned their salutations with a wave of his hand and relaxed not in his dignified pace until he reached the farm where mrs mann tended the infant paupers with parochial care
drat that beadle said mrs mann hearing the wellknown shaking at the gardengate
if it isnt him at this time in the morning
lauk mr bumble only think of its being you
well dear me it is a pleasure this is
come into the parlour sir please the first sentence was addressed to susan and the exclamations of delight were uttered to mr bumble as the good lady unlocked the gardengate and showed him with great attention and respect into the house
mrs
mann said mr bumble not sitting upon or dropping himself into a seat as any common jackanapes would but letting himself gradually and slowly down into a chair mrs
mann maam good morning well and good morning to you sir replied mrs mann with many smiles and hoping you find yourself well sir soso mrs mann replied the beadle
a porochial life is not a bed of roses mrs mann ah that it isnt indeed mr bumble rejoined the lady
and all the infant paupers might have chorussed the rejoinder with great propriety if they had heard it
a porochial life maam continued mr bumble striking the table with his cane is a life of worrit and vexation and hardihood but all public characters as i may say must suffer prosecution mrs mann not very well knowing what the beadle meant raised her hands with a look of sympathy and sighed
ah
you may well sigh mrs mann said the beadle
finding she had done right mrs mann sighed again evidently to the satisfaction of the public character who repressing a complacent smile by looking sternly at his cocked hat said mrs
mann i am going to london lauk mr bumble cried mrs mann starting back
to london maam resumed the inflexible beadle by coach
i and two paupers mrs mann
a legal action is a coming on about a settlement and the board has appointed meme mrs mannto dispose to the matter before the quartersessions at clerkinwell
and i very much question added mr bumble drawing himself up whether the clerkinwell sessions will not find themselves in the wrong box before they have done with me oh
you mustnt be too hard upon them sir said mrs mann coaxingly
the clerkinwell sessions have brought it upon themselves maam replied mr bumble and if the clerkinwell sessions find that they come off rather worse than they expected the clerkinwell sessions have only themselves to thank there was so much determination and depth of purpose about the menacing manner in which mr bumble delivered himself of these words that mrs mann appeared quite awed by them
at length she said youre going by coach sir
i thought it was always usual to send them paupers in carts thats when theyre ill mrs mann said the beadle
we put the sick paupers into open carts in the rainy weather to prevent their taking cold oh said mrs mann
the opposition coach contracts for these two and takes them cheap said mr bumble
they are both in a very low state and we find it would come two pound cheaper to move em than to bury emthat is if we can throw em upon another parish which i think we shall be able to do if they dont die upon the road to spite us
ha
ha
ha when mr bumble had laughed a little while his eyes again encountered the cocked hat and he became grave
we are forgetting business maam said the beadle here is your porochial stipend for the month mr bumble produced some silver money rolled up in paper from his pocketbook and requested a receipt which mrs mann wrote
its very much blotted sir said the farmer of infants but its formal enough i dare say
thank you mr bumble sir i am very much obliged to you im sure mr bumble nodded blandly in acknowledgment of mrs manns curtsey and inquired how the children were
bless their dear little hearts said mrs mann with emotion theyre as well as can be the dears
of course except the two that died last week
and little dick isnt that boy no better inquired mr bumble
mrs mann shook her head
hes a illconditioned wicious baddisposed porochial child that said mr bumble angrily
where is he ill bring him to you in one minute sir replied mrs mann
here you dick after some calling dick was discovered
having had his face put under the pump and dried upon mrs manns gown he was led into the awful presence of mr bumble the beadle
the child was pale and thin his cheeks were sunken and his eyes large and bright
the scanty parish dress the livery of his misery hung loosely on his feeble body and his young limbs had wasted away like those of an old man
such was the little being who stood trembling beneath mr bumbles glance not daring to lift his eyes from the floor and dreading even to hear the beadles voice
cant you look at the gentleman you obstinate boy said mrs mann
the child meekly raised his eyes and encountered those of mr bumble
whats the matter with you porochial dick inquired mr bumble with welltimed jocularity
nothing sir replied the child faintly
i should think not said mrs mann who had of course laughed very much at mr bumbles humour
you want for nothing im sure i should like faltered the child
heyday interposed mrs mann i suppose youre going to say that you do want for something now
why you little wretch stop mrs mann stop said the beadle raising his hand with a show of authority
like what sir eh i should like faltered the child if somebody that can write would put a few words down for me on a piece of paper and fold it up and seal it and keep it for me after i am laid in the ground why what does the boy mean exclaimed mr bumble on whom the earnest manner and wan aspect of the child had made some impression accustomed as he was to such things
what do you mean sir i should like said the child to leave my dear love to poor oliver twist and to let him know how often i have sat by myself and cried to think of his wandering about in the dark nights with nobody to help him
and i should like to tell him said the child pressing his small hands together and speaking with great fervour that i was glad to die when i was very young for perhaps if i had lived to be a man and had grown old my little sister who is in heaven might forget me or be unlike me and it would be so much happier if we were both children there together mr bumble surveyed the little speaker from head to foot with indescribable astonishment and turning to his companion said theyre all in one story mrs mann
that outdacious oliver had demogalized them all i couldnt have believed it sir said mrs mann holding up her hands and looking malignantly at dick
i never see such a hardened little wretch take him away maam said mr bumble imperiously
this must be stated to the board mrs mann i hope the gentleman will understand that it isnt my fault sir said mrs mann whimpering pathetically
they shall understand that maam they shall be acquainted with the true state of the case said mr bumble
there take him away i cant bear the sight on him dick was immediately taken away and locked up in the coalcellar
mr bumble shortly afterwards took himself off to prepare for his journey
at six oclock next morning mr bumble having exchanged his cocked hat for a round one and encased his person in a blue greatcoat with a cape to it took his place on the outside of the coach accompanied by the criminals whose settlement was disputed with whom in due course of time he arrived in london
he experienced no other crosses on the way than those which originated in the perverse behaviour of the two paupers who persisted in shivering and complaining of the cold in a manner which mr bumble declared caused his teeth to chatter in his head and made him feel quite uncomfortable although he had a greatcoat on
having disposed of these evilminded persons for the night mr bumble sat himself down in the house at which the coach stopped and took a temperate dinner of steaks oyster sauce and porter
putting a glass of hot ginandwater on the chimneypiece he drew his chair to the fire and with sundry moral reflections on the tooprevalent sin of discontent and complaining composed himself to read the paper
the very first paragraph upon which mr bumbles eye rested was the following advertisement
five guineas reward whereas a young boy named oliver twist absconded or was enticed on thursday evening last from his home at pentonville and has not since been heard of
the above reward will be paid to any person who will give such information as will lead to the discovery of the said oliver twist or tend to throw any light upon his previous history in which the advertiser is for many reasons warmly interested and then followed a full description of olivers dress person appearance and disappearance with the name and address of mr brownlow at full length
mr bumble opened his eyes read the advertisement slowly and carefully three several times and in something more than five minutes was on his way to pentonville having actually in his excitement left the glass of hot ginandwater untasted
is mr brownlow at home inquired mr bumble of the girl who opened the door
to this inquiry the girl returned the not uncommon but rather evasive reply of i dont know where do you come from mr bumble no sooner uttered olivers name in explanation of his errand than mrs bedwin who had been listening at the parlour door hastened into the passage in a breathless state
come in come in said the old lady i knew we should hear of him
poor dear
i knew we should
i was certain of it
bless his heart
i said so all along having heard this the worthy old lady hurried back into the parlour again and seating herself on a sofa burst into tears
the girl who was not quite so susceptible had run upstairs meanwhile and now returned with a request that mr bumble would follow her immediately which he did
he was shown into the little back study where sat mr brownlow and his friend mr grimwig with decanters and glasses before them
the latter gentleman at once burst into the exclamation a beadle
a parish beadle or ill eat my head pray dont interrupt just now said mr brownlow
take a seat will you mr bumble sat himself down quite confounded by the oddity of mr grimwigs manner
mr brownlow moved the lamp so as to obtain an uninterrupted view of the beadles countenance and said with a little impatience now sir you come in consequence of having seen the advertisement yes sir said mr bumble
and you are a beadle are you not inquired mr grimwig
i am a porochial beadle gentlemen rejoined mr bumble proudly
of course observed mr grimwig aside to his friend i knew he was
a beadle all over mr brownlow gently shook his head to impose silence on his friend and resumed do you know where this poor boy is now no more than nobody replied mr bumble
well what do you know of him inquired the old gentleman
speak out my friend if you have anything to say
what do you know of him you dont happen to know any good of him do you said mr grimwig caustically after an attentive perusal of mr bumbles features
mr bumble catching at the inquiry very quickly shook his head with portentous solemnity
you see said mr grimwig looking triumphantly at mr brownlow
mr brownlow looked apprehensively at mr bumbles pursedup countenance and requested him to communicate what he knew regarding oliver in as few words as possible
mr bumble put down his hat unbuttoned his coat folded his arms inclined his head in a retrospective manner and after a few moments reflection commenced his story
it would be tedious if given in the beadles words occupying as it did some twenty minutes in the telling but the sum and substance of it was that oliver was a foundling born of low and vicious parents
that he had from his birth displayed no better qualities than treachery ingratitude and malice
that he had terminated his brief career in the place of his birth by making a sanguinary and cowardly attack on an unoffending lad and running away in the nighttime from his masters house
in proof of his really being the person he represented himself mr bumble laid upon the table the papers he had brought to town
folding his arms again he then awaited mr brownlows observations
i fear it is all too true said the old gentleman sorrowfully after looking over the papers
this is not much for your intelligence but i would gladly have given you treble the money if it had been favourable to the boy it is not improbable that if mr bumble had been possessed of this information at an earlier period of the interview he might have imparted a very different colouring to his little history
it was too late to do it now however so he shook his head gravely and pocketing the five guineas withdrew
mr brownlow paced the room to and fro for some minutes evidently so much disturbed by the beadles tale that even mr grimwig forbore to vex him further
at length he stopped and rang the bell violently
mrs
bedwin said mr brownlow when the housekeeper appeared that boy oliver is an imposter it cant be sir
it cannot be said the old lady energetically
i tell you he is retorted the old gentleman
what do you mean by cant be
we have just heard a full account of him from his birth and he has been a thoroughpaced little villain all his life i never will believe it sir replied the old lady firmly
never you old women never believe anything but quackdoctors and lying storybooks growled mr grimwig
i knew it all along
why didnt you take my advise in the beginning you would if he hadnt had a fever i suppose eh
he was interesting wasnt he
interesting
bah and mr grimwig poked the fire with a flourish
he was a dear grateful gentle child sir retorted mrs bedwin indignantly
i know what children are sir and have done these forty years and people who cant say the same shouldnt say anything about them
thats my opinion this was a hard hit at mr grimwig who was a bachelor
as it extorted nothing from that gentleman but a smile the old lady tossed her head and smoothed down her apron preparatory to another speech when she was stopped by mr brownlow
silence said the old gentleman feigning an anger he was far from feeling
never let me hear the boys name again
i rang to tell you that
never
never on any pretence mind
you may leave the room mrs bedwin
remember
i am in earnest there were sad hearts at mr brownlows that night
olivers heart sank within him when he thought of his good friends it was well for him that he could not know what they had heard or it might have broken outright
how oliver passed his time in the improving society of his reputable friends about noon next day when the dodger and master bates had gone out to pursue their customary avocations mr fagin took the opportunity of reading oliver a long lecture on the crying sin of ingratitude of which he clearly demonstrated he had been guilty to no ordinary extent in wilfully absenting himself from the society of his anxious friends and still more in endeavouring to escape from them after so much trouble and expense had been incurred in his recovery
mr fagin laid great stress on the fact of his having taken oliver in and cherished him when without his timely aid he might have perished with hunger and he related the dismal and affecting history of a young lad whom in his philanthropy he had succoured under parallel circumstances but who proving unworthy of his confidence and evincing a desire to communicate with the police had unfortunately come to be hanged at the old bailey one morning
mr fagin did not seek to conceal his share in the catastrophe but lamented with tears in his eyes that the wrongheaded and treacherous behaviour of the young person in question had rendered it necessary that he should become the victim of certain evidence for the crown which if it were not precisely true was indispensably necessary for the safety of him mr fagin and a few select friends
mr fagin concluded by drawing a rather disagreeable picture of the discomforts of hanging and with great friendliness and politeness of manner expressed his anxious hopes that he might never be obliged to submit oliver twist to that unpleasant operation
little olivers blood ran cold as he listened to the jews words and imperfectly comprehended the dark threats conveyed in them
that it was possible even for justice itself to confound the innocent with the guilty when they were in accidental companionship he knew already and that deeplylaid plans for the destruction of inconveniently knowing or overcommunicative persons had been really devised and carried out by the jew on more occasions than one he thought by no means unlikely when he recollected the general nature of the altercations between that gentleman and mr sikes which seemed to bear reference to some foregone conspiracy of the kind
as he glanced timidly up and met the jews searching look he felt that his pale face and trembling limbs were neither unnoticed nor unrelished by that wary old gentleman
the jew smiling hideously patted oliver on the head and said that if he kept himself quiet and applied himself to business he saw they would be very good friends yet
then taking his hat and covering himself with an old patched greatcoat he went out and locked the roomdoor behind him
and so oliver remained all that day and for the greater part of many subsequent days seeing nobody between early morning and midnight and left during the long hours to commune with his own thoughts
which never failing to revert to his kind friends and the opinion they must long ago have formed of him were sad indeed
after the lapse of a week or so the jew left the roomdoor unlocked and he was at liberty to wander about the house
it was a very dirty place
the rooms upstairs had great high wooden chimneypieces and large doors with panelled walls and cornices to the ceiling which although they were black with neglect and dust were ornamented in various ways
from all of these tokens oliver concluded that a long time ago before the old jew was born it had belonged to better people and had perhaps been quite gay and handsome dismal and dreary as it looked now
spiders had built their webs in the angles of the walls and ceilings and sometimes when oliver walked softly into a room the mice would scamper across the floor and run back terrified to their holes
with these exceptions there was neither sight nor sound of any living thing and often when it grew dark and he was tired of wandering from room to room he would crouch in the corner of the passage by the streetdoor to be as near living people as he could and would remain there listening and counting the hours until the jew or the boys returned
in all the rooms the mouldering shutters were fast closed the bars which held them were screwed tight into the wood the only light which was admitted stealing its way through round holes at the top which made the rooms more gloomy and filled them with strange shadows
there was a backgarret window with rusty bars outside which had no shutter and out of this oliver often gazed with a melancholy face for hours together but nothing was to be descried from it but a confused and crowded mass of housetops blackened chimneys and gableends
sometimes indeed a grizzly head might be seen peering over the parapetwall of a distant house but it was quickly withdrawn again and as the window of olivers observatory was nailed down and dimmed with the rain and smoke of years it was as much as he could do to make out the forms of the different objects beyond without making any attempt to be seen or heardwhich he had as much chance of being as if he had lived inside the ball of st pauls cathedral
one afternoon the dodger and master bates being engaged out that evening the firstnamed young gentleman took it into his head to evince some anxiety regarding the decoration of his person to do him justice this was by no means an habitual weakness with him and with this end and aim he condescendingly commanded oliver to assist him in his toilet straightway
oliver was but too glad to make himself useful too happy to have some faces however bad to look upon too desirous to conciliate those about him when he could honestly do so to throw any objection in the way of this proposal
so he at once expressed his readiness and kneeling on the floor while the dodger sat upon the table so that he could take his foot in his laps he applied himself to a process which mr dawkins designated as japanning his trottercases the phrase rendered into plain english signifieth cleaning his boots
whether it was the sense of freedom and independence which a rational animal may be supposed to feel when he sits on a table in an easy attitude smoking a pipe swinging one leg carelessly to and fro and having his boots cleaned all the time without even the past trouble of having taken them off or the prospective misery of putting them on to disturb his reflections or whether it was the goodness of the tobacco that soothed the feelings of the dodger or the mildness of the beer that mollified his thoughts he was evidently tinctured for the nonce with a spice of romance and enthusiasm foreign to his general nature
he looked down on oliver with a thoughtful countenance for a brief space and then raising his head and heaving a gentle sign said half in abstraction and half to master bates what a pity it is he isnt a prig ah said master charles bates he dont know whats good for him the dodger sighed again and resumed his pipe as did charley bates
they both smoked for some seconds in silence
i suppose you dont even know what a prig is said the dodger mournfully
i think i know that replied oliver looking up
its a the youre one are you not inquired oliver checking himself
i am replied the dodger
id scorn to be anything else mr dawkins gave his hat a ferocious cock after delivering this sentiment and looked at master bates as if to denote that he would feel obliged by his saying anything to the contrary
i am repeated the dodger
sos charley
sos fagin
sos sikes
sos nancy
sos bet
so we all are down to the dog
and hes the downiest one of the lot and the least given to peaching added charley bates
he wouldnt so much as bark in a witnessbox for fear of committing himself no not if you tied him up in one and left him there without wittles for a fortnight said the dodger
not a bit of it observed charley
hes a rum dog
dont he look fierce at any strange cove that laughs or sings when hes in company pursued the dodger
wont he growl at all when he hears a fiddle playing
and dont he hate other dogs as aint of his breed
oh no hes an outandout christian said charley
this was merely intended as a tribute to the animals abilities but it was an appropriate remark in another sense if master bates had only known it for there are a good many ladies and gentlemen claiming to be outandout christians between whom and mr sikes dog there exist strong and singular points of resemblance
well well said the dodger recurring to the point from which they had strayed with that mindfulness of his profession which influenced all his proceedings
this hasnt go anything to do with young green here no more it has said charley
why dont you put yourself under fagin oliver and make your fortun out of hand added the dodger with a grin
and so be able to retire on your property and do the genteel as i mean to in the very next leapyear but four that ever comes and the fortysecond tuesday in trinityweek said charley bates
i dont like it rejoined oliver timidly i wish they would let me go
iiwould rather go and fagin would rather not rejoined charley
oliver knew this too well but thinking it might be dangerous to express his feelings more openly he only sighed and went on with his bootcleaning
go exclaimed the dodger
why wheres your spirit
dont you take any pride out of yourself
would you go and be dependent on your friends oh blow that said master bates drawing two or three silk handkerchiefs from his pocket and tossing them into a cupboard thats too mean that is i couldnt do it said the dodger with an air of haughty disgust
you can leave your friends though said oliver with a half smile and let them be punished for what you did that rejoined the dodger with a wave of his pipe that was all out of consideration for fagin cause the traps know that we work together and he might have got into trouble if we hadnt made our lucky that was the move wasnt it charley master bates nodded assent and would have spoken but the recollection of olivers flight came so suddenly upon him that the smoke he was inhaling got entangled with a laugh and went up into his head and down into his throat and brought on a fit of coughing and stamping about five minutes long
look here said the dodger drawing forth a handful of shillings and halfpence
heres a jolly life
whats the odds where it comes from
here catch hold theres plenty more where they were took from
you wont wont you
oh you precious flat its naughty aint it oliver inquired charley bates
hell come to be scragged wont he i dont know what that means replied oliver
something in this way old feller said charly
as he said it master bates caught up an end of his neckerchief and holding it erect in the air dropped his head on his shoulder and jerked a curious sound through his teeth thereby indicating by a lively pantomimic representation that scragging and hanging were one and the same thing
thats what it means said charley
look how he stares jack
i never did see such prime company as that ere boy hell be the death of me i know he will master charley bates having laughed heartily again resumed his pipe with tears in his eyes
youve been brought up bad said the dodger surveying his boots with much satisfaction when oliver had polished them
fagin will make something of you though or youll be the first he ever had that turned out unprofitable
youd better begin at once for youll come to the trade long before you think of it and youre only losing time oliver master bates backed this advice with sundry moral admonitions of his own which being exhausted he and his friend mr dawkins launched into a glowing description of the numerous pleasures incidental to the life they led interspersed with a variety of hints to oliver that the best thing he could do would be to secure fagins favour without more delay by the means which they themselves had employed to gain it
and always put this in your pipe nolly said the dodger as the jew was heard unlocking the door above if you dont take fogels and tickers whats the good of talking in that way interposed master bates he dont know what you mean if you dont take pockethandkechers and watches said the dodger reducing his conversation to the level of olivers capacity some other cove will so that the coves that lose em will be all the worse and youll be all the worse too and nobody half a haporth the better except the chaps wot gets themand youve just as good a right to them as they have to be sure to be sure said the jew who had entered unseen by oliver
it all lies in a nutshell my dear in a nutshell take the dodgers word for it
ha
ha
ha
he understands the catechism of his trade the old man rubbed his hands gleefully together as he corroborated the dodgers reasoning in these terms and chuckled with delight at his pupils proficiency
the conversation proceeded no farther at this time for the jew had returned home accompanied by miss betsy and a gentleman whom oliver had never seen before but who was accosted by the dodger as tom chitling and who having lingered on the stairs to exchange a few gallantries with the lady now made his appearance
mr chitling was older in years than the dodger having perhaps numbered eighteen winters but there was a degree of deference in his deportment towards that young gentleman which seemed to indicate that he felt himself conscious of a slight inferiority in point of genius and professional aquirements
he had small twinkling eyes and a pockmarked face wore a fur cap a dark corduroy jacket greasy fustian trousers and an apron
his wardrobe was in truth rather out of repair but he excused himself to the company by stating that his time was only out an hour before and that in consequence of having worn the regimentals for six weeks past he had not been able to bestow any attention on his private clothes
mr chitling added with strong marks of irritation that the new way of fumigating clothes up yonder was infernal unconstitutional for it burnt holes in them and there was no remedy against the county
the same remark he considered to apply to the regulation mode of cutting the hair which he held to be decidedly unlawful
mr chitling wound up his observations by stating that he had not touched a drop of anything for fortytwo moral long hardworking days and that he wished he might be busted if he warnt as dry as a limebasket where do you think the gentleman has come from oliver inquired the jew with a grin as the other boys put a bottle of spirits on the table
iidont know sir replied oliver
whos that inquired tom chitling casting a contemptuous look at oliver
a young friend of mine my dear replied the jew
hes in luck then said the young man with a meaning look at fagin
never mind where i came from young un youll find your way there soon enough ill bet a crown at this sally the boys laughed
after some more jokes on the same subject they exchanged a few short whispers with fagin and withdrew
after some words apart between the last comer and fagin they drew their chairs towards the fire and the jew telling oliver to come and sit by him led the conversation to the topics most calculated to interest his hearers
these were the great advantages of the trade the proficiency of the dodger the amiability of charley bates and the liberality of the jew himself
at length these subjects displayed signs of being thoroughly exhausted and mr chitling did the same for the house of correction becomes fatiguing after a week or two
miss betsy accordingly withdrew and left the party to their repose
from this day oliver was seldom left alone but was placed in almost constant communication with the two boys who played the old game with the jew every day whether for their own improvement or olivers mr fagin best knew
at other times the old man would tell them stories of robberies he had committed in his younger days mixed up with so much that was droll and curious that oliver could not help laughing heartily and showing that he was amused in spite of all his better feelings
in short the wily old jew had the boy in his toils
having prepared his mind by solitude and gloom to prefer any society to the companionship of his own sad thoughts in such a dreary place he was now slowly instilling into his soul the poison which he hoped would blacken it and change its hue for ever
in which a notable plan is discussed and determined on it was a chill damp windy night when the jew buttoning his greatcoat tight round his shrivelled body and pulling the collar up over his ears so as completely to obscure the lower part of his face emerged from his den
he paused on the step as the door was locked and chained behind him and having listened while the boys made all secure and until their retreating footsteps were no longer audible slunk down the street as quickly as he could
the house to which oliver had been conveyed was in the neighborhood of whitechapel
the jew stopped for an instant at the corner of the street and glancing suspiciously round crossed the road and struck off in the direction of the spitalfields
the mud lay thick upon the stones and a black mist hung over the streets the rain fell sluggishly down and everything felt cold and clammy to the touch
it seemed just the night when it befitted such a being as the jew to be abroad
as he glided stealthily along creeping beneath the shelter of the walls and doorways the hideous old man seemed like some loathsome reptile engendered in the slime and darkness through which he moved crawling forth by night in search of some rich offal for a meal
he kept on his course through many winding and narrow ways until he reached bethnal green then turning suddenly off to the left he soon became involved in a maze of the mean and dirty streets which abound in that close and denselypopulated quarter
the jew was evidently too familiar with the ground he traversed to be at all bewildered either by the darkness of the night or the intricacies of the way
he hurried through several alleys and streets and at length turned into one lighted only by a single lamp at the farther end
at the door of a house in this street he knocked having exchanged a few muttered words with the person who opened it he walked upstairs
a dog growled as he touched the handle of a roomdoor and a mans voice demanded who was there
only me bill only me my dear said the jew looking in
bring in your body then said sikes
lie down you stupid brute
dont you know the devil when hes got a greatcoat on apparently the dog had been somewhat deceived by mr fagins outer garment for as the jew unbuttoned it and threw it over the back of a chair he retired to the corner from which he had risen wagging his tail as he went to show that he was as well satisfied as it was in his nature to be
well said sikes
well my dear replied the jewah
nancy the latter recognition was uttered with just enough of embarrassment to imply a doubt of its reception for mr fagin and his young friend had not met since she had interfered in behalf of oliver
all doubts upon the subject if he had any were speedily removed by the young ladys behaviour
she took her feet off the fender pushed back her chair and bade fagin draw up his without saying more about it for it was a cold night and no mistake
it is cold nancy dear said the jew as he warmed his skinny hands over the fire
it seems to go right through one added the old man touching his side
it must be a piercer if it finds its way through your heart said mr sikes
give him something to drink nancy
burn my body make haste
its enough to turn a man ill to see his lean old carcase shivering in that way like a ugly ghost just rose from the grave nancy quickly brought a bottle from a cupboard in which there were many which to judge from the diversity of their appearance were filled with several kinds of liquids
sikes pouring out a glass of brandy bade the jew drink it off
quite enough quite thankye bill replied the jew putting down the glass after just setting his lips to it
what
youre afraid of our getting the better of you are you inquired sikes fixing his eyes on the jew
ugh with a hoarse grunt of contempt mr sikes seized the glass and threw the remainder of its contents into the ashes as a preparatory ceremony to filling it again for himself which he did at once
the jew glanced round the room as his companion tossed down the second glassful not in curiousity for he had seen it often before but in a restless and suspicious manner habitual to him
it was a meanly furnished apartment with nothing but the contents of the closet to induce the belief that its occupier was anything but a working man and with no more suspicious articles displayed to view than two or three heavy bludgeons which stood in a corner and a lifepreserver that hung over the chimneypiece
there said sikes smacking his lips
now im ready for business inquired the jew
for business replied sikes so say what youve got to say about the crib at chertsey bill said the jew drawing his chair forward and speaking in a very low voice
yes
wot about it inquired sikes
ah
you know what i mean my dear said the jew
he knows what i mean nancy dont he no he dont sneered mr sikes
or he wont and thats the same thing
speak out and call things by their right names dont sit there winking and blinking and talking to me in hints as if you warnt the very first that thought about the robbery
wot dye mean hush bill hush said the jew who had in vain attempted to stop this burst of indignation somebody will hear us my dear
somebody will hear us let em hear said sikes i dont care but as mr sikes did care on reflection he dropped his voice as he said the words and grew calmer
there there said the jew coaxingly
it was only my caution nothing more
now my dear about that crib at chertsey when is it to be done bill eh
when is it to be done
such plate my dear such plate said the jew rubbing his hands and elevating his eyebrows in a rapture of anticipation
not at all replied sikes coldly
not to be done at all echoed the jew leaning back in his chair
no not at all rejoined sikes
at least it cant be a putup job as we expected then it hasnt been properly gone about said the jew turning pale with anger
dont tell me but i will tell you retorted sikes
who are you thats not to be told
i tell you that toby crackit has been hanging about the place for a fortnight and he cant get one of the servants in line do you mean to tell me bill said the jew softening as the other grew heated that neither of the two men in the house can be got over yes i do mean to tell you so replied sikes
the old lady has had em these twenty years and if you were to give em five hundred pound they wouldnt be in it but do you mean to say my dear remonstrated the jew that the women cant be got over not a bit of it replied sikes
not by flash toby crackit said the jew incredulously
think what women are bill no not even by flash toby crackit replied sikes
he says hes worn sham whiskers and a canary waistcoat the whole blessed time hes been loitering down there and its all of no use he should have tried mustachios and a pair of military trousers my dear said the jew
so he did rejoined sikes and they warnt of no more use than the other plant the jew looked blank at this information
after ruminating for some minutes with his chin sunk on his breast he raised his head and said with a deep sigh that if flash toby crackit reported aright he feared the game was up
and yet said the old man dropping his hands on his knees its a sad thing my dear to lose so much when we had set our hearts upon it so it is said mr sikes
worse luck a long silence ensued during which the jew was plunged in deep thought with his face wrinkled into an expression of villainy perfectly demoniacal
sikes eyed him furtively from time to time
nancy apparently fearful of irritating the housebreaker sat with her eyes fixed upon the fire as if she had been deaf to all that passed
fagin said sikes abruptly breaking the stillness that prevailed is it worth fifty shiners extra if its safely done from the outside yes said the jew as suddenly rousing himself
is it a bargain inquired sikes
yes my dear yes rejoined the jew his eyes glistening and every muscle in his face working with the excitement that the inquiry had awakened
then said sikes thrusting aside the jews hand with some disdain let it come off as soon as you like
toby and me were over the gardenwall the night afore last sounding the panels of the door and shutters
the cribs barred up at night like a jail but theres one part we can crack safe and softly which is that bill asked the jew eagerly
why whispered sikes as you cross the lawn yes said the jew bending his head forward with his eyes almost starting out of it
umph cried sikes stopping short as the girl scarcely moving her head looked suddenly round and pointed for an instant to the jews face
never mind which part it is
you cant do it without me i know but its best to be on the safe side when one deals with you as you like my dear as you like replied the jew
is there no help wanted but yours and tobys none said sikes
cept a centrebit and a boy
the first weve both got the second you must find us a boy exclaimed the jew
oh
then its a panel eh never mind wot it is replied sikes
i want a boy and he musnt be a big un
lord said mr sikes reflectively if id only got that young boy of ned the chimbleysweepers
he kept him small on purpose and let him out by the job
but the father gets lagged and then the juvenile delinquent society comes and takes the boy away from a trade where he was earning money teaches him to read and write and in time makes a prentice of him
and so they go on said mr sikes his wrath rising with the recollection of his wrongs so they go on and if theyd got money enough which its a providence they havent we shouldnt have half a dozen boys left in the whole trade in a year or two no more we should acquiesced the jew who had been considering during this speech and had only caught the last sentence
bill what now inquired sikes
the jew nodded his head towards nancy who was still gazing at the fire and intimated by a sign that he would have her told to leave the room
sikes shrugged his shoulders impatiently as if he thought the precaution unnecessary but complied nevertheless by requesting miss nancy to fetch him a jug of beer
you dont want any beer said nancy folding her arms and retaining her seat very composedly
i tell you i do replied sikes
nonsense rejoined the girl coolly go on fagin
i know what hes going to say bill he neednt mind me the jew still hesitated
sikes looked from one to the other in some surprise
why you dont mind the old girl do you fagin he asked at length
youve known her long enough to trust her or the devils in it
she aint one to blab
are you nancy i should think not replied the young lady drawing her chair up to the table and putting her elbows upon it
no no my dear i know youre not said the jew but and again the old man paused
but wot inquired sikes
i didnt know whether she mightnt praps be out of sorts you know my dear as she was the other night replied the jew
at this confession miss nancy burst into a loud laugh and swallowing a glass of brandy shook her head with an air of defiance and burst into sundry exclamations of keep the game agoing never say die and the like
these seemed to have the effect of reassuring both gentlemen for the jew nodded his head with a satisfied air and resumed his seat as did mr sikes likewise
now fagin said nancy with a laugh
tell bill at once about oliver ha
youre a clever one my dear the sharpest girl i ever saw said the jew patting her on the neck
it was about oliver i was going to speak sure enough
ha
ha
ha what about him demanded sikes
hes the boy for you my dear replied the jew in a hoarse whisper laying his finger on the side of his nose and grinning frightfully
he exclaimed sikes
have him bill said nancy
i would if i was in your place
he maynt be so much up as any of the others but thats not what you want if hes only to open a door for you
depend upon it hes a safe one bill i know he is rejoined fagin
hes been in good training these last few weeks and its time he began to work for his bread
besides the others are all too big well he is just the size i want said mr sikes ruminating
and will do everything you want bill my dear interposed the jew he cant help himself
that is if you frighten him enough frighten him echoed sikes
itll be no sham frightening mind you
if theres anything queer about him when we once get into the work in for a penny in for a pound
you wont see him alive again fagin
think of that before you send him
mark my words said the robber poising a crowbar which he had drawn from under the bedstead
ive thought of it all said the jew with energy
iveive had my eye upon him my dears closeclose
once let him feel that he is one of us once fill his mind with the idea that he has been a thief and hes ours
ours for his life
oho
it couldnt have come about better the old man crossed his arms upon his breast and drawing his head and shoulders into a heap literally hugged himself for joy
ours said sikes
yours you mean perhaps i do my dear said the jew with a shrill chuckle
mine if you like bill and wot said sikes scowling fiercely on his agreeable friend wot makes you take so much pains about one chalkfaced kid when you know there are fifty boys snoozing about common garden every night as you might pick and choose from because theyre of no use to me my dear replied the jew with some confusion not worth the taking
their looks convict em when they get into trouble and i lose em all
with this boy properly managed my dears i could do what i couldnt with twenty of them
besides said the jew recovering his selfpossession he has us now if he could only give us legbail again and he must be in the same boat with us
never mind how he came there its quite enough for my power over him that he was in a robbery thats all i want
now how much better this is than being obliged to put the poor leetle boy out of the waywhich would be dangerous and we should lose by it besides when is it to be done asked nancy stopping some turbulent exclamation on the part of mr sikes expressive of the disgust with which he received fagins affectation of humanity
ah to be sure said the jew when is it to be done bill i planned with toby the night arter tomorrow rejoined sikes in a surly voice if he heerd nothing from me to the contrairy good said the jew theres no moon no rejoined sikes
its all arranged about bringing off the swag is it asked the jew
sikes nodded
and about oh ah its all planned rejoined sikes interrupting him
never mind particulars
youd better bring the boy here tomorrow night
i shall get off the stone an hour arter daybreak
then you hold your tongue and keep the meltingpot ready and thats all youll have to do after some discussion in which all three took an active part it was decided that nancy should repair to the jews next evening when the night had set in and bring oliver away with her fagin craftily observing that if he evinced any disinclination to the task he would be more willing to accompany the girl who had so recently interfered in his behalf than anybody else
it was also solemnly arranged that poor oliver should for the purposes of the contemplated expedition be unreservedly consigned to the care and custody of mr william sikes and further that the said sikes should deal with him as he thought fit and should not be held responsible by the jew for any mischance or evil that might be necessary to visit him it being understood that to render the compact in this respect binding any representations made by mr sikes on his return should be required to be confirmed and corroborated in all important particulars by the testimony of flash toby crackit
these preliminaries adjusted mr sikes proceeded to drink brandy at a furious rate and to flourish the crowbar in an alarming manner yelling forth at the same time most unmusical snatches of song mingled with wild execrations
at length in a fit of professional enthusiasm he insisted upon producing his box of housebreaking tools which he had no sooner stumbled in with and opened for the purpose of explaining the nature and properties of the various implements it contained and the peculiar beauties of their construction than he fell over the box upon the floor and went to sleep where he fell
goodnight nancy said the jew muffling himself up as before
goodnight their eyes met and the jew scrutinised her narrowly
there was no flinching about the girl
she was as true and earnest in the matter as toby crackit himself could be
the jew again bade her goodnight and bestowing a sly kick upon the prostrate form of mr sikes while her back was turned groped downstairs
always the way muttered the jew to himself as he turned homeward
the worst of these women is that a very little thing serves to call up some longforgotten feeling and the best of them is that it never lasts
ha
ha
the man against the child for a bag of gold beguiling the time with these pleasant reflections mr fagin wended his way through mud and mire to his gloomy abode where the dodger was sitting up impatiently awaiting his return
is oliver abed
i want to speak to him was his first remark as they descended the stairs
hours ago replied the dodger throwing open a door
here he is the boy was lying fast asleep on a rude bed upon the floor so pale with anxiety and sadness and the closeness of his prison that he looked like death not death as it shows in shroud and coffin but in the guise it wears when life has just departed when a young and gentle spirit has but an instant fled to heaven and the gross air of the world has not had time to breathe upon the changing dust it hallowed
not now said the jew turning softly away
tomorrow
tomorrow wherein oliver is delivered over to mr william sikes when oliver awoke in the morning he was a good deal surprised to find that a new pair of shoes with strong thick soles had been placed at his bedside and that his old shoes had been removed
at first he was pleased with the discovery hoping that it might be the forerunner of his release but such thoughts were quickly dispelled on his sitting down to breakfast along with the jew who told him in a tone and manner which increased his alarm that he was to be taken to the residence of bill sikes that night
totostop there sir asked oliver anxiously
no no my dear
not to stop there replied the jew
we shouldnt like to lose you
dont be afraid oliver you shall come back to us again
ha
ha
ha
we wont be so cruel as to send you away my dear
oh no no the old man who was stooping over the fire toasting a piece of bread looked round as he bantered oliver thus and chuckled as if to show that he knew he would still be very glad to get away if he could
i suppose said the jew fixing his eyes on oliver you want to know what youre going to bills foreh my dear oliver coloured involuntarily to find that the old thief had been reading his thoughts but boldly said yes he did want to know
why do you think inquired fagin parrying the question
indeed i dont know sir replied oliver
bah said the jew turning away with a disappointed countenance from a close perusal of the boys face
wait till bill tells you then the jew seemed much vexed by olivers not expressing any greater curiosity on the subject but the truth is that although oliver felt very anxious he was too much confused by the earnest cunning of fagins looks and his own speculations to make any further inquiries just then
he had no other opportunity for the jew remained very surly and silent till night when he prepared to go abroad
you may burn a candle said the jew putting one upon the table
and heres a book for you to read till they come to fetch you
goodnight goodnight replied oliver softly
the jew walked to the door looking over his shoulder at the boy as he went
suddenly stopping he called him by his name
oliver looked up the jew pointing to the candle motioned him to light it
he did so and as he placed the candlestick upon the table saw that the jew was gazing fixedly at him with lowering and contracted brows from the dark end of the room
take heed oliver
take heed said the old man shaking his right hand before him in a warning manner
hes a rough man and thinks nothing of blood when his own is up
whatever falls out say nothing and do what he bids you
mind placing a strong emphasis on the last word he suffered his features gradually to resolve themselves into a ghastly grin and nodding his head left the room
oliver leaned his head upon his hand when the old man disappeared and pondered with a trembling heart on the words he had just heard
the more he thought of the jews admonition the more he was at a loss to divine its real purpose and meaning
he could think of no bad object to be attained by sending him to sikes which would not be equally well answered by his remaining with fagin and after meditating for a long time concluded that he had been selected to perform some ordinary menial offices for the housebreaker until another boy better suited for his purpose could be engaged
he was too well accustomed to suffering and had suffered too much where he was to bewail the prospect of change very severely
he remained lost in thought for some minutes and then with a heavy sigh snuffed the candle and taking up the book which the jew had left with him began to read
he turned over the leaves
carelessly at first but lighting on a passage which attracted his attention he soon became intent upon the volume
it was a history of the lives and trials of great criminals and the pages were soiled and thumbed with use
here he read of dreadful crimes that made the blood run cold of secret murders that had been committed by the lonely wayside of bodies hidden from the eye of man in deep pits and wells which would not keep them down deep as they were but had yielded them up at last after many years and so maddened the murderers with the sight that in their horror they had confessed their guilt and yelled for the gibbet to end their agony
here too he read of men who lying in their beds at dead of night had been tempted so they said and led on by their own bad thoughts to such dreadful bloodshed as it made the flesh creep and the limbs quail to think of
the terrible descriptions were so real and vivid that the sallow pages seemed to turn red with gore and the words upon them to be sounded in his ears as if they were whispered in hollow murmurs by the spirits of the dead
in a paroxysm of fear the boy closed the book and thrust it from him
then falling upon his knees he prayed heaven to spare him from such deeds and rather to will that he should die at once than be reserved for crimes so fearful and appalling
by degrees he grew more calm and besought in a low and broken voice that he might be rescued from his present dangers and that if any aid were to be raised up for a poor outcast boy who had never known the love of friends or kindred it might come to him now when desolate and deserted he stood alone in the midst of wickedness and guilt
he had concluded his prayer but still remained with his head buried in his hands when a rustling noise aroused him
whats that he cried starting up and catching sight of a figure standing by the door
whos there me
only me replied a tremulous voice
oliver raised the candle above his head and looked towards the door
it was nancy
put down the light said the girl turning away her head
it hurts my eyes oliver saw that she was very pale and gently inquired if she were ill
the girl threw herself into a chair with her back towards him and wrung her hands but made no reply
god forgive me she cried after a while i never thought of this has anything happened asked oliver
can i help you
i will if i can
i will indeed she rocked herself to and fro caught her throat and uttering a gurgling sound gasped for breath
nancy cried oliver what is it the girl beat her hands upon her knees and her feet upon the ground and suddenly stopping drew her shawl close round her and shivered with cold
oliver stirred the fire
drawing her chair close to it she sat there for a little time without speaking but at length she raised her head and looked round
i dont know what comes over me sometimes said she affecting to busy herself in arranging her dress its this damp dirty room i think
now nolly dear are you ready am i to go with you asked oliver
yes
i have come from bill replied the girl
you are to go with me what for asked oliver recoiling
what for echoed the girl raising her eyes and averting them again the moment they encountered the boys face
oh
for no harm i dont believe it said oliver who had watched her closely
have it your own way rejoined the girl affecting to laugh
for no good then oliver could see that he had some power over the girls better feelings and for an instant thought of appealing to her compassion for his helpless state
but then the thought darted across his mind that it was barely eleven oclock and that many people were still in the streets of whom surely some might be found to give credence to his tale
as the reflection occured to him he stepped forward and said somewhat hastily that he was ready
neither his brief consideration nor its purport was lost on his companion
she eyed him narrowly while he spoke and cast upon him a look of intelligence which sufficiently showed that she guessed what had been passing in his thoughts
hush said the girl stooping over him and pointing to the door as she looked cautiously round
you cant help yourself
i have tried hard for you but all to no purpose
you are hedged round and round
if ever you are to get loose from here this is not the time struck by the energy of her manner oliver looked up in her face with great surprise
she seemed to speak the truth her countenance was white and agitated and she trembled with very earnestness
i have saved you from being illused once and i will again and i do now continued the girl aloud for those who would have fetched you if i had not would have been far more rough than me
i have promised for your being quiet and silent if you are not you will only do harm to yourself and me too and perhaps be my death
see here
i have borne all this for you already as true as god sees me show it she pointed hastily to some livid bruises on her neck and arms and continued with great rapidity remember this
and dont let me suffer more for you just now
if i could help you i would but i have not the power
they dont mean to harm you whatever they make you do is no fault of yours
hush
every word from you is a blow for me
give me your hand
make haste
your hand she caught the hand which oliver instinctively placed in hers and blowing out the light drew him after her up the stairs
the door was opened quickly by some one shrouded in the darkness and was as quickly closed when they had passed out
a hackneycabriolet was in waiting with the same vehemence which she had exhibited in addressing oliver the girl pulled him in with her and drew the curtains close
the driver wanted no directions but lashed his horse into full speed without the delay of an instant
the girl still held oliver fast by the hand and continued to pour into his ear the warnings and assurances she had already imparted
all was so quick and hurried that he had scarcely time to recollect where he was or how he came there when the carriage stopped at the house to which the jews steps had been directed on the previous evening
for one brief moment oliver cast a hurried glance along the empty street and a cry for help hung upon his lips
but the girls voice was in his ear beseeching him in such tones of agony to remember her that he had not the heart to utter it
while he hesitated the opportunity was gone he was already in the house and the door was shut
this way said the girl releasing her hold for the first time
bill hallo replied sikes appearing at the head of the stairs with a candle
oh
thats the time of day
come on this was a very strong expression of approbation an uncommonly hearty welcome from a person of mr sikes temperament
nancy appearing much gratified thereby saluted him cordially
bullseyes gone home with tom observed sikes as he lighted them up
hed have been in the way thats right rejoined nancy
so youve got the kid said sikes when they had all reached the room closing the door as he spoke
yes here he is replied nancy
did he come quiet inquired sikes
like a lamb rejoined nancy
im glad to hear it said sikes looking grimly at oliver for the sake of his young carcase as would otherways have suffered for it
come here young un and let me read you a lectur which is as well got over at once thus addressing his new pupil mr sikes pulled off olivers cap and threw it into a corner and then taking him by the shoulder sat himself down by the table and stood the boy in front of him
now first do you know wot this is inquired sikes taking up a pocketpistol which lay on the table
oliver replied in the affirmative
well then look here continued sikes
this is powder that eres a bullet and this is a little bit of a old hat for waddin oliver murmured his comprehension of the different bodies referred to and mr sikes proceeded to load the pistol with great nicety and deliberation
now its loaded said mr sikes when he had finished
yes i see it is sir replied oliver
well said the robber grasping olivers wrist and putting the barrel so close to his temple that they touched at which moment the boy could not repress a start if you speak a word when youre out odoors with me except when i speak to you that loading will be in your head without notice
so if you do make up your mind to speak without leave say your prayers first having bestowed a scowl upon the object of this warning to increase its effect mr sikes continued
as near as i know there isnt anybody as would be asking very partickler arter you if you was disposed of so i neednt take this devilandall of trouble to explain matters to you if it warnt for your own good
dye hear me the short and the long of what you mean said nancy speaking very emphatically and slightly frowning at oliver as if to bespeak his serious attention to her words is that if youre crossed by him in this job you have on hand youll prevent his ever telling tales afterwards by shooting him through the head and will take your chance of swinging for it as you do for a great many other things in the way of business every month of your life thats it observed mr sikes approvingly women can always put things in fewest wordsexcept when its blowing up and then they lengthens it out
and now that hes thoroughly up to it lets have some supper and get a snooze before starting in pursuance of this request nancy quickly laid the cloth disappearing for a few minutes she presently returned with a pot of porter and a dish of sheeps heads which gave occasion to several pleasant witticisms on the part of mr sikes founded upon the singular coincidence of jemmies being a can name common to them and also to an ingenious implement much used in his profession
indeed the worthy gentleman stimulated perhaps by the immediate prospect of being on active service was in great spirits and good humour in proof whereof it may be here remarked that he humourously drank all the beer at a draught and did not utter on a rough calculation more than fourscore oaths during the whole progress of the meal
supper being endedit may be easily conceived that oliver had no great appetite for itmr
sikes disposed of a couple of glasses of spirits and water and threw himself on the bed ordering nancy with many imprecations in case of failure to call him at five precisely
oliver stretched himself in his clothes by command of the same authority on a mattress upon the floor and the girl mending the fire sat before it in readiness to rouse them at the appointed time
for a long time oliver lay awake thinking it not impossible that nancy might seek that opportunity of whispering some further advice but the girl sat brooding over the fire without moving save now and then to trim the light
weary with watching and anxiety he at length fell asleep
when he awoke the table was covered with teathings and sikes was thrusting various articles into the pockets of his greatcoat which hung over the back of a chair
nancy was busily engaged in preparing breakfast
it was not yet daylight for the candle was still burning and it was quite dark outside
a sharp rain too was beating against the windowpanes and the sky looked black and cloudy
now then growled sikes as oliver started up halfpast five
look sharp or youll get no breakfast for its late as it is oliver was not long in making his toilet having taken some breakfast he replied to a surly inquiry from sikes by saying that he was quite ready
nancy scarcely looking at the boy threw him a handkerchief to tie round his throat sikes gave him a large rough cape to button over his shoulders
thus attired he gave his hand to the robber who merely pausing to show him with a menacing gesture that he had that same pistol in a sidepocket of his greatcoat clasped it firmly in his and exchanging a farewell with nancy led him away
oliver turned for an instant when they reached the door in the hope of meeting a look from the girl
but she had resumed her old seat in front of the fire and sat perfectly motionless before it
the expedition it was a cheerless morning when they got into the street blowing and raining hard and the clouds looking dull and stormy
the night had been very wet large pools of water had collected in the road and the kennels were overflowing
there was a faint glimmering of the coming day in the sky but it rather aggravated than relieved the gloom of the scene the sombre light only serving to pale that which the street lamps afforded without shedding any warmer or brighter tints upon the wet housetops and dreary streets
there appeared to be nobody stirring in that quarter of the town the windows of the houses were all closely shut and the streets through which they passed were noiseless and empty
by the time they had turned into the bethnal green road the day had fairly begun to break
many of the lamps were already extinguished a few country waggons were slowly toiling on towards london now and then a stagecoach covered with mud rattled briskly by the driver bestowing as he passed an admonitory lash upon the heavy waggoner who by keeping on the wrong side of the road had endangered his arriving at the office a quarter of a minute after his time
the publichouses with gaslights burning inside were already open
by degrees other shops began to be unclosed and a few scattered people were met with
then came straggling groups of labourers going to their work then men and women with fishbaskets on their heads donkeycarts laden with vegetables chaisecarts filled with livestock or whole carcasses of meat milkwomen with pails an unbroken concourse of people trudging out with various supplies to the eastern suburbs of the town
as they approached the city the noise and traffic gradually increased when they threaded the streets between shoreditch and smithfield it had swelled into a roar of sound and bustle
it was as light as it was likely to be till night came on again and the busy morning of half the london population had begun
turning down sun street and crown street and crossing finsbury square mr sikes struck by way of chiswell street into barbican thence into long lane and so into smithfield from which latter place arose a tumult of discordant sounds that filled oliver twist with amazement
it was marketmorning
the ground was covered nearly ankledeep with filth and mire a thick steam perpetually rising from the reeking bodies of the cattle and mingling with the fog which seemed to rest upon the chimneytops hung heavily above
all the pens in the centre of the large area and as many temporary pens as could be crowded into the vacant space were filled with sheep tied up to posts by the gutter side were long lines of beasts and oxen three or four deep
countrymen butchers drovers hawkers boys thieves idlers and vagabonds of every low grade were mingled together in a mass the whistling of drovers the barking dogs the bellowing and plunging of the oxen the bleating of sheep the grunting and squeaking of pigs the cries of hawkers the shouts oaths and quarrelling on all sides the ringing of bells and roar of voices that issued from every publichouse the crowding pushing driving beating whooping and yelling the hideous and discordant dim that resounded from every corner of the market and the unwashed unshaven squalid and dirty figures constantly running to and fro and bursting in and out of the throng rendered it a stunning and bewildering scene which quite confounded the senses
mr sikes dragging oliver after him elbowed his way through the thickest of the crowd and bestowed very little attention on the numerous sights and sounds which so astonished the boy
he nodded twice or thrice to a passing friend and resisting as many invitations to take a morning dram pressed steadily onward until they were clear of the turmoil and had made their way through hosier lane into holborn
now young un said sikes looking up at the clock of st andrews church hard upon seven
you must step out
come dont lag behind already lazylegs mr sikes accompanied this speech with a jerk at his little companions wrist oliver quickening his pace into a kind of trot between a fast walk and a run kept up with the rapid strides of the housebreaker as well as he could
they held their course at this rate until they had passed hyde park corner and were on their way to kensington when sikes relaxed his pace until an empty cart which was at some little distance behind came up
seeing hounslow written on it he asked the driver with as much civility as he could assume if he would give them a lift as far as isleworth
jump up said the man
is that your boy yes hes my boy replied sikes looking hard at oliver and putting his hand abstractedly into the pocket where the pistol was
your father walks rather too quick for you dont he my man inquired the driver seeing that oliver was out of breath
not a bit of it replied sikes interposing
hes used to it
here take hold of my hand ned
in with you thus addressing oliver he helped him into the cart and the driver pointing to a heap of sacks told him to lie down there and rest himself
as they passed the different milestones oliver wondered more and more where his companion meant to take him
kensington hammersmith chiswick kew bridge brentford were all passed and yet they went on as steadily as if they had only just begun their journey
at length they came to a publichouse called the coach and horses a little way beyond which another road appeared to run off
and here the cart stopped
sikes dismounted with great precipitation holding oliver by the hand all the while and lifting him down directly bestowed a furious look upon him and rapped the sidepocket with his fist in a significant manner
goodbye boy said the man
hes sulky replied sikes giving him a shake hes sulky
a young dog
dont mind him not i rejoined the other getting into his cart
its a fine day after all and he drove away
sikes waited until he had fairly gone and then telling oliver he might look about him if he wanted once again led him onward on his journey
they turned round to the left a short way past the publichouse and then taking a righthand road walked on for a long time passing many large gardens and gentlemens houses on both sides of the way and stopping for nothing but a little beer until they reached a town
here against the wall of a house oliver saw written up in pretty large letters hampton they lingered about in the fields for some hours
at length they came back into the town and turning into an old publichouse with a defaced signboard ordered some dinner by the kitchen fire
the kitchen was an old lowroofed room with a great beam across the middle of the ceiling and benches with high backs to them by the fire on which were seated several rough men in smockfrocks drinking and smoking
they took no notice of oliver and very little of sikes and as sikes took very little notice of them he and his young comrade sat in a corner by themselves without being much troubled by their company
they had some cold meat for dinner and sat so long after it while mr sikes indulged himself with three or four pipes that oliver began to feel quite certain they were not going any further
being much tired with the walk and getting up so early he dozed a little at first then quite overpowered by fatigue and the fumes of the tobacco fell asleep
it was quite dark when he was awakened by a push from sikes
rousing himself sufficiently to sit up and look about him he found that worthy in close fellowship and communication with a labouring man over a pint of ale
so youre going on to lower halliford are you inquired sikes
yes i am replied the man who seemed a little the worseor better as the case might befor drinking and not slow about it neither
my horse hasnt got a load behind him going back as he had coming up in the mornin and he wont be long adoing of it
heres luck to him
ecod
hes a good un could you give my boy and me a lift as far as there demanded sikes pushing the ale towards his new friend
if youre going directly i can replied the man looking out of the pot
are you going to halliford going on to shepperton replied sikes
im your man as far as i go replied the other
is all paid becky yes the other gentlemans paid replied the girl
i say said the man with tipsy gravity that wont do you know why not rejoined sikes
youre agoing to accommodate us and wots to prevent my standing treat for a pint or so in return the stranger reflected upon this argument with a very profound face having done so he seized sikes by the hand and declared he was a real good fellow
to which mr sikes replied he was joking as if he had been sober there would have been strong reason to suppose he was
after the exchange of a few more compliments they bade the company goodnight and went out the girl gathering up the pots and glasses as they did so and lounging out to the door with her hands full to see the party start
the horse whose health had been drunk in his absence was standing outside ready harnessed to the cart
oliver and sikes got in without any further ceremony and the man to whom he belonged having lingered for a minute or two to bear him up and to defy the hostler and the world to produce his equal mounted also
then the hostler was told to give the horse his head and his head being given him he made a very unpleasant use of it tossing it into the air with great disdain and running into the parlour windows over the way after performing those feats and supporting himself for a short time on his hindlegs he started off at great speed and rattled out of the town right gallantly
the night was very dark
a damp mist rose from the river and the marshy ground about and spread itself over the dreary fields
it was piercing cold too all was gloomy and black
not a word was spoken for the driver had grown sleepy and sikes was in no mood to lead him into conversation
oliver sat huddled together in a corner of the cart bewildered with alarm and apprehension and figuring strange objects in the gaunt trees whose branches waved grimly to and fro as if in some fantastic joy at the desolation of the scene
as they passed sunbury church the clock struck seven
there was a light in the ferryhouse window opposite which streamed across the road and threw into more sombre shadow a dark yewtree with graves beneath it
there was a dull sound of falling water not far off and the leaves of the old tree stirred gently in the night wind
it seemed like quiet music for the repose of the dead
sunbury was passed through and they came again into the lonely road
two or three miles more and the cart stopped
sikes alighted took oliver by the hand and they once again walked on
they turned into no house at shepperton as the weary boy had expected but still kept walking on in mud and darkness through gloomy lanes and over cold open wastes until they came within sight of the lights of a town at no great distance
on looking intently forward oliver saw that the water was just below them and that they were coming to the foot of a bridge
sikes kept straight on until they were close upon the bridge then turned suddenly down a bank upon the left
the water thought oliver turning sick with fear
he has brought me to this lonely place to murder me he was about to throw himself on the ground and make one struggle for his young life when he saw that they stood before a solitary house all ruinous and decayed
there was a window on each side of the dilapidated entrance and one story above but no light was visible
the house was dark dismantled and to all appearance uninhabited
sikes with olivers hand still in his softly approached the low porch and raised the latch
the door yielded to the pressure and they passed in together
the burglary hallo cried a loud hoarse voice as soon as they set foot in the passage
dont make such a row said sikes bolting the door
show a glim toby aha
my pal cried the same voice
a glim barney a glim
show the gentleman in barney wake up first if convenient the speaker appeared to throw a bootjack or some such article at the person he addressed to rouse him from his slumbers for the noise of a wooden body falling violently was heard and then an indistinct muttering as of a man between sleep and awake
do you hear cried the same voice
theres bill sikes in the passage with nobody to do the civil to him and you sleeping there as if you took laudanum with your meals and nothing stronger
are you any fresher now or do you want the iron candlestick to wake you thoroughly a pair of slipshod feet shuffled hastily across the bare floor of the room as this interrogatory was put and there issued from a door on the right hand first a feeble candle and next the form of the same individual who has been heretofore described as labouring under the infirmity of speaking through his nose and officiating as waiter at the publichouse on saffron hill
bister sikes exclaimed barney with real or counterfeit joy cub id sir cub id here
you get on first said sikes putting oliver in front of him
quicker
or i shall tread upon your heels muttering a curse upon his tardiness sikes pushed oliver before him and they entered a low dark room with a smoky fire two or three broken chairs a table and a very old couch on which with his legs much higher than his head a man was reposing at full length smoking a long clay pipe
he was dressed in a smartlycut snuffcoloured coat with large brass buttons an orange neckerchief a coarse staring shawlpattern waistcoat and drab breeches
mr crackit for he it was had no very great quantity of hair either upon his head or face but what he had was of a reddish dye and tortured into long corkscrew curls through which he occasionally thrust some very dirty fingers ornamented with large common rings
he was a trifle above the middle size and apparently rather weak in the legs but this circumstance by no means detracted from his own admiration of his topboots which he contemplated in their elevated situation with lively satisfaction
bill my boy said this figure turning his head towards the door im glad to see you
i was almost afraid youd given it up in which case i should have made a personal wentur
hallo uttering this exclamation in a tone of great surprise as his eyes rested on oliver mr toby crackit brought himself into a sitting posture and demanded who that was
the boy
only the boy replied sikes drawing a chair towards the fire
wud of bister fagids lads exclaimed barney with a grin
fagins eh exclaimed toby looking at oliver
wot an inwalable boy thatll make for the old ladies pockets in chapels
his mug is a fortin to him theretheres enough of that interposed sikes impatiently and stooping over his recumbant friend he whispered a few words in his ear at which mr crackit laughed immensely and honoured oliver with a long stare of astonishment
now said sikes as he resumed his seat if youll give us something to eat and drink while were waiting youll put some heart in us or in me at all events
sit down by the fire younker and rest yourself for youll have to go out with us again tonight though not very far off oliver looked at sikes in mute and timid wonder and drawing a stool to the fire sat with his aching head upon his hands scarecely knowing where he was or what was passing around him
here said toby as the young jew placed some fragments of food and a bottle upon the table success to the crack he rose to honour the toast and carefully depositing his empty pipe in a corner advanced to the table filled a glass with spirits and drank off its contents
mr sikes did the same
a drain for the boy said toby halffilling a wineglass
down with it innocence indeed said oliver looking piteously up into the mans face indeed i down with it echoed toby
do you think i dont know whats good for you
tell him to drink it bill he had better said sikes clapping his hand upon his pocket
burn my body if he isnt more trouble than a whole family of dodgers
drink it you perwerse imp drink it frightened by the menacing gestures of the two men oliver hastily swallowed the contents of the glass and immediately fell into a violent fit of coughing which delighted toby crackit and barney and even drew a smile from the surly mr sikes
this done and sikes having satisfied his appetite oliver could eat nothing but a small crust of bread which they made him swallow the two men laid themselves down on chairs for a short nap
oliver retained his stool by the fire barney wrapped in a blanket stretched himself on the floor close outside the fender
they slept or appeared to sleep for some time nobody stirring but barney who rose once or twice to throw coals on the fire
oliver fell into a heavy doze imagining himself straying along the gloomy lanes or wandering about the dark churchyard or retracing some one or other of the scenes of the past day when he was roused by toby crackit jumping up and declaring it was halfpast one
in an instant the other two were on their legs and all were actively engaged in busy preparation
sikes and his companion enveloped their necks and chins in large dark shawls and drew on their greatcoats barney opening a cupboard brought forth several articles which he hastily crammed into the pockets
barkers for me barney said toby crackit
here they are replied barney producing a pair of pistols
you loaded them yourself all right replied toby stowing them away
the persuaders ive got em replied sikes
crape keys centrebits darkiesnothing forgotten inquired toby fastening a small crowbar to a loop inside the skirt of his coat
all right rejoined his companion
bring them bits of timber barney
thats the time of day with these words he took a thick stick from barneys hands who having delivered another to toby busied himself in fastening on olivers cape
now then said sikes holding out his hand
oliver who was completely stupified by the unwonted exercise and the air and the drink which had been forced upon him put his hand mechanically into that which sikes extended for the purpose
take his other hand toby said sikes
look out barney the man went to the door and returned to announce that all was quiet
the two robbers issued forth with oliver between them
barney having made all fast rolled himself up as before and was soon asleep again
it was now intensely dark
the fog was much heavier than it had been in the early part of the night and the atmosphere was so damp that although no rain fell olivers hair and eyebrows within a few minutes after leaving the house had become stiff with the halffrozen moisture that was floating about
they crossed the bridge and kept on towards the lights which he had seen before
they were at no great distance off and as they walked pretty briskly they soon arrived at chertsey
slap through the town whispered sikes therell be nobody in the way tonight to see us toby acquiesced and they hurried through the main street of the little town which at that late hour was wholly deserted
a dim light shone at intervals from some bedroom window and the hoarse barking of dogs occasionally broke the silence of the night
but there was nobody abroad
they had cleared the town as the churchbell struck two
quickening their pace they turned up a road upon the left hand
after walking about a quarter of a mile they stopped before a detached house surrounded by a wall to the top of which toby crackit scarcely pausing to take breath climbed in a twinkling
the boy next said toby
hoist him up ill catch hold of him before oliver had time to look round sikes had caught him under the arms and in three or four seconds he and toby were lying on the grass on the other side
sikes followed directly
and they stole cautiously towards the house
and now for the first time oliver wellnigh mad with grief and terror saw that housebreaking and robbery if not murder were the objects of the expedition
he clasped his hands together and involuntarily uttered a subdued exclamation of horror
a mist came before his eyes the cold sweat stood upon his ashy face his limbs failed him and he sank upon his knees
get up murmured sikes trembling with rage and drawing the pistol from his pocket get up or ill strew your brains upon the grass oh
for gods sake let me go cried oliver let me run away and die in the fields
i will never come near london never never
oh
pray have mercy on me and do not make me steal
for the love of all the bright angels that rest in heaven have mercy upon me the man to whom this appeal was made swore a dreadful oath and had cocked the pistol when toby striking it from his grasp placed his hand upon the boys mouth and dragged him to the house
hush cried the man it wont answer here
say another word and ill do your business myself with a crack on the head
that makes no noise and is quite as certain and more genteel
here bill wrench the shutter open
hes game enough now ill engage
ive seen older hands of his age took the same way for a minute or two on a cold night sikes invoking terrific imprecations upon fagins head for sending oliver on such an errand plied the crowbar vigorously but with little noise
after some delay and some assistance from toby the shutter to which he had referred swung open on its hinges
it was a little lattice window about five feet and a half above the ground at the back of the house which belonged to a scullery or small brewingplace at the end of the passage
the aperture was so small that the inmates had probably not thought it worth while to defend it more securely but it was large enough to admit a boy of olivers size nevertheless
a very brief exercise of mr sikes art sufficed to overcome the fastening of the lattice and it soon stood wide open also
now listen you young limb whispered sikes drawing a dark lantern from his pocket and throwing the glare full on olivers face im a going to put you through there
take this light go softly up the steps straight afore you and along the little hall to the street door unfasten it and let us in theres a bolt at the top you wont be able to reach interposed toby
stand upon one of the hall chairs
there are three there bill with a jolly large blue unicorn and gold pitchfork on em which is the old ladys arms keep quiet cant you replied sikes with a threatening look
the roomdoor is open is it wide replied toby after peeping in to satisfy himself
the game of that is that they always leave it open with a catch so that the dog whos got a bed in here may walk up and down the passage when he feels wakeful
ha
ha
barney ticed him away tonight
so neat although mr crackit spoke in a scarcely audible whisper and laughed without noise sikes imperiously commanded him to be silent and to get to work
toby complied by first producing his lantern and placing it on the ground then by planting himself firmly with his head against the wall beneath the window and his hands upon his knees so as to make a step of his back
this was no sooner done than sikes mounting upon him put oliver gently through the window with his feet first and without leaving hold of his collar planted him safely on the floor inside
take this lantern said sikes looking into the room
you see the stairs afore you oliver more dead than alive gasped out yes sikes pointing to the streetdoor with the pistolbarrel briefly advised him to take notice that he was within shot all the way and that if he faltered he would fall dead that instant
its done in a minute said sikes in the same low whisper
directly i leave go of you do your work
hark whats that whispered the other man
they listened intently
nothing said sikes releasing his hold of oliver
now in the short time he had had to collect his senses the boy had firmly resolved that whether he died in the attempt or not he would make one effort to dart upstairs from the hall and alarm the family
filled with this idea he advanced at once but stealthily
come back suddenly cried sikes aloud
back
back scared by the sudden breaking of the dead stillness of the place and by a loud cry which followed it oliver let his lantern fall and knew not whether to advance or fly
the cry was repeateda light appeareda vision of two terrified halfdressed men at the top of the stairs swam before his eyesa flasha loud noisea smokea crash somewhere but where he knew notand he staggered back
sikes had disappeared for an instant but he was up again and had him by the collar before the smoke had cleared away
he fired his own pistol after the men who were already retreating and dragged the boy up
clasp your arm tighter said sikes as he drew him through the window
give me a shawl here
theyve hit him
quick
how the boy bleeds then came the loud ringing of a bell mingled with the noise of firearms and the shouts of men and the sensation of being carried over uneven ground at a rapid pace
and then the noises grew confused in the distance and a cold deadly feeling crept over the boys heart and he saw or heard no more
which contains the substance of a pleasant conversation between mr bumble and a lady and shows that even a beadle may be susceptible on some points the night was bitter cold
the snow lay on the ground frozen into a hard thick crust so that only the heaps that had drifted into byways and corners were affected by the sharp wind that howled abroad which as if expending increased fury on such prey as it found caught it savagely up in clouds and whirling it into a thousand misty eddies scattered it in air
bleak dark and piercing cold it was a night for the wellhoused and fed to draw round the bright fire and thank god they were at home and for the homeless starving wretch to lay him down and die
many hungerworn outcasts close their eyes in our bare streets at such times who let their crimes have been what they may can hardly open them in a more bitter world
such was the aspect of outofdoors affairs when mrs corney the matron of the workhouse to which our readers have been already introduced as the birthplace of oliver twist sat herself down before a cheerful fire in her own little room and glanced with no small degree of complacency at a small round table on which stood a tray of corresponding size furnished with all necessary materials for the most grateful meal that matrons enjoy
in fact mrs corney was about to solace herself with a cup of tea
as she glanced from the table to the fireplace where the smallest of all possible kettles was singing a small song in a small voice her inward satisfaction evidently increasedso much so indeed that mrs corney smiled
well said the matron leaning her elbow on the table and looking reflectively at the fire im sure we have all on us a great deal to be grateful for
a great deal if we did but know it
ah mrs corney shook her head mournfully as if deploring the mental blindness of those paupers who did not know it and thrusting a silver spoon private property into the inmost recesses of a twoounce tin teacaddy proceeded to make the tea
how slight a thing will disturb the equanimity of our frail minds
the black teapot being very small and easily filled ran over while mrs corney was moralising and the water slightly scalded mrs corneys hand
drat the pot said the worthy matron setting it down very hastily on the hob a little stupid thing that only holds a couple of cups
what use is it of to anybody
except said mrs corney pausing except to a poor desolate creature like me
oh dear with these words the matron dropped into her chair and once more resting her elbow on the table thought of her solitary fate
the small teapot and the single cup had awakened in her mind sad recollections of mr corney who had not been dead more than fiveandtwenty years and she was overpowered
i shall never get another said mrs corney pettishly i shall never get anotherlike him whether this remark bore reference to the husband or the teapot is uncertain
it might have been the latter for mrs corney looked at it as she spoke and took it up afterwards
she had just tasted her first cup when she was disturbed by a soft tap at the roomdoor
oh come in with you said mrs corney sharply
some of the old women dying i suppose
they always die when im at meals
dont stand there letting the cold air in dont
whats amiss now eh nothing maam nothing replied a mans voice
dear me exclaimed the matron in a much sweeter tone is that mr bumble at your service maam said mr bumble who had been stopping outside to rub his shoes clean and to shake the snow off his coat and who now made his appearance bearing the cocked hat in one hand and a bundle in the other
shall i shut the door maam the lady modestly hesitated to reply lest there should be any impropriety in holding an interview with mr bumble with closed doors
mr bumble taking advantage of the hesitation and being very cold himself shut it without permission
hard weather mr bumble said the matron
hard indeed maam replied the beadle
antiporochial weather this maam
we have given away mrs corney we have given away a matter of twenty quartern loaves and a cheese and a half this very blessed afternoon and yet them paupers are not contented of course not
when would they be mr bumble said the matron sipping her tea
when indeed maam rejoined mr bumble
why heres one man that in consideration of his wife and large family has a quartern loaf and a good pound of cheese full weight
is he grateful maam
is he grateful
not a copper farthings worth of it
what does he do maam but ask for a few coals if its only a pocket handkerchief full he says
coals
what would he do with coals
toast his cheese with em and then come back for more
thats the way with these people maam give em a apron full of coals today and theyll come back for another the day after tomorrow as brazen as alabaster the matron expressed her entire concurrence in this intelligible simile and the beadle went on
i never said mr bumble see anything like the pitch its got to
the day afore yesterday a manyou have been a married woman maam and i may mention it to youa man with hardly a rag upon his back here mrs corney looked at the floor goes to our overseers door when he has got company coming to dinner and says he must be relieved mrs corney
as he wouldnt go away and shocked the company very much our overseer sent him out a pound of potatoes and half a pint of oatmeal
my heart says the ungrateful villain whats the use of this to me
you might as well give me a pair of iron spectacles very good says our overseer taking em away again you wont get anything else here then ill die in the streets says the vagrant
oh no you wont says our overseer ha
ha
that was very good
so like mr grannett wasnt it interposed the matron
well mr bumble well maam rejoined the beadle he went away and he did die in the streets
theres a obstinate pauper for you it beats anything i could have believed observed the matron emphatically
but dont you think outofdoor relief a very bad thing any way mr bumble
youre a gentleman of experience and ought to know
come mrs
corney said the beadle smiling as men smile who are conscious of superior information outofdoor relief properly managed properly managed maam is the porochial safeguard
the great principle of outofdoor relief is to give the paupers exactly what they dont want and then they get tired of coming dear me exclaimed mrs corney
well that is a good one too yes
betwixt you and me maam returned mr bumble thats the great principle and thats the reason why if you look at any cases that get into them owdacious newspapers youll always observe that sick families have been relieved with slices of cheese
thats the rule now mrs corney all over the country
but however said the beadle stopping to unpack his bundle these are official secrets maam not to be spoken of except as i may say among the porochial officers such as ourselves
this is the port wine maam that the board ordered for the infirmary real fresh genuine port wine only out of the cask this forenoon clear as a bell and no sediment having held the first bottle up to the light and shaken it well to test its excellence mr bumble placed them both on top of a chest of drawers folded the handkerchief in which they had been wrapped put it carefully in his pocket and took up his hat as if to go
youll have a very cold walk mr bumble said the matron
it blows maam replied mr bumble turning up his coatcollar enough to cut ones ears off the matron looked from the little kettle to the beadle who was moving towards the door and as the beadle coughed preparatory to bidding her goodnight bashfully inquired whetherwhether he wouldnt take a cup of tea
mr bumble instantaneously turned back his collar again laid his hat and stick upon a chair and drew another chair up to the table
as he slowly seated himself he looked at the lady
she fixed her eyes upon the little teapot
mr bumble coughed again and slightly smiled
mrs corney rose to get another cup and saucer from the closet
as she sat down her eyes once again encountered those of the gallant beadle she coloured and applied herself to the task of making his tea
again mr bumble coughedlouder this time than he had coughed yet
sweet
mr bumble inquired the matron taking up the sugarbasin
very sweet indeed maam replied mr bumble
he fixed his eyes on mrs corney as he said this and if ever a beadle looked tender mr bumble was that beadle at that moment
the tea was made and handed in silence
mr bumble having spread a handkerchief over his knees to prevent the crumbs from sullying the splendour of his shorts began to eat and drink varying these amusements occasionally by fetching a deep sigh which however had no injurious effect upon his appetite but on the contrary rather seemed to facilitate his operations in the tea and toast department
you have a cat maam i see said mr bumble glancing at one who in the centre of her family was basking before the fire and kittens too i declare i am so fond of them mr bumble you cant think replied the matron
theyre so happy so frolicsome and so cheerful that they are quite companions for me very nice animals maam replied mr bumble approvingly so very domestic oh yes rejoined the matron with enthusiasm so fond of their home too that its quite a pleasure im sure mrs
corney maam said mr bumble slowly and marking the time with his teaspoon i mean to say this maam that any cat or kitten that could live with you maam and not be fond of its home must be a ass maam oh mr bumble remonstrated mrs corney
its of no use disguising facts maam said mr bumble slowly flourishing the teaspoon with a kind of amorous dignity which made him doubly impressive i would drown it myself with pleasure then youre a cruel man said the matron vivaciously as she held out her hand for the beadles cup and a very hardhearted man besides hardhearted maam said mr bumble
hard mr bumble resigned his cup without another word squeezed mrs corneys little finger as she took it and inflicting two openhanded slaps upon his laced waistcoat gave a mighty sigh and hitched his chair a very little morsel farther from the fire
it was a round table and as mrs corney and mr bumble had been sitting opposite each other with no great space between them and fronting the fire it will be seen that mr bumble in receding from the fire and still keeping at the table increased the distance between himself and mrs corney which proceeding some prudent readers will doubtless be disposed to admire and to consider an act of great heroism on mr bumbles part he being in some sort tempted by time place and opportunity to give utterance to certain soft nothings which however well they may become the lips of the light and thoughtless do seem immeasurably beneath the dignity of judges of the land members of parliament ministers of state lord mayors and other great public functionaries but more particularly beneath the stateliness and gravity of a beadle who as is well known should be the sternest and most inflexible among them all
whatever were mr bumbles intentions however and no doubt they were of the best it unfortunately happened as has been twice before remarked that the table was a round one consequently mr bumble moving his chair by little and little soon began to diminish the distance between himself and the matron and continuing to travel round the outer edge of the circle brought his chair in time close to that in which the matron was seated
indeed the two chairs touched and when they did so mr bumble stopped
now if the matron had moved her chair to the right she would have been scorched by the fire and if to the left she must have fallen into mr bumbles arms so being a discreet matron and no doubt foreseeing these consequences at a glance she remained where she was and handed mr bumble another cup of tea
hardhearted mrs corney said mr bumble stirring his tea and looking up into the matrons face are you hardhearted mrs corney dear me exclaimed the matron what a very curious question from a single man
what can you want to know for mr bumble the beadle drank his tea to the last drop finished a piece of toast whisked the crumbs off his knees wiped his lips and deliberately kissed the matron
mr
bumble cried that discreet lady in a whisper for the fright was so great that she had quite lost her voice mr
bumble i shall scream mr bumble made no reply but in a slow and dignified manner put his arm round the matrons waist
as the lady had stated her intention of screaming of course she would have screamed at this additional boldness but that the exertion was rendered unnecessary by a hasty knocking at the door which was no sooner heard than mr bumble darted with much agility to the wine bottles and began dusting them with great violence while the matron sharply demanded who was there
it is worthy of remark as a curious physical instance of the efficacy of a sudden surprise in counteracting the effects of extreme fear that her voice had quite recovered all its official asperity
if you please mistress said a withered old female pauper hideously ugly putting her head in at the door old sally is agoing fast well whats that to me angrily demanded the matron
i cant keep her alive can i no no mistress replied the old woman nobody can shes far beyond the reach of help
ive seen a many people die little babes and great strong men and i know when deaths acoming well enough
but shes troubled in her mind and when the fits are not on herand thats not often for she is dying very hardshe says she has got something to tell which you must hear
shell never die quiet till you come mistress at this intelligence the worthy mrs corney muttered a variety of invectives against old women who couldnt even die without purposely annoying their betters and muffling herself in a thick shawl which she hastily caught up briefly requested mr bumble to stay till she came back lest anything particular should occur
bidding the messenger walk fast and not be all night hobbling up the stairs she followed her from the room with a very ill grace scolding all the way
mr bumbles conduct on being left to himself was rather inexplicable
he opened the closet counted the teaspoons weighed the sugartongs closely inspected a silver milkpot to ascertain that it was of the genuine metal and having satisfied his curiosity on these points put on his cocked hat cornerwise and danced with much gravity four distinct times round the table
having gone through this very extraordinary performance he took off the cocked hat again and spreading himself before the fire with his back towards it seemed to be mentally engaged in taking an exact inventory of the furniture
treats on a very poor subject
but is a short one and may be found of importance in this history it was no unfit messenger of death who had disturbed the quiet of the matrons room
her body was bent by age her limbs trembled with palsy her face distorted into a mumbling leer resembled more the grotesque shaping of some wild pencil than the work of natures hand
alas
how few of natures faces are left alone to gladden us with their beauty
the cares and sorrows and hungerings of the world change them as they change hearts and it is only when those passions sleep and have lost their hold for ever that the troubled clouds pass off and leave heavens surface clear
it is a common thing for the countenances of the dead even in that fixed and rigid state to subside into the longforgotten expression of sleeping infancy and settle into the very look of early life so calm so peaceful do they grow again that those who knew them in their happy childhood kneel by the coffins side in awe and see the angel even upon earth
the old crone tottered along the passages and up the stairs muttering some indistinct answers to the chidings of her companion being at length compelled to pause for breath she gave the light into her hand and remained behind to follow as she might while the more nimble superior made her way to the room where the sick woman lay
it was a bare garretroom with a dim light burning at the farther end
there was another old woman watching by the bed the parish apothecarys apprentice was standing by the fire making a toothpick out of a quill
cold night mrs corney said this young gentleman as the matron entered
very cold indeed sir replied the mistress in her most civil tones and dropping a curtsey as she spoke
you should get better coals out of your contractors said the apothecarys deputy breaking a lump on the top of the fire with the rusty poker these are not at all the sort of thing for a cold night theyre the boards choosing sir returned the matron
the least they could do would be to keep us pretty warm for our places are hard enough the conversation was here interrupted by a moan from the sick woman
oh said the young man turning his face towards the bed as if he had previously quite forgotten the patient its all up
there mrs corney it is is it sir asked the matron
if she lasts a couple of hours i shall be surprised said the apothecarys apprentice intent upon the toothpicks point
its a breakup of the system altogether
is she dozing old lady the attendant stooped over the bed to ascertain and nodded in the affirmative
then perhaps shell go off in that way if you dont make a row said the young man
put the light on the floor
she wont see it there the attendant did as she was told shaking her head meanwhile to intimate that the woman would not die so easily having done so she resumed her seat by the side of the other nurse who had by this time returned
the mistress with an expression of impatience wrapped herself in her shawl and sat at the foot of the bed
the apothecarys apprentice having completed the manufacture of the toothpick planted himself in front of the fire and made good use of it for ten minutes or so when apparently growing rather dull he wished mrs corney joy of her job and took himself off on tiptoe
when they had sat in silence for some time the two old women rose from the bed and crouching over the fire held out their withered hands to catch the heat
the flame threw a ghastly light on their shrivelled faces and made their ugliness appear terrible as in this position they began to converse in a low voice
did she say any more anny dear while i was gone inquired the messenger
not a word replied the other
she plucked and tore at her arms for a little time but i held her hands and she soon dropped off
she hasnt much strength in her so i easily kept her quiet
i aint so weak for an old woman although i am on parish allowance no no did she drink the hot wine the doctor said she was to have demanded the first
i tried to get it down rejoined the other
but her teeth were tight set and she clenched the mug so hard that it was as much as i could do to get it back again
so i drank it and it did me good looking cautiously round to ascertain that they were not overheard the two hags cowered nearer to the fire and chuckled heartily
i mind the time said the first speaker when she would have done the same and made rare fun of it afterwards ay that she would rejoined the other she had a merry heart
a many many beautiful corpses she laid out as nice and neat as waxwork
my old eyes have seen themay and those old hands touched them too for i have helped her scores of times stretching forth her trembling fingers as she spoke the old creature shook them exultingly before her face and fumbling in her pocket brought out an old timediscoloured tin snuffbox from which she shook a few grains into the outstretched palm of her companion and a few more into her own
while they were thus employed the matron who had been impatiently watching until the dying woman should awaken from her stupor joined them by the fire and sharply asked how long she was to wait
not long mistress replied the second woman looking up into her face
we have none of us long to wait for death
patience patience
hell be here soon enough for us all hold your tongue you doting idiot said the matron sternly
you martha tell me has she been in this way before often answered the first woman
but will never be again added the second one that is shell never wake again but onceand mind mistress that wont be for long long or short said the matron snappishly she wont find me here when she does wake take care both of you how you worry me again for nothing
its no part of my duty to see all the old women in the house die and i wontthats more
mind that you impudent old harridans
if you make a fool of me again ill soon cure you i warrant you she was bouncing away when a cry from the two women who had turned towards the bed caused her to look round
the patient had raised herself upright and was stretching her arms towards them
whos that she cried in a hollow voice
hush hush said one of the women stooping over her
lie down lie down ill never lie down again alive said the woman struggling
i will tell her
come here
nearer
let me whisper in your ear she clutched the matron by the arm and forcing her into a chair by the bedside was about to speak when looking round she caught sight of the two old women bending forward in the attitude of eager listeners
turn them away said the woman drowsily make haste
make haste the two old crones chiming in together began pouring out many piteous lamentations that the poor dear was too far gone to know her best friends and were uttering sundry protestations that they would never leave her when the superior pushed them from the room closed the door and returned to the bedside
on being excluded the old ladies changed their tone and cried through the keyhole that old sally was drunk which indeed was not unlikely since in addition to a moderate dose of opium prescribed by the apothecary she was labouring under the effects of a final taste of ginandwater which had been privily administered in the openness of their hearts by the worthy old ladies themselves
now listen to me said the dying woman aloud as if making a great effort to revive one latent spark of energy
in this very roomin this very bedi once nursed a pretty young creetur that was brought into the house with her feet cut and bruised with walking and all soiled with dust and blood
she gave birth to a boy and died
let me thinkwhat was the year again never mind the year said the impatient auditor what about her ay murmured the sick woman relapsing into her former drowsy state what about herwhat abouti know she cried jumping fiercely up her face flushed and her eyes starting from her headi robbed her so i did
she wasnt coldi tell you she wasnt cold when i stole it stole what for gods sake cried the matron with a gesture as if she would call for help
it replied the woman laying her hand over the others mouth
the only thing she had
she wanted clothes to keep her warm and food to eat but she had kept it safe and had it in her bosom
it was gold i tell you
rich gold that might have saved her life gold echoed the matron bending eagerly over the woman as she fell back
go on go onyeswhat of it
who was the mother
when was it she charged me to keep it safe replied the woman with a groan and trusted me as the only woman about her
i stole it in my heart when she first showed it me hanging round her neck and the childs death perhaps is on me besides
they would have treated him better if they had known it all known what asked the other
speak the boy grew so like his mother said the woman rambling on and not heeding the question that i could never forget it when i saw his face
poor girl
poor girl
she was so young too
such a gentle lamb
wait theres more to tell
i have not told you all have i no no replied the matron inclining her head to catch the words as they came more faintly from the dying woman
be quick or it may be too late the mother said the woman making a more violent effort than before the mother when the pains of death first came upon her whispered in my ear that if her baby was born alive and thrived the day might come when it would not feel so much disgraced to hear its poor young mother named
and oh kind heaven she said folding her thin hands together whether it be boy or girl raise up some friends for it in this troubled world and take pity upon a lonely desolate child abandoned to its mercy the boys name demanded the matron
they called him oliver replied the woman feebly
the gold i stole was yes yeswhat cried the other
she was bending eagerly over the woman to hear her reply but drew back instinctively as she once again rose slowly and stiffly into a sitting posture then clutching the coverlid with both hands muttered some indistinct sounds in her throat and fell lifeless on the bed
stone dead said one of the old women hurrying in as soon as the door was opened
and nothing to tell after all rejoined the matron walking carelessly away
the two crones to all appearance too busily occupied in the preparations for their dreadful duties to make any reply were left alone hovering about the body
wherein this history reverts to mr fagin and company while these things were passing in the country workhouse mr fagin sat in the old denthe same from which oliver had been removed by the girlbrooding over a dull smoky fire
he held a pair of bellows upon his knee with which he had apparently been endeavouring to rouse it into more cheerful action but he had fallen into deep thought and with his arms folded on them and his chin resting on his thumbs fixed his eyes abstractedly on the rusty bars
at a table behind him sat the artful dodger master charles bates and mr chitling all intent upon a game of whist the artful taking dummy against master bates and mr chitling
the countenance of the firstnamed gentleman peculiarly intelligent at all times acquired great additional interest from his close observance of the game and his attentive perusal of mr chitlings hand upon which from time to time as occasion served he bestowed a variety of earnest glances wisely regulating his own play by the result of his observations upon his neighbours cards
it being a cold night the dodger wore his hat as indeed was often his custom within doors
he also sustained a clay pipe between his teeth which he only removed for a brief space when he deemed it necessary to apply for refreshment to a quart pot upon the table which stood ready filled with ginandwater for the accommodation of the company
master bates was also attentive to the play but being of a more excitable nature than his accomplished friend it was observable that he more frequently applied himself to the ginandwater and moreover indulged in many jests and irrelevant remarks all highly unbecoming a scientific rubber
indeed the artful presuming upon their close attachment more than once took occasion to reason gravely with his companion upon these improprieties all of which remonstrances master bates received in extremely good part merely requesting his friend to be blowed or to insert his head in a sack or replying with some other neatlyturned witticism of a similar kind the happy application of which excited considerable admiration in the mind of mr chitling
it was remarkable that the latter gentleman and his partner invariably lost and that the circumstance so far from angering master bates appeared to afford him the highest amusement inasmuch as he laughed most uproariously at the end of every deal and protested that he had never seen such a jolly game in all his born days
thats two doubles and the rub said mr chitling with a very long face as he drew halfacrown from his waistcoatpocket
i never see such a feller as you jack you win everything
even when weve good cards charley and i cant make nothing of em either the master or the manner of this remark which was made very ruefully delighted charley bates so much that his consequent shout of laughter roused the jew from his reverie and induced him to inquire what was the matter
matter fagin cried charley
i wish you had watched the play
tommy chitling hasnt won a point and i went partners with him against the artfull and dumb ay ay said the jew with a grin which sufficiently demonstrated that he was at no loss to understand the reason
try em again tom try em again no more of it for me thank ee fagin replied mr chitling ive had enough
that ere dodger has such a run of luck that theres no standing again him ha
ha
my dear replied the jew you must get up very early in the morning to win against the dodger morning said charley bates you must put your boots on overnight and have a telescope at each eye and a operaglass between your shoulders if you want to come over him mr dawkins received these handsome compliments with much philosophy and offered to cut any gentleman in company for the first picturecard at a shilling at a time
nobody accepting the challenge and his pipe being by this time smoked out he proceeded to amuse himself by sketching a groundplan of newgate on the table with the piece of chalk which had served him in lieu of counters whistling meantime with peculiar shrillness
how precious dull you are tommy said the dodger stopping short when there had been a long silence and addressing mr chitling
what do you think hes thinking of fagin how should i know my dear replied the jew looking round as he plied the bellows
about his losses maybe or the little retirement in the country that hes just left eh
ha
ha
is that it my dear not a bit of it replied the dodger stopping the subject of discourse as mr chitling was about to reply
what do you say charley i should say replied master bates with a grin that he was uncommon sweet upon betsy
see how hes ablushing
oh my eye
heres a merrygorounder
tommy chitlings in love
oh fagin fagin
what a spree thoroughly overpowered with the notion of mr chitling being the victim of the tender passion master bates threw himself back in his chair with such violence that he lost his balance and pitched over upon the floor where the accident abating nothing of his merriment he lay at full length until his laugh was over when he resumed his former position and began another laugh
never mind him my dear said the jew winking at mr dawkins and giving master bates a reproving tap with the nozzle of the bellows
betsys a fine girl
stick up to her tom
stick up to her what i mean to say fagin replied mr chitling very red in the face is that that isnt anything to anybody here no more it is replied the jew charley will talk
dont mind him my dear dont mind him
betsys a fine girl
do as she bids you tom and you will make your fortune so i do do as she bids me replied mr chitling i shouldnt have been milled if it hadnt been for her advice
but it turned out a good job for you didnt it fagin
and whats six weeks of it
it must come some time or another and why not in the winter time when you dont want to go out awalking so much eh fagin ah to be sure my dear replied the jew
you wouldnt mind it again tom would you asked the dodger winking upon charley and the jew if bet was all right i mean to say that i shouldnt replied tom angrily
there now
ah
wholl say as much as that i should like to know eh fagin nobody my dear replied the jew not a soul tom
i dont know one of em that would do it besides you not one of em my dear i might have got clear off if id split upon her mightnt i fagin angrily pursued the poor halfwitted dupe
a word from me would have done it wouldnt it fagin to be sure it would my dear replied the jew
but i didnt blab it did i fagin demanded tom pouring question upon question with great volubility
no no to be sure replied the jew you were too stouthearted for that
a deal too stout my dear perhaps i was rejoined tom looking round and if i was whats to laugh at in that eh fagin the jew perceiving that mr chitling was considerably roused hastened to assure him that nobody was laughing and to prove the gravity of the company appealed to master bates the principal offender
but unfortunately charley in opening his mouth to reply that he was never more serious in his life was unable to prevent the escape of such a violent roar that the abused mr chitling without any preliminary ceremonies rushed across the room and aimed a blow at the offender who being skilful in evading pursuit ducked to avoid it and chose his time so well that it lighted on the chest of the merry old gentleman and caused him to stagger to the wall where he stood panting for breath while mr chitling looked on in intense dismay
hark cried the dodger at this moment i heard the tinkler catching up the light he crept softly upstairs
the bell was rung again with some impatience while the party were in darkness
after a short pause the dodger reappeared and whispered fagin mysteriously
what cried the jew alone the dodger nodded in the affirmative and shading the flame of the candle with his hand gave charley bates a private intimation in dumb show that he had better not be funny just then
having performed this friendly office he fixed his eyes on the jews face and awaited his directions
the old man bit his yellow fingers and meditated for some seconds his face working with agitation the while as if he dreaded something and feared to know the worst
at length he raised his head
where is he he asked
the dodger pointed to the floor above and made a gesture as if to leave the room
yes said the jew answering the mute inquiry bring him down
hush
quiet charley
gently tom
scarce scarce this brief direction to charley bates and his recent antagonist was softly and immediately obeyed
there was no sound of their whereabout when the dodger descended the stairs bearing the light in his hand and followed by a man in a coarse smockfrock who after casting a hurried glance round the room pulled off a large wrapper which had concealed the lower portion of his face and disclosed all haggard unwashed and unshorn the features of flash toby crackit
how are you faguey said this worthy nodding to the jew
pop that shawl away in my castor dodger so that i may know where to find it when i cut thats the time of day
youll be a fine young cracksman afore the old file now with these words he pulled up the smockfrock and winding it round his middle drew a chair to the fire and placed his feet upon the hob
see there faguey he said pointing disconsolately to his top boots not a drop of day and martin since you know when not a bubble of blacking by jove
but dont look at me in that way man
all in good time
i cant talk about business till ive eat and drank so produce the sustainance and lets have a quiet fillout for the first time these three days the jew motioned to the dodger to place what eatables there were upon the table and seating himself opposite the housebreaker waited his leisure
to judge from appearances toby was by no means in a hurry to open the conversation
at first the jew contented himself with patiently watching his countenance as if to gain from its expression some clue to the intelligence he brought but in vain
he looked tired and worn but there was the same complacent repose upon his features that they always wore and through dirt and beard and whisker there still shone unimpaired the selfsatisfied smirk of flash toby crackit
then the jew in an agony of impatience watched every morsel he put into his mouth pacing up and down the room meanwhile in irrepressible excitement
it was all of no use
toby continued to eat with the utmost outward indifference until he could eat no more then ordering the dodger out he closed the door mixed a glass of spirits and water and composed himself for talking
first and foremost faguey said toby
yes yes interposed the jew drawing up his chair
mr crackit stopped to take a draught of spirits and water and to declare that the gin was excellent then placing his feet against the low mantelpiece so as to bring his boots to about the level of his eye he quietly resumed
first and foremost faguey said the housebreaker hows bill what screamed the jew starting from his seat
why you dont mean to say began toby turning pale
mean cried the jew stamping furiously on the ground
where are they
sikes and the boy
where are they
where have they been
where are they hiding
why have they not been here the crack failed said toby faintly
i know it replied the jew tearing a newspaper from his pocket and pointing to it
what more they fired and hit the boy
we cut over the fields at the back with him between usstraight as the crow fliesthrough hedge and ditch
they gave chase
damme
the whole country was awake and the dogs upon us the boy bill had him on his back and scudded like the wind
we stopped to take him between us his head hung down and he was cold
they were close upon our heels every man for himself and each from the gallows
we parted company and left the youngster lying in a ditch
alive or dead thats all i know about him the jew stopped to hear no more but uttering a loud yell and twining his hands in his hair rushed from the room and from the house
in which a mysterious character appears upon the scene and many things inseparable from this history are done and performed the old man had gained the street corner before he began to recover the effect of toby crackits intelligence
he had relaxed nothing of his unusual speed but was still pressing onward in the same wild and disordered manner when the sudden dashing past of a carriage and a boisterous cry from the foot passengers who saw his danger drove him back upon the pavement
avoiding as much as was possible all the main streets and skulking only through the byways and alleys he at length emerged on snow hill
here he walked even faster than before nor did he linger until he had again turned into a court when as if conscious that he was now in his proper element he fell into his usual shuffling pace and seemed to breathe more freely
near to the spot on which snow hill and holborn hill meet opens upon the right hand as you come out of the city a narrow and dismal alley leading to saffron hill
in its filthy shops are exposed for sale huge bunches of secondhand silk handkerchiefs of all sizes and patterns for here reside the traders who purchase them from pickpockets
hundreds of these handkerchiefs hang dangling from pegs outside the windows or flaunting from the doorposts and the shelves within are piled with them
confined as the limits of field lane are it has its barber its coffeeshop its beershop and its friedfish warehouse
it is a commercial colony of itself the emporium of petty larceny visited at early morning and settingin of dusk by silent merchants who traffic in dark backparlours and who go as strangely as they come
here the clothesman the shoevamper and the ragmerchant display their goods as signboards to the petty thief here stores of old iron and bones and heaps of mildewy fragments of woollenstuff and linen rust and rot in the grimy cellars
it was into this place that the jew turned
he was well known to the sallow denizens of the lane for such of them as were on the lookout to buy or sell nodded familiarly as he passed along
he replied to their salutations in the same way but bestowed no closer recognition until he reached the further end of the alley when he stopped to address a salesman of small stature who had squeezed as much of his person into a childs chair as the chair would hold and was smoking a pipe at his warehouse door
why the sight of you mr fagin would cure the hoptalmy said this respectable trader in acknowledgment of the jews inquiry after his health
the neighbourhood was a little too hot lively said fagin elevating his eyebrows and crossing his hands upon his shoulders
well ive heerd that complaint of it once or twice before replied the trader but it soon cools down again dont you find it so fagin nodded in the affirmative
pointing in the direction of saffron hill he inquired whether any one was up yonder tonight
at the cripples inquired the man
the jew nodded
let me see pursued the merchant reflecting
yes theres some halfdozen of em gone in that i knows
i dont think your friends there sikes is not i suppose inquired the jew with a disappointed countenance
non istwentus as the lawyers say replied the little man shaking his head and looking amazingly sly
have you got anything in my line tonight nothing tonight said the jew turning away
are you going up to the cripples fagin cried the little man calling after him
stop
i dont mind if i have a drop there with you but as the jew looking back waved his hand to intimate that he preferred being alone and moreover as the little man could not very easily disengage himself from the chair the sign of the cripples was for a time bereft of the advantage of mr livelys presence
by the time he had got upon his legs the jew had disappeared so mr lively after ineffectually standing on tiptoe in the hope of catching sight of him again forced himself into the little chair and exchanging a shake of the head with a lady in the opposite shop in which doubt and mistrust were plainly mingled resumed his pipe with a grave demeanour
the three cripples or rather the cripples which was the sign by which the establishment was familiarly known to its patrons was the publichouse in which mr sikes and his dog have already figured
merely making a sign to a man at the bar fagin walked straight upstairs and opening the door of a room and softly insinuating himself into the chamber looked anxiously about shading his eyes with his hand as if in search of some particular person
the room was illuminated by two gaslights the glare of which was prevented by the barred shutters and closelydrawn curtains of faded red from being visible outside
the ceiling was blackened to prevent its colour from being injured by the flaring of the lamps and the place was so full of dense tobacco smoke that at first it was scarcely possible to discern anything more
by degrees however as some of it cleared away through the open door an assemblage of heads as confused as the noises that greeted the ear might be made out and as the eye grew more accustomed to the scene the spectator gradually became aware of the presence of a numerous company male and female crowded round a long table at the upper end of which sat a chairman with a hammer of office in his hand while a professional gentleman with a bluish nose and his face tied up for the benefit of a toothache presided at a jingling piano in a remote corner
as fagin stepped softly in the professional gentleman running over the keys by way of prelude occasioned a general cry of order for a song which having subsided a young lady proceeded to entertain the company with a ballad in four verses between each of which the accompanyist played the melody all through as loud as he could
when this was over the chairman gave a sentiment after which the professional gentleman on the chairmans right and left volunteered a duet and sang it with great applause
it was curious to observe some faces which stood out prominently from among the group
there was the chairman himself the landlord of the house a coarse rough heavy built fellow who while the songs were proceeding rolled his eyes hither and thither and seeming to give himself up to joviality had an eye for everything that was done and an ear for everything that was saidand sharp ones too
near him were the singers receiving with professional indifference the compliments of the company and applying themselves in turn to a dozen proffered glasses of spirits and water tendered by their more boisterous admirers whose countenances expressive of almost every vice in almost every grade irresistibly attracted the attention by their very repulsiveness
cunning ferocity and drunkeness in all its stages were there in their strongest aspect and women some with the last lingering tinge of their early freshness almost fading as you looked others with every mark and stamp of their sex utterly beaten out and presenting but one loathsome blank of profligacy and crime some mere girls others but young women and none past the prime of life formed the darkest and saddest portion of this dreary picture
fagin troubled by no grave emotions looked eagerly from face to face while these proceedings were in progress but apparently without meeting that of which he was in search
succeeding at length in catching the eye of the man who occupied the chair he beckoned to him slightly and left the room as quietly as he had entered it
what can i do for you mr fagin inquired the man as he followed him out to the landing
wont you join us
theyll be delighted every one of em the jew shook his head impatiently and said in a whisper is he here no replied the man
and no news of barney inquired fagin
none replied the landlord of the cripples for it was he
he wont stir till its all safe
depend on it theyre on the scent down there and that if he moved hed blow upon the thing at once
hes all right enough barney is else i should have heard of him
ill pound it that barneys managing properly
let him alone for that will he be here tonight asked the jew laying the same emphasis on the pronoun as before
monks do you mean inquired the landlord hesitating
hush said the jew
yes certain replied the man drawing a gold watch from his fob i expected him here before now
if youll wait ten minutes hell be no no said the jew hastily as though however desirous he might be to see the person in question he was nevertheless relieved by his absence
tell him i came here to see him and that he must come to me tonight
no say tomorrow
as he is not here tomorrow will be time enough good said the man
nothing more not a word now said the jew descending the stairs
i say said the other looking over the rails and speaking in a hoarse whisper what a time this would be for a sell
ive got phil barker here so drunk that a boy might take him ah
but its not phil barkers time said the jew looking up
phil has something more to do before we can afford to part with him so go back to the company my dear and tell them to lead merry liveswhile they last
ha
ha
ha the landlord reciprocated the old mans laugh and returned to his guests
the jew was no sooner alone than his countenance resumed its former expression of anxiety and thought
after a brief reflection he called a hackcabriolet and bade the man drive towards bethnal green
he dismissed him within some quarter of a mile of mr sikess residence and performed the short remainder of the distance on foot
now muttered the jew as he knocked at the door if there is any deep play here i shall have it out of you my girl cunning as you are she was in her room the woman said
fagin crept softly upstairs and entered it without any previous ceremony
the girl was alone lying with her head upon the table and her hair straggling over it
she has been drinking thought the jew cooly or perhaps she is only miserable the old man turned to close the door as he made this reflection the noise thus occasioned roused the girl
she eyed his crafty face narrowly as she inquired to his recital of toby crackits story
when it was concluded she sank into her former attitude but spoke not a word
she pushed the candle impatiently away and once or twice as she feverishly changed her position shuffled her feet upon the ground but this was all
during the silence the jew looked restlessly about the room as if to assure himself that there were no appearances of sikes having covertly returned
apparently satisfied with his inspection he coughed twice or thrice and made as many efforts to open a conversation but the girl heeded him no more than if he had been made of stone
at length he made another attempt and rubbing his hands together said in his most conciliatory tone and where should you think bill was now my dear the girl moaned out some half intelligible reply that she could not tell and seemed from the smothered noise that escaped her to be crying
and the boy too said the jew straining his eyes to catch a glimpse of her face
poor leetle child
left in a ditch nance only think the child said the girl suddenly looking up is better where he is than among us and if no harm comes to bill from it i hope he lies dead in the ditch and that his young bones may rot there what cried the jew in amazement
ay i do returned the girl meeting his gaze
i shall be glad to have him away from my eyes and to know that the worst is over
i cant bear to have him about me
the sight of him turns me against myself and all of you pooh said the jew scornfully
youre drunk am i cried the girl bitterly
its no fault of yours if i am not
youd never have me anything else if you had your will except nowthe humour doesnt suit you doesnt it no rejoined the jew furiously
it does not change it then responded the girl with a laugh
change it exclaimed the jew exasperated beyond all bounds by his companions unexpected obstinacy and the vexation of the night i will change it
listen to me you drab
listen to me who with six words can strangle sikes as surely as if i had his bulls throat between my fingers now
if he comes back and leaves the boy behind him if he gets off free and dead or alive fails to restore him to me murder him yourself if you would have him escape jack ketch
and do it the moment he sets foot in this room or mind me it will be too late what is all this cried the girl involuntarily
what is it pursued fagin mad with rage
when the boys worth hundreds of pounds to me am i to lose what chance threw me in the way of getting safely through the whims of a drunken gang that i could whistle away the lives of
and me bound too to a born devil that only wants the will and has the power to to panting for breath the old man stammered for a word and in that instant checked the torrent of his wrath and changed his whole demeanour
a moment before his clenched hands had grasped the air his eyes had dilated and his face grown livid with passion but now he shrunk into a chair and cowering together trembled with the apprehension of having himself disclosed some hidden villainy
after a short silence he ventured to look round at his companion
he appeared somewhat reassured on beholding her in the same listless attitude from which he had first roused her
nancy dear croaked the jew in his usual voice
did you mind me dear dont worry me now fagin replied the girl raising her head languidly
if bill has not done it this time he will another
he has done many a good job for you and will do many more when he can and when he cant he wont so no more about that regarding this boy my dear said the jew rubbing the palms of his hands nervously together
the boy must take his chance with the rest interrupted nancy hastily and i say again i hope he is dead and out of harms way and out of yoursthat is if bill comes to no harm
and if toby got clear off bills pretty sure to be safe for bills worth two of toby any time and about what i was saying my dear observed the jew keeping his glistening eye steadily upon her
you must say it all over again if its anything you want me to do rejoined nancy and if it is you had better wait till tomorrow
you put me up for a minute but now im stupid again fagin put several other questions all with the same drift of ascertaining whether the girl had profited by his unguarded hints but she answered them so readily and was withal so utterly unmoved by his searching looks that his original impression of her being more than a trifle in liquor was confirmed
nancy indeed was not exempt from a failing which was very common among the jews female pupils and in which in their tenderer years they were rather encouraged than checked
her disordered appearance and a wholesale perfume of geneva which pervaded the apartment afforded strong confirmatory evidence of the justice of the jews supposition and when after indulging in the temporary display of violence above described she subsided first into dullness and afterwards into a compound of feelings under the influence of which she shed tears one minute and in the next gave utterance to various exclamations of never say die and divers calculations as to what might be the amount of the odds so long as a lady or gentleman was happy mr fagin who had had considerable experience of such matters in his time saw with great satisfaction that she was very far gone indeed
having eased his mind by this discovery and having accomplished his twofold object of imparting to the girl what he had that night heard and of ascertaining with his own eyes that sikes had not returned mr fagin again turned his face homeward leaving his young friend asleep with her head upon the table
it was within an hour of midnight
the weather being dark and piercing cold he had no great temptation to loiter
the sharp wind that scoured the streets seemed to have cleared them of passengers as of dust and mud for few people were abroad and they were to all appearance hastening fast home
it blew from the right quarter for the jew however and straight before it he went trembling and shivering as every fresh gust drove him rudely on his way
he had reached the corner of his own street and was already fumbling in his pocket for the doorkey when a dark figure emerged from a projecting entrance which lay in deep shadow and crossing the road glided up to him unperceived
fagin whispered a voice close to his ear
ah said the jew turning quickly round is that yes interrupted the stranger
i have been lingering here these two hours
where the devil have you been on your business my dear replied the jew glancing uneasily at his companion and slackening his pace as he spoke
on your business all night oh of course said the stranger with a sneer
well and whats come of it nothing good said the jew
nothing bad i hope said the stranger stopping short and turning a startled look on his companion
the jew shook his head and was about to reply when the stranger interrupting him motioned to the house before which they had by this time arrived remarking that he had better say what he had got to say under cover for his blood was chilled with standing about so long and the wind blew through him
fagin looked as if he could have willingly excused himself from taking home a visitor at that unseasonable hour and indeed muttered something about having no fire but his companion repeating his request in a peremptory manner he unlocked the door and requested him to close it softly while he got a light
its as dark as the grave said the man groping forward a few steps
make haste shut the door whispered fagin from the end of the passage
as he spoke it closed with a loud noise
that wasnt my doing said the other man feeling his way
the wind blew it to or it shut of its own accord one or the other
look sharp with the light or i shall knock my brains out against something in this confounded hole fagin stealthily descended the kitchen stairs
after a short absence he returned with a lighted candle and the intelligence that toby crackit was asleep in the back room below and that the boys were in the front one
beckoning the man to follow him he led the way upstairs
we can say the few words weve got to say in here my dear said the jew throwing open a door on the first floor and as there are holes in the shutters and we never show lights to our neighbours well set the candle on the stairs
there with those words the jew stooping down placed the candle on an upper flight of stairs exactly opposite to the room door
this done he led the way into the apartment which was destitute of all movables save a broken armchair and an old couch or sofa without covering which stood behind the door
upon this piece of furniture the stranger sat himself with the air of a weary man and the jew drawing up the armchair opposite they sat face to face
it was not quite dark the door was partially open and the candle outside threw a feeble reflection on the opposite wall
they conversed for some time in whispers
though nothing of the conversation was distinguishable beyond a few disjointed words here and there a listener might easily have perceived that fagin appeared to be defending himself against some remarks of the stranger and that the latter was in a state of considerable irritation
they might have been talking thus for a quarter of an hour or more when monksby which name the jew had designated the strange man several times in the course of their colloquysaid raising his voice a little i tell you again it was badly planned
why not have kept him here among the rest and made a sneaking snivelling pickpocket of him at once only hear him exclaimed the jew shrugging his shoulders
why do you mean to say you couldnt have done it if you had chosen demanded monks sternly
havent you done it with other boys scores of times
if you had had patience for a twelvemonth at most couldnt you have got him convicted and sent safely out of the kingdom perhaps for life whose turn would that have served my dear inquired the jew humbly
mine replied monks
but not mine said the jew submissively
he might have become of use to me
when there are two parties to a bargain it is only reasonable that the interests of both should be consulted is it my good friend what then demanded monks
i saw it was not easy to train him to the business replied the jew he was not like other boys in the same circumstances curse him no muttered the man or he would have been a thief long ago i had no hold upon him to make him worse pursued the jew anxiously watching the countenance of his companion
his hand was not in
i had nothing to frighten him with which we always must have in the beginning or we labour in vain
what could i do
send him out with the dodger and charley
we had enough of that at first my dear i trembled for us all that was not my doing observed monks
no no my dear renewed the jew
and i dont quarrel with it now because if it had never happened you might never have clapped eyes on the boy to notice him and so led to the discovery that it was him you were looking for
well
i got him back for you by means of the girl and then she begins to favour him throttle the girl said monks impatiently
why we cant afford to do that just now my dear replied the jew smiling and besides that sort of thing is not in our way or one of these days i might be glad to have it done
i know what these girls are monks well
as soon as the boy begins to harden shell care no more for him than for a block of wood
you want him made a thief
if he is alive i can make him one from this time and ifif said the jew drawing nearer to the otherits not likely mindbut if the worst comes to the worst and he is dead its no fault of mine if he is interposed the other man with a look of terror and clasping the jews arm with trembling hands
mind that
fagin
i had no hand in it
anything but his death i told you from the first
i wont shed blood its always found out and haunts a man besides
if they shot him dead i was not the cause do you hear me
fire this infernal den
whats that what cried the jew grasping the coward round the body with both arms as he sprung to his feet
where yonder replied the man glaring at the opposite wall
the shadow
i saw the shadow of a woman in a cloak and bonnet pass along the wainscot like a breath the jew released his hold and they rushed tumultuously from the room
the candle wasted by the draught was standing where it had been placed
it showed them only the empty staircase and their own white faces
they listened intently a profound silence reigned throughout the house
its your fancy said the jew taking up the light and turning to his companion
ill swear i saw it replied monks trembling
it was bending forward when i saw it first and when i spoke it darted away the jew glanced contemptuously at the pale face of his associate and telling him he could follow if he pleased ascended the stairs
they looked into all the rooms they were cold bare and empty
they descended into the passage and thence into the cellars below
the green damp hung upon the low walls the tracks of the snail and slug glistened in the light of the candle but all was still as death
what do you think now said the jew when they had regained the passage
besides ourselves theres not a creature in the house except toby and the boys and theyre safe enough
see here as a proof of the fact the jew drew forth two keys from his pocket and explained that when he first went downstairs he had locked them in to prevent any intrusion on the conference
this accumulated testimony effectually staggered mr monks
his protestations had gradually become less and less vehement as they proceeded in their search without making any discovery and now he gave vent to several very grim laughs and confessed it could only have been his excited imagination
he declined any renewal of the conversation however for that night suddenly remembering that it was past one oclock
and so the amiable couple parted
most unceremoniously as it would be by no means seemly in a humble author to keep so mighty a personage as a beadle waiting with his back to the fire and the skirts of his coat gathered up under his arms until such time as it might suit his pleasure to relieve him and as it would still less become his station or his gallantry to involve in the same neglect a lady on whom that beadle had looked with an eye of tenderness and affection and in whose ear he had whispered sweet words which coming from such a quarter might well thrill the bosom of maid or matron of whatsoever degree the historian whose pen traces these wordstrusting that he knows his place and that he entertains a becoming reverence for those upon earth to whom high and important authority is delegatedhastens to pay them that respect which their position demands and to treat them with all that duteous ceremony which their exalted rank and by consequence great virtues imperatively claim at his hands
towards this end indeed he had purposed to introduce in this place a dissertation touching the divine right of beadles and elucidative of the position that a beadle can do no wrong which could not fail to have been both pleasurable and profitable to the rightminded reader but which he is unfortunately compelled by want of time and space to postpone to some more convenient and fitting opportunity on the arrival of which he will be prepared to show that a beadle properly constituted that is to say a parochial beadle attached to a parochial workhouse and attending in his official capacity the parochial church is in right and virtue of his office possessed of all the excellences and best qualities of humanity and that to none of those excellences can mere companies beadles or courtoflaw beadles or even chapelofease beadles save the last and they in a very lowly and inferior degree lay the remotest sustainable claim
mr bumble had recounted the teaspoons reweighed the sugartongs made a closer inspection of the milkpot and ascertained to a nicety the exact condition of the furniture down to the very horsehair seats of the chairs and had repeated each process full half a dozen times before he began to think that it was time for mrs corney to return
thinking begets thinking as there were no sounds of mrs corneys approach it occured to mr bumble that it would be an innocent and virtuous way of spending the time if he were further to allay his curiousity by a cursory glance at the interior of mrs corneys chest of drawers
having listened at the keyhole to assure himself that nobody was approaching the chamber mr bumble beginning at the bottom proceeded to make himself acquainted with the contents of the three long drawers which being filled with various garments of good fashion and texture carefully preserved between two layers of old newspapers speckled with dried lavender seemed to yield him exceeding satisfaction
arriving in course of time at the righthand corner drawer in which was the key and beholding therein a small padlocked box which being shaken gave forth a pleasant sound as of the chinking of coin mr bumble returned with a stately walk to the fireplace and resuming his old attitude said with a grave and determined air ill do it he followed up this remarkable declaration by shaking his head in a waggish manner for ten minutes as though he were remonstrating with himself for being such a pleasant dog and then he took a view of his legs in profile with much seeming pleasure and interest
he was still placidly engaged in this latter survey when mrs corney hurrying into the room threw herself in a breathless state on a chair by the fireside and covering her eyes with one hand placed the other over her heart and gasped for breath
mrs
corney said mr bumble stooping over the matron what is this maam
has anything happened maam
pray answer me im onon mr bumble in his alarm could not immediately think of the word tenterhooks so he said broken bottles oh mr bumble cried the lady i have been so dreadfully put out put out maam exclaimed mr bumble who has dared to
i know said mr bumble checking himself with native majesty this is them wicious paupers its dreadful to think of said the lady shuddering
then dont think of it maam rejoined mr bumble
i cant help it whimpered the lady
then take something maam said mr bumble soothingly
a little of the wine not for the world replied mrs corney
i couldntoh
the top shelf in the righthand corneroh uttering these words the good lady pointed distractedly to the cupboard and underwent a convulsion from internal spasms
mr bumble rushed to the closet and snatching a pint greenglass bottle from the shelf thus incoherently indicated filled a teacup with its contents and held it to the ladys lips
im better now said mrs corney falling back after drinking half of it
mr bumble raised his eyes piously to the ceiling in thankfulness and bringing them down again to the brim of the cup lifted it to his nose
peppermint exclaimed mrs corney in a faint voice smiling gently on the beadle as she spoke
try it
theres a littlea little something else in it mr bumble tasted the medicine with a doubtful look smacked his lips took another taste and put the cup down empty
its very comforting said mrs corney
very much so indeed maam said the beadle
as he spoke he drew a chair beside the matron and tenderly inquired what had happened to distress her
nothing replied mrs corney
i am a foolish excitable weak creetur not weak maam retorted mr bumble drawing his chair a little closer
are you a weak creetur mrs corney we are all weak creeturs said mrs corney laying down a general principle
so we are said the beadle
nothing was said on either side for a minute or two afterwards
by the expiration of that time mr bumble had illustrated the position by removing his left arm from the back of mrs corneys chair where it had previously rested to mrs corneys apronstring round which it gradually became entwined
we are all weak creeturs said mr bumble
mrs corney sighed
dont sigh mrs corney said mr bumble
i cant help it said mrs corney
and she sighed again
this is a very comfortable room maam said mr bumble looking round
another room and this maam would be a complete thing it would be too much for one murmured the lady
but not for two maam rejoined mr bumble in soft accents
eh mrs corney mrs corney drooped her head when the beadle said this the beadle drooped his to get a view of mrs corneys face
mrs corney with great propriety turned her head away and released her hand to get at her pockethandkerchief but insensibly replaced it in that of mr bumble
the board allows you coals dont they mrs corney inquired the beadle affectionately pressing her hand
and candles replied mrs corney slightly returning the pressure
coals candles and houserent free said mr bumble
oh mrs corney what an angel you are the lady was not proof against this burst of feeling
she sank into mr bumbles arms and that gentleman in his agitation imprinted a passionate kiss upon her chaste nose
such porochial perfection exclaimed mr bumble rapturously
you know that mr slout is worse tonight my fascinator yes replied mrs corney bashfully
he cant live a week the doctor says pursued mr bumble
he is the master of this establishment his death will cause a wacancy that wacancy must be filled up
oh mrs corney what a prospect this opens
what a opportunity for a jining of hearts and housekeepings mrs corney sobbed
the little word said mr bumble bending over the bashful beauty
the one little little little word my blessed corney yeyeyes sighed out the matron
one more pursued the beadle compose your darling feelings for only one more
when is it to come off mrs corney twice essayed to speak and twice failed
at length summoning up courage she threw her arms around mr bumbles neck and said it might be as soon as ever he pleased and that he was a irresistible duck matters being thus amicably and satisfactorily arranged the contract was solemnly ratified in another teacupful of the peppermint mixture which was rendered the more necessary by the flutter and agitation of the ladys spirits
while it was being disposed of she acquainted mr bumble with the old womans decease
very good said that gentleman sipping his peppermint ill call at sowerberrys as i go home and tell him to send tomorrow morning
was it that as frightened you love it wasnt anything particular dear said the lady evasively
it must have been something love urged mr bumble
wont you tell your own b not now rejoined the lady one of these days
after were married dear after were married exclaimed mr bumble
it wasnt any impudence from any of them male paupers as no no love interposed the lady hastily
if i thought it was continued mr bumble if i thought as any one of em had dared to lift his wulgar eyes to that lovely countenance they wouldnt have dared to do it love responded the lady
they had better not said mr bumble clenching his fist
let me see any man porochial or extraporochial as would presume to do it and i can tell him that he wouldnt do it a second time unembellished by any violence of gesticulation this might have seemed no very high compliment to the ladys charms but as mr bumble accompanied the threat with many warlike gestures she was much touched with this proof of his devotion and protested with great admiration that he was indeed a dove
the dove then turned up his coatcollar and put on his cocked hat and having exchanged a long and affectionate embrace with his future partner once again braved the cold wind of the night merely pausing for a few minutes in the male paupers ward to abuse them a little with the view of satisfying himself that he could fill the office of workhousemaster with needful acerbity
assured of his qualifications mr bumble left the building with a light heart and bright visions of his future promotion which served to occupy his mind until he reached the shop of the undertaker
now mr and mrs sowerberry having gone out to tea and supper and noah claypole not being at any time disposed to take upon himself a greater amount of physical exertion than is necessary to a convenient performance of the two functions of eating and drinking the shop was not closed although it was past the usual hour of shuttingup
mr bumble tapped with his cane on the counter several times but attracting no attention and beholding a light shining through the glasswindow of the little parlour at the back of the shop he made bold to peep in and see what was going forward and when he saw what was going forward he was not a little surprised
the cloth was laid for supper the table was covered with bread and butter plates and glasses a porterpot and a winebottle
at the upper end of the table mr noah claypole lolled negligently in an easychair with his legs thrown over one of the arms an open claspknife in one hand and a mass of buttered bread in the other
close beside him stood charlotte opening oysters from a barrel which mr claypole condescended to swallow with remarkable avidity
a more than ordinary redness in the region of the young gentlemans nose and a kind of fixed wink in his right eye denoted that he was in a slight degree intoxicated these symptoms were confirmed by the intense relish with which he took his oysters for which nothing but a strong appreciation of their cooling properties in cases of internal fever could have sufficiently accounted
heres a delicious fat one noah dear said charlotte try him do only this one what a delicious thing is a oyster remarked mr claypole after he had swallowed it
what a pity it is a number of em should ever make you feel uncomfortable isnt it charlotte its quite a cruelty said charlotte
so it is acquiesced mr claypole
ant yer fond of oysters not overmuch replied charlotte
i like to see you eat em noah dear better than eating em myself lor said noah reflectively how queer have another said charlotte
heres one with such a beautiful delicate beard i cant manage any more said noah
im very sorry
come here charlotte and ill kiss yer what said mr bumble bursting into the room
say that again sir charlotte uttered a scream and hid her face in her apron
mr claypole without making any further change in his position than suffering his legs to reach the ground gazed at the beadle in drunken terror
say it again you wile owdacious fellow said mr bumble
how dare you mention such a thing sir
and how dare you encourage him you insolent minx

faugh i didnt mean to do it said noah blubbering
shes always akissing of me whether i like it or not oh noah cried charlotte reproachfully
yer are yer know yer are retorted noah
shes always adoin of it mr bumble sir she chucks me under the chin please sir and makes all manner of love silence cried mr bumble sternly
take yourself downstairs maam
noah you shut up the shop say another word till your master comes home at your peril and when he does come home tell him that mr bumble said he was to send a old womans shell after breakfast tomorrow morning
do you hear sir
kissing cried mr bumble holding up his hands
the sin and wickedness of the lower orders in this porochial district is frightful
if parliament dont take their abominable courses under consideration this countrys ruined and the character of the peasantry gone for ever with these words the beadle strode with a lofty and gloomy air from the undertakers premises
and now that we have accompanied him so far on his road home and have made all necessary preparations for the old womans funeral let us set on foot a few inquires after young oliver twist and ascertain whether he be still lying in the ditch where toby crackit left him
looks after oliver and proceeds with his adventures wolves tear your throats muttered sikes grinding his teeth
i wish i was among some of you youd howl the hoarser for it as sikes growled forth this imprecation with the most desperate ferocity that his desperate nature was capable of he rested the body of the wounded boy across his bended knee and turned his head for an instant to look back at his pursuers
there was little to be made out in the mist and darkness but the loud shouting of men vibrated through the air and the barking of the neighbouring dogs roused by the sound of the alarm bell resounded in every direction
stop you whitelivered hound cried the robber shouting after toby crackit who making the best use of his long legs was already ahead
stop the repetition of the word brought toby to a dead standstill
for he was not quite satisfied that he was beyond the range of pistolshot and sikes was in no mood to be played with
bear a hand with the boy cried sikes beckoning furiously to his confederate
come back toby made a show of returning but ventured in a low voice broken for want of breath to intimate considerable reluctance as he came slowly along
quicker cried sikes laying the boy in a dry ditch at his feet and drawing a pistol from his pocket
dont play booty with me at this moment the noise grew louder
sikes again looking round could discern that the men who had given chase were already climbing the gate of the field in which he stood and that a couple of dogs were some paces in advance of them
its all up bill cried toby drop the kid and show em your heels with this parting advice mr crackit preferring the chance of being shot by his friend to the certainty of being taken by his enemies fairly turned tail and darted off at full speed
sikes clenched his teeth took one look around threw over the prostrate form of oliver the cape in which he had been hurriedly muffled ran along the front of the hedge as if to distract the attention of those behind from the spot where the boy lay paused for a second before another hedge which met it at right angles and whirling his pistol high into the air cleared it at a bound and was gone
ho ho there cried a tremulous voice in the rear
pincher
neptune
come here come here the dogs who in common with their masters seemed to have no particular relish for the sport in which they were engaged readily answered to the command
three men who had by this time advanced some distance into the field stopped to take counsel together
my advice or leastways i should say my orders is said the fattest man of the party that we mediately go home again i am agreeable to anything which is agreeable to mr giles said a shorter man who was by no means of a slim figure and who was very pale in the face and very polite as frightened men frequently are
i shouldnt wish to appear illmannered gentlemen said the third who had called the dogs back mr
giles ought to know certainly replied the shorter man and whatever mr giles says it isnt our place to contradict him
no no i know my sitiwation
thank my stars i know my sitiwation to tell the truth the little man did seem to know his situation and to know perfectly well that it was by no means a desirable one for his teeth chattered in his head as he spoke
you are afraid brittles said mr giles
i ant said brittles
you are said giles
youre a falsehood mr giles said brittles
youre a lie brittles said mr giles
now these four retorts arose from mr giless taunt and mr giless taunt had arisen from his indignation at having the responsibility of going home again imposed upon himself under cover of a compliment
the third man brought the dispute to a close most philosophically
ill tell you what it is gentlemen said he were all afraid speak for yourself sir said mr giles who was the palest of the party
so i do replied the man
its natural and proper to be afraid under such circumstances
i am so am i said brittles only theres no call to tell a man he is so bounceably these frank admissions softened mr giles who at once owned that he was afraid upon which they all three faced about and ran back again with the completest unanimity until mr giles who had the shortest wind of the party as was encumbered with a pitchfork most handsomely insisted on stopping to make an apology for his hastiness of speech
but its wonderful said mr giles when he had explained what a man will do when his blood is up
i should have committed murderi know i shouldif wed caught one of them rascals as the other two were impressed with a similar presentiment and as their blood like his had all gone down again some speculation ensued upon the cause of this sudden change in their temperament
i know what it was said mr giles it was the gate i shouldnt wonder if it was exclaimed brittles catching at the idea
you may depend upon it said giles that that gate stopped the flow of the excitement
i felt all mine suddenly going away as i was climbing over it by a remarkable coincidence the other two had been visited with the same unpleasant sensation at that precise moment
it was quite obvious therefore that it was the gate especially as there was no doubt regarding the time at which the change had taken place because all three remembered that they had come in sight of the robbers at the instant of its occurance
this dialogue was held between the two men who had surprised the burglars and a travelling tinker who had been sleeping in an outhouse and who had been roused together with his two mongrel curs to join in the pursuit
mr giles acted in the double capacity of butler and steward to the old lady of the mansion brittles was a lad of allwork who having entered her service a mere child was treated as a promising young boy still though he was something past thirty
encouraging each other with such converse as this but keeping very close together notwithstanding and looking apprehensively round whenever a fresh gust rattled through the boughs the three men hurried back to a tree behind which they had left their lantern lest its light should inform the thieves in what direction to fire
catching up the light they made the best of their way home at a good round trot and long after their dusky forms had ceased to be discernible the light might have been seen twinkling and dancing in the distance like some exhalation of the damp and gloomy atmosphere through which it was swiftly borne
the air grew colder as day came slowly on and the mist rolled along the ground like a dense cloud of smoke
the grass was wet the pathways and low places were all mire and water the damp breath of an unwholesome wind went languidly by with a hollow moaning
still oliver lay motionless and insensible on the spot where sikes had left him
morning drew on apace
the air become more sharp and piercing as its first dull huethe death of night rather than the birth of dayglimmered faintly in the sky
the objects which had looked dim and terrible in the darkness grew more and more defined and gradually resolved into their familiar shapes
the rain came down thick and fast and pattered noisily among the leafless bushes
but oliver felt it not as it beat against him for he still lay stretched helpless and unconscious on his bed of clay
at length a low cry of pain broke the stillness that prevailed and uttering it the boy awoke
his left arm rudely bandaged in a shawl hung heavy and useless at his side the bandage was saturated with blood
he was so weak that he could scarcely raise himself into a sitting posture when he had done so he looked feebly round for help and groaned with pain
trembling in every joint from cold and exhaustion he made an effort to stand upright but shuddering from head to foot fell prostrate on the ground
after a short return of the stupor in which he had been so long plunged oliver urged by a creeping sickness at his heart which seemed to warn him that if he lay there he must surely die got upon his feet and essayed to walk
his head was dizzy and he staggered to and fro like a drunken man
but he kept up nevertheless and with his head drooping languidly on his breast went stumbling onward he knew not whither
and now hosts of bewildering and confused ideas came crowding on his mind
he seemed to be still walking between sikes and crackit who were angrily disputingfor the very words they said sounded in his ears and when he caught his own attention as it were by making some violent effort to save himself from falling he found that he was talking to them
then he was alone with sikes plodding on as on the previous day and as shadowy people passed them he felt the robbers grasp upon his wrist
suddenly he started back at the report of firearms there rose into the air loud cries and shouts lights gleamed before his eyes all was noise and tumult as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away
through all these rapid visions there ran an undefined uneasy consciousness of pain which wearied and tormented him incessantly
thus he staggered on creeping almost mechanically between the bars of gates or through hedgegaps as they came in his way until he reached a road
here the rain began to fall so heavily that it roused him
he looked about and saw that at no great distance there was a house which perhaps he could reach
pitying his condition they might have compassion on him and if they did not it would be better he thought to die near human beings than in the lonely open fields
he summoned up all his strength for one last trial and bent his faltering steps towards it
as he drew nearer to this house a feeling come over him that he had seen it before
he remembered nothing of its details but the shape and aspect of the building seemed familiar to him
that garden wall
on the grass inside he had fallen on his knees last night and prayed the two mens mercy
it was the very house they had attempted to rob
oliver felt such fear come over him when he recognised the place that for the instant he forgot the agony of his wound and thought only of flight
flight
he could scarcely stand and if he were in full possession of all the best powers of his slight and youthful frame whither could he fly
he pushed against the gardengate it was unlocked and swung open on its hinges
he tottered across the lawn climbed the steps knocked faintly at the door and his whole strength failing him sunk down against one of the pillars of the little portico
it happened that about this time mr giles brittles and the tinker were recruiting themselves after the fatigues and terrors of the night with tea and sundries in the kitchen
not that it was mr giless habit to admit to too great familiarity the humbler servants towards whom it was rather his wont to deport himself with a lofty affability which while it gratified could not fail to remind them of his superior position in society
but death fires and burglary make all men equals so mr giles sat with his legs stretched out before the kitchen fender leaning his left arm on the table while with his right he illustrated a circumstantial and minute account of the robbery to which his bearers but especially the cook and housemaid who were of the party listened with breathless interest
it was about halfpast two said mr giles or i wouldnt swear that it mightnt have been a little nearer three when i woke up and turning round in my bed as it might be so here mr giles turned round in his chair and pulled the corner of the tablecloth over him to imitate bedclothes i fancied i heerd a noise at this point of the narrative the cook turned pale and asked the housemaid to shut the door who asked brittles who asked the tinker who pretended not to hear
heerd a noise continued mr giles
i says at first this is illusion and was composing myself off to sleep when i heerd the noise again distinct what sort of a noise asked the cook
a kind of a busting noise replied mr giles looking round him
more like the noise of powdering a iron bar on a nutmeggrater suggested brittles
it was when you heerd it sir rejoined mr giles but at this time it had a busting sound
i turned down the clothes continued giles rolling back the tablecloth sat up in bed and listened the cook and housemaid simultaneously ejaculated lor and drew their chairs closer together
i heerd it now quite apparent resumed mr giles
somebody i says is forcing of a door or window whats to be done
ill call up that poor lad brittles and save him from being murdered in his bed or his throat i says may be cut from his right ear to his left without his ever knowing it here all eyes were turned upon brittles who fixed his upon the speaker and stared at him with his mouth wide open and his face expressive of the most unmitigated horror
i tossed off the clothes said giles throwing away the tablecloth and looking very hard at the cook and housemaid got softly out of bed drew on a pair of ladies present mr giles murmured the tinker
of shoes sir said giles turning upon him and laying great emphasis on the word seized the loaded pistol that always goes upstairs with the platebasket and walked on tiptoes to his room
brittles i says when i had woke him dont be frightened so you did observed brittles in a low voice
were dead men i think brittles i says continued giles but dont be frightened was he frightened asked the cook
not a bit of it replied mr giles
he was as firmah
pretty near as firm as i was i should have died at once im sure if it had been me observed the housemaid
youre a woman retorted brittles plucking up a little
brittles is right said mr giles nodding his head approvingly from a woman nothing else was to be expected
we being men took a dark lantern that was standing on brittles hob and groped our way downstairs in the pitch darkas it might be so mr giles had risen from his seat and taken two steps with his eyes shut to accompany his description with appropriate action when he started violently in common with the rest of the company and hurried back to his chair
the cook and housemaid screamed
it was a knock said mr giles assuming perfect serenity
open the door somebody nobody moved
it seems a strange sort of a thing a knock coming at such a time in the morning said mr giles surveying the pale faces which surrounded him and looking very blank himself but the door must be opened
do you hear somebody mr giles as he spoke looked at brittles but that young man being naturally modest probably considered himself nobody and so held that the inquiry could not have any application to him at all events he tendered no reply
mr giles directed an appealing glance at the tinker but he had suddenly fallen asleep
the women were out of the question
if brittles would rather open the door in the presence of witnesses said mr giles after a short silence i am ready to make one so am i said the tinker waking up as suddenly as he had fallen asleep
brittles capitulated on these terms and the party being somewhat reassured by the discovery made on throwing open the shutters that it was now broad day took their way upstairs with the dogs in front
the two women who were afraid to stay below brought up the rear
by the advice of mr giles they all talked very loud to warn any evildisposed person outside that they were strong in numbers and by a masterstoke of policy originating in the brain of the same ingenious gentleman the dogs tails were well pinched in the hall to make them bark savagely
these precautions having been taken mr giles held on fast by the tinkers arm to prevent his running away as he pleasantly said and gave the word of command to open the door
brittles obeyed the group peeping timorously over each others shoulders beheld no more formidable object than poor little oliver twist speechless and exhausted who raised his heavy eyes and mutely solicited their compassion
a boy exclaimed mr giles valiantly pushing the tinker into the background
whats the matter with theehwhybrittleslook heredont you know brittles who had got behind the door to open it no sooner saw oliver than he uttered a loud cry
mr giles seizing the boy by one leg and one arm fortunately not the broken limb lugged him straight into the hall and deposited him at full length on the floor thereof
here he is bawled giles calling in a state of great excitement up the staircase heres one of the thieves maam
heres a thief miss
wounded miss
i shot him miss and brittles held the light in a lantern miss cried brittles applying one hand to the side of his mouth so that his voice might travel the better
the two womenservants ran upstairs to carry the intelligence that mr giles had captured a robber and the tinker busied himself in endeavouring to restore oliver lest he should die before he could be hanged
in the midst of all this noise and commotion there was heard a sweet female voice which quelled it in an instant
giles whispered the voice from the stairhead
im here miss replied mr giles
dont be frightened miss i aint much injured
he didnt make a very desperate resistance miss
i was soon too many for him hush replied the young lady you frighten my aunt as much as the thieves did
is the poor creature much hurt wounded desperate miss replied giles with indescribable complacency
he looks as if he was agoing miss bawled brittles in the same manner as before
wouldnt you like to come and look at him miss in case he should hush pray theres a good man rejoined the lady
wait quietly only one instant while i speak to aunt with a footstep as soft and gentle as the voice the speaker tripped away
she soon returned with the direction that the wounded person was to be carried carefully upstairs to mr giless room and that brittles was to saddle the pony and betake himself instantly to chertsey from which place he was to despatch with all speed a constable and doctor
but wont you take one look at him first miss asked mr giles with as much pride as if oliver were some bird of rare plumage that he had skilfully brought down
not one little peep miss not now for the world replied the young lady
poor fellow
oh
treat him kindly giles for my sake the old servant looked up at the speaker as she turned away with a glance as proud and admiring as if she had been his own child
then bending over oliver he helped to carry him upstairs with the care and solicitude of a woman
has an introductory account of the inmates of the house to which oliver resorted in a handsome room though its furniture had rather the air of oldfashioned comfort than of modern elegance there sat two ladies at a wellspread breakfasttable
mr giles dressed with scrupulous care in a full suit of black was in attendance upon them
he had taken his station some halfway between the sideboard and the breakfasttable and with his body drawn up to its full height his head thrown back and inclined the merest trifle on one side his left leg advanced and his right hand thrust into his waistcoat while his left hung down by his side grasping a waiter looked like one who laboured under a very agreeable sense of his own merits and importance
of the two ladies one was well advanced in years but the highbacked oaken chair in which she sat was not more upright than she
dressed with the utmost nicety and precision in a quaint mixture of bygone costume with some slight concessions to the prevailing taste which rather served to point the old style pleasantly than to impair its effect she sat in a stately manner with her hands folded on the table before her
her eyes and age had dimmed but little of their brightness were attentively upon her young companion
the younger lady was in the lovely bloom and springtime of womanhood at that age when if ever angels be for gods good purposes enthroned in mortal forms they may be without impiety supposed to abide in such as hers
she was not past seventeen
cast in so slight and exquisite a mould so mild and gentle so pure and beautiful that earth seemed not her element nor its rough creatures her fit companions
the very intelligence that shone in her deep blue eye and was stamped upon her noble head seemed scarcely of her age or of the world and yet the changing expression of sweetness and good humour the thousand lights that played about the face and left no shadow there above all the smile the cheerful happy smile were made for home and fireside peace and happiness
she was busily engaged in the little offices of the table
chancing to raise her eyes as the elder lady was regarding her she playfully put back her hair which was simply braided on her forehead and threw into her beaming look such an expression of affection and artless loveliness that blessed spirits might have smiled to look upon her
and brittles has been gone upwards of an hour has he asked the old lady after a pause
an hour and twelve minutes maam replied mr giles referring to a silver watch which he drew forth by a black ribbon
he is always slow remarked the old lady
brittles always was a slow boy maam replied the attendant
and seeing by the bye that brittles had been a slow boy for upwards of thirty years there appeared no great probability of his ever being a fast one
he gets worse instead of better i think said the elder lady
it is very inexcusable in him if he stops to play with any other boys said the young lady smiling
mr giles was apparently considering the propriety of indulging in a respectful smile himself when a gig drove up to the gardengate out of which there jumped a fat gentleman who ran straight up to the door and who getting quickly into the house by some mysterious process burst into the room and nearly overturned mr giles and the breakfasttable together
i never heard of such a thing exclaimed the fat gentleman
my dear mrs mayliebless my soulin the silence of the night tooi never heard of such a thing with these expressions of condolence the fat gentleman shook hands with both ladies and drawing up a chair inquired how they found themselves
you ought to be dead positively dead with the fright said the fat gentleman
why didnt you send
bless me my man should have come in a minute and so would i and my assistant would have been delighted or anybody im sure under such circumstances
dear dear
so unexpected
in the silence of the night too the doctor seemed especially troubled by the fact of the robbery having been unexpected and attempted in the nighttime as if it were the established custom of gentlemen in the housebreaking way to transact business at noon and to make an appointment by post a day or two previous
and you miss rose said the doctor turning to the young lady i oh
very much so indeed said rose interrupting him but there is a poor creature upstairs whom aunt wishes you to see ah
to be sure replied the doctor so there is
that was your handiwork giles i understand mr giles who had been feverishly putting the teacups to rights blushed very red and said that he had had that honour
honour eh said the doctor well i dont know perhaps its as honourable to hit a thief in a back kitchen as to hit your man at twelve paces
fancy that he fired in the air and youve fought a duel giles mr giles who thought this light treatment of the matter an unjust attempt at diminishing his glory answered respectfully that it was not for the like of him to judge about that but he rather thought it was no joke to the opposite party
gad thats true said the doctor
where is he
show me the way
ill look in again as i come down mrs maylie
thats the little window that he got in at eh
well i couldnt have believed it talking all the way he followed mr giles upstairs and while he is going upstairs the reader may be informed that mr losberne a surgeon in the neighbourhood known through a circuit of ten miles round as the doctor had grown fat more from goodhumour than from good living and was as kind and hearty and withal as eccentric an old bachelor as will be found in five times that space by any explorer alive
the doctor was absent much longer than either he or the ladies had anticipated
a large flat box was fetched out of the gig and a bedroom bell was rung very often and the servants ran up and down stairs perpetually from which tokens it was justly concluded that something important was going on above
at length he returned and in reply to an anxious inquiry after his patient looked very mysterious and closed the door carefully
this is a very extraordinary thing mrs maylie said the doctor standing with his back to the door as if to keep it shut
he is not in danger i hope said the old lady
why that would not be an extraordinary thing under the circumstances replied the doctor though i dont think he is
have you seen the thief no rejoined the old lady
nor heard anything about him no i beg your pardon maam interposed mr giles but i was going to tell you about him when doctor losberne came in the fact was that mr giles had not at first been able to bring his mind to the avowal that he had only shot a boy
such commendations had been bestowed upon his bravery that he could not for the life of him help postponing the explanation for a few delicious minutes during which he had flourished in the very zenith of a brief reputation for undaunted courage
rose wished to see the man said mrs maylie but i wouldnt hear of it humph rejoined the doctor
there is nothing very alarming in his appearance
have you any objection to see him in my presence if it be necessary replied the old lady certainly not then i think it is necessary said the doctor at all events i am quite sure that you would deeply regret not having done so if you postponed it
he is perfectly quiet and comfortable now
allow memiss rose will you permit me
not the slightest fear i pledge you my honour relates what olivers new visitors thought of him with many loquacious assurances that they would be agreeably surprised in the aspect of the criminal the doctor drew the young ladys arm through one of his and offering his disengaged hand to mrs maylie led them with much ceremony and stateliness upstairs
now said the doctor in a whisper as he softly turned the handle of a bedroomdoor let us hear what you think of him
he has not been shaved very recently but he dont look at all ferocious notwithstanding
stop though
let me first see that he is in visiting order stepping before them he looked into the room
motioning them to advance he closed the door when they had entered and gently drew back the curtains of the bed
upon it in lieu of the dogged blackvisaged ruffian they had expected to behold there lay a mere child worn with pain and exhaustion and sunk into a deep sleep
his wounded arm bound and splintered up was crossed upon his breast his head reclined upon the other arm which was half hidden by his long hair as it streamed over the pillow
the honest gentleman held the curtain in his hand and looked on for a minute or so in silence
whilst he was watching the patient thus the younger lady glided softly past and seating herself in a chair by the bedside gathered olivers hair from his face
as she stooped over him her tears fell upon his forehead
the boy stirred and smiled in his sleep as though these marks of pity and compassion had awakened some pleasant dream of a love and affection he had never known
thus a strain of gentle music or the rippling of water in a silent place or the odour of a flower or the mention of a familiar word will sometimes call up sudden dim remembrances of scenes that never were in this life which vanish like a breath which some brief memory of a happier existence long gone by would seem to have awakened which no voluntary exertion of the mind can ever recall
what can this mean exclaimed the elder lady
this poor child can never have been the pupil of robbers vice said the surgeon replacing the curtain takes up her abode in many temples and who can say that a fair outside shell not enshrine her but at so early an age urged rose
my dear young lady rejoined the surgeon mournfully shaking his head crime like death is not confined to the old and withered alone
the youngest and fairest are too often its chosen victims but can youoh
can you really believe that this delicate boy has been the voluntary associate of the worst outcasts of society said rose
the surgeon shook his head in a manner which intimated that he feared it was very possible and observing that they might disturb the patient led the way into an adjoining apartment
but even if he has been wicked pursued rose think how young he is think that he may never have known a mothers love or the comfort of a home that illusage and blows or the want of bread may have driven him to herd with men who have forced him to guilt
aunt dear aunt for mercys sake think of this before you let them drag this sick child to a prison which in any case must be the grave of all his chances of amendment
oh
as you love me and know that i have never felt the want of parents in your goodness and affection but that i might have done so and might have been equally helpless and unprotected with this poor child have pity upon him before it is too late my dear love said the elder lady as she folded the weeping girl to her bosom do you think i would harm a hair of his head oh no replied rose eagerly
no surely said the old lady my days are drawing to their close and may mercy be shown to me as i show it to others
what can i do to save him sir let me think maam said the doctor let me think mr losberne thrust his hands into his pockets and took several turns up and down the room often stopping and balancing himself on his toes and frowning frightfully
after various exclamations of ive got it now and no i havent and as many renewals of the walking and frowning he at length made a dead halt and spoke as follows i think if you give me a full and unlimited commission to bully giles and that little boy brittles i can manage it
giles is a faithful fellow and an old servant i know but you can make it up to him in a thousand ways and reward him for being such a good shot besides
you dont object to that unless there is some other way of preserving the child replied mrs maylie
there is no other said the doctor
no other take my word for it then my aunt invests you with full power said rose smiling through her tears but pray dont be harder upon the poor fellows than is indispensably necessary you seem to think retorted the doctor that everybody is disposed to be hardhearted today except yourself miss rose
i only hope for the sake of the rising male sex generally that you may be found in as vulnerable and softhearted a mood by the first eligible young fellow who appeals to your compassion and i wish i were a young fellow that i might avail myself on the spot of such a favourable opportunity for doing so as the present you are as great a boy as poor brittles himself returned rose blushing
well said the doctor laughing heartily that is no very difficult matter
but to return to this boy
the great point of our agreement is yet to come
he will wake in an hour or so i dare say and although i have told that thickheaded constablefellow downstairs that he musnt be moved or spoken to on peril of his life i think we may converse with him without danger
now i make this stipulationthat i shall examine him in your presence and that if from what he says we judge and i can show to the satisfaction of your cool reason that he is a real and thorough bad one which is more than possible he shall be left to his fate without any farther interference on my part at all events oh no aunt entreated rose
oh yes aunt said the doctor
is is a bargain he cannot be hardened in vice said rose it is impossible very good retorted the doctor then so much the more reason for acceding to my proposition finally the treaty was entered into and the parties thereunto sat down to wait with some impatience until oliver should awake
the patience of the two ladies was destined to undergo a longer trial than mr losberne had led them to expect for hour after hour passed on and still oliver slumbered heavily
it was evening indeed before the kindhearted doctor brought them the intelligence that he was at length sufficiently restored to be spoken to
the boy was very ill he said and weak from the loss of blood but his mind was so troubled with anxiety to disclose something that he deemed it better to give him the opportunity than to insist upon his remaining quiet until next morning which he should otherwise have done
the conference was a long one
oliver told them all his simple history and was often compelled to stop by pain and want of strength
it was a solemn thing to hear in the darkened room the feeble voice of the sick child recounting a weary catalogue of evils and calamities which hard men had brought upon him
oh
if when we oppress and grind our fellowcreatures we bestowed but one thought on the dark evidences of human error which like dense and heavy clouds are rising slowly it is true but not less surely to heaven to pour their aftervengeance on our heads if we heard but one instant in imagination the deep testimony of dead mens voices which no power can stifle and no pride shut out where would be the injury and injustice the suffering misery cruelty and wrong that each days life brings with it
olivers pillow was smoothed by gentle hands that night and loveliness and virtue watched him as he slept
he felt calm and happy and could have died without a murmur
the momentous interview was no sooner concluded and oliver composed to rest again than the doctor after wiping his eyes and condemning them for being weak all at once betook himself downstairs to open upon mr giles
and finding nobody about the parlours it occurred to him that he could perhaps originate the proceedings with better effect in the kitchen so into the kitchen he went
there were assembled in that lower house of the domestic parliament the womenservants mr brittles mr giles the tinker who had received a special invitation to regale himself for the remainder of the day in consideration of his services and the constable
the latter gentleman had a large staff a large head large features and large halfboots and he looked as if he had been taking a proportionate allowance of aleas indeed he had
the adventures of the previous night were still under discussion for mr giles was expatiating upon his presence of mind when the doctor entered mr brittles with a mug of ale in his hand was corroborating everything before his superior said it
sit still said the doctor waving his hand
thank you sir said mr giles
misses wished some ale to be given out sir and as i felt no ways inclined for my own little room sir and was disposed for company i am taking mine among em here brittles headed a low murmur by which the ladies and gentlemen generally were understood to express the gratification they derived from mr giless condescension
mr giles looked round with a patronising air as much as to say that so long as they behaved properly he would never desert them
how is the patient tonight sir asked giles
soso returned the doctor
i am afraid you have got yourself into a scrape there mr giles i hope you dont mean to say sir said mr giles trembling that hes going to die
if i thought it i should never be happy again
i wouldnt cut a boy off no not even brittles here not for all the plate in the county sir thats not the point said the doctor mysteriously
mr
giles are you a protestant yes sir i hope so faltered mr giles who had turned very pale
and what are you boy said the doctor turning sharply upon brittles
lord bless me sir replied brittles starting violently im the same as mr giles sir then tell me this said the doctor both of you both of you
are you going to take upon yourselves to swear that that boy upstairs is the boy that was put through the little window last night
out with it
come
we are prepared for you the doctor who was universally considered one of the besttempered creatures on earth made this demand in such a dreadful tone of anger that giles and brittles who were considerably muddled by ale and excitement stared at each other in a state of stupefaction
pay attention to the reply constable will you said the doctor shaking his forefinger with great solemnity of manner and tapping the bridge of his nose with it to bespeak the exercise of that worthys utmost acuteness
something may come of this before long the constable looked as wise as he could and took up his staff of office which had been reclining indolently in the chimneycorner
its a simple question of identity you will observe said the doctor
thats what it is sir replied the constable coughing with great violence for he had finished his ale in a hurry and some of it had gone the wrong way
heres the house broken into said the doctor and a couple of men catch one moments glimpse of a boy in the midst of gunpowder smoke and in all the distraction of alarm and darkness
heres a boy comes to that very same house next morning and because he happens to have his arm tied up these men lay violent hands upon himby doing which they place his life in great dangerand swear he is the thief
now the question is whether these men are justified by the fact if not in what situation do they place themselves the constable nodded profoundly
he said if that wasnt law he would be glad to know what was
i ask you again thundered the doctor are you on your solemn oaths able to identify that boy brittles looked doubtfully at mr giles mr giles looked doubtfully at brittles the constable put his hand behind his ear to catch the reply the two women and the tinker leaned forward to listen the doctor glanced keenly round when a ring was heard at the gate and at the same moment the sound of wheels
its the runners cried brittles to all appearance much relieved
the what exclaimed the doctor aghast in his turn
the bow street officers sir replied brittles taking up a candle me and mr giles sent for em this morning what cried the doctor
yes replied brittles i sent a message up by the coachman and i only wonder they werent here before sir you did did you
then confound yourslow coaches down here thats all said the doctor walking away
involves a critical position whos that inquired brittles opening the door a little way with the chain up and peeping out shading the candle with his hand
open the door replied a man outside its the officers from bow street as was sent to today much comforted by this assurance brittles opened the door to its full width and confronted a portly man in a greatcoat who walked in without saying anything more and wiped his shoes on the mat as coolly as if he lived there
just send somebody out to relieve my mate will you young man said the officer hes in the gig aminding the prad
have you got a coach us here that you could put it up in for five or ten minutes brittles replying in the affirmative and pointing out the building the portly man stepped back to the gardengate and helped his companion to put up the gig while brittles lighted them in a state of great admiration
this done they returned to the house and being shown into a parlour took off their greatcoats and hats and showed like what they were
the man who had knocked at the door was a stout personage of middle height aged about fifty with shiny black hair cropped pretty close halfwhiskers a round face and sharp eyes
the other was a redheaded bony man in topboots with a rather illfavoured countenance and a turnedup sinisterlooking nose
tell your governor that blathers and duff is here will you said the stouter man smoothing down his hair and laying a pair of handcuffs on the table
oh
goodevening master
can i have a word or two with you in private if you please this was addressed to mr losberne who now made his appearance that gentleman motioning brittles to retire brought in the two ladies and shut the door
this is the lady of the house said mr losberne motioning towards mrs maylie
mr blathers made a bow
being desired to sit down he put his hat on the floor and taking a chair motioned to duff to do the same
the latter gentleman who did not appear quite so much accustomed to good society or quite so much at his ease in itone of the twoseated himself after undergoing several muscular affections of the limbs and the head of his stick into his mouth with some embarrassment
now with regard to this here robbery master said blathers
what are the circumstances mr losberne who appeared desirous of gaining time recounted them at great length and with much circumlocution
messrs blathers and duff looked very knowing meanwhile and occasionally exchanged a nod
i cant say for certain till i see the work of course said blathers but my opinion at once isi dont mind committing myself to that extentthat this wasnt done by a yokel eh duff certainly not replied duff
and translating the word yokel for the benefit of the ladies i apprehend your meaning to be that this attempt was not made by a countryman said mr losberne with a smile
thats it master replied blathers
this is all about the robbery is it all replied the doctor
now what is this about this here boy that the servants are atalking on said blathers
nothing at all replied the doctor
one of the frightened servants chose to take it into his head that he had something to do with this attempt to break into the house but its nonsense sheer absurdity wery easy disposed of if it is remarked duff
what he says is quite correct observed blathers nodding his head in a confirmatory way and playing carelessly with the handcuffs as if they were a pair of castanets
who is the boy
what account does he give of himself
where did he come from
he didnt drop out of the clouds did he master of course not replied the doctor with a nervous glance at the two ladies
i know his whole history but we can talk about that presently
you would like first to see the place where the thieves made their attempt i suppose certainly rejoined mr blathers
we had better inspect the premises first and examine the servants afterwards
thats the usual way of doing business lights were then procured and messrs blathers and duff attended by the native constable brittles giles and everybody else in short went into the little room at the end of the passage and looked out at the window and afterwards went round by way of the lawn and looked in at the window and after that had a candle handed out to inspect the shutter with and after that a lantern to trace the footsteps with and after that a pitchfork to poke the bushes with
this done amidst the breathless interest of all beholders they came in again and mr giles and brittles were put through a melodramatic representation of their share in the previous nights adventures which they performed some six times over contradicting each other in not more than one important respect the first time and in not more than a dozen the last
this consummation being arrived at blathers and duff cleared the room and held a long council together compared with which for secrecy and solemnity a consultation of great doctors on the knottiest point in medicine would be mere childs play
meanwhile the doctor walked up and down the next room in a very uneasy state and mrs maylie and rose looked on with anxious faces
upon my word he said making a halt after a great number of very rapid turns i hardly know what to do surely said rose the poor childs story faithfully repeated to these men will be sufficient to exonerate him i doubt it my dear young lady said the doctor shaking his head
i dont think it would exonerate him either with them or with legal functionaries of a higher grade
what is he after all they would say
a runaway
judged by mere worldly considerations and probabilities his story is a very doubtful one you believe it surely interrupted rose
i believe it strange as it is and perhaps i may be an old fool for doing so rejoined the doctor but i dont think it is exactly the tale for a practical policeofficer nevertheless why not demanded rose
because my pretty crossexaminer replied the doctor because viewed with their eyes there are many ugly points about it he can only prove the parts that look ill and none of those that look well
confound the fellows they will have the why and the wherefore and will take nothing for granted
on his own showing you see he has been the companion of thieves for some time past he has been carried to a policeofficer on a charge of picking a gentlemans pocket he has been taken away forcibly from that gentlemans house to a place which he cannot describe or point out and of the situation of which he has not the remotest idea
he is brought down to chertsey by men who seem to have taken a violent fancy to him whether he will or no and is put through a window to rob a house and then just at the very moment when he is going to alarm the inmates and so do the very thing that would set him all to rights there rushes into the way a blundering dog of a halfbred butler and shoots him
as if on purpose to prevent his doing any good for himself
dont you see all this i see it of course replied rose smiling at the doctors impetuosity but still i do not see anything in it to criminate the poor child no replied the doctor of course not
bless the bright eyes of your sex
they never see whether for good or bad more than one side of any question and that is always the one which first presents itself to them having given vent to this result of experience the doctor put his hands into his pockets and walked up and down the room with even greater rapidity than before
the more i think of it said the doctor the more i see that it will occasion endless trouble and difficulty if we put these men in possession of the boys real story
i am certain it will not be believed and even if they can do nothing to him in the end still the dragging it forward and giving publicity to all the doubts that will be cast upon it must interfere materially with your benevolent plan of rescuing him from misery oh
what is to be done cried rose
dear dear
why did they send for these people why indeed exclaimed mrs maylie
i would not have had them here for the world all i know is said mr losberne at last sitting down with a kind of desperate calmness that we must try and carry it off with a bold face
the object is a good one and that must be our excuse
the boy has strong symptoms of fever upon him and is in no condition to be talked to any more thats one comfort
we must make the best of it and if bad be the best it is no fault of ours
come in well master said blathers entering the room followed by his colleague and making the door fast before he said any more
this warnt a putup thing and what the devils a putup thing demanded the doctor impatiently
we call it a putup robbery ladies said blathers turning to them as if he pitied their ignorance but had a contempt for the doctors when the servants is in it nobody suspected them in this case said mrs maylie
wery likely not maam replied blathers but they might have been in it for all that more likely on that wery account said duff
we find it was a town hand said blathers continuing his report for the style of work is firstrate wery pretty indeed it is remarked duff in an undertone
there was two of em in it continued blathers and they had a boy with em thats plain from the size of the window
thats all to be said at present
well see this lad that youve got upstairs at once if you please perhaps they will take something to drink first mrs maylie said the doctor his face brightening as if some new thought had occurred to him
oh
to be sure exclaimed rose eagerly
you shall have it immediately if you will why thank you miss said blathers drawing his coatsleeve across his mouth its dry work this sort of duty
anythink thats handy miss dont put yourself out of the way on our accounts what shall it be asked the doctor following the young lady to the sideboard
a little drop of spirits master if its all the same replied blathers
its a cold ride from london maam and i always find that spirits comes home warmer to the feelings this interesting communication was addressed to mrs maylie who received it very graciously
while it was being conveyed to her the doctor slipped out of the room
ah said mr blathers not holding his wineglass by the stem but grasping the bottom between the thumb and forefinger of his left hand and placing it in front of his chest i have seen a good many pieces of business like this in my time ladies that crack down in the back lane at edmonton blathers said mr duff assisting his colleagues memory
that was something in this way warnt it rejoined mr blathers that was done by conkey chickweed that was you always gave that to him replied duff
it was the family pet i tell you
conkey hadnt any more to do with it than i had get out retorted mr blathers i know better
do you mind that time when conkey was robbed of his money though
what a start that was
better than any novelbook i ever see what was that inquired rose anxious to encourage any symptoms of goodhumour in the unwelcome visitors
it was a robbery miss that hardly anybody would have been down upon said blathers
this here conkey chickweed conkey means nosey maam interposed duff
of course the lady knows that dont she demanded mr blathers
always interrupting you are partner
this here conkey chickweed miss kept a publichouse over battlebridge way and he had a cellar where a good many young lords went to see cockfighting and badgerdrawing and that and a wery intellectual manner the sports was conducted in for ive seen em offen
he warnt one of the family at that time and one night he was robbed of three hundred and twentyseven guineas in a canvas bag that was stole out of his bedroom in the dead of night by a tall man with a black patch over his eye who had concealed himself under the bed and after committing the robbery jumped slap out of window which was only a story high
he was wery quick about it
but conkey was quick too for he fired a blunderbuss arter him and roused the neighbourhood
they set up a hueandcry directly and when they came to look about em found that conkey had hit the robber for there was traces of blood all the way to some palings a good distance off and there they lost em
however he had made off with the blunt and consequently the name of mr chickweed licensed witler appeared in the gazette among the other bankrupts and all manner of benefits and subscriptions and i dont know what all was got up for the poor man who was in a wery low state of mind about his loss and went up and down the streets for three or four days a pulling his hair off in such a desperate manner that many people was afraid he might be going to make away with himself
one day he came up to the office all in a hurry and had a private interview with the magistrate who after a deal of talk rings the bell and orders jem spyers in jem was a active officer and tells him to go and assist mr chickweed in apprehending the man as robbed his house
i see him spyers said chickweed pass my house yesterday morning why didnt you up and collar him says spyers
i was so struck all of a heap that you might have fractured my skull with a toothpick says the poor man but were sure to have him for between ten and eleven oclock at night he passed again spyers no sooner heard this than he put some clean linen and a comb in his pocket in case he should have to stop a day or two and away he goes and sets himself down at one of the publichouse windows behind the little red curtain with his hat on all ready to bolt out at a moments notice
he was smoking his pipe here late at night when all of a sudden chickweed roars out here he is
stop thief
murder jem spyers dashes out and there he sees chickweed atearing down the street full cry
away goes spyers on goes chickweed round turns the people everybody roars out thieves and chickweed himself keeps on shouting all the time like mad
spyers loses sight of him a minute as he turns a corner shoots round sees a little crowd dives in which is the man dme says chickweed ive lost him again it was a remarkable occurrence but he warnt to be seen nowhere so they went back to the publichouse
next morning spyers took his old place and looked out from behind the curtain for a tall man with a black patch over his eye till his own two eyes ached again
at last he couldnt help shutting em to ease em a minute and the very moment he did so he hears chickweed aroaring out here he is off he starts once more with chickweed halfway down the street ahead of him and after twice as long a run as the yesterdays one the mans lost again
this was done once or twice more till onehalf the neighbours gave out that mr chickweed had been robbed by the devil who was playing tricks with him arterwards and the other half that poor mr chickweed had gone mad with grief what did jem spyers say inquired the doctor who had returned to the room shortly after the commencement of the story
jem spyers resumed the officer for a long time said nothing at all and listened to everything without seeming to which showed he understood his business
but one morning he walked into the bar and taking out his snuffbox says chickweed ive found out who done this here robbery have you said chickweed
oh my dear spyers only let me have wengeance and i shall die contented
oh my dear spyers where is the villain come said spyers offering him a pinch of snuff none of that gammon
you did it yourself so he had and a good bit of money he had made by it too and nobody would never have found it out if he hadnt been so precious anxious to keep up appearances said mr blathers putting down his wineglass and clinking the handcuffs together
very curious indeed observed the doctor
now if you please you can walk upstairs if you please sir returned mr blathers
closely following mr losberne the two officers ascended to olivers bedroom mr giles preceding the party with a lighted candle
oliver had been dozing but looked worse and was more feverish than he had appeared yet
being assisted by the doctor he managed to sit up in bed for a minute or so and looked at the strangers without at all understanding what was going forwardin fact without seeming to recollect where he was or what had been passing
this said mr losberne speaking softly but with great vehemence notwithstanding this is the lad who being accidently wounded by a springgun in some boyish trespass on mr whatd yecallhims grounds at the back here comes to the house for assistance this morning and is immediately laid hold of and maltreated by that ingenious gentleman with the candle in his hand who has placed his life in considerable danger as i can professionally certify messrs blathers and duff looked at mr giles as he was thus recommended to their notice
the bewildered butler gazed from them towards oliver and from oliver towards mr losberne with a most ludicrous mixture of fear and perplexity
you dont mean to deny that i suppose said the doctor laying oliver gently down again
it was all done for thefor the best sir answered giles
i am sure i thought it was the boy or i wouldnt have meddled with him
i am not of an inhuman disposition sir thought it was what boy inquired the senior officer
the housebreakers boy sir replied giles
theythey certainly had a boy well
do you think so now inquired blathers
think what now replied giles looking vacantly at his questioner
think its the same boy stupidhead rejoined blathers impatiently
i dont know i really dont know said giles with a rueful countenance
i couldnt swear to him what do you think asked mr blathers
i dont know what to think replied poor giles
i dont think it is the boy indeed im almost certain that it isnt
you know it cant be has this man been adrinking sir inquired blathers turning to the doctor
what a precious muddleheaded chap you are said duff addressing mr giles with supreme contempt
mr losberne had been feeling the patients pulse during this short dialogue but he now rose from the chair by the bedside and remarked that if the officers had any doubts upon the subject they would perhaps like to step into the next room and have brittles before them
acting upon this suggestion they adjourned to a neighbouring apartment where mr brittles being called in involved himself and his respected superior in such a wonderful maze of fresh contradictions and impossibilities as tended to throw no particular light on anything but the fact of his own strong mystification except indeed his declarations that he shouldnt know the real boy if he were put before him that instant that he had only taken oliver to be he because mr giles had said he was and that mr giles had five minutes previously admitted in the kitchen that he began to be very much afraid he had been a little too hasty
among other ingenious surmises the question was then raised whether mr giles had really hit anybody and upon examination of the fellow pistol to that which he had fired it turned out to have no more destructive loading than gunpowder and brown paper a discovery which made a considerable impression on everybody but the doctor who had drawn the ball about ten minutes before
upon no one however did it make a greater impression than on mr giles himself who after labouring for some hours under the fear of having mortally wounded a fellowcreature eagerly caught at this new idea and favoured it to the utmost
finally the officers without troubling themselves very much about oliver left the chertsey constable in the house and took up their rest for that night in the town promising to return the next morning
with the next morning there came a rumour that two men and a boy were in the cage at kingston who had been apprehended over night under suspicious circumstances and to kingston messrs blathers and duff journeyed accordingly
the suspicious circumstances however resolving themselves on investigation into the one fact that they had been discovered sleeping under a haystack which although a great crime is only punishable by imprisonment and is in the merciful eye of the english law and its comprehensive love of all the kings subjects held to be no satisfactory proof in the absence of all other evidence that the sleeper or sleepers have committed burglary accompanied with violence and have therefore rendered themselves liable to the punishment of death messrs blathers and duff came back again as wise as they went
in short after some more examination and a great deal more conversation a neighbouring magistrate was readily induced to take the joint bail of mrs maylie and mr losberne for olivers appearance if he should ever be called upon and blathers and duff being rewarded with a couple of guineas returned to town with divided opinions on the subject of their expedition the latter gentleman on a mature consideration of all the circumstances inclining to the belief that the burglarious attempt had originated with the family pet and the former being equally disposed to concede the full merit of it to the great mr conkey chickweed
meanwhile oliver gradually throve and prospered under the united care of mrs maylie rose and the kindhearted mr losberne
if fervent prayers gushing from hearts overcharged with gratitude be heard in heavenand if they be not what prayers arethe blessings which the orphan child called down upon them sunk into their souls diffusing peace and happiness
of the happy life oliver began to lead with his kind friends olivers ailings were neither slight nor few
in addition to the pain and delay attendant on a broken limb his exposure to the wet and cold had brought on fever and ague which hung about him for many weeks and reduced him sadly
but at length he began by slow degrees to get better and to be able to say sometimes in a few tearful words how deeply he felt the goodness of the two sweet ladies and how ardently he hoped that when he grew strong and well again he could do something to show his gratitude only something which would let them see the love and duty with which his breast was full something however slight which would prove to them that their gentle kindness had not been cast away but that the poor boy whom their charity had rescued from misery or death was eager to serve them with his whole heart and soul
poor fellow said rose when oliver had been one day feebly endeavouring to utter the words of thankfulness that rose to his pale lips you shall have many opportunities of serving us if you will
we are going into the country and my aunt intends that you shall accompany us
the quiet place the pure air and all the pleasure and beauties of spring will restore you in a few days
we will employ you in a hundred ways when you can bear the trouble the trouble cried oliver
oh
dear lady if i could but work for you if i could only give you pleasure by watering your flowers or watching your birds or running up and down the whole day long to make you happy what would i give to do it you shall give nothing at all said miss maylie smiling for as i told you before we shall employ you in a hundred ways and if you only take half the trouble to please us that you promise now you will make me very happy indeed happy maam cried oliver how kind of you to say so you will make me happier than i can tell you replied the young lady
to think that my dear good aunt should have been the means of rescuing any one from such sad misery as you have described to us would be an unspeakable pleasure to me but to know that the object of her goodness and compassion was sincerely grateful and attached in consequence would delight me more than you can well imagine
do you understand me she inquired watching olivers thoughtful face
oh yes maam yes replied oliver eagerly but i was thinking that i am ungrateful now to whom inquired the young lady
to the kind gentleman and the dear old nurse who took so much care of me before rejoined oliver
if they knew how happy i am they would be pleased i am sure i am sure they would rejoined olivers benefactress and mr losberne has already been kind enough to promise that when you are well enough to bear the journey he will carry you to see them has he maam cried oliver his face brightening with pleasure
i dont know what i shall do for joy when i see their kind faces once again in a short time oliver was sufficiently recovered to undergo the fatigue of this expedition
one morning he and mr losberne set out accordingly in a little carriage which belonged to mrs maylie
when they came to chertsey bridge oliver turned very pale and uttered a loud exclamation
whats the matter with the boy cried the doctor as usual all in a bustle
do you see anythinghear anythingfeel anythingeh that sir cried oliver pointing out of the carriage window
that house yes well what of it
stop coachman
pull up here cried the doctor
what of the house my man eh the thievesthe house they took me to whispered oliver
the devil it is cried the doctor
hallo there
let me out but before the coachman could dismount from his box he had tumbled out of the coach by some means or other and running down to the deserted tenement began kicking at the door like a madman
halloa said a little ugly humpbacked man opening the door so suddenly that the doctor from the very impetus of his last kick nearly fell forward into the passage
whats the matter here matter exclaimed the other collaring him without a moments reflection
a good deal
robbery is the matter therell be murder the matter too replied the humpbacked man coolly if you dont take your hands off
do you hear me i hear you said the doctor giving his captive a hearty shake
wheresconfound the fellow whats his rascally namesikes thats it
wheres sikes you thief the humpbacked man stared as if in excess of amazement and indignation then twisting himself dexterously from the doctors grasp growled forth a volley of horrid oaths and retired into the house
before he could shut the door however the doctor had passed into the parlour without a word of parley
he looked anxiously round not an article of furniture not a vestige of anything animate or inanimate not even the position of the cupboards answered olivers description
now said the humpbacked man who had watched him keenly what do you mean by coming into my house in this violent way
do you want to rob me or to murder me
which is it did you ever know a man come out to do either in a chariot and pair you ridiculous old vampire said the irritable doctor
what do you want then demanded the hunchback
will you take yourself off before i do you a mischief
curse you as soon as i think proper said mr losberne looking into the other parlour which like the first bore no resemblance whatever to olivers account of it
i shall find you out some day my friend will you sneered the illfavoured cripple
if you ever want me im here
i havent lived here mad and all alone for fiveandtwenty years to be scared by you
you shall pay for this you shall pay for this and so saying the misshapen little demon set up a yell and danced upon the ground as if wild with rage
stupid enough this muttered the doctor to himself the boy must have made a mistake
here
put that in your pocket and shut yourself up again with these words he flung the hunchback a piece of money and returned to the carriage
the man followed to the chariot door uttering the wildest imprecations and curses all the way but as mr losberne turned to speak to the driver he looked into the carriage and eyed oliver for an instant with a glance so sharp and fierce and at the same time so furious and vindictive that waking or sleeping he could not forget it for months afterwards
he continued to utter the most fearful imprecations until the driver had resumed his seat and when they were once more on their way they could see him some distance behind beating his feet upon the ground and tearing his hair in transports of real or pretended rage
i am an ass said the doctor after a long silence
did you know that before oliver no sir then dont forget it another time an ass said the doctor again after a further silence of some minutes
even if it had been the right place and the right fellows had been there what could i have done singlehanded
and if i had had assistance i see no good that i should have done except leading to my own exposure and an unavoidable statement of the manner in which i have hushed up this business
that would have served me right though
i am always involving myself in some scrape or other by acting on impulse
it might have done me good now the fact was that the excellent doctor had never acted upon anything but impulse all through his life and it was no bad compliment to the nature of the impulses which governed him that so far from being involved in any peculiar troubles or misfortunes he had the warmest respect and esteem of all who knew him
if the truth must be told he was a little out of temper for a minute or two at being disappointed in procuring corroborative evidence of olivers story on the very first occasion on which he had a chance of obtaining any
he soon came round again however and finding that olivers replies to his questions were still as straightforward and consistent and still delivered with as much apparent sincerity and truth as they had ever been he made up his mind to attach full credence to them from that time forth
as oliver knew the name of the street in which mr brownlow resided they were enabled to drive straight thither
when the coach turned into it his heart beat so violently that he could scarcely draw his breath
now my boy which house is it inquired mr losberne
that
that replied oliver pointing eagerly out of the window
the white house
oh
make haste
pray make haste
i feel as if i should die it makes me tremble so come come said the good doctor patting him on the shoulder
you will see them directly and they will be overjoyed to find you safe and well oh
i hope so cried oliver
they were so good to me so very very good to me the coach rolled on
it stopped
no that was the wrong house the next door
it went on a few paces and stopped again
oliver looked up at the windows with tears of happy expectation coursing down his face
alas
the white house was empty and there was a bill in the window
to let knock at the next door cried mr losberne taking olivers arm in his
what has become of mr brownlow who used to live in the adjoining house do you know the servant did not know but would go and inquire
she presently returned and said that mr brownlow had sold off his goods and gone to the west indies six weeks before
oliver clasped his hands and sank feebly backward
has his housekeeper gone too inquired mr losberne after a moments pause
yes sir replied the servant
the old gentleman the housekeeper and a gentleman who was a friend of mr brownlows all went together then turn towards home again said mr losberne to the driver and dont stop to bait the horses till you get out of this confounded london the bookstall keeper sir said oliver
i know the way there
see him pray sir
do see him my poor boy this is disappointment enough for one day said the doctor
quite enough for both of us
if we go to the bookstall keepers we shall certainly find that he is dead or has set his house on fire or run away
no home again straight and in obedience to the doctors impulse home they went
this bitter disappointment caused oliver much sorrow and grief even in the midst of his happiness for he had pleased himself many times during his illness with thinking of all that mr brownlow and mrs bedwin would say to him and what delight it would be to tell them how many long days and nights he had passed in reflecting on what they had done for him and in bewailing his cruel separation from them
the hope of eventually clearing himself with them too and explaining how he had been forced away had buoyed him up and sustained him under many of his recent trials and now the idea that they should have gone so far and carried with them the belief that he was an impostor and a robbera belief which might remain uncontradicted to his dying daywas almost more than he could bear
the circumstance occasioned no alteration however in the behaviour of his benefactors
after another fortnight when the fine warm weather had fairly begun and every tree and flower was putting forth its young leaves and rich blossoms they made preparations for quitting the house at chertsey for some months
sending the plate which had so excited fagins cupidity to the bankers and leaving giles and another servant in care of the house they departed to a cottage at some distance in the country and took oliver with them
who can describe the pleasure and delight the peace of mind and soft tranquillity the sickly boy felt in the balmy air and among the green hills and rich woods of an inland village
who can tell how scenes of peace and quietude sink into the minds of painworn dwellers in close and noisy places and carry their own freshness deep into their jaded hearts
men who have lived in crowded pentup streets through lives of toil and who have never wished for change men to whom custom has indeed been second nature and who have come almost to love each brick and stone that formed the narrow boundaries of their daily walks even they with the hand of death upon them have been known to yearn at last for one short glimpse of natures face and carried far from the scenes of their old pains and pleasures have seemed to pass at once into a new state of being
crawling forth from day to day to some green sunny spot they have had such memories wakened up within them by the sight of the sky and hill and plain and glistening water that a foretaste of heaven itself has soothed their quick decline and they have sunk into their tombs as peacefully as the sun whose setting they watched from their lonely chamber window but a few hours before faded from their dim and feeble sight
the memories which peaceful country scenes call up are not of this world nor of its thoughts and hopes
their gentle influence may teach us how to weave fresh garlands for the graves of those we loved may purify our thoughts and bear down before it old enmity and hatred but beneath all this there lingers in the least reflective mind a vague and halfformed consciousness of having held such feelings long before in some remote and distant time which calls up solemn thoughts of distant times to come and bends down pride and worldliness beneath it
it was a lovely spot to which they repaired
oliver whose days had been spent among squalid crowds and in the midst of noise and brawling seemed to enter on a new existence there
the rose and honeysuckle clung to the cottage walls the ivy crept round the trunks of the trees and the gardenflowers perfumed the air with delicious odours
hard by was a little churchyard not crowded with tall unsightly gravestones but full of humble mounds covered with fresh turf and moss beneath which the old people of the village lay at rest
oliver often wandered here and thinking of the wretched grave in which his mother lay would sometimes sit him down and sob unseen but when he raised his eyes to the deep sky overhead he would cease to think of her as lying in the ground and would weep for her sadly but without pain
it was a happy time
the days were peaceful and serene the nights brought with them neither fear nor care no languishing in a wretched prison or associating with wretched men nothing but pleasant and happy thoughts
every morning he went to a whiteheaded old gentleman who lived near the little church who taught him to read better and to write and who spoke so kindly and took such pains that oliver could never try enough to please him
then he would walk with mrs maylie and rose and hear them talk of books or perhaps sit near them in some shady place and listen whilst the young lady read which he could have done until it grew too dark to see the letters
then he had his own lesson for the next day to prepare and at this he would work hard in a little room which looked into the garden till evening came slowly on when the ladies would walk out again and he with them listening with such pleasure to all they said and so happy if they wanted a flower that he could climb to reach or had forgotten anything he could run to fetch that he could never be quick enough about it
when it became quite dark and they returned home the young lady would sit down to the piano and play some pleasant air or sing in a low and gentle voice some old song which it pleased her aunt to hear
there would be no candles lighted at such times as these and oliver would sit by one of the windows listening to the sweet music in a perfect rapture
and when sunday came how differently the day was spent from any way in which he had ever spent it yet
and how happily too like all the other days in that most happy time
there was the little church in the morning with the green leaves fluttering at the windows the birds singing without and the sweetsmelling air stealing in at the low porch and filling the homely building with its fragrance
the poor people were so neat and clean and knelt so reverently in prayer that it seemed a pleasure not a tedious duty their assembling there together and though the singing might be rude it was real and sounded more musical to olivers ears at least than any he had ever heard in church before
then there were the walks as usual and many calls at the clean houses of the labouring men and at night oliver read a chapter or two from the bible which he had been studying all the week and in the performance of which duty he felt more proud and pleased than if he had been the clergyman himself
in the morning oliver would be afoot by six oclock roaming the fields and plundering the hedges far and wide for nosegays of wild flowers with which he would return laden home and which it took great care and consideration to arrange to the best advantage for the embellishment of the breakfasttable
there was fresh groundsel too for miss maylies birds with which oliver who had been studying the subject under the able tuition of the village clerk would decorate the cages in the most approved taste
when the birds were made all spruce and smart for the day there was usually some little commission of charity to execute in the village or failing that there was rare cricketplaying sometimes on the green or failing that there was always something to do in the garden or about the plants to which oliver who had studied this science also under the same master who was a gardener by trade applied himself with hearty goodwill until miss rose made her appearance when there were a thousand commendations to be bestowed on all he had done
so three months glided away three months which in the life of the most blessed and favoured of mortals might have been unmingled happiness and which in olivers were true felicity
with the purest and most amiable generosity on one side and the truest warmest soulfelt gratitude on the other it is no wonder that by the end of that short time oliver twist had become completely domesticated with the old lady and her niece and that the fervent attachment of his young and sensitive heart was repaid by their pride in and attachment to himself
wherein the happiness of oliver and his friends experiences a sudden check spring flew swiftly by and summer came
if the village had been beautiful at first it was now in the full glow and luxuriance of its richness
the great trees which had looked shrunken and bare in the earlier months had now burst into strong life and health and stretching forth their green arms over the thirsty ground converted open and naked spots into choice nooks where was a deep and pleasant shade from which to look upon the wide prospect steeped in sunshine which lay stretched beyond
the earth had donned her mantle of brightest green and shed her richest perfumes abroad
it was the prime and vigour of the year all things were glad and flourishing
still the same quiet life went on at the little cottage and the same cheerful serenity prevailed among its inmates
oliver had long since grown stout and healthy but health or sickness made no difference in his warm feelings of a great many people
he was still the same gentle attached affectionate creature that he had been when pain and suffering had wasted his strength and when he was dependent for every slight attention and comfort on those who tended him
one beautiful night when they had taken a longer walk than was customary with them for the day had been unusually warm and there was a brilliant moon and a light wind had sprung up which was unusually refreshing
rose had been in high spirits too and they had walked on in merry conversation until they had far exceeded their ordinary bounds
mrs maylie being fatigued they returned more slowly home
the young lady merely throwing off her simple bonnet sat down to the piano as usual
after running abstractedly over the keys for a few minutes she fell into a low and very solemn air and as she played it they heard a sound as if she were weeping
rose my dear said the elder lady
rose made no reply but played a little quicker as though the words had roused her from some painful thoughts
rose my love cried mrs maylie rising hastily and bending over her
what is this
in tears
my dear child what distresses you nothing aunt nothing replied the young lady
i dont know what it is i cant describe it but i feel not ill my love interposed mrs maylie
no no
oh not ill replied rose shuddering as though some deadly chillness were passing over her while she spoke i shall be better presently
close the window pray oliver hastened to comply with her request
the young lady making an effort to recover her cheerfulness strove to play some livelier tune but her fingers dropped powerless over the keys
covering her face with her hands she sank upon a sofa and gave vent to the tears which she was now unable to repress
my child said the elderly lady folding her arms about her i never saw you so before i would not alarm you if i could avoid it rejoined rose but indeed i have tried very hard and cannot help this
i fear i am ill aunt she was indeed for when candles were brought they saw that in the very short time which had elapsed since their return home the hue of her countenance had changed to a marble whiteness
its expression had lost nothing of its beauty but it was changed and there was an anxious haggard look about the gentle face which it had never worn before
another minute and it was suffused with a crimson flush and a heavy wildness came over the soft blue eye
again this disappeared like the shadow thrown by a passing cloud and she was once more deadly pale
oliver who watched the old lady anxiously observed that she was alarmed by these appearances and so in truth was he but seeing that she affected to make light of them he endeavoured to do the same and they so far succeeded that when rose was persuaded by her aunt to retire for the night she was in better spirits and appeared even in better health assuring them that she felt certain she should rise in the morning quite well
i hope said oliver when mrs maylie returned that nothing is the matter
she dont look well tonight but the old lady motioned to him not to speak and sitting herself down in a dark corner of the room remained silent for some time
at length she said in a trembling voice i hope not oliver
i have been very happy with her for some years too happy perhaps
it may be time that i should meet with some misfortune but i hope it is not this what inquired oliver
the heavy blow said the old lady of losing the dear girl who has so long been my comfort and happiness oh
god forbid exclaimed oliver hastily
amen to that my child said the old lady wringing her hands
surely there is no danger of anything so dreadful said oliver
two hours ago she was quite well she is very ill now rejoined mrs maylies and will be worse i am sure
my dear dear rose
oh what shall i do without her she gave way to such great grief that oliver suppressing his own emotion ventured to remonstrate with her and to beg earnestly that for the sake of the dear young lady herself she would be more calm
and consider maam said oliver as the tears forced themselves into his eyes despite of his efforts to the contrary
oh
consider how young and good she is and what pleasure and comfort she gives to all about her
i am surecertainquite certainthat for your sake who are so good yourself and for her own and for the sake of all she makes so happy she will not die
heaven will never let her die so young hush said mrs maylie laying her hand on olivers head
you think like a child poor boy
but you teach me my duty notwithstanding
i had forgotten it for a moment oliver but i hope i may be pardoned for i am old and have seen enough of illness and death to know the agony of separation from the objects of our love
i have seen enough too to know that it is not always the youngest and best who are spared to those that love them but this should give us comfort in our sorrow for heaven is just and such things teach us impressively that there is a brighter world than this and that the passage to it is speedy
gods will be done
i love her and he knows how well oliver was surprised to see that as mrs maylie said these words she checked her lamentations as though by one effort and drawing herself up as she spoke became composed and firm
he was still more astonished to find that this firmness lasted and that under all the care and watching which ensued mrs maylie was ever ready and collected performing all the duties which had devolved upon her steadily and to all external appearances even cheerfully
but he was young and did not know what strong minds are capable of under trying circumstances
how should he when their possessors so seldom know themselves
an anxious night ensued
when morning came mrs maylies predictions were but too well verified
rose was in the first stage of a high and dangerous fever
we must be active oliver and not give way to useless grief said mrs maylie laying her finger on her lip as she looked steadily into his face this letter must be sent with all possible expedition to mr losberne
it must be carried to the markettown which is not more than four miles off by the footpath across the field and thence dispatched by an express on horseback straight to chertsey
the people at the inn will undertake to do this and i can trust to you to see it done i know oliver could make no reply but looked his anxiety to be gone at once
here is another letter said mrs maylie pausing to reflect but whether to send it now or wait until i see how rose goes on i scarcely know
i would not forward it unless i feared the worst is it for chertsey too maam inquired oliver impatient to execute his commission and holding out his trembling hand for the letter
no replied the old lady giving it to him mechanically
oliver glanced at it and saw that it was directed to harry maylie esquire at some great lords house in the country where he could not make out
shall it go maam asked oliver looking up impatiently
i think not replied mrs maylie taking it back
i will wait until tomorrow with these words she gave oliver her purse and he started off without more delay at the greatest speed he could muster
swiftly he ran across the fields and down the little lanes which sometimes divided them now almost hidden by the high corn on either side and now emerging on an open field where the mowers and haymakers were busy at their work nor did he stop once save now and then for a few seconds to recover breath until he came in a great heat and covered with dust on the little marketplace of the markettown
here he paused and looked about for the inn
there were a white bank and a red brewery and a yellow townhall and in one corner there was a large house with all the wood about it painted green before which was the sign of the george to this he hastened as soon as it caught his eye
he spoke to a postboy who was dozing under the gateway and who after hearing what he wanted referred him to the ostler who after hearing all he had to say again referred him to the landlord who was a tall gentleman in a blue neckcloth a white hat drab breeches and boots with tops to match leaning against a pump by the stabledoor picking his teeth with a silver toothpick
this gentleman walked with much deliberation into the bar to make out the bill which took a long time making out and after it was ready and paid a horse had to be saddled and a man to be dressed which took up ten good minutes more
meanwhile oliver was in such a desperate state of impatience and anxiety that he felt as if he could have jumped upon the horse himself and galloped away full tear to the next stage
at length all was ready and the little parcel having been handed up with many injunctions and entreaties for its speedy delivery the man set spurs to his horse and rattling over the uneven paving of the marketplace was out of the town and galloping along the turnpikeroad in a couple of minutes
as it was something to feel certain that assistance was sent for and that no time had been lost oliver hurried up the innyard with a somewhat lighter heart
he was turning out of the gateway when he accidently stumbled against a tall man wrapped in a cloak who was at that moment coming out of the inn door
hah cried the man fixing his eyes on oliver and suddenly recoiling
what the devils this i beg your pardon sir said oliver i was in a great hurry to get home and didnt see you were coming death muttered the man to himself glaring at the boy with his large dark eyes
who would have thought it
grind him to ashes
hed start up from a stone coffin to come in my way i am sorry stammered oliver confused by the strange mans wild look
i hope i have not hurt you rot you murmured the man in a horrible passion between his clenched teeth if i had only had the courage to say the word i might have been free of you in a night
curses on your head and black death on your heart you imp
what are you doing here the man shook his fist as he uttered these words incoherently
he advanced towards oliver as if with the intention of aiming a blow at him but fell violently on the ground writhing and foaming in a fit
oliver gazed for a moment at the struggles of the madman for such he supposed him to be and then darted into the house for help
having seen him safely carried into the hotel he turned his face homewards running as fast as he could to make up for lost time and recalling with a great deal of astonishment and some fear the extraordinary behaviour of the person from whom he had just parted
the circumstance did not dwell in his recollection long however for when he reached the cottage there was enough to occupy his mind and to drive all considerations of self completely from his memory
rose maylie had rapidly grown worse before midnight she was delirious
a medical practitioner who resided on the spot was in constant attendance upon her and after first seeing the patient he had taken mrs maylie aside and pronounced her disorder to be one of a most alarming nature
in fact he said it would be little short of a miracle if she recovered how often did oliver start from his bed that night and stealing out with noiseless footstep to the staircase listen for the slightest sound from the sick chamber
how often did a tremble shake his frame and cold drops of terror start upon his brow when a sudden trampling of feet caused him to fear that something too dreadful to think of had even then occurred
and what had been the fervency of all the prayers he had ever muttered compared with those he poured forth now in the agony and passion of his supplication for the life and health of the gentle creature who was tottering on the deep graves verge
oh
the suspense the fearful acute suspense of standing idly by while the life of one we dearly love is trembling in the balance
oh
the racking thoughts that crowd upon the mind and make the heart beat violently and the breath come thick by the force of the images they conjure up before it the desperate anxiety to be doing something to relieve the pain or lessen the danger which we have no power to alleviate the sinking of soul and spirit which the sad remembrance of our helplessness produces what tortures can equal these what reflections or endeavours can in the full tide and fever of the time allay them
morning came and the little cottage was lonely and still
people spoke in whispers anxious faces appeared at the gate from time to time women and children went away in tears
all the livelong day and for hours after it had grown dark oliver paced softly up and down the garden raising his eyes every instant to the sick chamber and shuddering to see the darkened window looking as if death lay stretched inside
late that night mr losberne arrived
it is hard said the good doctor turning away as he spoke so young so much beloved but there is very little hope another morning
the sun shone brightly as brightly as if it looked upon no misery or care and with every leaf and flower in full bloom about her with life and health and sounds and sights of joy surrounding her on every side the fair young creature lay wasting fast
oliver crept away to the old churchyard and sitting down on one of the green mounds wept and prayed for her in silence
there was such peace and beauty in the scene so much of brightness and mirth in the sunny landscape such blithesome music in the songs of the summer birds such freedom in the rapid flight of the rook careering overhead so much of life and joyousness in all that when the boy raised his aching eyes and looked about the thought instinctively occurred to him that this was not a time for death that rose could surely never die when humbler things were all so glad and gay that graves were for cold and cheerless winter not for sunlight and fragrance
he almost thought that shrouds were for the old and shrunken and that they never wrapped the young and graceful form in their ghastly folds
a knell from the church bell broke harshly on these youthful thoughts
another
again
it was tolling for the funeral service
a group of humble mourners entered the gate wearing white favours for the corpse was young
they stood uncovered by a grave and there was a mothera mother onceamong the weeping train
but the sun shone brightly and the birds sang on
oliver turned homeward thinking on the many kindnesses he had received from the young lady and wishing that the time could come again that he might never cease showing her how grateful and attached he was
he had no cause for selfreproach on the score of neglect or want of thought for he had been devoted to her service and yet a hundred little occasions rose up before him on which he fancied he might have been more zealous and more earnest and wished he had been
we need be careful how we deal with those about us when every death carries to some small circle of survivors thoughts of so much omitted and so little doneof so many things forgotten and so many more which might have been repaired
there is no remorse so deep as that which is unavailing if we would be spared its tortures let us remember this in time
when he reached home mrs maylie was sitting in the little parlour
olivers heart sank at sight of her for she had never left the bedside of her niece and he trembled to think what change could have driven her away
he learnt that she had fallen into a deep sleep from which she would waken either to recovery and life or to bid them farewell and die
they sat listening and afraid to speak for hours
the untasted meal was removed with looks which showed that their thoughts were elsewhere they watched the sun as he sank lower and lower and at length cast over sky and earth those brilliant hues which herald his departure
their quick ears caught the sound of an approaching footstep
they both involuntarily darted to the door as mr losberne entered
what of rose cried the old lady
tell me at once
i can bear it anything but suspense
oh tell me
in the name of heaven you must compose yourself said the doctor supporting her
be calm my dear maam pray let me go in gods name
my dear child
she is dead
she is dying no cried the doctor passionately
as he is good and merciful she will live to bless us all for years to come the lady fell upon her knees and tried to fold her hands together but the energy which had supported her so long fled up to heaven with her first thanksgiving and she sank into the friendly arms which were extended to receive her
contains some introductory particulars relative to a young gentleman who now arrives upon the scene and a new adventure which happened to oliver it was almost too much happiness to bear
oliver felt stunned and stupefied by the unexpected intelligence he could not weep or speak or rest
he had scarcely the power of understanding anything that had passed until after a long ramble in the quiet evening air a burst of tears came to his relief and he seemed to awaken all at once to a full sense of the joyful change that had occurred and the almost insupportable load of anguish which had been taken from his breast
the night was fast closing in when he returned homeward laden with flowers which he had culled with peculiar care for the adornment of the sick chamber
as he walked briskly along the road he heard behind him the noise of some vehicle approaching at a furious pace
looking round he saw that it was a postchaise driven at great speed and as the horses were galloping and the road was narrow he stood leaning against a gate until it should have passed him
as it dashed on oliver caught a glimpse of a man in a white nightcap whose face seemed familiar to him although his view was so brief that he could not identify the person
in another second or two the nightcap was thrust out of the chaisewindow and a stentorian voice bellowed to the driver to stop which he did as soon as he could pull up his horses
then the nightcap once again appeared and the same voice called oliver by his name
here cried the voice
oliver whats the news
miss rose
master oliver is it you giles cried oliver running up to the chaisedoor
giles popped out his nightcap again preparatory to making some reply when he was suddenly pulled back by a young gentleman who occupied the other corner of the chaise and who eagerly demanded what was the news
in a word cried the gentleman better or worse bettermuch better replied oliver hastily
thank heaven exclaimed the gentleman
you are sure quite sir replied oliver
the change took place only a few hours ago and mr losberne says that all danger is at an end the gentleman said not another word but opening the chaisedoor leaped out and taking oliver hurriedly by the arm led him aside
you are quite certain
there is no possibility of any mistake on your part my boy is there demanded the gentleman in a tremulous voice
do not deceive me by awakening hopes that are not to be fulfilled i would not for the world sir replied oliver
indeed you may believe me
mr losbernes words were that she would live to bless us all for many years to come
i heard him say so the tears stood in olivers eyes as he recalled the scene which was the beginning of so much happiness and the gentleman turned his face away and remained silent for some minutes
oliver thought he heard him sob more than once but he feared to interrupt him by any fresh remarkfor he could well guess what his feelings wereand so stood apart feigning to be occupied with his nosegay
all this time mr giles with the white nightcap on had been sitting on the steps of the chaise supporting an elbow on each knee and wiping his eyes with a blue cotton pockethandkerchief dotted with white spots
that the honest fellow had not been feigning emotion was abundantly demonstrated by the very red eyes with which he regarded the young gentleman when he turned round and addressed him
i think you had better go on to my mothers in the chaise giles said he
i would rather walk slowly on so as to gain a little time before i see her
you can say i am coming i beg your pardon mr harry said giles giving a final polish to his ruffled countenance with the handkerchief but if you would leave the postboy to say that i should be very much obliged to you
it wouldnt be proper for the maids to see me in this state sir i should never have any more authority with them if they did well rejoined harry maylie smiling you can do as you like
let him go on with the luggage if you wish it and do you follow with us
only first exchange that nightcap for some more appropriate covering or we shall be taken for madmen mr giles reminded of his unbecoming costume snatched off and pocketed his nightcap and substituted a hat of grave and sober shape which he took out of the chaise
this done the postboy drove off giles mr maylie and oliver followed at their leisure
as they walked along oliver glanced from time to time with much interest and curiosity at the new comer
he seemed about fiveandtwenty years of age and was of the middle height his countenance was frank and handsome and his demeanor easy and prepossessing
notwithstanding the difference between youth and age he bore so strong a likeness to the old lady that oliver would have had no great difficulty in imagining their relationship if he had not already spoken of her as his mother
mrs maylie was anxiously waiting to receive her son when he reached the cottage
the meeting did not take place without great emotion on both sides
mother whispered the young man why did you not write before i did replied mrs maylie but on reflection i determined to keep back the letter until i had heard mr losbernes opinion but why said the young man why run the chance of that occurring which so nearly happened
if rose hadi cannot utter that word nowif this illness had terminated differently how could you ever have forgiven yourself
how could i ever have know happiness again if that had been the case harry said mrs maylie i fear your happiness would have been effectually blighted and that your arrival here a day sooner or a day later would have been of very very little import and who can wonder if it be so mother rejoined the young man or why should i say ifit isit isyou know it motheryou must know it i know that she deserves the best and purest love the heart of man can offer said mrs maylie i know that the devotion and affection of her nature require no ordinary return but one that shall be deep and lasting
if i did not feel this and know besides that a changed behaviour in one she loved would break her heart i should not feel my task so difficult of performance or have to encounter so many struggles in my own bosom when i take what seems to me to be the strict line of duty this is unkind mother said harry
do you still suppose that i am a boy ignorant of my own mind and mistaking the impulses of my own soul i think my dear son returned mrs maylie laying her hand upon his shoulder that youth has many generous impulses which do not last and that among them are some which being gratified become only the more fleeting
above all i think said the lady fixing her eyes on her sons face that if an enthusiastic ardent and ambitious man marry a wife on whose name there is a stain which though it originate in no fault of hers may be visited by cold and sordid people upon her and upon his children also and in exact proportion to his success in the world be cast in his teeth and made the subject of sneers against him he may no matter how generous and good his nature one day repent of the connection he formed in early life
and she may have the pain of knowing that he does so mother said the young man impatiently he would be a selfish brute unworthy alike of the name of man and of the woman you describe who acted thus you think so now harry replied his mother
and ever will said the young man
the mental agony i have suffered during the last two days wrings from me the avowal to you of a passion which as you well know is not one of yesterday nor one i have lightly formed
on rose sweet gentle girl
my heart is set as firmly as ever heart of man was set on woman
i have no thought no view no hope in life beyond her and if you oppose me in this great stake you take my peace and happiness in your hands and cast them to the wind
mother think better of this and of me and do not disregard the happiness of which you seem to think so little harry said mrs maylie it is because i think so much of warm and sensitive hearts that i would spare them from being wounded
but we have said enough and more than enough on this matter just now let it rest with rose then interposed harry
you will not press these overstrained opinions of yours so far as to throw any obstacle in my way i will not rejoined mrs maylie but i would have you consider i have considered was the impatient reply mother i have considered years and years
i have considered ever since i have been capable of serious reflection
my feelings remain unchanged as they ever will and why should i suffer the pain of a delay in giving them vent which can be productive of no earthly good
no
before i leave this place rose shall hear me she shall said mrs maylie
there is something in your manner which would almost imply that she will hear me coldly mother said the young man
not coldly rejoined the old lady far from it how then urged the young man
she has formed no other attachment no indeed replied his mother you have or i mistake too strong a hold on her affections already
what i would say resumed the old lady stopping her son as he was about to speak is this
before you stake your all on this chance before you suffer yourself to be carried to the highest point of hope reflect for a few moments my dear child on roses history and consider what effect the knowledge of her doubtful birth may have on her decision devoted as she is to us with all the intensity of her noble mind and with that perfect sacrifice of self which in all matters great or trifling has always been her characteristic what do you mean that i leave you to discover replied mrs maylie
i must go back to her
god bless you i shall see you again tonight said the young man eagerly
by and by replied the lady when i leave rose you will tell her i am here said harry
of course replied mrs maylie
and say how anxious i have been and how much i have suffered and how i long to see her
you will not refuse to do this mother no said the old lady i will tell her all and pressing her sons hand affectionately she hastened from the room
mr losberne and oliver had remained at another end of the apartment while this hurried conversation was proceeding
the former now held out his hand to harry maylie and hearty salutations were exchanged between them
the doctor then communicated in reply to multifarious questions from his young friend a precise account of his patients situation which was quite as consolatory and full of promise as olivers statement had encouraged him to hope and to the whole of which mr giles who affected to be busy about the luggage listened with greedy ears
have you shot anything particular lately giles inquired the doctor when he had concluded
nothing particular sir replied mr giles colouring up to the eyes
nor catching any thieves nor identifying any housebreakers said the doctor
none at all sir replied mr giles with much gravity
well said the doctor i am sorry to hear it because you do that sort of thing admirably
pray how is brittles the boy is very well sir said mr giles recovering his usual tone of patronage and sends his respectful duty sir thats well said the doctor
seeing you here reminds me mr giles that on the day before that on which i was called away so hurriedly i executed at the request of your good mistress a small commission in your favour
just step into this corner a moment will you mr giles walked into the corner with much importance and some wonder and was honoured with a short whispering conference with the doctor on the termination of which he made a great many bows and retired with steps of unusual stateliness
the subject matter of this conference was not disclosed in the parlour but the kitchen was speedily enlightened concerning it for mr giles walked straight thither and having called for a mug of ale announced with an air of majesty which was highly effective that it had pleased his mistress in consideration of his gallant behaviour on the occasion of that attempted robbery to deposit in the local savingsbank the sum of fiveandtwenty pounds for his sole use and benefit
at this the two womenservants lifted up their hands and eyes and supposed that mr giles pulling out his shirtfrill replied no no and that if they observed that he was at all haughty to his inferiors he would thank them to tell him so
and then he made a great many other remarks no less illustrative of his humility which were received with equal favour and applause and were withal as original and as much to the purpose as the remarks of great men commonly are
above stairs the remainder of the evening passed cheerfully away for the doctor was in high spirits and however fatigued or thoughtful harry maylie might have been at first he was not proof against the worthy gentlemans good humour which displayed itself in a great variety of sallies and professional recollections and an abundance of small jokes which struck oliver as being the drollest things he had ever heard and caused him to laugh proportionately to the evident satisfaction of the doctor who laughed immoderately at himself and made harry laugh almost as heartily by the very force of sympathy
so they were as pleasant a party as under the circumstances they could well have been and it was late before they retired with light and thankful hearts to take that rest of which after the doubt and suspense they had recently undergone they stood much in need
oliver rose next morning in better heart and went about his usual occupations with more hope and pleasure than he had known for many days
the birds were once more hung out to sing in their old places and the sweetest wild flowers that could be found were once more gathered to gladden rose with their beauty
the melancholy which had seemed to the sad eyes of the anxious boy to hang for days past over every object beautiful as all were was dispelled by magic
the dew seemed to sparkle more brightly on the green leaves the air to rustle among them with a sweeter music and the sky itself to look more blue and bright
such is the influence which the condition of our own thoughts exercise even over the appearance of external objects
men who look on nature and their fellowmen and cry that all is dark and gloomy are in the right but the sombre colours are reflections from their own jaundiced eyes and hearts
the real hues are delicate and need a clearer vision
it is worthy of remark and oliver did not fail to note it at the time that his morning expeditions were no longer made alone
harry maylie after the very first morning when he met oliver coming laden home was seized with such a passion for flowers and displayed such a taste in their arrangement as left his young companion far behind
if oliver were behindhand in these respects he knew where the best were to be found and morning after morning they scoured the country together and brought home the fairest that blossomed
the window of the young ladys chamber was opened now for she loved to feel the rich summer air stream in and revive her with its freshness but there always stood in water just inside the lattice one particular little bunch which was made up with great care every morning
oliver could not help noticing that the withered flowers were never thrown away although the little vase was regularly replenished nor could he help observing that whenever the doctor came into the garden he invariably cast his eyes up to that particular corner and nodded his head most expressively as he set forth on his mornings walk
pending these observations the days were flying by and rose was rapidly recovering
nor did olivers time hang heavy on his hands although the young lady had not yet left her chamber and there were no evening walks save now and then for a short distance with mrs maylie
he applied himself with redoubled assiduity to the instructions of the whiteheaded old gentleman and laboured so hard that his quick progress surprised even himself
it was while he was engaged in this pursuit that he was greatly startled and distressed by a most unexpected occurrence
the little room in which he was accustomed to sit when busy at his books was on the groundfloor at the back of the house
it was quite a cottageroom with a latticewindow around which were clusters of jessamine and honeysuckle that crept over the casement and filled the place with their delicious perfume
it looked into a garden whence a wicketgate opened into a small paddock all beyond was fine meadowland and wood
there was no other dwelling near in that direction and the prospect it commanded was very extensive
one beautiful evening when the first shades of twilight were beginning to settle upon the earth oliver sat at this window intent upon his books
he had been poring over them for some time and as the day had been uncommonly sultry and he had exerted himself a great deal it is no disparagement to the authors whoever they may have been to say that gradually and by slow degrees he fell asleep
there is a kind of sleep that steals upon us sometimes which while it holds the body prisoner does not free the mind from a sense of things about it and enable it to ramble at its pleasure
so far as an overpowering heaviness a prostration of strength and an utter inability to control our thoughts or power of motion can be called sleep this is it and yet we have a consciousness of all that is going on about us and if we dream at such a time words which are really spoken or sounds which really exist at the moment accommodate themselves with surprising readiness to our visions until reality and imagination become so strangely blended that it is afterwards almost matter of impossibility to separate the two
nor is this the most striking phenomenon incidental to such a state
it is an undoubted fact that although our senses of touch and sight be for the time dead yet our sleeping thoughts and the visionary scenes that pass before us will be influenced and materially influenced by the mere silent presence of some external object which may not have been near us when we closed our eyes and of whose vicinity we have had no waking consciousness
oliver knew perfectly well that he was in his own little room that his books were lying on the table before him that the sweet air was stirring among the creeping plants outside
and yet he was asleep
suddenly the scene changed the air became close and confined and he thought with a glow of terror that he was in the jews house again
there sat the hideous old man in his accustomed corner pointing at him and whispering to another man with his face averted who sat beside him
hush my dear he thought he heard the jew say it is he sure enough
come away he the other man seemed to answer could i mistake him think you
if a crowd of ghosts were to put themselves into his exact shape and he stood amongst them there is something that would tell me how to point him out
if you buried him fifty feet deep and took me across his grave i fancy i should know if there wasnt a mark above it that he lay buried there the man seemed to say this with such dreadful hatred that oliver awoke with the fear and started up
good heaven
what was that which sent the blood tingling to his heart and deprived him of his voice and of power to move
therethereat the windowclose before himso close that he could have almost touched him before he started back with his eyes peering into the room and meeting his there stood the jew
and beside him white with rage or fear or both were the scowling features of the man who had accosted him in the innyard
it was but an instant a glance a flash before his eyes and they were gone
but they had recognised him and he them and their look was as firmly impressed upon his memory as if it had been deeply carved in stone and set before him from his birth
he stood transfixed for a moment then leaping from the window into the garden called loudly for help
containing the unsatisfactory result of olivers adventure and a conversation of some importance between harry maylie and rose when the inmates of the house attracted by olivers cries hurried to the spot from which they proceeded they found him pale and agitated pointing in the direction of the meadows behind the house and scarcely able to articulate the words the jew
the jew mr giles was at a loss to comprehend what this outcry meant but harry maylie whose perceptions were something quicker and who had heard olivers history from his mother understood it at once
what direction did he take he asked catching up a heavy stick which was standing in a corner
that replied oliver pointing out the course the man had taken i missed them in an instant then they are in the ditch said harry
follow
and keep as near me as you can so saying he sprang over the hedge and darted off with a speed which rendered it matter of exceeding difficulty for the others to keep near him
giles followed as well as he could and oliver followed too and in the course of a minute or two mr losberne who had been out walking and just then returned tumbled over the hedge after them and picking himself up with more agility than he could have been supposed to possess struck into the same course at no contemptible speed shouting all the while most prodigiously to know what was the matter
on they all went nor stopped they once to breathe until the leader striking off into an angle of the field indicated by oliver began to search narrowly the ditch and hedge adjoining which afforded time for the remainder of the party to come up and for oliver to communicate to mr losberne the circumstances that had led to so vigorous a pursuit
the search was all in vain
there were not even the traces of recent footsteps to be seen
they stood now on the summit of a little hill commanding the open fields in every direction for three or four miles
there was the village in the hollow on the left but in order to gain that after pursuing the track oliver had pointed out the men must have made a circuit of open ground which it was impossible they could have accomplished in so short a time
a thick wood skirted the meadowland in another direction but they could not have gained that covert for the same reason
it must have been a dream oliver said harry maylie
oh no indeed sir replied oliver shuddering at the very recollection of the old wretchs countenance i saw him too plainly for that
i saw them both as plainly as i see you now who was the other inquired harry and mr losberne together
the very same man i told you of who came so suddenly upon me at the inn said oliver
we had our eyes fixed full upon each other and i could swear to him they took this way demanded harry are you sure as i am that the men were at the window replied oliver pointing down as he spoke to the hedge which divided the cottagegarden from the meadow
the tall man leaped over just there and the jew running a few paces to the right crept through that gap the two gentlemen watched olivers earnest face as he spoke and looking from him to each other seemed to feel satisfied of the accuracy of what he said
still in no direction were there any appearances of the trampling of men in hurried flight
the grass was long but it was trodden down nowhere save where their own feet had crushed it
the sides and brinks of the ditches were of damp clay but in no one place could they discern the print of mens shoes or the slightest mark which would indicate that any feet had pressed the ground for hours before
this is strange said harry
strange echoed the doctor
blathers and duff themselves could make nothing of it notwithstanding the evidently useless nature of their search they did not desist until the coming on of night rendered its further prosecution hopeless and even then they gave it up with reluctance
giles was dispatched to the different alehouses in the village furnished with the best description oliver could give of the appearance and dress of the strangers
of these the jew was at all events sufficiently remarkable to be remembered supposing he had been seen drinking or loitering about but giles returned without any intelligence calculated to dispel or lessen the mystery
on the next day fresh search was made and the inquiries renewed but with no better success
on the day following oliver and mr maylie repaired to the markettown in the hope of seeing or hearing something of the men there but this effort was equally fruitless
after a few days the affair began to be forgotten as most affairs are when wonder having no fresh food to support it dies away of itself
meanwhile rose was rapidly recovering
she had left her room was able to go out and mixing once more with the family carried joy into the hearts of all
but although this happy change had a visible effect on the little circle and although cheerful voices and merry laughter were once more heard in the cottage there was at times an unwonted restraint upon some there even upon rose herself which oliver could not fail to remark
mrs maylie and her son were often closeted together for a long time and more than once rose appeared with traces of tears upon her face
after mr losberne had fixed a day for his departure to chertsey these symptoms increased and it became evident that something was in progress which affected the peace of the young lady and of somebody else besides
at length one morning when rose was alone in the breakfastparlour harry maylie entered and with some hesitation begged permission to speak with her for a few moments
a fewa very fewwill suffice rose said the young man drawing his chair towards her
what i shall have to say has already presented itself to your mind the most cherished hopes of my heart are not unknown to you though from my lips you have not heard them stated rose had been very pale from the moment of his entrance but that might have been the effect of her recent illness
she merely bowed and bending over some plants that stood near waited in silence for him to proceed
iiought to have left here before said harry
you should indeed replied rose
forgive me for saying so but i wish you had i was brought here by the most dreadful and agonising of all apprehensions said the young man the fear of losing the one dear being on whom my every wish and hope are fixed
you had been dying trembling between earth and heaven
we know that when the young the beautiful and good are visited with sickness their pure spirits insensibly turn towards their bright home of lasting rest we know heaven help us
that the best and fairest of our kind too often fade in blooming there were tears in the eyes of the gentle girl as these words were spoken and when one fell upon the flower over which she bent and glistened brightly in its cup making it more beautiful it seemed as though the outpouring of her fresh young heart claimed kindred naturally with the loveliest things in nature
a creature continued the young man passionately a creature as fair and innocent of guile as one of gods own angels fluttered between life and death
oh
who could hope when the distant world to which she was akin half opened to her view that she would return to the sorrow and calamity of this
rose rose to know that you were passing away like some soft shadow which a light from above casts upon the earth to have no hope that you would be spared to those who linger here hardly to know a reason why you should be to feel that you belonged to that bright sphere whither so many of the fairest and the best have winged their early flight and yet to pray amid all these consolations that you might be restored to those who loved youthese were distractions almost too great to bear
they were mine by day and night and with them came such a rushing torrent of fears and apprehensions and selfish regrets lest you should die and never know how devotedly i loved you as almost bore down sense and reason in its course
you recovered
day by day and almost hour by hour some drop of health came back and mingling with the spent and feeble stream of life which circulated languidly within you swelled it again to a high and rushing tide
i have watched you change almost from death to life with eyes that turned blind with their eagerness and deep affection
do not tell me that you wish i had lost this for it has softened my heart to all mankind i did not mean that said rose weeping i only wish you had left here that you might have turned to high and noble pursuits again to pursuits well worthy of you there is no pursuit more worthy of me more worthy of the highest nature that exists than the struggle to win such a heart as yours said the young man taking her hand
rose my own dear rose
for yearsfor yearsi have loved you hoping to win my way to fame and then come proudly home and tell you it had been pursued only for you to share thinking in my daydreams how i would remind you in that happy moment of the many silent tokens i had given of a boys attachment and claim your hand as in redemption of some old mute contract that had been sealed between us
that time has not arrived but here with not fame won and no young vision realised i offer you the heart so long your own and stake my all upon the words with which you greet the offer your behaviour has ever been kind and noble said rose mastering the emotions by which she was agitated
as you believe that i am not insensible or ungrateful so hear my answer it is that i may endeavour to deserve you it is dear rose it is replied rose that you must endeavour to forget me not as your old and dearlyattached companion for that would wound me deeply but as the object of your love
look into the world think how many hearts you would be proud to gain are there
confide some other passion to me if you will i will be the truest warmest and most faithful friend you have there was a pause during which rose who had covered her face with one hand gave free vent to her tears
harry still retained the other
and your reasons rose he said at length in a low voice your reasons for this decision you have a right to know them rejoined rose
you can say nothing to alter my resolution
it is a duty that i must perform
i owe it alike to others and to myself to yourself yes harry
i owe it to myself that i a friendless portionless girl with a blight upon my name should not give your friends reason to suspect that i had sordidly yielded to your first passion and fastened myself a clog on all your hopes and projects
i owe it to you and yours to prevent you from opposing in the warmth of your generous nature this great obstacle to your progress in the world if your inclinations chime with your sense of duty harry began
they do not replied rose colouring deeply
then you return my love said harry
say but that dear rose say but that and soften the bitterness of this hard disappointment if i could have done so without doing heavy wrong to him i loved rejoined rose i could have have received this declaration very differently said harry
do not conceal that from me at least rose i could said rose
stay she added disengaging her hand why should we prolong this painful interview
most painful to me and yet productive of lasting happiness notwithstanding for it will be happiness to know that i once held the high place in your regard which i now occupy and every triumph you achieve in life will animate me with new fortitude and firmness
farewell harry
as we have met today we meet no more but in other relations than those in which this conversation have placed us we may be long and happily entwined and may every blessing that the prayers of a true and earnest heart can call down from the source of all truth and sincerity cheer and prosper you another word rose said harry
your reason in your own words
from your own lips let me hear it the prospect before you answered rose firmly is a brilliant one
all the honours to which great talents and powerful connections can help men in public life are in store for you
but those connections are proud and i will neither mingle with such as may hold in scorn the mother who gave me life nor bring disgrace or failure on the son of her who has so well supplied that mothers place
in a word said the young lady turning away as her temporary firmness forsook her there is a stain upon my name which the world visits on innocent heads
i will carry it into no blood but my own and the reproach shall rest alone on me one word more rose
dearest rose
one more cried harry throwing himself before her
if i had been lessless fortunate the world would call itif some obscure and peaceful life had been my destinyif i had been poor sick helplesswould you have turned from me then
or has my probable advancement to riches and honour given this scruple birth do not press me to reply answered rose
the question does not arise and never will
it is unfair almost unkind to urge it if your answer be what i almost dare to hope it is retorted harry it will shed a gleam of happiness upon my lonely way and light the path before me
it is not an idle thing to do so much by the utterance of a few brief words for one who loves you beyond all else
oh rose in the name of my ardent and enduring attachment in the name of all i have suffered for you and all you doom me to undergo answer me this one question then if your lot had been differently cast rejoined rose if you had been even a little but not so far above me if i could have been a help and comfort to you in any humble scene of peace and retirement and not a blot and drawback in ambitious and distinguished crowds i should have been spared this trial
i have every reason to be happy very happy now but then harry i own i should have been happier busy recollections of old hopes cherished as a girl long ago crowded into the mind of rose while making this avowal but they brought tears with them as old hopes will when they come back withered and they relieved her
i cannot help this weakness and it makes my purpose stronger said rose extending her hand
i must leave you now indeed i ask one promise said harry
once and only once moresay within a year but it may be much sooneri may speak to you again on this subject for the last time not to press me to alter my right determination replied rose with a melancholy smile it will be useless no said harry to hear you repeat it if you willfinally repeat it
i will lay at your feet whatever of station of fortune i may possess and if you still adhere to your present resolution will not seek by word or act to change it then let it be so rejoined rose it is but one pang the more and by that time i may be enabled to bear it better she extended her hand again
but the young man caught her to his bosom and imprinting one kiss on her beautiful forehead hurried from the room
is a very short one and may appear of no great importance in its place but it should be read notwithstanding as a sequel to the last and a key to one that will follow when its time arrives and so you are resolved to be my travelling companion this morning eh said the doctor as harry maylie joined him and oliver at the breakfasttable
why you are not in the same mind or intention two halfhours together you will tell me a different tale one of these days said harry colouring without any perceptible reason
i hope i may have good cause to do so replied mr losberne though i confess i dont think i shall
but yesterday morning you had made up your mind in a great hurry to stay here and to accompany your mother like a dutiful son to the seaside
before noon you announce that you are going to do me the honour of accompanying me as far as i go on your road to london
and at night you urge me with great mystery to start before the ladies are stirring the consequence of which is that young oliver here is pinned down to his breakfast when he ought to be ranging the meadows after botanical phenomena of all kinds
too bad isnt it oliver i should have been very sorry not to have been at home when you and mr maylie went away sir rejoined oliver
thats a fine fellow said the doctor you shall come and see me when you return
but to speak seriously harry has any communication from the great nobs produced this sudden anxiety on your part to be gone the great nobs replied harry under which designation i presume you include my most stately uncle have not communicated with me at all since i have been here nor at this time of the year is it likely that anything would occur to render necessary my immediate attendance among them well said the doctor you are a queer fellow
but of course they will get you into parliament at the election before christmas and these sudden shiftings and changes are no bad preparation for political life
theres something in that
good training is always desirable whether the race be for place cup or sweepstakes harry maylie looked as if he could have followed up this short dialogue by one or two remarks that would have staggered the doctor not a little but he contented himself with saying we shall see and pursued the subject no farther
the postchaise drove up to the door shortly afterwards and giles coming in for the luggage the good doctor bustled out to see it packed
oliver said harry maylie in a low voice let me speak a word with you oliver walked into the windowrecess to which mr maylie beckoned him much surprised at the mixture of sadness and boisterous spirits which his whole behaviour displayed
you can write well now said harry laying his hand upon his arm
i hope so sir replied oliver
i shall not be at home again perhaps for some time i wish you would write to mesay once a fortnight every alternate monday to the general post office in london
will you oh
certainly sir i shall be proud to do it exclaimed oliver greatly delighted with the commission
i should like to know howhow my mother and miss maylie are said the young man and you can fill up a sheet by telling me what walks you take and what you talk about and whether shethey i meanseem happy and quite well
you understand me oh
quite sir quite replied oliver
i would rather you did not mention it to them said harry hurrying over his words because it might make my mother anxious to write to me oftener and it is a trouble and worry to her
let it be a secret between you and me and mind you tell me everything
i depend upon you oliver quite elated and honoured by a sense of his importance faithfully promised to be secret and explicit in his communications
mr maylie took leave of him with many assurances of his regard and protection
the doctor was in the chaise giles who it had been arranged should be left behind held the door open in his hand and the womenservants were in the garden looking on
harry cast one slight glance at the latticed window and jumped into the carriage
drive on he cried hard fast full gallop
nothing short of flying will keep pace with me today halloa cried the doctor letting down the front glass in a great hurry and shouting to the postillion something very short of flying will keep pace with me
do you hear jingling and clattering till distance rendered its noise inaudible and its rapid progress only perceptible to the eye the vehicle wound its way along the road almost hidden in a cloud of dust now wholly disappearing and now becoming visible again as intervening objects or the intricacies of the way permitted
it was not until even the dusty cloud was no longer to be seen that the gazers dispersed
and there was one lookeron who remained with eyes fixed upon the spot where the carriage had disappeared long after it was many miles away for behind the white curtain which had shrouded her from view when harry raised his eyes towards the window sat rose herself
he seems in high spirits and happy she said at length
i feared for a time he might be otherwise
i was mistaken
i am very very glad tears are signs of gladness as well as grief but those which coursed down roses face as she sat pensively at the window still gazing in the same direction seemed to tell more of sorrow than of joy
in which the reader may perceive a contrast not uncommon in matrimonial cases mr bumble sat in the workhouse parlour with his eyes moodily fixed on the cheerless grate whence as it was summer time no brighter gleam proceeded than the reflection of certain sickly rays of the sun which were sent back from its cold and shining surface
a paper flycage dangled from the ceiling to which he occasionally raised his eyes in gloomy thought and as the heedless insects hovered round the gaudy network mr bumble would heave a deep sigh while a more gloomy shadow overspread his countenance
mr bumble was meditating it might be that the insects brought to mind some painful passage in his own past life
nor was mr bumbles gloom the only thing calculated to awaken a pleasing melancholy in the bosom of a spectator
there were not wanting other appearances and those closely connected with his own person which announced that a great change had taken place in the position of his affairs
the laced coat and the cocked hat where were they
he still wore kneebreeches and dark cotton stockings on his nether limbs but they were not the breeches
the coat was wideskirted and in that respect like the coat but oh how different
the mighty cocked hat was replaced by a modest round one
mr bumble was no longer a beadle
there are some promotions in life which independent of the more substantial rewards they offer require peculiar value and dignity from the coats and waistcoats connected with them
a fieldmarshal has his uniform a bishop his silk apron a counsellor his silk gown a beadle his cocked hat
strip the bishop of his apron or the beadle of his hat and lace what are they
men
mere men
dignity and even holiness too sometimes are more questions of coat and waistcoat than some people imagine
mr bumble had married mrs corney and was master of the workhouse
another beadle had come into power
on him the cocked hat goldlaced coat and staff had all three descended
and tomorrow two months it was done said mr bumble with a sigh
it seems a age mr bumble might have meant that he had concentrated a whole existence of happiness into the short space of eight weeks but the sighthere was a vast deal of meaning in the sigh
i sold myself said mr bumble pursuing the same train of relection for six teaspoons a pair of sugartongs and a milkpot with a small quantity of secondhand furniture and twenty pound in money
i went very reasonable
cheap dirt cheap cheap cried a shrill voice in mr bumbles ear you would have been dear at any price and dear enough i paid for you lord above knows that mr bumble turned and encountered the face of his interesting consort who imperfectly comprehending the few words she had overheard of his complaint had hazarded the foregoing remark at a venture
mrs
bumble maam said mr bumble with a sentimental sternness
well cried the lady
have the goodness to look at me said mr bumble fixing his eyes upon her
if she stands such a eye as that said mr bumble to himself she can stand anything
it is a eye i never knew to fail with paupers
if it fails with her my power is gone whether an exceedingly small expansion of eye be sufficient to quell paupers who being lightly fed are in no very high condition or whether the late mrs corney was particularly proof against eagle glances are matters of opinion
the matter of fact is that the matron was in no way overpowered by mr bumbles scowl but on the contrary treated it with great disdain and even raised a laugh thereat which sounded as though it were genuine
on hearing this most unexpected sound mr bumble looked first incredulous and afterwards amazed
he then relapsed into his former state nor did he rouse himself until his attention was again awakened by the voice of his partner
are you going to sit snoring there all day inquired mrs bumble
i am going to sit here as long as i think proper maam rejoined mr bumble and although i was not snoring i shall snore gape sneeze laugh or cry as the humour strikes me such being my prerogative your prerogative sneered mrs bumble with ineffable contempt
i said the word maam said mr bumble
the prerogative of a man is to command and whats the prerogative of a woman in the name of goodness cried the relict of mr corney deceased
to obey maam thundered mr bumble
your late unfortunate husband should have taught it you and then perhaps he might have been alive now
i wish he was poor man mrs bumble seeing at a glance that the decisive moment had now arrived and that a blow struck for the mastership on one side or other must necessarily be final and conclusive no sooner heard this allusion to the dead and gone than she dropped into a chair and with a loud scream that mr bumble was a hardhearted brute fell into a paroxysm of tears
but tears were not the things to find their way to mr bumbles soul his heart was waterproof
like washable beaver hats that improve with rain his nerves were rendered stouter and more vigorous by showers of tears which being tokens of weakness and so far tacit admissions of his own power pleased and exalted him
he eyed his good lady with looks of great satisfaction and begged in an encouraging manner that she should cry her hardest the exercise being looked upon by the faculty as strongly conducive to health
it opens the lungs washes the countenance exercises the eyes and softens down the temper said mr bumble
so cry away as he discharged himself of this pleasantry mr bumble took his hat from a peg and putting it on rather rakishly on one side as a man might who felt he had asserted his superiority in a becoming manner thrust his hands into his pockets and sauntered towards the door with much ease and waggishness depicted in his whole appearance
now mrs corney that was had tried the tears because they were less troublesome than a manual assault but she was quite prepared to make trial of the latter mode of proceeding as mr bumble was not long in discovering
the first proof he experienced of the fact was conveyed in a hollow sound immediately succeeded by the sudden flying off of his hat to the opposite end of the room
this preliminary proceeding laying bare his head the expert lady clasping him tightly round the throat with one hand inflicted a shower of blows dealt with singular vigour and dexterity upon it with the other
this done she created a little variety by scratching his face and tearing his hair and having by this time inflicted as much punishment as she deemed necessary for the offence she pushed him over a chair which was luckily well situated for the purpose and defied him to talk about his prerogative again if he dared
get up said mrs bumble in a voice of command
and take yourself away from here unless you want me to do something desperate mr bumble rose with a very rueful countenance wondering much what something desperate might be
picking up his hat he looked towards the door
are you going demanded mrs bumble
certainly my dear certainly rejoined mr bumble making a quicker motion towards the door
i didnt intend toim going my dear
you are so very violent that really i at this instant mrs bumble stepped hastily forward to replace the carpet which had been kicked up in the scuffle
mr bumble immediately darted out of the room without bestowing another thought on his unfinished sentence leaving the late mrs corney in full possession of the field
mr bumble was fairly taken by surprise and fairly beaten
he had a decided propensity for bullying derived no inconsiderable pleasure from the exercise of petty cruelty and consequently was it is needless to say a coward
this is by no means a disparagement to his character for many official personages who are held in high respect and admiration are the victims of similar infirmities
the remark is made indeed rather in his favour than otherwise and with a view of impressing the reader with a just sense of his qualifications for office
but the measure of his degradation was not yet full
after making a tour of the house and thinking for the first time that the poorlaws really were too hard on people and that men who ran away from their wives leaving them chargeable to the parish ought in justice to be visited with no punishment at all but rather rewarded as meritorious individuals who had suffered much mr bumble came to a room where some of the female paupers were usually employed in washing the parish linen when the sound of voices in conversation now proceeded
hem said mr bumble summoning up all his native dignity
these women at least shall continue to respect the prerogative
hallo
hallo there
what do you mean by this noise you hussies with these words mr bumble opened the door and walked in with a very fierce and angry manner which was at once exchanged for a most humiliated and cowering air as his eyes unexpectedly rested on the form of his lady wife
my dear said mr bumble i didnt know you were here didnt know i was here repeated mrs bumble
what do you do here i thought they were talking rather too much to be doing their work properly my dear replied mr bumble glancing distractedly at a couple of old women at the washtub who were comparing notes of admiration at the workhousemasters humility
you thought they were talking too much said mrs bumble
what business is it of yours why my dear urged mr bumble submissively
what business is it of yours demanded mrs bumble again
its very true youre matron here my dear submitted mr bumble but i thought you mightnt be in the way just then ill tell you what mr bumble returned his lady
we dont want any of your interference
youre a great deal too fond of poking your nose into things that dont concern you making everybody in the house laugh the moment your back is turned and making yourself look like a fool every hour in the day
be off come mr bumble seeing with excruciating feelings the delight of the two old paupers who were tittering together most rapturously hesitated for an instant
mrs bumble whose patience brooked no delay caught up a bowl of soapsuds and motioning him towards the door ordered him instantly to depart on pain of receiving the contents upon his portly person
what could mr bumble do
he looked dejectedly round and slunk away and as he reached the door the titterings of the paupers broke into a shrill chuckle of irrepressible delight
it wanted but this
he was degraded in their eyes he had lost caste and station before the very paupers he had fallen from all the height and pomp of beadleship to the lowest depth of the most snubbed henpeckery
all in two months said mr bumble filled with dismal thoughts
two months
no more than two months ago i was not only my own master but everybody elses so far as the porochial workhouse was concerned and now it was too much
mr bumble boxed the ears of the boy who opened the gate for him for he had reached the portal in his reverie and walked distractedly into the street
he walked up one street and down another until exercise had abated the first passion of his grief and then the revulsion of feeling made him thirsty
he passed a great many publichouses but at length paused before one in a byway whose parlour as he gathered from a hasty peep over the blinds was deserted save by one solitary customer
it began to rain heavily at the moment
this determined him
mr bumble stepped in and ordering something to drink as he passed the bar entered the apartment into which he had looked from the street
the man who was seated there was tall and dark and wore a large cloak
he had the air of a stranger and seemed by a certain haggardness in his look as well as by the dusty soils on his dress to have travelled some distance
he eyed bumble askance as he entered but scarcely deigned to nod his head in acknowledgment of his salutation
mr bumble had quite dignity enough for two supposing even that the stranger had been more familiar so he drank his ginandwater in silence and read the paper with great show of pomp and circumstance
it so happened however as it will happen very often when men fall into company under such circumstances that mr bumble felt every now and then a powerful inducement which he could not resist to steal a look at the stranger and that whenever he did so he withdrew his eyes in some confusion to find that the stranger was at that moment stealing a look at him
mr bumbles awkwardness was enhanced by the very remarkable expression of the strangers eye which was keen and bright but shadowed by a scowl of distrust and suspicion unlike anything he had ever observed before and repulsive to behold
when they had encountered each others glance several times in this way the stranger in a harsh deep voice broke silence
were you looking for me he said when you peered in at the window not that i am aware of unless youre mr here mr bumble stopped short for he was curious to know the strangers name and thought in his impatience he might supply the blank
i see you were not said the stranger an expression of quiet sarcasm playing about his mouth or you have known my name
you dont know it
i would recommend you not to ask for it i meant no harm young man observed mr bumble majestically
and have done none said the stranger
another silence succeeded this short dialogue which was again broken by the stranger
i have seen you before i think said he
you were differently dressed at that time and i only passed you in the street but i should know you again
you were beadle here once were you not i was said mr bumble in some surprise porochial beadle just so rejoined the other nodding his head
it was in that character i saw you
what are you now master of the workhouse rejoined mr bumble slowly and impressively to check any undue familiarity the stranger might otherwise assume
master of the workhouse young man you have the same eye to your own interest that you always had i doubt not resumed the stranger looking keenly into mr bumbles eyes as he raised them in astonishment at the question
dont scruple to answer freely man
i know you pretty well you see i suppose a married man replied mr bumble shading his eyes with his hand and surveying the stranger from head to foot in evident perplexity is not more averse to turning an honest penny when he can than a single one
porochial officers are not so well paid that they can afford to refuse any little extra fee when it comes to them in a civil and proper manner the stranger smiled and nodded his head again as much to say he had not mistaken his man then rang the bell
fill this glass again he said handing mr bumbles empty tumbler to the landlord
let it be strong and hot
you like it so i suppose not too strong replied mr bumble with a delicate cough
you understand what that means landlord said the stranger drily
the host smiled disappeared and shortly afterwards returned with a steaming jorum of which the first gulp brought the water into mr bumbles eyes
now listen to me said the stranger after closing the door and window
i came down to this place today to find you out and by one of those chances which the devil throws in the way of his friends sometimes you walked into the very room i was sitting in while you were uppermost in my mind
i want some information from you
i dont ask you to give it for nothing slight as it is
put up that to begin with as he spoke he pushed a couple of sovereigns across the table to his companion carefully as though unwilling that the chinking of money should be heard without
when mr bumble had scrupulously examined the coins to see that they were genuine and had put them up with much satisfaction in his waistcoatpocket he went on carry your memory backlet me seetwelve years last winter its a long time said mr bumble
very good
ive done it the scene the workhouse good and the time night yes and the place the crazy hole wherever it was in which miserable drabs brought forth the life and health so often denied to themselvesgave birth to puling children for the parish to rear and hid their shame rot em in the grave the lyingin room i suppose said mr bumble not quite following the strangers excited description
yes said the stranger
a boy was born there a many boys observed mr bumble shaking his head despondingly
a murrain on the young devils cried the stranger i speak of one a meeklooking palefaced boy who was apprenticed down here to a coffinmakeri wish he had made his coffin and screwed his body in itand who afterwards ran away to london as it was supposed why you mean oliver
young twist said mr bumble i remember him of course
there wasnt a obstinater young rascal its not of him i want to hear ive heard enough of him said the stranger stopping mr bumble in the outset of a tirade on the subject of poor olivers vices
its of a woman the hag that nursed his mother
where is she where is she said mr bumble whom the ginandwater had rendered facetious
it would be hard to tell
theres no midwifery there whichever place shes gone to so i suppose shes out of employment anyway what do you mean demanded the stranger sternly
that she died last winter rejoined mr bumble
the man looked fixedly at him when he had given this information and although he did not withdraw his eyes for some time afterwards his gaze gradually became vacant and abstracted and he seemed lost in thought
for some time he appeared doubtful whether he ought to be relieved or disappointed by the intelligence but at length he breathed more freely and withdrawing his eyes observed that it was no great matter
with that he rose as if to depart
but mr bumble was cunning enough and he at once saw that an opportunity was opened for the lucrative disposal of some secret in the possession of his better half
he well remembered the night of old sallys death which the occurrences of that day had given him good reason to recollect as the occasion on which he had proposed to mrs corney and although that lady had never confided to him the disclosure of which she had been the solitary witness he had heard enough to know that it related to something that had occurred in the old womans attendance as workhouse nurse upon the young mother of oliver twist
hastily calling this circumstance to mind he informed the stranger with an air of mystery that one woman had been closeted with the old harridan shortly before she died and that she could as he had reason to believe throw some light on the subject of his inquiry
how can i find her said the stranger thrown off his guard and plainly showing that all his fears whatever they were were aroused afresh by the intelligence
only through me rejoined mr bumble
when cried the stranger hastily
tomorrow rejoined bumble
at nine in the evening said the stranger producing a scrap of paper and writing down upon it an obscure address by the waterside in characters that betrayed his agitation at nine in the evening bring her to me there
i neednt tell you to be secret
its your interest with these words he led the way to the door after stopping to pay for the liquor that had been drunk
shortly remarking that their roads were different he departed without more ceremony than an emphatic repetition of the hour of appointment for the following night
on glancing at the address the parochial functionary observed that it contained no name
the stranger had not gone far so he made after him to ask it
what do you want cried the man turning quickly round as bumble touched him on the arm
following me only to ask a question said the other pointing to the scrap of paper
what name am i to ask for monks rejoined the man and strode hastily away
containing an account of what passed between mr and mrs bumble and mr monks at their nocturnal interview it was a dull close overcast summer evening
the clouds which had been threatening all day spread out in a dense and sluggish mass of vapour already yielded large drops of rain and seemed to presage a violent thunderstorm when mr and mrs bumble turning out of the main street of the town directed their course towards a scattered little colony of ruinous houses distant from it some mile and ahalf or thereabouts and erected on a low unwholesome swamp bordering upon the river
they were both wrapped in old and shabby outer garments which might perhaps serve the double purpose of protecting their persons from the rain and sheltering them from observation
the husband carried a lantern from which however no light yet shone and trudged on a few paces in front as thoughthe way being dirtyto give his wife the benefit of treading in his heavy footprints
they went on in profound silence every now and then mr bumble relaxed his pace and turned his head as if to make sure that his helpmate was following then discovering that she was close at his heels he mended his rate of walking and proceeded at a considerable increase of speed towards their place of destination
this was far from being a place of doubtful character for it had long been known as the residence of none but low ruffians who under various pretences of living by their labour subsisted chiefly on plunder and crime
it was a collection of mere hovels some hastily built with loose bricks others of old wormeaten shiptimber jumbled together without any attempt at order or arrangement and planted for the most part within a few feet of the rivers bank
a few leaky boats drawn up on the mud and made fast to the dwarf wall which skirted it and here and there an oar or coil of rope appeared at first to indicate that the inhabitants of these miserable cottages pursued some avocation on the river but a glance at the shattered and useless condition of the articles thus displayed would have led a passerby without much difficulty to the conjecture that they were disposed there rather for the preservation of appearances than with any view to their being actually employed
in the heart of this cluster of huts and skirting the river which its upper stories overhung stood a large building formerly used as a manufactory of some kind
it had in its day probably furnished employment to the inhabitants of the surrounding tenements
but it had long since gone to ruin
the rat the worm and the action of the damp had weakened and rotted the piles on which it stood and a considerable portion of the building had already sunk down into the water while the remainder tottering and bending over the dark stream seemed to wait a favourable opportunity of following its old companion and involving itself in the same fate
it was before this ruinous building that the worthy couple paused as the first peal of distant thunder reverberated in the air and the rain commenced pouring violently down
the place should be somewhere here said bumble consulting a scrap of paper he held in his hand
halloa there cried a voice from above
following the sound mr bumble raised his head and descried a man looking out of a door breasthigh on the second story
stand still a minute cried the voice ill be with you directly with which the head disappeared and the door closed
is that the man asked mr bumbles good lady
mr bumble nodded in the affirmative
then mind what i told you said the matron and be careful to say as little as you can or youll betray us at once mr bumble who had eyed the building with very rueful looks was apparently about to express some doubts relative to the advisability of proceeding any further with the enterprise just then when he was prevented by the appearance of monks who opened a small door near which they stood and beckoned them inwards
come in he cried impatiently stamping his foot upon the ground
dont keep me here the woman who had hesitated at first walked boldly in without any other invitation
mr bumble who was ashamed or afraid to lag behind followed obviously very ill at ease and with scarcely any of that remarkable dignity which was usually his chief characteristic
what the devil made you stand lingering there in the wet said monks turning round and addressing bumble after he had bolted the door behind them
wewe were only cooling ourselves stammered bumble looking apprehensively about him
cooling yourselves retorted monks
not all the rain that ever fell or ever will fall will put as much of hells fire out as a man can carry about with him
you wont cool yourself so easily dont think it with this agreeable speech monks turned short upon the matron and bent his gaze upon her till even she who was not easily cowed was fain to withdraw her eyes and turn them towards the ground
this is the woman is it demanded monks
hem
that is the woman replied mr bumble mindful of his wifes caution
you think women never can keep secrets i suppose said the matron interposing and returning as she spoke the searching look of monks
i know they will always keep one till its found out said monks
and what may that be asked the matron
the loss of their own good name replied monks
so by the same rule if a womans a party to a secret that might hang or transport her im not afraid of her telling it to anybody not i
do you understand mistress no rejoined the matron slightly colouring as she spoke
of course you dont said monks
how should you bestowing something halfway between a smile and a frown upon his two companions and again beckoning them to follow him the man hastened across the apartment which was of considerable extent but low in the roof
he was preparing to ascend a steep staircase or rather ladder leading to another floor of warehouses above when a bright flash of lightning streamed down the aperture and a peal of thunder followed which shook the crazy building to its centre
hear it he cried shrinking back
hear it
rolling and crashing on as if it echoed through a thousand caverns where the devils were hiding from it
i hate the sound he remained silent for a few moments and then removing his hands suddenly from his face showed to the unspeakable discomposure of mr bumble that it was much distorted and discoloured
these fits come over me now and then said monks observing his alarm and thunder sometimes brings them on
dont mind me now its all over for this once thus speaking he led the way up the ladder and hastily closing the windowshutter of the room into which it led lowered a lantern which hung at the end of a rope and pulley passed through one of the heavy beams in the ceiling and which cast a dim light upon an old table and three chairs that were placed beneath it
now said monks when they had all three seated themselves the sooner we come to our business the better for all
the woman know what it is does she the question was addressed to bumble but his wife anticipated the reply by intimating that she was perfectly acquainted with it
he is right in saying that you were with this hag the night she died and that she told you something about the mother of the boy you named replied the matron interrupting him
yes the first question is of what nature was her communication said monks
thats the second observed the woman with much deliberation
the first is what may the communication be worth who the devil can tell that without knowing of what kind it is asked monks
nobody better than you i am persuaded answered mrs bumble who did not want for spirit as her yokefellow could abundantly testify
humph said monks significantly and with a look of eager inquiry there may be moneys worth to get eh perhaps there may was the composed reply
something that was taken from her said monks
something that she wore
something that you had better bid interrupted mrs bumble
i have heard enough already to assure me that you are the man i ought to talk to mr bumble who had not yet been admitted by his better half into any greater share of the secret than he had originally possessed listened to this dialogue with outstretched neck and distended eyes which he directed towards his wife and monks by turns in undisguised astonishment increased if possible when the latter sternly demanded what sum was required for the disclosure
whats it worth to you asked the woman as collectedly as before
it may be nothing it may be twenty pounds replied monks
speak out and let me know which add five pounds to the sum you have named give me fiveandtwenty pounds in gold said the woman and ill tell you all i know
not before fiveandtwenty pounds exclaimed monks drawing back
i spoke as plainly as i could replied mrs bumble
its not a large sum either not a large sum for a paltry secret that may be nothing when its told cried monks impatiently and which has been lying dead for twelve years past or more such matters keep well and like good wine often double their value in course of time answered the matron still preserving the resolute indifference she had assumed
as to lying dead there are those who will lie dead for twelve thousand years to come or twelve million for anything you or i know who will tell strange tales at last what if i pay it for nothing asked monks hesitating
you can easily take it away again replied the matron
i am but a woman alone here and unprotected not alone my dear nor unprotected neither submitted mr bumble in a voice tremulous with fear i am here my dear
and besides said mr bumble his teeth chattering as he spoke mr
monks is too much of a gentleman to attempt any violence on porochial persons
mr monks is aware that i am not a young man my dear and also that i am a little run to seed as i may say but he has heerd i say i have no doubt mr monks has heerd my dear that i am a very determined officer with very uncommon strength if im once roused
i only want a little rousing thats all as mr bumble spoke he made a melancholy feint of grasping his lantern with fierce determination and plainly showed by the alarmed expression of every feature that he did want a little rousing and not a little prior to making any very warlike demonstration unless indeed against paupers or other person or persons trained down for the purpose
you are a fool said mrs bumble in reply and had better hold your tongue he had better have cut it out before he came if he cant speak in a lower tone said monks grimly
so
hes your husband eh he my husband tittered the matron parrying the question
i thought as much when you came in rejoined monks marking the angry glance which the lady darted at her spouse as she spoke
so much the better i have less hesitation in dealing with two people when i find that theres only one will between them
im in earnest
see here he thrust his hand into a sidepocket and producing a canvas bag told out twentyfive sovereigns on the table and pushed them over to the woman
now he said gather them up and when this cursed peal of thunder which i feel is coming up to break over the housetop is gone lets hear your story the thunder which seemed in fact much nearer and to shiver and break almost over their heads having subsided monks raising his face from the table bent forward to listen to what the woman should say
the faces of the three nearly touched as the two men leant over the small table in their eagerness to hear and the woman also leant forward to render her whisper audible
the sickly rays of the suspended lantern falling directly upon them aggravated the paleness and anxiety of their countenances which encircled by the deepest gloom and darkness looked ghastly in the extreme
when this woman that we called old sally died the matron began she and i were alone was there no one by asked monks in the same hollow whisper no sick wretch or idiot in some other bed
no one who could hear and might by possibility understand not a soul replied the woman we were alone
i stood alone beside the body when death came over it good said monks regarding her attentively
go on she spoke of a young creature resumed the matron who had brought a child into the world some years before not merely in the same room but in the same bed in which she then lay dying ay said monks with quivering lip and glancing over his shoulder blood
how things come about the child was the one you named to him last night said the matron nodding carelessly towards her husband the mother this nurse had robbed in life asked monks
in death replied the woman with something like a shudder
she stole from the corpse when it had hardly turned to one that which the dead mother had prayed her with her last breath to keep for the infants sake she sold it cried monks with desperate eagerness did she sell it
where
when
to whom
how long before as she told me with great difficulty that she had done this said the matron she fell back and died without saying more cried monks in a voice which from its very suppression seemed only the more furious
its a lie
ill not be played with
she said more
ill tear the life out of you both but ill know what it was she didnt utter another word said the woman to all appearance unmoved as mr bumble was very far from being by the strange mans violence but she clutched my gown violently with one hand which was partly closed and when i saw that she was dead and so removed the hand by force i found it clasped a scrap of dirty paper which contained interposed monks stretching forward
nothing replied the woman it was a pawnbrokers duplicate for what demanded monks
in good time ill tell you said the woman
i judge that she had kept the trinket for some time in the hope of turning it to better account and then had pawned it and had saved or scraped together money to pay the pawnbrokers interest year by year and prevent its running out so that if anything came of it it could still be redeemed
nothing had come of it and as i tell you she died with the scrap of paper all worn and tattered in her hand
the time was out in two days i thought something might one day come of it too and so redeemed the pledge where is it now asked monks quickly
there replied the woman
and as if glad to be relieved of it she hastily threw upon the table a small kid bag scarcely large enough for a french watch which monks pouncing upon tore open with trembling hands
it contained a little gold locket in which were two locks of hair and a plain gold weddingring
it has the word agnes engraved on the inside said the woman
there is a blank left for the surname and then follows the date which is within a year before the child was born
i found out that and this is all said monks after a close and eager scrutiny of the contents of the little packet
all replied the woman
mr bumble drew a long breath as if he were glad to find that the story was over and no mention made of taking the fiveandtwenty pounds back again and now he took courage to wipe the perspiration which had been trickling over his nose unchecked during the whole of the previous dialogue
i know nothing of the story beyond what i can guess at said his wife addressing monks after a short silence and i want to know nothing for its safer not
but i may ask you two questions may i you may ask said monks with some show of surprise but whether i answer or not is another question which makes three observed mr bumble essaying a stroke of facetiousness
is that what you expected to get from me demanded the matron
it is replied monks
the other question what do you propose to do with it
can it be used against me never rejoined monks nor against me either
see here
but dont move a step forward or your life is not worth a bulrush with these words he suddenly wheeled the table aside and pulling an iron ring in the boarding threw back a large trapdoor which opened close at mr bumbles feet and caused that gentleman to retire several paces backward with great precipitation
look down said monks lowering the lantern into the gulf
dont fear me
i could have let you down quietly enough when you were seated over it if that had been my game thus encouraged the matron drew near to the brink and even mr bumble himself impelled by curiousity ventured to do the same
the turbid water swollen by the heavy rain was rushing rapidly on below and all other sounds were lost in the noise of its plashing and eddying against the green and slimy piles
there had once been a watermill beneath the tide foaming and chafing round the few rotten stakes and fragments of machinery that yet remained seemed to dart onward with a new impulse when freed from the obstacles which had unavailingly attempted to stem its headlong course
if you flung a mans body down there where would it be tomorrow morning said monks swinging the lantern to and fro in the dark well
twelve miles down the river and cut to pieces besides replied bumble recoiling at the thought
monks drew the little packet from his breast where he had hurriedly thrust it and tying it to a leaden weight which had formed a part of some pulley and was lying on the floor dropped it into the stream
it fell straight and true as a die clove the water with a scarcely audible splash and was gone
the three looking into each others faces seemed to breathe more freely
there said monks closing the trapdoor which fell heavily back into its former position
if the sea ever gives up its dead as books say it will it will keep its gold and silver to itself and that trash among it
we have nothing more to say and may break up our pleasant party by all means observed mr bumble with great alacrity
youll keep a quiet tongue in your head will you said monks with a threatening look
i am not afraid of your wife you may depend upon me young man answered mr bumble bowing himself gradually towards the ladder with excessive politeness
on everybodys account young man on my own you know mr monks i am glad for your sake to hear it remarked monks
light your lantern
and get away from here as fast as you can it was fortunate that the conversation terminated at this point or mr bumble who had bowed himself to within six inches of the ladder would infallibly have pitched headlong into the room below
he lighted his lantern from that which monks had detached from the rope and now carried in his hand and making no effort to prolong the discourse descended in silence followed by his wife
monks brought up the rear after pausing on the steps to satisfy himself that there were no other sounds to be heard than the beating of the rain without and the rushing of the water
they traversed the lower room slowly and with caution for monks started at every shadow and mr bumble holding his lantern a foot above the ground walked not only with remarkable care but with a marvellously light step for a gentleman of his figure looking nervously about him for hidden trapdoors
the gate at which they had entered was softly unfastened and opened by monks merely exchanging a nod with their mysterious acquaintance the married couple emerged into the wet and darkness outside
they were no sooner gone than monks who appeared to entertain an invincible repugnance to being left alone called to a boy who had been hidden somewhere below
bidding him go first and bear the light he returned to the chamber he had just quitted
introduces some respectable characters with whom the reader is already acquainted and shows how monks and the jew laid their worthy heads together on the evening following that upon which the three worthies mentioned in the last chapter disposed of their little matter of business as therein narrated mr william sikes awakening from a nap drowsily growled forth an inquiry what time of night it was
the room in which mr sikes propounded this question was not one of those he had tenanted previous to the chertsey expedition although it was in the same quarter of the town and was situated at no great distance from his former lodgings
it was not in appearance so desirable a habitation as his old quarters being a mean and badlyfurnished apartment of very limited size lighted only by one small window in the shelving roof and abutting on a close and dirty lane
nor were there wanting other indications of the good gentlemans having gone down in the world of late for a great scarcity of furniture and total absence of comfort together with the disappearance of all such small moveables as spare clothes and linen bespoke a state of extreme poverty while the meagre and attenuated condition of mr sikes himself would have fully confirmed these symptoms if they had stood in any need of corroboration
the housebreaker was lying on the bed wrapped in his white greatcoat by way of dressinggown and displaying a set of features in no degree improved by the cadaverous hue of illness and the addition of a soiled nightcap and a stiff black beard of a weeks growth
the dog sat at the bedside now eyeing his master with a wistful look and now pricking his ears and uttering a low growl as some noise in the street or in the lower part of the house attracted his attention
seated by the window busily engaged in patching an old waistcoat which formed a portion of the robbers ordinary dress was a female so pale and reduced with watching and privation that there would have been considerable difficulty in recognising her as the same nancy who has already figured in this tale but for the voice in which she replied to mr sikess question
not long gone seven said the girl
how do you feel tonight bill as weak as water replied mr sikes with an imprecation on his eyes and limbs
here lend us a hand and let me get off this thundering bed anyhow illness had not improved mr sikess temper for as the girl raised him up and led him to a chair he muttered various curses on her awkwardness and struck her
whining are you said sikes
come
dont stand snivelling there
if you cant do anything better than that cut off altogether
dye hear me i hear you replied the girl turning her face aside and forcing a laugh
what fancy have you got in your head now oh
youve thought better of it have you growled sikes marking the tear which trembled in her eye
all the better for you you have why you dont mean to say youd be hard upon me tonight bill said the girl laying her hand upon his shoulder
no cried mr sikes
why not such a number of nights said the girl with a touch of womans tenderness which communicated something like sweetness of tone even to her voice such a number of nights as ive been patient with you nursing and caring for you as if you had been a child and this the first that ive seen you like yourself you wouldnt have served me as you did just now if youd thought of that would you
come come say you wouldnt well then rejoined mr sikes i wouldnt
why damme now the girlss whining again its nothing said the girl throwing herself into a chair
dont you seem to mind me
itll soon be over whatll be over demanded mr sikes in a savage voice
what foolery are you up to now again
get up and bustle about and dont come over me with your womans nonsense at any other time this remonstrance and the tone in which it was delivered would have had the desired effect but the girl being really weak and exhausted dropped her head over the back of the chair and fainted before mr sikes could get out a few of the appropriate oaths with which on similar occasions he was accustomed to garnish his threats
not knowing very well what to do in this uncommon emergency for miss nancys hysterics were usually of that violent kind which the patient fights and struggles out of without much assistance mr sikes tried a little blasphemy and finding that mode of treatment wholly ineffectual called for assistance
whats the matter here my dear said fagin looking in
lend a hand to the girl cant you replied sikes impatiently
dont stand chattering and grinning at me with an exclamation of surprise fagin hastened to the girls assistance while mr john dawkins otherwise the artful dodger who had followed his venerable friend into the room hastily deposited on the floor a bundle with which he was laden and snatching a bottle from the grasp of master charles bates who came close at his heels uncorked it in a twinkling with his teeth and poured a portion of its contents down the patients throat previously taking a taste himself to prevent mistakes
give her a whiff of fresh air with the bellows charley said mr dawkins and you slap her hands fagin while bill undoes the petticuts these united restoratives administered with great energy especially that department consigned to master bates who appeared to consider his share in the proceedings a piece of unexampled pleasantry were not long in producing the desired effect
the girl gradually recovered her senses and staggering to a chair by the bedside hid her face upon the pillow leaving mr sikes to confront the new comers in some astonishment at their unlookedfor appearance
why what evil wind has blowed you here he asked fagin
no evil wind at all my dear for evil winds blow nobody any good and ive brought something good with me that youll be glad to see
dodger my dear open the bundle and give bill the little trifles that we spent all our money on this morning in compliance with mr fagins request the artful untied this bundle which was of large size and formed of an old tablecloth and handed the articles it contained one by one to charley bates who placed them on the table with various encomiums on their rarity and excellence
sitch a rabbit pie bill exclaimed that young gentleman disclosing to view a huge pasty sitch delicate creeturs with sitch tender limbs bill that the wery bones melt in your mouth and theres no occasion to pick em half a pound of seven and sixpenny green so precious strong that if you mix it with biling water itll go nigh to blow the lid of the teapot off a pound and a half of moist sugar that the niggers didnt work at all at afore they got it up to sitch a pitch of goodnessoh no
two halfquartern brans pound of best fresh piece of double gloster and to wind up all some of the richest sort you ever lushed uttering this last panegyric master bates produced from one of his extensive pockets a fullsized winebottle carefully corked while mr dawkins at the same instant poured out a wineglassful of raw spirits from the bottle he carried which the invalid tossed down his throat without a moments hesitation
ah said fagin rubbing his hands with great satisfaction
youll do bill youll do now do exclaimed mr sikes i might have been done for twenty times over afore youd have done anything to help me
what do you mean by leaving a man in this state three weeks and more you falsehearted wagabond only hear him boys said fagin shrugging his shoulders
and us come to bring him all these beautiful things the things is well enough in their way observed mr sikes a little soothed as he glanced over the table but what have you got to say for yourself why you should leave me here down in the mouth health blunt and everything else and take no more notice of me all this mortal time than if i was that ere dogdrive him down charley i never see such a jolly dog as that cried master bates doing as he was desired
smelling the grub like a old lady a going to market
hed make his fortun on the stage that dog would and rewive the drayma besides hold your din cried sikes as the dog retreated under the bed still growling angrily
what have you got to say for yourself you withered old fence eh i was away from london a week and more my dear on a plant replied the jew
and what about the other fortnight demanded sikes
what about the other fortnight that youve left me lying here like a sick rat in his hole i couldnt help it bill
i cant go into a long explanation before company but i couldnt help it upon my honour upon your what growled sikes with excessive disgust
here
cut me off a piece of that pie one of you boys to take the taste of that out of my mouth or itll choke me dead dont be out of temper my dear urged fagin submissively
i have never forgot you bill never once no
ill pound it that you hant replied sikes with a bitter grin
youve been scheming and plotting away every hour that i have laid shivering and burning here and bill was to do this and bill was to do that and bill was to do it all dirt cheap as soon as he got well and was quite poor enough for your work
if it hadnt been for the girl i might have died there now bill remonstrated fagin eagerly catching at the word
if it hadnt been for the girl
who but poor ould fagin was the means of your having such a handy girl about you he says true enough there said nancy coming hastily forward
let him be let him be nancys appearance gave a new turn to the conversation for the boys receiving a sly wink from the wary old jew began to ply her with liquor of which however she took very sparingly while fagin assuming an unusual flow of spirits gradually brought mr sikes into a better temper by affecting to regard his threats as a little pleasant banter and moreover by laughing very heartily at one or two rough jokes which after repeated applications to the spiritbottle he condescended to make
its all very well said mr sikes but i must have some blunt from you tonight i havent a piece of coin about me replied the jew
then youve got lots at home retorted sikes and i must have some from there lots cried fagin holding up is hands
i havent so much as would i dont know how much youve got and i dare say you hardly know yourself as it would take a pretty long time to count it said sikes but i must have some tonight and thats flat well well said fagin with a sigh ill send the artful round presently you wont do nothing of the kind rejoined mr sikes
the artfuls a deal too artful and would forget to come or lose his way or get dodged by traps and so be perwented or anything for an excuse if you put him up to it
nancy shall go to the ken and fetch it to make all sure and ill lie down and have a snooze while shes gone after a great deal of haggling and squabbling fagin beat down the amount of the required advance from five pounds to three pounds four and sixpence protesting with many solemn asseverations that that would only leave him eighteenpence to keep house with mr sikes sullenly remarking that if he couldnt get any more he must accompany him home with the dodger and master bates put the eatables in the cupboard
the jew then taking leave of his affectionate friend returned homeward attended by nancy and the boys mr sikes meanwhile flinging himself on the bed and composing himself to sleep away the time until the young ladys return
in due course they arrived at fagins abode where they found toby crackit and mr chitling intent upon their fifteenth game at cribbage which it is scarcely necessary to say the latter gentleman lost and with it his fifteenth and last sixpence much to the amusement of his young friends
mr crackit apparently somewhat ashamed at being found relaxing himself with a gentleman so much his inferior in station and mental endowments yawned and inquiring after sikes took up his hat to go
has nobody been toby asked fagin
not a living leg answered mr crackit pulling up his collar its been as dull as swipes
you ought to stand something handsome fagin to recompense me for keeping house so long
damme im as flat as a juryman and should have gone to sleep as fast as newgate if i hadnt had the good natur to amuse this youngster
horrid dull im blessed if i ant with these and other ejaculations of the same kind mr toby crackit swept up his winnings and crammed them into his waistcoat pocket with a haughty air as though such small pieces of silver were wholly beneath the consideration of a man of his figure this done he swaggered out of the room with so much elegance and gentility that mr chitling bestowing numerous admiring glances on his legs and boots till they were out of sight assured the company that he considered his acquaintance cheap at fifteen sixpences an interview and that he didnt value his losses the snap of his little finger
wot a rum chap you are tom said master bates highly amused by this declaration
not a bit of it replied mr chitling
am i fagin a very clever fellow my dear said fagin patting him on the shoulder and winking to his other pupils
and mr crackit is a heavy swell ant he fagin asked tom
no doubt at all of that my dear and it is a creditable thing to have his acquaintance ant it fagin pursued tom
very much so indeed my dear
theyre only jealous tom because he wont give it to them ah cried tom triumphantly thats where it is
he has cleaned me out
but i can go and earn some more when i like cant i fagin to be sure you can and the sooner you go the better tom so make up your loss at once and dont lose any more time
dodger
charley
its time you were on the lay
come
its near ten and nothing done yet in obedience to this hint the boys nodding to nancy took up their hats and left the room the dodger and his vivacious friend indulging as they went in many witticisms at the expense of mr chitling in whose conduct it is but justice to say there was nothing very conspicuous or peculiar inasmuch as there are a great number of spirited young bloods upon town who pay a much higher price than mr chitling for being seen in good society and a great number of fine gentlemen composing the good society aforesaid who established their reputation upon very much the same footing as flash toby crackit
now said fagin when they had left the room ill go and get you that cash nancy
this is only the key of a little cupboard where i keep a few odd things the boys get my dear
i never lock up my money for ive got none to lock up my dearha
ha
hanone to lock up
its a poor trade nancy and no thanks but im fond of seeing the young people about me and i bear it all i bear it all
hush he said hastily concealing the key in his breast whos that
listen the girl who was sitting at the table with her arms folded appeared in no way interested in the arrival or to care whether the person whoever he was came or went until the murmur of a mans voice reached her ears
the instant she caught the sound she tore off her bonnet and shawl with the rapidity of lightning and thrust them under the table
the jew turning round immediately afterwards she muttered a complaint of the heat in a tone of languor that contrasted very remarkably with the extreme haste and violence of this action which however had been unobserved by fagin who had his back towards her at the time
bah he whispered as though nettled by the interruption its the man i expected before hes coming downstairs
not a word about the money while hes here nance
he wont stop long
not ten minutes my dear laying his skinny forefinger upon his lip the jew carried a candle to the door as a mans step was heard upon the stairs without
he reached it at the same moment as the visitor who coming hastily into the room was close upon the girl before he observed her
it was monks
only one of my young people said fagin observing that monks drew back on beholding a stranger
dont move nancy the girl drew closer to the table and glancing at monks with an air of careless levity withdrew her eyes but as he turned towards fagin she stole another look so keen and searching and full of purpose that if there had been any bystander to observe the change he could hardly have believed the two looks to have proceeded from the same person
any news inquired fagin
great andandgood asked fagin hesitating as though he feared to vex the other man by being too sanguine
not bad any way replied monks with a smile
i have been prompt enough this time
let me have a word with you the girl drew closer to the table and made no offer to leave the room although she could see that monks was pointing to her
the jew perhaps fearing she might say something aloud about the money if he endeavoured to get rid of her pointed upward and took monks out of the room
not that infernal hole we were in before she could hear the man say as they went upstairs
fagin laughed and making some reply which did not reach her seemed by the creaking of the boards to lead his companion to the second story
before the sound of their footsteps had ceased to echo through the house the girl had slipped off her shoes and drawing her gown loosely over her head and muffling her arms in it stood at the door listening with breathless interest
the moment the noise ceased she glided from the room ascended the stairs with incredible softness and silence and was lost in the gloom above
the room remained deserted for a quarter of an hour or more the girl glided back with the same unearthly tread and immediately afterwards the two men were heard descending
monks went at once into the street and the jew crawled upstairs again for the money
when he returned the girl was adjusting her shawl and bonnet as if preparing to be gone
why nance exclaimed the jew starting back as he put down the candle how pale you are pale echoed the girl shading her eyes with her hands as if to look steadily at him
quite horrible
what have you been doing to yourself nothing that i know of except sitting in this close place for i dont know how long and all replied the girl carelessly
come
let me get back thats a dear with a sigh for every piece of money fagin told the amount into her hand
they parted without more conversation merely interchanging a goodnight when the girl got into the open street she sat down upon a doorstep and seemed for a few moments wholly bewildered and unable to pursue her way
suddenly she arose and hurrying on in a direction quite opposite to that in which sikes was awaiting her returned quickened her pace until it gradually resolved into a violent run
after completely exhausting herself she stopped to take breath and as if suddenly recollecting herself and deploring her inability to do something she was bent upon wrung her hands and burst into tears
it might be that her tears relieved her or that she felt the full hopelessness of her condition but she turned back and hurrying with nearly as great rapidity in the contrary direction partly to recover lost time and partly to keep pace with the violent current of her own thoughts soon reached the dwelling where she had left the housebreaker
if she betrayed any agitation when she presented herself to mr sikes he did not observe it for merely inquiring if she had brought the money and receiving a reply in the affirmative he uttered a growl of satisfaction and replacing his head upon the pillow resumed the slumbers which her arrival had interrupted
it was fortunate for her that the possession of money occasioned him so much employment next day in the way of eating and drinking and withal had so beneficial an effect in smoothing down the asperities of his temper that he had neither time nor inclination to be very critical upon her behaviour and deportment
that she had all the abstracted and nervous manner of one who is on the eve of some bold and hazardous step which it has required no common struggle to resolve upon would have been obvious to the lynxeyed fagin who would most probably have taken the alarm at once but mr sikes lacking the niceties of discrimination and being troubled with no more subtle misgivings than those which resolve themselves into a dogged roughness of behaviour towards everybody and being furthermore in an unusually amiable condition as has been already observed saw nothing unusual in her demeanor and indeed troubled himself so little about her that had her agitation been far more perceptible than it was it would have been very unlikely to have awakened his suspicions
as that day closed in the girls excitement increased and when night came on and she sat by watching until the housebreaker should drink himself asleep there was an unusual paleness in her cheek and a fire in her eye that even sikes observed with astonishment
mr sikes being weak from the fever was lying in bed taking hot water with his gin to render it less inflammatory and had pushed his glass towards nancy to be replenished for the third or fourth time when these symptoms first struck him
why burn my body said the man raising himself on his hands as he stared the girl in the face
you look like a corpse come to life again
whats the matter matter replied the girl
nothing
what do you look at me so hard for what foolery is this demanded sikes grasping her by the arm and shaking her roughly
what is it
what do you mean
what are you thinking of of many things bill replied the girl shivering and as she did so pressing her hands upon her eyes
but lord
what odds in that the tone of forced gaiety in which the last words were spoken seemed to produce a deeper impression on sikes than the wild and rigid look which had preceded them
i tell you wot it is said sikes if you havent caught the fever and got it comin on now theres something more than usual in the wind and something dangerous too
youre not agoing to
no damme
you wouldnt do that do what asked the girl
there aint said sikes fixing his eyes upon her and muttering the words to himself there aint a stauncherhearted gal going or id have cut her throat three months ago
shes got the fever coming on thats it fortifying himself with this assurance sikes drained the glass to the bottom and then with many grumbling oaths called for his physic
the girl jumped up with great alacrity poured it quickly out but with her back towards him and held the vessel to his lips while he drank off the contents
now said the robber come and sit aside of me and put on your own face or ill alter it so that you wont know it agin when you do want it the girl obeyed
sikes locking her hand in his fell back upon the pillow turning his eyes upon her face
they closed opened again closed once more again opened
he shifted his position restlessly and after dozing again and again for two or three minutes and as often springing up with a look of terror and gazing vacantly about him was suddenly stricken as it were while in the very attitude of rising into a deep and heavy sleep
the grasp of his hand relaxed the upraised arm fell languidly by his side and he lay like one in a profound trance
the laudanum has taken effect at last murmured the girl as she rose from the bedside
i may be too late even now she hastily dressed herself in her bonnet and shawl looking fearfully round from time to time as if despite the sleeping draught she expected every moment to feel the pressure of sikess heavy hand upon her shoulder then stooping softly over the bed she kissed the robbers lips and then opening and closing the roomdoor with noiseless touch hurried from the house
a watchman was crying halfpast nine down a dark passage through which she had to pass in gaining the main thoroughfare
has it long gone the halfhour asked the girl
itll strike the hour in another quarter said the man raising his lantern to her face
and i cannot get there in less than an hour or more muttered nancy brushing swiftly past him and gliding rapidly down the street
many of the shops were already closing in the back lanes and avenues through which she tracked her way in making from spitalfields towards the westend of london
the clock struck ten increasing her impatience
she tore along the narrow pavement elbowing the passengers from side to side and darting almost under the horses heads crossed crowded streets where clusters of persons were eagerly watching their opportunity to do the like
the woman is mad said the people turning to look after her as she rushed away
when she reached the more wealthy quarter of the town the streets were comparatively deserted and here her headlong progress excited a still greater curiosity in the stragglers whom she hurried past
some quickened their pace behind as though to see whither she was hastening at such an unusual rate and a few made head upon her and looked back surprised at her undiminished speed but they fell off one by one and when she neared her place of destination she was alone
it was a family hotel in a quiet but handsome street near hyde park
as the brilliant light of the lamp which burnt before its door guided her to the spot the clock struck eleven
she had loitered for a few paces as though irresolute and making up her mind to advance but the sound determined her and she stepped into the hall
the porters seat was vacant
she looked round with an air of incertitude and advanced towards the stairs
now young woman said a smartlydressed female looking out from a door behind her who do you want here a lady who is stopping in this house answered the girl
a lady was the reply accompanied with a scornful look
what lady miss maylie said nancy
the young woman who had by this time noted her appearance replied only by a look of virtuous disdain and summoned a man to answer her
to him nancy repeated her request
what name am i to say asked the waiter
its of no use saying any replied nancy
nor business said the man
no nor that neither rejoined the girl
i must see the lady come said the man pushing her towards the door
none of this
take yourself off i shall be carried out if i go said the girl violently and i can make that a job that two of you wont like to do
isnt there anybody here she said looking round that will see a simple message carried for a poor wretch like me this appeal produced an effect on a goodtemperedfaced mancook who with some of the other servants was looking on and who stepped forward to interfere
take it up for her joe cant you said this person
whats the good replied the man
you dont suppose the young lady will see such as her do you this allusion to nancys doubtful character raised a vast quantity of chaste wrath in the bosoms of four housemaids who remarked with great fervour that the creature was a disgrace to her sex and strongly advocated her being thrown ruthlessly into the kennel
do what you like with me said the girl turning to the men again but do what i ask you first and i ask you to give this message for god almightys sake the softhearted cook added his intercession and the result was that the man who had first appeared undertook its delivery
whats it to be said the man with one foot on the stairs
that a young woman earnestly asks to speak to miss maylie alone said nancy and that if the lady will only hear the first word she has to say she will know whether to hear her business or to have her turned out of doors as an impostor i say said the man youre coming it strong you give the message said the girl firmly and let me hear the answer the man ran upstairs
nancy remained pale and almost breathless listening with quivering lip to the very audible expressions of scorn of which the chaste housemaids were very prolific and of which they became still more so when the man returned and said the young woman was to walk upstairs
its no good being proper in this world said the first housemaid
brass can do better than the gold what has stood the fire said the second
the third contented herself with wondering what ladies was made of and the fourth took the first in a quartette of shameful with which the dianas concluded
regardless of all this for she had weightier matters at heart nancy followed the man with trembling limbs to a small antechamber lighted by a lamp from the ceiling
here he left her and retired
a strange interview which is a sequel to the last chamber the girls life had been squandered in the streets and among the most noisome of the stews and dens of london but there was something of the womans original nature left in her still and when she heard a light step approaching the door opposite to that by which she had entered and thought of the wide contrast which the small room would in another moment contain she felt burdened with the sense of her own deep shame and shrunk as though she could scarcely bear the presence of her with whom she had sought this interview
but struggling with these better feelings was pridethe vice of the lowest and most debased creatures no less than of the high and selfassured
the miserable companion of thieves and ruffians the fallen outcast of low haunts the associate of the scourings of the jails and hulks living within the shadow of the gallows itselfeven this degraded being felt too proud to betray a feeble gleam of the womanly feeling which she thought a weakness but which alone connected her with that humanity of which her wasting life had obliterated so many many traces when a very child
she raised her eyes sufficiently to observe that the figure which presented itself was that of a slight and beautiful girl then bending them on the ground she tossed her head with affected carelessness as she said its a hard matter to get to see you lady
if i had taken offence and gone away as many would have done youd have been sorry for it one day and not without reason either i am very sorry if any one has behaved harshly to you replied rose
do not think of that
tell me why you wished to see me
i am the person you inquired for the kind tone of this answer the sweet voice the gentle manner the absence of any accent of haughtiness or displeasure took the girl completely by surprise and she burst into tears
oh lady lady she said clasping her hands passionately before her face if there was more like you there would be fewer like methere wouldthere would sit down said rose earnestly
if you are in poverty or affliction i shall be truly glad to relieve you if i cani shall indeed
sit down let me stand lady said the girl still weeping and do not speak to me so kindly till you know me better
it is growing late
isisthat door shut yes said rose recoiling a few steps as if to be nearer assistance in case she should require it
why because said the girl i am about to put my life and the lives of others in your hands
i am the girl that dragged little oliver back to old fagins on the night he went out from the house in pentonville you said rose maylie
i lady replied the girl
i am the infamous creature you have heard of that lives among the thieves and that never from the first moment i can recollect my eyes and senses opening on london streets have known any better life or kinder words than they have given me so help me god
do not mind shrinking openly from me lady
i am younger than you would think to look at me but i am well used to it
the poorest women fall back as i make my way along the crowded pavement what dreadful things are these said rose involuntarily falling from her strange companion
thank heaven upon your knees dear lady cried the girl that you had friends to care for and keep you in your childhood and that you were never in the midst of cold and hunger and riot and drunkenness andandsomething worse than allas i have been from my cradle
i may use the word for the alley and the gutter were mine as they will be my deathbed i pity you said rose in a broken voice
it wrings my heart to hear you heaven bless you for your goodness rejoined the girl
if you knew what i am sometimes you would pity me indeed
but i have stolen away from those who would surely murder me if they knew i had been here to tell you what i have overheard
do you know a man named monks no said rose
he knows you replied the girl and knew you were here for it was by hearing him tell the place that i found you out i never heard the name said rose
then he goes by some other amongst us rejoined the girl which i more than thought before
some time ago and soon after oliver was put into your house on the night of the robbery isuspecting this manlistened to a conversation held between him and fagin in the dark
i found out from what i heard that monksthe man i asked you about you know yes said rose i understand that monks pursued the girl had seen him accidently with two of our boys on the day we first lost him and had known him directly to be the same child that he was watching for though i couldnt make out why
a bargain was struck with fagin that if oliver was got back he should have a certain sum and he was to have more for making him a thief which this monks wanted for some purpose of his own for what purpose asked rose
he caught sight of my shadow on the wall as i listened in the hope of finding out said the girl and there are not many people besides me that could have got out of their way in time to escape discovery
but i did and i saw him no more till last night and what occurred then ill tell you lady
last night he came again
again they went upstairs and i wrapping myself up so that my shadow would not betray me again listened at the door
the first words i heard monks say were these so the only proofs of the boys identity lie at the bottom of the river and the old hag that received them from the mother is rotting in her coffin they laughed and talked of his success in doing this and monks talking on about the boy and getting very wild said that though he had got the young devils money safely now hed rather have had it the other way for what a game it would have been to have brought down the boast of the fathers will by driving him through every jail in town and then hauling him up for some capital felony which fagin could easily manage after having made a good profit of him besides what is all this said rose
the truth lady though it comes from my lips replied the girl
then he said with oaths common enough in my ears but strange to yours that if he could gratify his hatred by taking the boys life without bringing his own neck in danger he would but as he couldnt hed be upon the watch to meet him at every turn in life and if he took advantage of his birth and history he might harm him yet
in short fagin he says jew as you are you never laid such snares as ill contrive for my young brother oliver his brother exclaimed rose
those were his words said nancy glancing uneasily round as she had scarcely ceased to do since she began to speak for a vision of sikes haunted her perpetually
and more
when he spoke of you and the other lady and said it seemed contrived by heaven or the devil against him that oliver should come into your hands he laughed and said there was some comfort in that too for how many thousands and hundreds of thousands of pounds would you not give if you had them to know who your twolegged spaniel was you do not mean said rose turning very pale to tell me that this was said in earnest he spoke in hard and angry earnest if a man ever did replied the girl shaking her head
he is an earnest man when his hatred is up
i know many who do worse things but id rather listen to them all a dozen times than to that monks once
it is growing late and i have to reach home without suspicion of having been on such an errand as this
i must get back quickly but what can i do said rose
to what use can i turn this communication without you
back
why do you wish to return to companions you paint in such terrible colors
if you repeat this information to a gentleman whom i can summon in an instant from the next room you can be consigned to some place of safety without half an hours delay i wish to go back said the girl
i must go back becausehow can i tell such things to an innocent lady like youbecause among the men i have told you of there is one the most desperate among them all that i cant leave no not even to be saved from the life i am leading now your having interfered in this dear boys behalf before said rose your coming here at so great a risk to tell me what you have heard your manner which convinces me of the truth of what you say your evident contrition and sense of shame all lead me to believe that you might yet be reclaimed
oh said the earnest girl folding her hands as the tears coursed down her face do not turn a deaf ear to the entreaties of one of your own sex the firstthe first i do believe who ever appealed to you in the voice of pity and compassion
do hear my words and let me save you yet for better things lady cried the girl sinking on her knees dear sweet angel lady you are the first that ever blessed me with such words as these and if i had heard them years ago they might have turned me from a life of sin and sorrow but it is too late it is too late it is never too late said rose for penitence and atonement it is cried the girl writhing in agony of her mind i cannot leave him now
i could not be his death why should you be asked rose
nothing could save him cried the girl
if i told others what i have told you and led to their being taken he would be sure to die
he is the boldest and has been so cruel is it possible cried rose that for such a man as this you can resign every future hope and the certainty of immediate rescue
it is madness i dont know what it is answered the girl i only know that it is so and not with me alone but with hundreds of others as bad and wretched as myself
i must go back
whether it is gods wrath for the wrong i have done i do not know but i am drawn back to him through every suffering and ill usage and i should be i believe if i knew that i was to die by his hand at last what am i to do said rose
i should not let you depart from me thus you should lady and i know you will rejoined the girl rising
you will not stop my going because i have trusted in your goodness and forced no promise from you as i might have done of what use then is the communication you have made said rose
this mystery must be investigated or how will its disclosure to me benefit oliver whom you are anxious to serve you must have some kind gentleman about you that will hear it as a secret and advise you what to do rejoined the girl
but where can i find you again when it is necessary asked rose
i do not seek to know where these dreadful people live but where will you be walking or passing at any settled period from this time will you promise me that you will have my secret strictly kept and come alone or with the only other person that knows it and that i shall not be watched or followed asked the girl
i promise you solemnly answered rose
every sunday night from eleven until the clock strikes twelve said the girl without hesitation i will walk on london bridge if i am alive stay another moment interposed rose as the girl moved hurriedly towards the door
think once again on your own condition and the opportunity you have of escaping from it
you have a claim on me not only as the voluntary bearer of this intelligence but as a woman lost almost beyond redemption
will you return to this gang of robbers and to this man when a word can save you
what fascination is it that can take you back and make you cling to wickedness and misery
oh
is there no chord in your heart that i can touch
is there nothing left to which i can appeal against this terrible infatuation when ladies as young and good and beautiful as you are replied the girl steadily give away your hearts love will carry you all lengthseven such as you who have home friends other admirers everything to fill them
when such as i who have no certain roof but the coffinlid and no friend in sickness or death but the hospital nurse set our rotten hearts on any man and let him fill the place that has been a blank through all our wretched lives who can hope to cure us
pity us ladypity us for having only one feeling of the woman left and for having that turned by a heavy judgment from a comfort and a pride into a new means of violence and suffering you will said rose after a pause take some money from me which may enable you to live without dishonestyat all events until we meet again not a penny replied the girl waving her hand
do not close your heart against all my efforts to help you said rose stepping gently forward
i wish to serve you indeed you would serve me best lady replied the girl wringing her hands if you could take my life at once for i have felt more grief to think of what i am tonight than i ever did before and it would be something not to die in the hell in which i have lived
god bless you sweet lady and send as much happiness on your head as i have brought shame on mine thus speaking and sobbing aloud the unhappy creature turned away while rose maylie overpowered by this extraordinary interview which had more the semblance of a rapid dream than an actual occurrence sank into a chair and endeavoured to collect her wandering thoughts
containing fresh discoveries and showing that suprises like misfortunes seldom come alone her situation was indeed one of no common trial and difficulty
while she felt the most eager and burning desire to penetrate the mystery in which olivers history was enveloped she could not but hold sacred the confidence which the miserable woman with whom she had just conversed had reposed in her as a young and guileless girl
her words and manner had touched rose maylies heart and mingled with her love for her young charge and scarcely less intense in its truth and fervour was her fond wish to win the outcast back to repentance and hope
they purposed remaining in london only three days prior to departing for some weeks to a distant part of the coast
it was now midnight of the first day
what course of action could she determine upon which could be adopted in eightandforty hours
or how could she postpone the journey without exciting suspicion
mr losberne was with them and would be for the next two days but rose was too well acquainted with the excellent gentlemans impetuosity and foresaw too clearly the wrath with which in the first explosion of his indignation he would regard the instrument of olivers recapture to trust him with the secret when her representations in the girls behalf could be seconded by no experienced person
these were all reasons for the greatest caution and most circumspect behaviour in communicating it to mrs maylie whose first impulse would infallibly be to hold a conference with the worthy doctor on the subject
as to resorting to any legal adviser even if she had known how to do so it was scarcely to be thought of for the same reason
once the thought occurred to her of seeking assistance from harry but this awakened the recollection of their last parting and it seemed unworthy of her to call him back whenthe tears rose to her eyes as she pursued this train of reflectionhe might have by this time learnt to forget her and to be happier away
disturbed by these different reflections inclining now to one course and then to another and again recoiling from all as each successive consideration presented itself to her mind rose passed a sleepless and anxious night
after more communing with herself next day she arrived at the desperate conclusion of consulting harry
if it be painful to him she thought to come back here how painful it will be to me
but perhaps he will not come he may write or he may come himself and studiously abstain from meeting mehe did when he went away
i hardly thought he would but it was better for us both and here rose dropped the pen and turned away as though the very paper which was to be her messenger should not see her weep
she had taken up the same pen and laid it down again fifty times and had considered and reconsidered the first line of her letter without writing the first word when oliver who had been walking in the streets with mr giles for a bodyguard entered the room in such breathless haste and violent agitation as seemed to betoken some new cause of alarm
what makes you look so flurried asked rose advancing to meet him
i hardly know how i feel as if i should be choked replied the boy
oh dear
to think that i should see him at last and you should be able to know that i have told you the truth i never thought you had told us anything but the truth said rose soothing him
but what is thisof whom do you speak i have seen the gentleman replied oliver scarcely able to articulate the gentleman who was so good to memr
brownlow that we have so often talked about where asked rose
getting out of a coach replied oliver shedding tears of delight and going into a house
i didnt speak to himi couldnt speak to him for he didnt see me and i trembled so that i was not able to go up to him
but giles asked for me whether he lived there and they said he did
look here said oliver opening a scrap of paper here it is heres where he livesim going there directly
oh dear me dear me
what shall i do when i come to see him and hear him speak again with her attention not a little distracted by these and a great many other incoherent exclamations of joy rose read the address which was craven street in the strand
she very soon determined upon turning the discovery to account
quick she said
tell them to fetch a hackneycoach and be ready to go with me
i will take you there directly without a minutes loss of time
i will only tell my aunt that we are going out for an hour and be ready as soon as you are oliver needed no prompting to despatch and in little more than five minutes they were on their way to craven street
when they arrived there rose left oliver in the coach under pretence of preparing the old gentleman to receive him and sending up her card by the servant requested to see mr brownlow on very pressing business
the servant soon returned to beg that she would walk upstairs and following him into an upper room miss maylie was presented to an elderly gentleman of benevolent appearance in a bottlegreen coat
at no great distance from whom was seated another old gentleman in nankeen breeches and gaiters who did not look particularly benevolent and who was sitting with his hands clasped on the top of a thick stick and his chin propped thereupon
dear me said the gentleman in the bottlegreen coat hastily rising with great politeness i beg your pardon young ladyi imagined it was some importunate person whoi beg you will excuse me
be seated pray mr
brownlow i believe sir said rose glancing from the other gentleman to the one who had spoken
that is my name said the old gentleman
this is my friend mr grimwig
grimwig will you leave us for a few minutes i believe interposed miss maylie that at this period of our interview i need not give that gentleman the trouble of going away
if i am correctly informed he is cognizant of the business on which i wish to speak to you mr brownlow inclined his head
mr grimwig who had made one very stiff bow and risen from his chair made another very stiff bow and dropped into it again
i shall surprise you very much i have no doubt said rose naturally embarrassed but you once showed great benevolence and goodness to a very dear young friend of mine and i am sure you will take an interest in hearing of him again indeed said mr brownlow
oliver twist you knew him as replied rose
the words no sooner escaped her lips than mr grimwig who had been affecting to dip into a large book that lay on the table upset it with a great crash and falling back in his chair discharged from his features every expression but one of unmitigated wonder and indulged in a prolonged and vacant stare then as if ashamed of having betrayed so much emotion he jerked himself as it were by a convulsion into his former attitude and looking out straight before him emitted a long deep whistle which seemed at last not to be discharged on empty air but to die away in the innermost recesses of his stomach
mr browlow was no less surprised although his astonishment was not expressed in the same eccentric manner
he drew his chair nearer to miss maylies and said do me the favour my dear young lady to leave entirely out of the question that goodness and benevolence of which you speak and of which nobody else knows anything and if you have it in your power to produce any evidence which will alter the unfavourable opinion i was once induced to entertain of that poor child in heavens name put me in possession of it a bad one
ill eat my head if he is not a bad one growled mr grimwig speaking by some ventriloquial power without moving a muscle of his face
he is a child of a noble nature and a warm heart said rose colouring and that power which has thought fit to try him beyond his years has planted in his breast affections and feelings which would do honour to many who have numbered his days six times over im only sixtyone said mr grimwig with the same rigid face
and as the devils in it if this oliver is not twelve years old at least i dont see the application of that remark do not heed my friend miss maylie said mr brownlow he does not mean what he says yes he does growled mr grimwig
no he does not said mr brownlow obviously rising in wrath as he spoke
hell eat his head if he doesnt growled mr grimwig
he would deserve to have it knocked off if he does said mr brownlow
and hed uncommonly like to see any man offer to do it responded mr grimwig knocking his stick upon the floor
having gone thus far the two old gentlemen severally took snuff and afterwards shook hands according to their invariable custom
now miss maylie said mr brownlow to return to the subject in which your humanity is so much interested
will you let me know what intelligence you have of this poor child allowing me to promise that i exhausted every means in my power of discovering him and that since i have been absent from this country my first impression that he had imposed upon me and had been persuaded by his former associates to rob me has been considerably shaken rose who had had time to collect her thoughts at once related in a few natural words all that had befallen oliver since he left mr brownlows house reserving nancys information for that gentlemans private ear and concluding with the assurance that his only sorrow for some months past had been not being able to meet with his former benefactor and friend
thank god said the old gentleman
this is great happiness to me great happiness
but you have not told me where he is now miss maylie
you must pardon my finding fault with youbut why not have brought him he is waiting in a coach at the door replied rose
at this door cried the old gentleman
with which he hurried out of the room down the stairs up the coachsteps and into the coach without another word
when the roomdoor closed behind him mr grimwig lifted up his head and converting one of the hind legs of his chair into a pivot described three distinct circles with the assistance of his stick and the table sitting in it all the time
after performing this evolution he rose and limped as fast as he could up and down the room at least a dozen times and then stopping suddenly before rose kissed her without the slightest preface
hush he said as the young lady rose in some alarm at this unusual proceeding
dont be afraid
im old enough to be your grandfather
youre a sweet girl
i like you
here they are in fact as he threw himself at one dexterous dive into his former seat mr brownlow returned accompanied by oliver whom mr grimwig received very graciously and if the gratification of that moment had been the only reward for all her anxiety and care in olivers behalf rose maylie would have been well repaid
there is somebody else who should not be forgotten by the bye said mr brownlow ringing the bell
send mrs bedwin here if you please the old housekeeper answered the summons with all dispatch and dropping a curtsey at the door waited for orders
why you get blinder every day bedwin said mr brownlow rather testily
well that i do sir replied the old lady
peoples eyes at my time of life dont improve with age sir i could have told you that rejoined mr brownlow but put on your glasses and see if you cant find out what you were wanted for will you the old lady began to rummage in her pocket for her spectacles
but olivers patience was not proof against this new trial and yielding to his first impulse he sprang into her arms
god be good to me cried the old lady embracing him it is my innocent boy my dear old nurse cried oliver
he would come backi knew he would said the old lady holding him in her arms
how well he looks and how like a gentlemans son he is dressed again
where have you been this long long while
ah
the same sweet face but not so pale the same soft eye but not so sad
i have never forgotten them or his quiet smile but have seen them every day side by side with those of my own dear children dead and gone since i was a lightsome young creature running on thus and now holding oliver from her to mark how he had grown now clasping him to her and passing her fingers fondly through his hair the good soul laughed and wept upon his neck by turns
leaving her and oliver to compare notes at leisure mr brownlow led the way into another room and there heard from rose a full narration of her interview with nancy which occasioned him no little surprise and perplexity
rose also explained her reasons for not confiding in her friend mr losberne in the first instance
the old gentleman considered that she had acted prudently and readily undertook to hold solemn conference with the worthy doctor himself
to afford him an early opportunity for the execution of this design it was arranged that he should call at the hotel at eight oclock that evening and that in the meantime mrs maylie should be cautiously informed of all that had occurred
these preliminaries adjusted rose and oliver returned home
rose had by no means overrated the measure of the good doctors wrath
nancys history was no sooner unfolded to him than he poured forth a shower of mingled threats and execrations threatened to make her the first victim of the combined ingenuity of messrs blathers and duff and actually put on his hat preparatory to sallying forth to obtain the assistance of those worthies
and doubtless he would in this first outbreak have carried the intention into effect without a moments consideration of the consequences if he had not been restrained in part by corresponding violence on the side of mr brownlow who was himself of an irascible temperament and party by such arguments and representations as seemed best calculated to dissuade him from his hotbrained purpose
then what the devil is to be done said the impetuous doctor when they had rejoined the two ladies
are we to pass a vote of thanks to all these vagabonds male and female and beg them to accept a hundred pounds or so apiece as a trifling mark of our esteem and some slight acknowledgment of their kindness to oliver not exactly that rejoined mr brownlow laughing but we must proceed gently and with great care gentleness and care exclaimed the doctor
id send them one and all to never mind where interposed mr brownlow
but reflect whether sending them anywhere is likely to attain the object we have in view what object asked the doctor
simply the discovery of olivers parentage and regaining for him the inheritance of which if this story be true he has been fraudulently deprived ah said mr losberne cooling himself with his pockethandkerchief i almost forgot that you see pursued mr brownlow placing this poor girl entirely out of the question and supposing it were possible to bring these scoundrels to justice without compromising her safety what good should we bring about hanging a few of them at least in all probability suggested the doctor and transporting the rest very good replied mr brownlow smiling but no doubt they will bring that about for themselves in the fulness of time and if we step in to forestall them it seems to me that we shall be performing a very quixotic act in direct opposition to our own interestor at least to olivers which is the same thing how inquired the doctor
thus
it is quite clear that we shall have extreme difficulty in getting to the bottom of this mystery unless we can bring this man monks upon his knees
that can only be done by stratagem and by catching him when he is not surrounded by these people
for suppose he were apprehended we have no proof against him
he is not even so far as we know or as the facts appear to us concerned with the gang in any of their robberies
if he were not discharged it is very unlikely that he could receive any further punishment than being committed to prison as a rogue and vagabond and of course ever afterwards his mouth would be so obstinately closed that he might as well for our purposes be deaf dumb blind and an idiot then said the doctor impetuously i put it to you again whether you think it reasonable that this promise to the girl should be considered binding a promise made with the best and kindest intentions but really do not discuss the point my dear young lady pray said mr brownlow interrupting rose as she was about to speak
the promise shall be kept
i dont think it will in the slightest degree interfere with our proceedings
but before we can resolve upon any precise course of action it will be necessary to see the girl to ascertain from her whether she will point out this monks on the understanding that he is to be dealt with by us and not by the law or if she will not or cannot do that to procure from her such an account of his haunts and description of his person as will enable us to identify him
she cannot be seen until next sunday night this is tuesday
i would suggest that in the meantime we remain perfectly quiet and keep these matters secret even from oliver himself although mr losberne received with many wry faces a proposal involving a delay of five whole days he was fain to admit that no better course occurred to him just then and as both rose and mrs maylie sided very strongly with mr brownlow that gentlemans proposition was carried unanimously
i should like he said to call in the aid of my friend grimwig
he is a strange creature but a shrewd one and might prove of material assistance to us i should say that he was bred a lawyer and quitted the bar in disgust because he had only one brief and a motion of course in twenty years though whether that is recommendation or not you must determine for yourselves i have no objection to your calling in your friend if i may call in mine said the doctor
we must put it to the vote replied mr brownlow who may he be that ladys son and this young ladysvery old friend said the doctor motioning towards mrs maylie and concluding with an expressive glance at her niece
rose blushed deeply but she did not make any audible objection to this motion possibly she felt in a hopeless minority and harry maylie and mr grimwig were accordingly added to the committee
we stay in town of course said mrs maylie while there remains the slightest prospect of prosecuting this inquiry with a chance of success
i will spare neither trouble nor expense in behalf of the object in which we are all so deeply interested and i am content to remain here if it be for twelve months so long as you assure me that any hope remains good rejoined mr brownlow
and as i see on the faces about me a disposition to inquire how it happened that i was not in the way to corroborate olivers tale and had so suddenly left the kingdom let me stipulate that i shall be asked no questions until such time as i may deem it expedient to forestall them by telling my own story
believe me i make this request with good reason for i might otherwise excite hopes destined never to be realised and only increase difficulties and disappointments already quite numerous enough
come
supper has been announced and young oliver who is all alone in the next room will have begun to think by this time that we have wearied of his company and entered into some dark conspiracy to thrust him forth upon the world with these words the old gentleman gave his hand to mrs maylie and escorted her into the supperroom
mr losberne followed leading rose and the council was for the present effectually broken up
an old acquaintance of olivers exhibiting decided marks of genius becomes a public character in the metropolis upon the night when nancy having lulled mr sikes to sleep hurried on her selfimposed mission to rose maylie there advanced towards london by the great north road two persons upon whom it is expedient that this history should bestow some attention
they were a man and woman or perhaps they would be better described as a male and female for the former was one of those longlimbed knockkneed shambling bony people to whom it is difficult to assign any precise agelooking as they do when they are yet boys like undergrown men and when they are almost men like overgrown boys
the woman was young but of a robust and hardy make as she need have been to bear the weight of the heavy bundle which was strapped to her back
her companion was not encumbered with much luggage as there merely dangled from a stick which he carried over his shoulder a small parcel wrapped in a common handkerchief and apparently light enough
this circumstance added to the length of his legs which were of unusual extent enabled him with much ease to keep some halfdozen paces in advance of his companion to whom he occasionally turned with an impatient jerk of the head as if reproaching her tardiness and urging her to greater exertion
thus they had toiled along the dusty road taking little heed of any object within sight save when they stepped aside to allow a wider passage for the mailcoaches which were whirling out of town until they passed through highgate archway when the foremost traveller stopped and called impatiently to his companion come on cant yer
what a lazybones yer are charlotte its a heavy load i can tell you said the female coming up almost breathless with fatigue
heavy
what are yer talking about
what are yer made for rejoined the male traveller changing his own little bundle as he spoke to the other shoulder
oh there yer are resting again
well if yer aint enough to tire anybodys patience out i dont know what is is it much farther asked the woman resting herself against a bank and looking up with the perspiration streaming from her face
much farther
yer as good as there said the longlegged tramper pointing out before him
look there
those are the lights of london theyre a good two mile off at least said the woman despondingly
never mind whether theyre two mile off or twenty said noah claypole for he it was but get up and come on or ill kick yer and so i give yer notice as noahs red nose grew redder with anger and as he crossed the road while speaking as if fully prepared to put his threat into execution the woman rose without any further remark and trudged onward by his side
where do you mean to stop for the night noah she asked after they had walked a few hundred yards
how should i know replied noah whose temper had been considerably impaired by walking
near i hope said charlotte
no not near replied mr claypole
there
not near so dont think it why not when i tell yer that i dont mean to do a thing thats enough without any why or because either replied mr claypole with dignity
well you neednt be so cross said his companion
a pretty thing it would be wouldnt it to go and stop at the very first publichouse outside the town so that sowerberry if he come up after us might poke in his old nose and have us taken back in a cart with handcuffs on said mr claypole in a jeering tone
no
i shall go and lose myself among the narrowest streets i can find and not stop till we come to the very outofthewayest house i can set eyes on
cod yer may thanks yer stars ive got a head for if we hadnt gone at first the wrong road a purpose and come back across country yerd have been locked up hard and fast a week ago my lady
and serve yer right for being a fool i know i aint as cunning as you are replied charlotte but dont put all the blame on me and say i should have been locked up
you would have been if i had been any way yer took the money from the till yer know yer did said mr claypole
i took it for you noah dear rejoined charlotte
did i keep it asked mr claypole
no you trusted in me and let me carry it like a dear and so you are said the lady chucking him under the chin and drawing her arm through his
this was indeed the case but as it was not mr claypoles habit to repose a blind and foolish confidence in anybody it should be observed in justice to that gentleman that he had trusted charlotte to this extent in order that if they were pursued the money might be found on her which would leave him an opportunity of asserting his innocence of any theft and would greatly facilitate his chances of escape
of course he entered at this juncture into no explanation of his motives and they walked on very lovingly together
in pursuance of this cautious plan mr claypole went on without halting until he arrived at the angel at islington where he wisely judged from the crowd of passengers and numbers of vehicles that london began in earnest
just pausing to observe which appeared the most crowded streets and consequently the most to be avoided he crossed into saint johns road and was soon deep in the obscurity of the intricate and dirty ways which lying between grays inn lane and smithfield render that part of the town one of the lowest and worst that improvement has left in the midst of london
through these streets noah claypole walked dragging charlotte after him now stepping into the kennel to embrace at a glance the whole external character of some small publichouse now jogging on again as some fancied appearance induced him to believe it too public for his purpose
at length he stopped in front of one more humble in appearance and more dirty than any he had yet seen and having crossed over and surveyed it from the opposite pavement graciously announced his intention of putting up there for the night
so give us the bundle said noah unstrapping it from the womans shoulders and slinging it over his own and dont yer speak except when yer spoke to
whats the name of the housethrthree what cripples said charlotte
three cripples repeated noah and a very good sign too
now then
keep close at my heels and come along with these injunctions he pushed the rattling door with his shoulder and entered the house followed by his companion
there was nobody in the bar but a young jew who with his two elbows on the counter was reading a dirty newspaper
he stared very hard at noah and noah stared very hard at him
if noah had been attired in his charityboys dress there might have been some reason for the jew opening his eyes so wide but as he had discarded the coat and badge and wore a short smockfrock over his leathers there seemed no particular reason for his appearance exciting so much attention in a publichouse
is this the three cripples asked noah
that is the dabe of this ouse replied the jew
a gentleman we met on the road coming up from the country recommended us here said noah nudging charlotte perhaps to call her attention to this most ingenious device for attracting respect and perhaps to warn her to betray no surprise
we want to sleep here tonight ib dot certaid you cad said barney who was the attendant sprite but ill idquire show us the tap and give us a bit of cold meat and a drop of beer while yer inquiring will yer said noah
barney complied by ushering them into a small backroom and setting the required viands before them having done which he informed the travellers that they could be lodged that night and left the amiable couple to their refreshment
now this backroom was immediately behind the bar and some steps lower so that any person connected with the house undrawing a small curtain which concealed a single pane of glass fixed in the wall of the lastnamed apartment about five feet from its flooring could not only look down upon any guests in the backroom without any great hazard of being observed the glass being in a dark angle of the wall between which and a large upright beam the observer had to thrust himself but could by applying his ear to the partition ascertain with tolerable distinctness their subject of conversation
the landlord of the house had not withdrawn his eye from this place of espial for five minutes and barney had only just returned from making the communication above related when fagin in the course of his evenings business came into the bar to inquire after some of his young pupils
hush said barney stradegers id the next roob strangers repeated the old man in a whisper
ah
ad rub uds too added barney
frob the cuttry but subthig in your way or ib bistaked fagin appeared to receive this communication with great interest
mounting a stool he cautiously applied his eye to the pane of glass from which secret post he could see mr claypole taking cold beef from the dish and porter from the pot and administering homeopathic doses of both to charlotte who sat patiently by eating and drinking at his pleasure
aha he whispered looking round to barney i like that fellows looks
hed be of use to us he knows how to train the girl already
dont make as much noise as a mouse my dear and let me hear em talklet me hear em he again applied his eye to the glass and turning his ear to the partition listened attentively with a subtle and eager look upon his face that might have appertained to some old goblin
so i mean to be a gentleman said mr claypole kicking out his legs and continuing a conversation the commencement of which fagin had arrived too late to hear
no more jolly old coffins charlotte but a gentlemans life for me and if yer like yer shall be a lady i should like that well enough dear replied charlotte but tills aint to be emptied every day and people to get clear off after it tills be blowed said mr claypole theres more things besides tills to be emptied what do you mean asked his companion
pockets womens ridicules houses mailcoaches banks said mr claypole rising with the porter
but you cant do all that dear said charlotte
i shall look out to get into company with them as can replied noah
theyll be able to make us useful some way or another
why you yourself are worth fifty women i never see such a precious sly and deceitful creetur as yer can be when i let yer lor how nice it is to hear yer say so exclaimed charlotte imprinting a kiss upon his ugly face
there thatll do dont yer be too affectionate in case im cross with yer said noah disengaging himself with great gravity
i should like to be the captain of some band and have the whopping of em and follering em about unbeknown to themselves
that would suit me if there was good profit and if we could only get in with some gentleman of this sort i say it would be cheap at that twentypound note youve gotespecially as we dont very well know how to get rid of it ourselves after expressing this opinion mr claypole looked into the porterpot with an aspect of deep wisdom and having well shaken its contents nodded condescendingly to charlotte and took a draught wherewith he appeared greatly refreshed
he was meditating another when the sudden opening of the door and the appearance of a stranger interrupted him
the stranger was mr fagin
and very amiable he looked and a very low bow he made as he advanced and setting himself down at the nearest table ordered something to drink of the grinning barney
a pleasant night sir but cool for the time of year said fagin rubbing his hands
from the country i see sir how do yer see that asked noah claypole
we have not so much dust as that in london replied fagin pointing from noahs shoes to those of his companion and from them to the two bundles
yer a sharp feller said noah
ha
ha
only hear that charlotte why one need be sharp in this town my dear replied the jew sinking his voice to a confidential whisper and thats the truth fagin followed up this remark by striking the side of his nose with his right forefingera gesture which noah attempted to imitate though not with complete success in consequence of his own nose not being large enough for the purpose
however mr fagin seemed to interpret the endeavour as expressing a perfect coincidence with his opinion and put about the liquor which barney reappeared with in a very friendly manner
good stuff that observed mr claypole smacking his lips
dear said fagin
a man need be always emptying a till or a pocket or a womans reticule or a house or a mailcoach or a bank if he drinks it regularly mr claypole no sooner heard this extract from his own remarks than he fell back in his chair and looked from the jew to charlotte with a countenance of ashy paleness and excessive terror
dont mind me my dear said fagin drawing his chair closer
ha
ha
it was lucky it was only me that heard you by chance
it was very lucky it was only me i didnt take it stammered noah no longer stretching out his legs like an independent gentleman but coiling them up as well as he could under his chair it was all her doing yerve got it now charlotte yer know yer have no matter whos got it or who did it my dear replied fagin glancing nevertheless with a hawks eye at the girl and the two bundles
im in that way myself and i like you for it in what way asked mr claypole a little recovering
in that way of business rejoined fagin and so are the people of the house
youve hit the right nail upon the head and are as safe here as you could be
there is not a safer place in all this town than is the cripples that is when i like to make it so
and i have taken a fancy to you and the young woman so ive said the word and you may make your minds easy noah claypoles mind might have been at ease after this assurance but his body certainly was not for he shuffled and writhed about into various uncouth positions eyeing his new friend meanwhile with mingled fear and suspicion
ill tell you more said fagin after he had reassured the girl by dint of friendly nods and muttered encouragements
i have got a friend that i think can gratify your darling wish and put you in the right way where you can take whatever department of the business you think will suit you best at first and be taught all the others yer speak as if yer were in earnest replied noah
what advantage would it be to me to be anything else inquired fagin shrugging his shoulders
here
let me have a word with you outside theres no occasion to trouble ourselves to move said noah getting his legs by gradual degrees abroad again
shell take the luggage upstairs the while
charlotte see to them bundles this mandate which had been delivered with great majesty was obeyed without the slightest demur and charlotte made the best of her way off with the packages while noah held the door open and watched her out
shes kept tolerably well under aint she he asked as he resumed his seat in the tone of a keeper who had tamed some wild animal
quite perfect rejoined fagin clapping him on the shoulder
youre a genius my dear why i suppose if i wasnt i shouldnt be here replied noah
but i say shell be back if yer lose time now what do you think said fagin
if you was to like my friend could you do better than join him is he in a good way of business thats where it is responded noah winking one of his little eyes
the top of the tree employs a power of hands has the very best society in the profession regular townmaders asked mr claypole
not a countryman among em and i dont think hed take you even on my recommendation if he didnt run rather short of assistants just now replied fagin
should i have to hand over said noah slapping his breechespocket
it couldnt possibly be done without replied fagin in a most decided manner
twenty pound thoughits a lot of money not when its in a note you cant get rid of retorted fagin
number and date taken i suppose
payment stopped at the bank
ah
its not worth much to him
itll have to go abroad and he couldnt sell it for a great deal in the market when could i see him asked noah doubtfully
tomorrow morning where here um said noah
whats the wages live like a gentlemanboard and lodging pipes and spirits freehalf of all you earn and half of all the young woman earns replied mr fagin
whether noah claypole whose rapacity was none of the least comprehensive would have acceded even to these glowing terms had he been a perfectly free agent is very doubtful but as he recollected that in the event of his refusal it was in the power of his new acquaintance to give him up to justice immediately and more unlikely things had come to pass he gradually relented and said he thought that would suit him
but yer see observed noah as she will be able to do a good deal i should like to take something very light a little fancy work suggested fagin
ah
something of that sort replied noah
what do you think would suit me now
something not too trying for the strength and not very dangerous you know
thats the sort of thing i heard you talk of something in the spy way upon the others my dear said fagin
my friend wants somebody who would do that well very much why i did mention that and i shouldnt mind turning my hand to it sometimes rejoined mr claypole slowly but it wouldnt pay by itself you know thats true observed the jew ruminating or pretending to ruminate
no it might not what do you think then asked noah anxiously regarding him
something in the sneaking way where it was pretty sure work and not much more risk than being at home what do you think of the old ladies asked fagin
theres a good deal of money made in snatching their bags and parcels and running round the corner dont they holler out a good deal and scratch sometimes asked noah shaking his head
i dont think that would answer my purpose
aint there any other line open stop said fagin laying his hand on noahs knee
the kinchin lay whats that demanded mr claypole
the kinchins my dear said fagin is the young children thats sent on errands by their mothers with sixpences and shillings and the lay is just to take their money awaytheyve always got it ready in their handsthen knock em into the kennel and walk off very slow as if there were nothing else the matter but a child fallen down and hurt itself
ha
ha
ha ha
ha roared mr claypole kicking up his legs in an ecstasy
lord thats the very thing to be sure it is replied fagin and you can have a few good beats chalked out in camden town and battle bridge and neighborhoods like that where theyre always going errands and you can upset as many kinchins as you want any hour in the day
ha
ha
ha with this fagin poked mr claypole in the side and they joined in a burst of laughter both long and loud
well thats all right said noah when he had recovered himself and charlotte had returned
what time tomorrow shall we say will ten do asked fagin adding as mr claypole nodded assent what name shall i tell my good friend mr
bolter replied noah who had prepared himself for such emergency
mr
morris bolter
this is mrs bolter mrs
bolters humble servant said fagin bowing with grotesque politeness
i hope i shall know her better very shortly do you hear the gentleman charlotte thundered mr claypole
yes noah dear replied mrs bolter extending her hand
she calls me noah as a sort of fond way of talking said mr morris bolter late claypole turning to fagin
you understand oh yes i understandperfectly replied fagin telling the truth for once
goodnight
goodnight with many adieus and good wishes mr fagin went his way
noah claypole bespeaking his good ladys attention proceeded to enlighten her relative to the arrangement he had made with all that haughtiness and air of superiority becoming not only a member of the sterner sex but a gentleman who appreciated the dignity of a special appointment on the kinchin lay in london and its vicinity
wherein is shown how the artful dodger got into trouble and so it was you that was your own friend was it asked mr claypole otherwise bolter when by virtue of the compact entered into between them he had removed next day to fagins house
cod i thought as much last night every mans his own friend my dear replied fagin with his most insinuating grin
he hasnt as good a one as himself anywhere except sometimes replied morris bolter assuming the air of a man of the world
some people are nobodys enemies but their own yer know dont believe that said fagin
when a mans his own enemy its only because hes too much his own friend not because hes careful for everybody but himself
pooh
pooh
there aint such a thing in nature there oughnt to be if there is replied mr bolter
that stands to reason
some conjurers say that number three is the magic number and some say number seven
its neither my friend neither
its number one ha
ha cried mr bolter
number one for ever in a little community like ours my dear said fagin who felt it necessary to qualify this position we have a general number one without considering me too as the same and all the other young people oh the devil exclaimed mr bolter
you see pursued fagin affecting to disregard this interruption we are so mixed up together and identified in our interests that it must be so
for instance its your object to take care of number onemeaning yourself certainly replied mr bolter
yer about right there well
you cant take care of yourself number one without taking care of me number one number two you mean said mr bolter who was largely endowed with the quality of selfishness
no i dont retorted fagin
im of the same importance to you as you are to yourself i say interrupted mr bolter yer a very nice man and im very fond of yer but we aint quite so thick together as all that comes to only think said fagin shrugging his shoulders and stretching out his hands only consider
youve done whats a very pretty thing and what i love you for doing but what at the same time would put the cravat round your throat thats so very easily tied and so very difficult to unloosein plain english the halter mr bolter put his hand to his neckerchief as if he felt it inconveniently tight and murmured an assent qualified in tone but not in substance
the gallows continued fagin the gallows my dear is an ugly fingerpost which points out a very short and sharp turning that has stopped many a bold fellows career on the broad highway
to keep in the easy road and keep it at a distance is object number one with you of course it is replied mr bolter
what do yer talk about such things for only to show you my meaning clearly said the jew raising his eyebrows
to be able to do that you depend upon me
to keep my little business all snug i depend upon you
the first is your number one the second my number one
the more you value your number one the more careful you must be of mine so we come at last to what i told you at firstthat a regard for number one holds us all together and must do so unless we would all go to pieces in company thats true rejoined mr bolter thoughtfully
oh
yer a cunning old codger mr fagin saw with delight that this tribute to his powers was no mere compliment but that he had really impressed his recruit with a sense of his wily genius which it was most important that he should entertain in the outset of their acquaintance
to strengthen an impression so desirable and useful he followed up the blow by acquainting him in some detail with the magnitude and extent of his operations blending truth and fiction together as best served his purpose and bringing both to bear with so much art that mr bolters respect visibly increased and became tempered at the same time with a degree of wholesome fear which it was highly desirable to awaken
its this mutual trust we have in each other that consoles me under heavy losses said fagin
my best hand was taken from me yesterday morning you dont mean to say he died cried mr bolter
no no replied fagin not so bad as that
not quite so bad what i suppose he was wanted interposed fagin
yes he was wanted very particular inquired mr bolter
no replied fagin not very
he was charged with attempting to pick a pocket and they found a silver snuffbox on himhis own my dear his own for he took snuff himself and was very fond of it
they remanded him till today for they thought they knew the owner
ah
he was worth fifty boxes and id give the price of as many to have him back
you should have known the dodger my dear you should have known the dodger well but i shall know him i hope dont yer think so said mr bolter
im doubtful about it replied fagin with a sigh
if they dont get any fresh evidence itll only be a summary conviction and we shall have him back again after six weeks or so but if they do its a case of lagging
they know what a clever lad he is hell be a lifer
theyll make the artful nothing less than a lifer what do you mean by lagging and a lifer demanded mr bolter
whats the good of talking in that way to me why dont yer speak so as i can understand yer fagin was about to translate these mysterious expressions into the vulgar tongue and being interpreted mr bolter would have been informed that they represented that combination of words transportation for life when the dialogue was cut short by the entry of master bates with his hands in his breechespockets and his face twisted into a look of semicomical woe
its all up fagin said charley when he and his new companion had been made known to each other
what do you mean theyve found the gentleman as owns the box two or three mores a coming to dentify him and the artfuls booked for a passage out replied master bates
i must have a full suit of mourning fagin and a hatband to wisit him in afore he sets out upon his travels
to think of jack dawkinslummy jackthe dodgerthe artful dodgergoing abroad for a common twopennyhalfpenny sneezebox
i never thought hed a done it under a gold watch chain and seals at the lowest
oh why didnt he rob some rich old gentleman of all his walables and go out as a gentleman and not like a common prig without no honour nor glory with this expression of feeling for his unfortunate friend master bates sat himself on the nearest chair with an aspect of chagrin and despondency
what do you talk about his having neither honour nor glory for exclaimed fagin darting an angry look at his pupil
wasnt he always the topsawyer among you all
is there one of you that could touch him or come near him on any scent
eh not one replied master bates in a voice rendered husky by regret not one then what do you talk of replied fagin angrily what are you blubbering for cause it isnt on the record is it said charley chafed into perfect defiance of his venerable friend by the current of his regrets cause it cant come out in the dictment cause nobody will never know half of what he was
how will he stand in the newgate calendar
praps not be there at all
oh my eye my eye wot a blow it is ha
ha cried fagin extending his right hand and turning to mr bolter in a fit of chuckling which shook him as though he had the palsy see what a pride they take in their profession my dear
aint it beautiful mr bolter nodded assent and fagin after contemplating the grief of charley bates for some seconds with evident satisfaction stepped up to that young gentleman and patted him on the shoulder
never mind charley said fagin soothingly itll come out itll be sure to come out
theyll all know what a clever fellow he was hell show it himself and not disgrace his old pals and teachers
think how young he is too
what a distinction charley to be lagged at his time of life well it is a honour that is said charley a little consoled
he shall have all he wants continued the jew
he shall be kept in the stone jug charley like a gentleman
like a gentleman
with his beer every day and money in his pocket to pitch and toss with if he cant spend it no shall he though cried charley bates
ay that he shall replied fagin and well have a bigwig charley one thats got the greatest gift of the gab to carry on his defence and he shall make a speech for himself too if he likes and well read it all in the papersartful dodgershrieks of laughterhere the court was convulsedeh charley eh ha
ha laughed master bates what a lark that would be wouldnt it fagin
i say how the artful would bother em wouldnt he would cried fagin
he shallhe will ah to be sure so he will repeated charley rubbing his hands
i think i see him now cried the jew bending his eyes upon his pupil
so do i cried charley bates
ha
ha
ha
so do i i see it all afore me upon my soul i do fagin
what a game
what a regular game
all the bigwigs trying to look solemn and jack dawkins addressing of em as intimate and comfortable as if he was the judges own son making a speech arter dinnerha
ha
ha in fact mr fagin had so well humoured his young friends eccentric disposition that master bates who had at first been disposed to consider the imprisoned dodger rather in the light of a victim now looked upon him as the chief actor in a scene of most uncommon and exquisite humour and felt quite impatient for the arrival of the time when his old companion should have so favourable an opportunity of displaying his abilities
we must know how he gets on today by some handy means or other said fagin
let me think shall i go asked charley
not for the world replied fagin
are you mad my dear stark mad that youd walk into the very place whereno charley no
one is enough to lose at a time you dont mean to go yourself i suppose said charley with a humorous leer
that wouldnt quite fit replied fagin shaking his head
then why dont you send this new cove asked master bates laying his hand on noahs arm
nobody knows him why if he didnt mind observed fagin
mind interposed charley
what should he have to mind really nothing my dear said fagin turning to mr bolter really nothing oh i dare say about that yer know observed noah backing towards the door and shaking his head with a kind of sober alarm
no nonone of that
its not in my department that aint wot department has he got fagin inquired master bates surveying noahs lank form with much disgust
the cutting away when theres anything wrong and the eating all the wittles when theres everything right is that his branch never mind retorted mr bolter and dont yer take liberties with yer superiors little boy or yerll find yerself in the wrong shop master bates laughed so vehemently at this magnificent threat that it was some time before fagin could interpose and represent to mr bolter that he incurred no possible danger in visiting the policeoffice that inasmuch as no account of the little affair in which he had engaged nor any description of his person had yet been forwarded to the metropolis it was very probable that he was not even suspected of having resorted to it for shelter and that if he were properly disguised it would be as safe a spot for him to visit as any in london inasmuch as it would be of all places the very last to which he could be supposed likely to resort of his own free will
persuaded in part by these representations but overborne in a much greater degree by his fear of fagin mr bolter at length consented with a very bad grace to undertake the expedition
by fagins directions he immediately substituted for his own attire a waggoners frock velveteen breeches and leather leggings all of which articles the jew had at hand
he was likewise furnished with a felt hat well garnished with turnpike tickets and a carters whip
thus equipped he was to saunter into the office as some country fellow from covent garden market might be supposed to do for the gratification of his curiousity and as he was as awkward ungainly and rawboned a fellow as need be mr fagin had no fear but that he would look the part to perfection
these arrangements completed he was informed of the necessary signs and tokens by which to recognise the artful dodger and was conveyed by master bates through dark and winding ways to within a very short distance of bow street
having described the precise situation of the office and accompanied it with copious directions how he was to walk straight up the passage and when he got into the side and pull off his hat as he went into the room charley bates bade him hurry on alone and promised to bide his return on the spot of their parting
noah claypole or morris bolter as the reader pleases punctually followed the directions he had received whichmaster bates being pretty well acquainted with the localitywere so exact that he was enabled to gain the magisterial presence without asking any question or meeting with any interruption by the way
he found himself jostled among a crowd of people chiefly women who were huddled together in a dirty frowsy room at the upper end of which was a raised platform railed off from the rest with a dock for the prisoners on the left hand against the wall a box for the witnesses in the middle and a desk for the magistrates on the right the awful locality last named being screened off by a partition which concealed the bench from the common gaze and left the vulgar to imagine if they could the full majesty of justice
there were only a couple of women in the dock who were nodding to their admiring friends while the clerk read some depositions to a couple of policemen and a man in plain clothes who leant over the table
a jailer stood reclining against the dockrail tapping his nose listlessly with a large key except when he repressed an undue tendency to conversation among the idlers by proclaiming silence or looked sternly up to bid some woman take that baby out when the gravity of justice was disturbed by feeble cries halfsmothered in the mothers shawl from some meagre infant
the room smelt close and unwholesome the walls were dirtdiscoloured and the ceiling blackened
there was an old smoky bust over the mantelshelf and a dusty clock above the dockthe only thing present that seemed to go on as it ought for depravity or poverty or an habitual acquaintance with both had left a taint on all the animate matter hardly less unpleasant than the thick greasy scum on every inanimate object that frowned upon it
noah looked eagerly about him for the dodger but although there were several women who would have done very well for that distinguished characters mother or sister and more than one man who might be supposed to bear a strong resemblance to his father nobody at all answering the description given him of mr dawkins was to be seen
he waited in a state of much suspense and uncertainty until the women being committed for trial went flaunting out and then was quickly relieved by the appearance of another prisoner who he felt at once could be no other than the object of his visit
it was indeed mr dawkins who shuffling into the office with the big coat sleeves tucked up as usual his left hand in his pocket and his hat in his right hand preceded the jailer with a rolling gait altogether indescribable and taking his place in the dock requested in an audible voice to know what he was placed in that ere disgraceful sitivation for
hold your tongue will you said the jailer
im an englishman aint i rejoined the dodger
where are my priwileges youll get your privileges soon enough retorted the jailer and pepper with em well see wot the secretary of state for the home affairs has got to say to the beaks if i dont replied mr dawkins
now then
wot is this here business
i shall thank the madgstrates to dispose of this here little affair and not to keep me while they read the paper for ive got an appointment with a genelman in the city and as i am a man of my word and wery punctual in business matters hell go away if i aint there to my time and then praps ther wont be an action for damage against them as kep me away
oh no certainly not at this point the dodger with a show of being very particular with a view to proceedings to be had thereafter desired the jailer to communicate the names of them two files as was on the bench which so tickled the spectators that they laughed almost as heartily as master bates could have done if he had heard the request
silence there cried the jailer
what is this inquired one of the magistrates
a pickpocketing case your worship has the boy ever been here before he ought to have been a many times replied the jailer
he has been pretty well everywhere else
i know him well your worship oh
you know me do you cried the artful making a note of the statement
wery good
thats a case of deformation of character any way here there was another laugh and another cry of silence
now then where are the witnesses said the clerk
ah
thats right added the dodger
where are they
i should like to see em this wish was immediately gratified for a policeman stepped forward who had seen the prisoner attempt the pocket of an unknown gentleman in a crowd and indeed take a handkerchief therefrom which being a very old one he deliberately put back again after trying it on his own countenance
for this reason he took the dodger into custody as soon as he could get near him and the said dodger being searched had upon his person a silver snuffbox with the owners name engraved upon the lid
this gentleman had been discovered on reference to the court guide and being then and there present swore that the snuffbox was his and that he had missed it on the previous day the moment he had disengaged himself from the crowd before referred to
he had also remarked a young gentleman in the throng particularly active in making his way about and that young gentleman was the prisoner before him
have you anything to ask this witness boy said the magistrate
i wouldnt abase myself by descending to hold no conversation with him replied the dodger
have you anything to say at all do you hear his worship ask if youve anything to say inquired the jailer nudging the silent dodger with his elbow
i beg your pardon said the dodger looking up with an air of abstraction
did you redress yourself to me my man i never see such an outandout young wagabond your worship observed the officer with a grin
do you mean to say anything you young shaver no replied the dodger not here for this aint the shop for justice besides which my attorney is abreakfasting this morning with the wice president of the house of commons but i shall have something to say elsewhere and so will he and so will a wery numerous and spectable circle of acquaintance asll make them beaks wish theyd never been born or that theyd got their footmen to hang em up to their own hatpegs afore they let em come out this morning to try it on upon me
ill there
hes fully committed interposed the clerk
take him away come on said the jailer
oh ah
ill come on replied the dodger brushing his hat with the palm of his hand
ah
to the bench its no use your looking frightened i wont show you no mercy not a haporth of it
youll pay for this my fine fellers
i wouldnt be you for something
i wouldnt go free now if you was to fall down on your knees and ask me
here carry me off to prison
take me away with these last words the dodger suffered himself to be led off by the collar threatening till he got into the yard to make a parliamentary business of it and then grinning in the officers face with great glee and selfapproval
having seen him locked up by himself in a little cell noah made the best of his way back to where he had left master bates
after waiting here some time he was joined by that young gentleman who had prudently abstained from showing himself until he had looked carefully abroad from a snug retreat and ascertained that his new friend had not been followed by any impertinent person
the two hastened back together to bear to mr fagin the animating news that the dodger was doing full justice to his bringingup and establishing for himself a glorious reputation
the time arrives for nancy to redeem her pledge to rose maylie
she fails
adept as she was in all the arts of cunning and dissimulation the girl nancy could not wholly conceal the effect which the knowledge of the step she had taken wrought upon her mind
she remembered that both the crafty jew and the brutal sikes had confided to her schemes which had been hidden from all others in the full confidence that she was trustworthy and beyond the reach of their suspicion
vile as those schemes were desperate as were their originators and bitter as were her feelings towards fagin who had led her step by step deeper and deeper down into an abyss of crime and misery whence was no escape still there were times when even towards him she felt some relenting lest her disclosure should bring him within the iron grasp he had so long eluded and he should fall at lastrichly as he merited such a fateby her hand
but these were the mere wanderings of a mind unable wholly to detach itself from old companions and associations though enabled to fix itself steadily on one object and resolved not to be turned aside by any consideration
her fears for sikes would have been more powerful inducements to recoil while there was yet time but she had stipulated that her secret should be rigidly kept she had dropped no clue which could lead to his discovery she had refused even for his sake a refuge from all the guilt and wretchedness that encompasses herand what more could she do
she was resolved
though all her mental struggles terminated in this conclusion they forced themselves upon her again and again and left their traces too
she grew pale and thin even within a few days
at times she took no heed of what was passing before her or no part in conversations where once she would have been the loudest
at other times she laughed without merriment and was noisy without a moment afterwardsshe sat silent and dejected brooding with her head upon her hands while the very effort by which she roused herself told more forcibly than even these indications that she was ill at ease and that her thoughts were occupied with matters very different and distant from those in the course of discussion by her companions
it was sunday night and the bell of the nearest church struck the hour
sikes and the jew were talking but they paused to listen
the girl looked up from the low seat on which she crouched and listened too
eleven
an hour this side of midnight said sikes raising the blind to look out and returning to his seat
dark and heavy it is too
a good night for business this ah replied fagin
what a pity bill my dear that theres none quite ready to be done youre right for once replied sikes gruffly
it is a pity for im in the humour too fagin sighed and shook his head despondingly
we must make up for lost time when weve got things into a good train
thats all i know said sikes
thats the way to talk my dear replied fagin venturing to pat him on the shoulder
it does me good to hear you does you good does it cried sikes
well so be it ha
ha
ha laughed fagin as if he were relieved by even this concession
youre like yourself tonight bill
quite like yourself i dont feel like myself when you lay that withered old claw on my shoulder so take it away said sikes casting off the jews hand
it make you nervous billreminds you of being nabbed does it said fagin determined not to be offended
reminds me of being nabbed by the devil returned sikes
there never was another man with such a face as yours unless it was your father and i suppose he is singeing his grizzled red beard by this time unless you came straight from the old un without any father at all betwixt you which i shouldnt wonder at a bit fagin offered no reply to this compliment but pulling sikes by the sleeve pointed his finger towards nancy who had taken advantage of the foregoing conversation to put on her bonnet and was now leaving the room
hallo cried sikes
nance
wheres the gal going to at this time of night not far what answers that retorted sikes
do you hear me i dont know where replied the girl
then i do said sikes more in the spirit of obstinacy than because he had any real objection to the girl going where she listed
nowhere
sit down im not well
i told you that before rejoined the girl
i want a breath of air put your head out of the winder replied sikes
theres not enough there said the girl
i want it in the street then you wont have it replied sikes
with which assurance he rose locked the door took the key out and pulling her bonnet from her head flung it up to the top of an old press
there said the robber
now stop quietly where you are will you its not such a matter as a bonnet would keep me said the girl turning very pale
what do you mean bill
do you know what youre doing know what imoh cried sikes turning to fagin shes out of her senses you know or she darent talk to me in that way youll drive me on the something desperate muttered the girl placing both hands upon her breast as though to keep down by force some violent outbreak
let me go will youthis minutethis instant no said sikes
tell him to let me go fagin
he had better
itll be better for him
do you hear me cried nancy stamping her foot upon the ground
hear you repeated sikes turning round in his chair to confront her
aye
and if i hear you for half a minute longer the dog shall have such a grip on your throat asll tear some of that screaming voice out
wot has come over you you jade
wot is it let me go said the girl with great earnestness then sitting herself down on the floor before the door she said bill let me go you dont know what you are doing
you dont indeed
for only one hourdodo cut my limbs off one by one cried sikes seizing her roughly by the arm if i dont think the gals stark raving mad
get up not till you let me gonot till you let me gonevernever screamed the girl
sikes looked on for a minute watching his opportunity and suddenly pinioning her hands dragged her struggling and wrestling with him by the way into a small room adjoining where he sat himself on a bench and thrusting her into a chair held her down by force
she struggled and implored by turns until twelve oclock had struck and then wearied and exhausted ceased to contest the point any further
with a caution backed by many oaths to make no more efforts to go out that night sikes left her to recover at leisure and rejoined fagin
whew said the housebreaker wiping the perspiration from his face
wot a precious strange gal that is you may say that bill replied fagin thoughtfully
you may say that wot did she take it into her head to go out tonight for do you think asked sikes
come you should know her better than me
wot does it mean obstinacy womans obstinacy i suppose my dear well i suppose it is growled sikes
i thought i had tamed her but shes as bad as ever worse said fagin thoughtfully
i never knew her like this for such a little cause nor i said sikes
i think shes got a touch of that fever in her blood yet and it wont come outeh like enough ill let her a little blood without troubling the doctor if shes took that way again said sikes
fagin nodded an expressive approval of this mode of treatment
she was hanging about me all day and night too when i was stretched on my back and you like a blackhearted wolf as you are kept yourself aloof said sikes
we was poor too all the time and i think one way or other its worried and fretted her and that being shut up here so long has made her restlesseh thats it my dear replied the jew in a whisper
hush as he uttered these words the girl herself appeared and resumed her former seat
her eyes were swollen and red she rocked herself to and fro tossed her head and after a little time burst out laughing
why now shes on the other tack exclaimed sikes turning a look of excessive surprise on his companion
fagin nodded to him to take no further notice just then and in a few minutes the girl subsided into her accustomed demeanour
whispering sikes that there was no fear of her relapsing fagin took up his hat and bade him goodnight
he paused when he reached the roomdoor and looking round asked if somebody would light him down the dark stairs
light him down said sikes who was filling his pipe
its a pity he should break his neck himself and disappoint the sightseers
show him a light nancy followed the old man downstairs with a candle
when they reached the passage he laid his finger on his lip and drawing close to the girl said in a whisper
what is it nancy dear what do you mean replied the girl in the same tone
the reason of all this replied fagin
if hehe pointed with his skinny forefinger up the stairsis so hard with you hes a brute nance a brutebeast why dont you well said the girl as fagin paused with his mouth almost touching her ear and his eyes looking into hers
no matter just now
well talk of this again
you have a friend in me nance a staunch friend
i have the means at hand quiet and close
if you want revenge on those that treat you like a doglike a dog
worse than his dog for he humours him sometimescome to me
i say come to me
he is the mere hound of a day but you know me of old nance i know you well replied the girl without manifesting the least emotion
goodnight she shrank back as fagin offered to lay his hand on hers but said goodnight again in a steady voice and answering his parting look with a nod of intelligence closed the door between them
fagin walked towards his home intent upon the thoughts that were working within his brain
he had conceived the ideanot from what had just passed though that had tended to confirm him but slowly and by degreesthat nancy wearied of the housebreakers brutality had conceived an attachment for some new friend
her altered manner her repeated absences from home alone her comparative indifference to the interests of the gang for which she had once been so zealous and added to these her desperate impatience to leave home that night at a particular hour all favoured the supposition and rendered it to him at least almost matter of certainty
the object of this new liking was not among his myrmidons
he would be a valuable acquisition with such an assistant as nancy and must thus fagin argued be secured without delay
there was another and a darker object to be gained
sikes knew too much and his ruffian taunts had not galled fagin the less because the wounds were hidden
the girl must know well that if she shook him off she could never be safe from his fury and that it would be surely wreakedto the maiming of limbs or perhaps the loss of lifeon the object of her more recent fancy
with a little persuasion thought fagin what more likely than that she would consent to poison him
women have done such things and worse to secure the same object before now
there would be the dangerous villain the man i hate gone another secured in his place and my influence over the girl with a knowledge of this crime to back it unlimited these things passed through the mind of fagin during the short time he sat alone in the housebreakers room and with them uppermost in his thoughts he had taken the opportunity afterwards afforded him of sounding the girl in the broken hints he threw out at parting
there was no expression of surprise no assumption of an inability to understand his meaning
the girl clearly comprehended it
her glance at parting showed that
but perhaps she would recoil from a plot to take the life of sikes and that was one of the chief ends to be attained
how thought fagin as he crept homeward can i increase my influence with her
what new power can i acquire such brains are fertile in expedients
if without extracting a confession from herself he laid a watch discovered the object of her altered regard and threatened to reveal the whole history to sikes of whom she stood in no common fear unless she entered into his designs could he not secure her compliance
i can said fagin almost aloud
she durst not refuse me then
not for her life not for her life
i have it all
the means are ready and shall be set to work
i shall have you yet he cast back a dark look and a threatening motion of the hand towards the spot where he had left the bolder villain and went on his way busying his bony hands in the folds of his tattered garment which he wrenched tightly in his grasp as though there were a hated enemy crushed with every motion of his fingers
noah claypole is employed by fagin on a secret mission the old man was up betimes next morning and waited impatiently for the appearance of his new associate who after a delay that seemed interminable at length presented himself and commenced a voracious assault on the breakfast
bolter said fagin drawing up a chair and seating himself opposite morris bolter
well here i am returned noah
whats the matter
dont yer ask me to do anything till i have done eating
thats a great fault in this place
yer never get time enough over yer meals you can talk as you eat cant you said fagin cursing his dear young friends greediness from the very bottom of his heart
oh yes i can talk
i get on better when i talk said noah cutting a monstrous slice of bread
wheres charlotte out said fagin
i sent her out this morning with the other young woman because i wanted us to be alone oh said noah
i wish yerd ordered her to make some buttered toast first
well
talk away
yer wont interrupt me there seemed indeed no great fear of anything interrupting him as he had evidently sat down with a determination to do a great deal of business
you did well yesterday my dear said fagin
beautiful
six shillings and ninepence halfpenny on the very first day
the kinchin lay will be a fortune to you dont you forget to add three pintpots and a milkcan said mr bolter
no no my dear
the pintpots were great strokes of genius but the milkcan was a perfect masterpiece pretty well i think for a beginner remarked mr bolter complacently
the pots i took off airy railings and the milkcan was standing by itself outside a publichouse
i thought it might get rusty with the rain or catch cold yer know
eh
ha
ha
ha fagin affected to laugh very heartily and mr bolter having had his laugh out took a series of large bites which finished his first hunk of bread and butter and assisted himself to a second
i want you bolter said fagin leaning over the table to do a piece of work for me my dear that needs great care and caution i say rejoined bolter dont yer go shoving me into danger or sending me any more o yer policeoffices
that dont suit me that dont and so i tell yer thats not the smallest danger in itnot the very smallest said the jew its only to dodge a woman an old woman demanded mr bolter
a young one replied fagin
i can do that pretty well i know said bolter
i was a regular cunning sneak when i was at school
what am i to dodge her for
not to not to do anything but to tell me where she goes who she sees and if possible what she says to remember the street if it is a street or the house if it is a house and to bring me back all the information you can whatll yer give me asked noah setting down his cup and looking his employer eagerly in the face
if you do it well a pound my dear
one pound said fagin wishing to interest him in the scent as much as possible
and thats what i never gave yet for any job of work where there wasnt valuable consideration to be gained who is she inquired noah
one of us oh lor cried noah curling up his nose
yer doubtful of her are yer she has found out some new friends my dear and i must know who they are replied fagin
i see said noah
just to have the pleasure of knowing them if theyre respectable people eh
ha
ha
ha
im your man i knew you would be cried fagin elated by the success of his proposal
of course of course replied noah
where is she
where am i to wait for her
where am i to go all that my dear you shall hear from me
ill point her out at the proper time said fagin
you keep ready and leave the rest to me that night and the next and the next again the spy sat booted and equipped in his carters dress ready to turn out at a word from fagin
six nights passedsix long weary nightsand on each fagin came home with a disappointed face and briefly intimated that it was not yet time
on the seventh he returned earlier and with an exultation he could not conceal
it was sunday
she goes abroad tonight said fagin and on the right errand im sure for she has been alone all day and the man she is afraid of will not be back much before daybreak
come with me
quick noah started up without saying a word for the jew was in a state of such intense excitement that it infected him
they left the house stealthily and hurrying through a labyrinth of streets arrived at length before a publichouse which noah recognised as the same in which he had slept on the night of his arrival in london
it was past eleven oclock and the door was closed
it opened softly on its hinges as fagin gave a low whistle
they entered without noise and the door was closed behind them
scarcely venturing to whisper but substituting dumb show for words fagin and the young jew who had admitted them pointed out the pane of glass to noah and signed to him to climb up and observe the person in the adjoining room
is that the woman he asked scarcely above his breath
fagin nodded yes
i cant see her face well whispered noah
she is looking down and the candle is behind her stay there whispered fagin
he signed to barney who withdrew
in an instant the lad entered the room adjoining and under pretence of snuffing the candle moved it in the required position and speaking to the girl caused her to raise her face
i see her now cried the spy
plainly i should know her among a thousand he hastily descended as the roomdoor opened and the girl came out
fagin drew him behind a small partition which was curtained off and they held their breaths as she passed within a few feet of their place of concealment and emerged by the door at which they had entered
hist cried the lad who held the door
dow noah exchanged a look with fagin and darted out
to the left whispered the lad take the left had and keep od the other side he did so and by the light of the lamps saw the girls retreating figure already at some distance before him
he advanced as near as he considered prudent and kept on the opposite side of the street the better to observe her motions
she looked nervously round twice or thrice and once stopped to let two men who were following close behind her pass on
she seemed to gather courage as she advanced and to walk with a steadier and firmer step
the spy preserved the same relative distance between them and followed with his eye upon her
the appointment kept the church clocks chimed three quarters past eleven as two figures emerged on london bridge
one which advanced with a swift and rapid step was that of a woman who looked eagerly about her as though in quest of some expected object the other figure was that of a man who slunk along in the deepest shadow he could find and at some distance accommodated his pace to hers stopping when she stopped and as she moved again creeping stealthily on but never allowing himself in the ardour of his pursuit to gain upon her footsteps
thus they crossed the bridge from the middlesex to the surrey shore when the woman apparently disappointed in her anxious scrutiny of the footpassengers turned back
the movement was sudden but he who watched her was not thrown off his guard by it for shrinking into one of the recesses which surmount the piers of the bridge and leaning over the parapet the better to conceal his figure he suffered her to pass on the opposite pavement
when she was about the same distance in advance as she had been before he slipped quietly down and followed her again
at nearly the centre of the bridge she stopped
the man stopped too
it was a very dark night
the day had been unfavourable and at that hour and place there were few people stirring
such as there were hurried quickly past very possibly without seeing but certainly without noticing either the woman or the man who kept her in view
their appearance was not calculated to attract the importunate regards of such of londons destitute population as chanced to take their way over the bridge that night in search of some cold arch or doorless hovel wherein to lay their heads they stood there in silence neither speaking nor spoken to by any one who passed
a mist hung over the river deepening the red glare of the fires that burnt upon the small craft moored off the different wharfs and rendering darker and more indistinct the murky buildings on the banks
the old smokestained storehouses on either side rose heavy and dull from the dense mass of roofs and gables and frowned sternly upon water too black to reflect even their lumbering shapes
the tower of old saint saviours church and the spire of saint magnus so long the giantwarders of the ancient bridge were visible in the gloom but the forest of shipping below bridge and the thickly scattered spires of churches above were nearly all hidden from sight
the girl had taken a few restless turns to and froclosely watched meanwhile by her hidden observerwhen the heavy bell of st pauls tolled for the death of another day
midnight had come upon the crowded city
the palace the nightcellar the jail the madhouse the chambers of birth and death of health and sickness the rigid face of the corpse and the calm sleep of the child midnight was upon them all
the hour had not struck two minutes when a young lady accompanied by a greyhaired gentleman alighted from a hackneycarriage within a short distance of the bridge and having dismissed the vehicle walked straight towards it
they had scarcely set foot upon its pavement when the girl started and immediately made towards them
they walked onward looking about them with the air of persons who entertained some very slight expectation which had little chance of being realised when they were suddenly joined by this new associate
they halted with an exclamation of surprise but suppressed it immediately for a man in the garments of a countryman came close upbrushed against them indeedat that precise moment
not here said nancy hurriedly i am afraid to speak to you here
come awayout of the public roaddown the steps yonder as she uttered these words and indicated with her hand the direction in which she wished them to proceed the countryman looked round and roughly asking what they took up the whole pavement for passed on
the steps to which the girl had pointed were those which on the surrey bank and on the same side of the bridge as saint saviours church form a landingstairs from the river
to this spot the man bearing the appearance of a countryman hastened unobserved and after a moments survey of the place he began to descend
these stairs are a part of the bridge they consist of three flights
just below the end of the second going down the stone wall on the left terminates in an ornamental pilaster facing towards the thames
at this point the lower steps widen so that a person turning that angle of the wall is necessarily unseen by any others on the stairs who chance to be above him if only a step
the countryman looked hastily round when he reached this point and as there seemed no better place of concealment and the tide being out there was plenty of room he slipped aside with his back to the pilaster and there waited pretty certain that they would come no lower and that even if he could not hear what was said he could follow them again with safety
so tardily stole the time in this lonely place and so eager was the spy to penetrate the motives of an interview so different from what he had been led to expect that he more than once gave the matter up for lost and persuaded himself either that they had stopped far above or had resorted to some entirely different spot to hold their mysterious conversation
he was on the point of emerging from his hidingplace and regaining the road above when he heard the sound of footsteps and directly afterwards of voices almost close at his ear
he drew himself straight upright against the wall and scarcely breathing listened attentively
this is far enough said a voice which was evidently that of the gentleman
i will not suffer the young lady to go any farther
many people would have distrusted you too much to have come even so far but you see i am willing to humour you to humour me cried the voice of the girl whom he had followed
youre considerate indeed sir
to humour me
well well its no matter why for what said the gentleman in a kinder tone for what purpose can you have brought us to this strange place
why not have let me speak to you above there where it is light and there is something stirring instead of bringing us to this dark and dismal hole i told you before replied nancy that i was afraid to speak to you there
i dont know why it is said the girl shuddering but i have such a fear and dread upon me tonight that i can hardly stand a fear of what asked the gentleman who seemed to pity her
i scarcely know of what replied the girl
i wish i did
horrible thoughts of death and shrouds with blood upon them and a fear that has made me burn as if i was on fire have been upon me all day
i was reading a book tonight to wile the time away and the same things came into the print imagination said the gentleman soothing her
no imagination replied the girl in a hoarse voice
ill swear i saw coffin written in every page of the book in large black lettersaye and they carried one close to me in the streets tonight there is nothing unusual in that said the gentleman
they have passed me often real ones rejoined the girl
this was not there was something so uncommon in her manner that the flesh of the concealed listener crept as he heard the girl utter these words and the blood chilled within him
he had never experienced a greater relief than in hearing the sweet voice of the young lady as she begged her to be calm and not allow herself to become the prey of such fearful fancies
speak to her kindly said the young lady to her companion
poor creature
she seems to need it your haughty religious people would have held their heads up to see me as i am tonight and preached of flames and vengeance cried the girl
oh dear lady why arnt those who claim to be gods own folks as gentle and as kind to us poor wretches as you who having youth and beauty and all that they have lost might be a little proud instead of so much humbler ah said the gentleman
a turk turns his face after washing it well to the east when he says his prayers these good people after giving their faces such a rub against the world as to take the smiles off turn with no less regularity to the darkest side of heaven
between the mussulman and the pharisee commend me to the first these words appeared to be addressed to the young lady and were perhaps uttered with the view of affording nancy time to recover herself
the gentleman shortly afterwards addressed himself to her
you were not here last sunday night he said
i couldnt come replied nancy i was kept by force by whom him that i told the young lady of before you were not suspected of holding any communication with anybody on the subject which has brought us here tonight i hope asked the old gentleman
no replied the girl shaking her head
its not very easy for me to leave him unless he knows why i couldnt give him a drink of laudanum before i came away did he awake before you returned inquired the gentleman
no and neither he nor any of them suspect me good said the gentleman
now listen to me i am ready replied the girl as he paused for a moment
this young lady the gentleman began has communicated to me and to some other friends who can be safely trusted what you told her nearly a fortnight since
i confess to you that i had doubts at first whether you were to be implicitly relied upon but now i firmly believe you are i am said the girl earnestly
i repeat that i firmly believe it
to prove to you that i am disposed to trust you i tell you without reserve that we propose to extort the secret whatever it may be from the fear of this man monks
but ifif said the gentleman he cannot be secured or if secured cannot be acted upon as we wish you must deliver up the jew fagin cried the girl recoiling
that man must be delivered up by you said the gentleman
i will not do it
i will never do it replied the girl
devil that he is and worse than devil as he has been to me i will never do that you will not said the gentleman who seemed fully prepared for this answer
never returned the girl
tell me why for one reason rejoined the girl firmly for one reason that the lady knows and will stand by me in i know she will for i have her promise and for this other reason besides that bad life as he has led i have led a bad life too there are many of us who have kept the same courses together and ill not turn upon them who mightany of themhave turned upon me but didnt bad as they are then said the gentleman quickly as if this had been the point he had been aiming to attain put monks into my hands and leave him to me to deal with what if he turns against the others i promise you that in that case if the truth is forced from him there the matter will rest there must be circumstances in olivers little history which it would be painful to drag before the public eye and if the truth is once elicited they shall go scot free and if it is not suggested the girl
then pursued the gentleman this fagin shall not be brought to justice without your consent
in such a case i could show you reasons i think which would induce you to yield it have i the ladys promise for that asked the girl
you have replied rose
my true and faithful pledge monks would never learn how you knew what you do said the girl after a short pause
never replied the gentleman
the intelligence should be brought to bear upon him that he could never even guess i have been a liar and among liars from a little child said the girl after another interval of silence but i will take your words after receiving an assurance from both that she might safely do so she proceeded in a voice so low that it was often difficult for the listener to discover even the purport of what she said to describe by name and situation the publichouse whence she had been followed that night
from the manner in which she occasionally paused it appeared as if the gentleman were making some hasty notes of the information she communicated
when she had thoroughly explained the localities of the place the best position from which to watch it without exciting observation and the night and hour on which monks was most in the habit of frequenting it she seemed to consider for a few moments for the purpose of recalling his features and appearances more forcibly to her recollection
he is tall said the girl and a strongly made man but not stout he has a lurking walk and as he walks constantly looks over his shoulder first on one side and then on the other
dont forget that for his eyes are sunk in his head so much deeper than any other mans that you might almost tell him by that alone
his face is dark like his hair and eyes and although he cant be more than six or eight and twenty withered and haggard
his lips are often discoloured and disfigured with the marks of teeth for he has desperate fits and sometimes even bites his hands and covers them with woundswhy did you start said the girl stopping suddenly
the gentleman replied in a hurried manner that he was not conscious of having done so and begged her to proceed
part of this said the girl i have drawn out from other people at the house i tell you of for i have only seen him twice and both times he was covered up in a large cloak
i think thats all i can give you to know him by
stay though she added
upon his throat so high that you can see a part of it below his neckerchief when he turns his face there is a broad red mark like a burn or scald cried the gentleman
hows this said the girl
you know him the young lady uttered a cry of surprise and for a few moments they were so still that the listener could distinctly hear them breathe
i think i do said the gentleman breaking silence
i should by your description
we shall see
many people are singularly like each other
it may not be the same as he expressed himself to this effect with assumed carelessness he took a step or two nearer the concealed spy as the latter could tell from the distinctness with which he heard him mutter it must be he now he said returning so it seemed by the sound to the spot where he had stood before you have given us most valuable assistance young woman and i wish you to be the better for it
what can i do to serve you nothing replied nancy
you will not persist in saying that rejoined the gentleman with a voice and emphasis of kindness that might have touched a much harder and more obdurate heart
think now
tell me nothing sir rejoined the girl weeping
you can do nothing to help me
i am past all hope indeed you put yourself beyond its pale said the gentleman
the past has been a dreary waste with you of youthful energies misspent and such priceless treasures lavished as the creator bestows but once and never grants again but for the future you may hope
i do not say that it is in our power to offer you peace of heart and mind for that must come as you seek it but a quiet asylum either in england or if you fear to remain here in some foreign country it is not only within the compass of our ability but our most anxious wish to secure you
before the dawn of morning before this river wakes to the first glimpse of daylight you shall be placed as entirely beyond the reach of your former associates and leave as utter an absence of all trace behind you as if you were to disappear from the earth this moment
come
i would not have you go back to exchange one word with any old companion or take one look at any old haunt or breathe the very air which is pestilence and death to you
quit them all while there is time and opportunity she will be persuaded now cried the young lady
she hesitates i am sure i fear not my dear said the gentleman
no sir i do not replied the girl after a short struggle
i am chained to my old life
i loathe and hate it now but i cannot leave it
i must have gone too far to turn backand yet i dont know for if you had spoken to me so some time ago i should have laughed it off
but she said looking hastily round this fear comes over me again
i must go home home repeated the young lady with great stress upon the word
home lady rejoined the girl
to such a home as i have raised for myself with the work of my whole life
let us part
i shall be watched or seen
go
go
if i have done you any service all i ask is that you leave me and let me go my way alone it is useless said the gentleman with a sigh
we compromise her safety perhaps by staying here
we may have detained her longer than she expected already yes yes urged the girl
you have what cried the young lady can be the end of this poor creatures life what repeated the girl
look before you lady
look at that dark water
how many times do you read of such as i who spring into the tide and leave no living thing to care for or bewail them
it may be years hence or it may be only months but i shall come to that at last do not speak thus pray returned the young lady sobbing
it will never reach your ears dear lady and god forbid such horrors should replied the girl
goodnight goodnight the gentleman turned away
this purse cried the young lady
take it for my sake that you may have some resource in an hour of need and trouble no replied the girl
i have not done this for money
let me have that to think of
and yetgive me something that you have worn i should like to have somethingno no not a ringyour gloves or handkerchiefanything that i can keep as having belonged to you sweet lady
there
bless you
god bless you
goodnight goodnight the violent agitation of the girl and the apprehension of some discovery which would subject her to illusage and violence seemed to determine the gentleman to leave her as she requested
the sound of retreating footsteps were audible and the voices ceased
the two figures of the young lady and her companion soon afterwards appeared upon the bridge
they stopped at the summit of the stairs
hark cried the young lady listening
did she call
i thought i heard her voice no my love replied mr brownlow looking sadly back
she has not moved and will not till we are gone rose maylie lingered but the old gentleman drew her arm through his and led her with gentle force away
as they disappeared the girl sunk down nearly at her full length upon one of the stone stairs and vented the anguish of her heart in bitter tears
after a time she arose and with feeble and tottering steps ascended the street
the astonished listener remained motionless on his post for some minutes afterwards and having ascertained with many cautious glances round him that he was again alone crept slowly from his hidingplace and returned stealthily and in the shade of the wall in the same manner as he had descended
peeping out more than once when he reached the top to make sure that he was unobserved noah claypole darted away at his utmost speed and made for the jews house as fast as his legs would carry him
fatal consequences it was nearly two hours before daybreak that time which in the autumn of the year may be truly called the dead of night when the streets are silent and deserted when even sounds appear to slumber and profligacy and riot have staggered home to dream it was at this still and silent hour that fagin sat watching in his old lair with face so distorted and pale and eyes so red and bloodshot that he looked less like a man than like some hideous phantom moist from the grave and worried by an evil spirit
he sat crouching over a cold hearth wrapped in an old torn coverlet with his face turned towards a wasting candle that stood upon a table by his side
his right hand was raised to his lips and as absorbed in thought he hit his long black nails he disclosed among his toothless gums a few such fangs as should have been a dogs or rats
stretched upon a mattress on the floor lay noah claypole fast asleep
towards him the old man sometimes directed his eyes for an instant and then brought them back again to the candle which with a longburnt wick drooping almost double and hot grease falling down in clots upon the table plainly showed that his thoughts were busy elsewhere
indeed they were
mortification at the overthrow of his notable scheme hatred of the girl who had dared to palter with strangers and utter distrust of the sincerity of her refusal to yield him up bitter disappointment at the loss of his revenge on sikes the fear of detection and ruin and death and a fierce and deadly rage kindled by all these were the passionate considerations which following close upon each other with rapid and ceaseless whirl shot through the brain of fagin as every evil thought and blackest purpose lay working at his heart
he sat without changing his attitude in the least or appearing to take the smallest heed of time until his quick ear seemed to be attracted by a footstep in the street
at last he muttered wiping his dry and fevered mouth
at last the bell rang gently as he spoke
he crept upstairs to the door and presently returned accompanied by a man muffled to the chin who carried a bundle under one arm
sitting down and throwing back his outer coat the man displayed the burly frame of sikes
there he said laying the bundle on the table
take care of that and do the most you can with it
its been trouble enough to get i thought i should have been here three hours ago fagin laid his hand upon the bundle and locking it in the cupboard sat down again without speaking
but he did not take his eyes off the robber for an instant during this action and now that they sat over against each other face to face he looked fixedly at him with his lips quivering so violently and his face so altered by the emotions which had mastered him that the housebreaker involuntarily drew back his chair and surveyed him with a look of real affright
wot now cried sikes
wot do you look at a man so for fagin raised his right hand and shook his trembling forefinger in the air but his passion was so great that the power of speech was for the moment gone
damme said sikes feeling in his breast with a look of alarm
hes gone mad
i must look to myself here no no rejoined fagin finding his voice
its notyoure not the person bill
ive nono fault to find with you oh you havent havent you said sikes looking sternly at him and ostentatiously passing a pistol into a more convenient pocket
thats luckyfor one of us
which one that is dont matter ive got that to tell you bill said fagin drawing his chair nearer will make you worse than me aye returned the robber with an incredulous air
tell away
look sharp or nance will think im lost lost cried fagin
she has pretty well settled that in her own mind already sikes looked with an aspect of great perplexity into the jews face and reading no satisfactory explanation of the riddle there clenched his coat collar in his huge hand and shook him soundly
speak will you he said or if you dont it shall be for want of breath
open your mouth and say wot youve got to say in plain words
out with it you thundering old cur out with it suppose that lad thats laying there fagin began
sikes turned round to where noah was sleeping as if he had not previously observed him
well he said resuming his former position
suppose that lad pursued fagin was to peachto blow upon us allfirst seeking out the right folks for the purpose and then having a meeting with em in the street to paint our likenesses describe every mark that they might know us by and the crib where we might be most easily taken
suppose he was to do all this and besides to blow upon a plant weve all been in more or lessof his own fancy not grabbed trapped tried earwigged by the parson and brought to it on bread and waterbut of his own fancy to please his own taste stealing out at nights to find those most interested against us and peaching to them
do you hear me cried the jew his eyes flashing with rage
suppose he did all this what then what then replied sikes with a tremendous oath
if he was left alive till i came id grind his skull under the iron heel of my boot into as many grains as there are hairs upon his head what if i did it cried fagin almost in a yell
i that knows so much and could hang so many besides myself i dont know replied sikes clenching his teeth and turning white at the mere suggestion
id do something in the jail that ud get me put in irons and if i was tried along with you id fall upon you with them in the open court and beat your brains out afore the people
i should have such strength muttered the robber poising his brawny arm that i could smash your head as if a loaded waggon had gone over it you would would i said the housebreaker
try me if it was charley or the dodger or bet or i dont care who replied sikes impatiently
whoever it was id serve them the same fagin looked hard at the robber and motioning him to be silent stooped over the bed upon the floor and shook the sleeper to rouse him
sikes leant forward in his chair looking on with his hands upon his knees as if wondering much what all this questioning and preparation was to end in
bolter bolter
poor lad said fagin looking up with an expression of devilish anticipation and speaking slowly and with marked emphasis
hes tiredtired with watching for her so longwatching for her bill wot dye mean asked sikes drawing back
fagin made no answer but bending over the sleeper again hauled him into a sitting posture
when his assumed name had been repeated several times noah rubbed his eyes and giving a heavy yawn looked sleepily about him
tell me that againonce again just for him to hear said the jew pointing to sikes as he spoke
tell yer what asked the sleepy noah shaking himself pettishly
that about nancy said fagin clutching sikes by the wrist as if to prevent his leaving the house before he had heard enough
you followed her yes to london bridge yes where she met two people so she did a gentleman and a lady that she had gone to of her own accord before who asked her to give up all her pals and monks first which she didand to describe him which she didand to tell her what house it was that we meet at and go to which she didand where it could be best watched from which she didand what time the people went there which she did
she did all this
she told it all every word without a threat without a murmurshe diddid she not cried fagin half mad with fury
all right replied noah scratching his head
thats just what it was what did they say about last sunday about last sunday replied noah considering
why i told yer that before again
tell it again cried fagin tightening his grasp on sikes and brandishing his other hand aloft as the foam flew from his lips
they asked her said noah who as he grew more wakeful seemed to have a dawning perception who sikes was they asked her why she didnt come last sunday as she promised
she said she couldnt whywhy
tell him that because she was forcibly kept at home by bill the man she had told them of before replied noah
what more of him cried fagin
what more of the man she had told them of before
tell him that tell him that why that she couldnt very easily get out of doors unless he knew where she was going to said noah and so the first time she went to see the lady sheha
ha
ha
it made me laugh when she said it that it didshe gave him a drink of laudanum hells fire cried sikes breaking fiercely from the jew
let me go flinging the old man from him he rushed from the room and darted wildly and furiously up the stairs
bill bill cried fagin following him hastily
a word
only a word the word would not have been exchanged but that the housebreaker was unable to open the door on which he was expending fruitless oaths and violence when the jew came panting up
let me out said sikes
dont speak to me its not safe
let me out i say hear me speak a word rejoined fagin laying his hand upon the lock
you wont be well replied the other
you wont betooviolent bill the day was breaking and there was light enough for the men to see each others faces
they exchanged one brief glance there was a fire in the eyes of both which could not be mistaken
i mean said fagin showing that he felt all disguise was now useless not too violent for safety
be crafty bill and not too bold sikes made no reply but pulling open the door of which fagin had turned the lock dashed into the silent streets
without one pause or moments consideration without once turning his head to the right or left or raising his eyes to the sky or lowering them to the ground but looking straight before him with savage resolution his teeth so tightly compressed that the strained jaw seemed starting through his skin the robber held on his headlong course nor muttered a word nor relaxed a muscle until he reached his own door
he opened it softly with a key strode lightly up the stairs and entering his own room doublelocked the door and lifting a heavy table against it drew back the curtain of the bed
the girl was lying halfdressed upon it
he had roused her from her sleep for she raised herself with a hurried and startled look
get up said the man
it is you bill said the girl with an expression of pleasure at his return
it is was the reply
get up there was a candle burning but the man hastily drew it from the candlestick and hurled it under the grate
seeing the faint light of early day without the girl rose to undraw the curtain
let it be said sikes thrusting his hand before her
theres enough light for wot ive got to do bill said the girl in the low voice of alarm why do you look like that at me the robber sat regarding her for a few seconds with dilated nostrils and heaving breast and then grasping her by the head and throat dragged her into the middle of the room and looking once towards the door placed his heavy hand upon her mouth
bill bill gasped the girl wrestling with the strength of mortal fearii wont scream or crynot oncehear mespeak to metell me what i have done you know you she devil returned the robber suppressing his breath
you were watched tonight every word you said was heard then spare my life for the love of heaven as i spared yours rejoined the girl clinging to him
bill dear bill you cannot have the heart to kill me
oh
think of all i have given up only this one night for you
you shall have time to think and save yourself this crime i will not loose my hold you cannot throw me off
bill bill for dear gods sake for your own for mine stop before you spill my blood
i have been true to you upon my guilty soul i have the man struggled violently to release his arms but those of the girl were clasped round his and tear her as he would he could not tear them away
bill cried the girl striving to lay her head upon his breast the gentleman and that dear lady told me tonight of a home in some foreign country where i could end my days in solitude and peace
let me see them again and beg them on my knees to show the same mercy and goodness to you and let us both leave this dreadful place and far apart lead better lives and forget how we have lived except in prayers and never see each other more
it is never too late to repent
they told me soi feel it nowbut we must have timea little little time the housebreaker freed one arm and grasped his pistol
the certainty of immediate detection if he fired flashed across his mind even in the midst of his fury and he beat it twice with all the force he could summon upon the upturned face that almost touched his own
she staggered and fell nearly blinded with the blood that rained down from a deep gash in her forehead but raising herself with difficulty on her knees drew from her bosom a white handkerchiefrose maylies ownand holding it up in her folded hands as high towards heaven as her feeble strength would allow breathed one prayer for mercy to her maker
it was a ghastly figure to look upon
the murderer staggering backward to the wall and shutting out the sight with his hand seized a heavy club and struck her down
the flight of sikes of all bad deeds that under cover of the darkness had been committed within wide londons bounds since night hung over it that was the worst
of all the horrors that rose with an ill scent upon the morning air that was the foulest and most cruel
the sunthe bright sun that brings back not light alone but new life and hope and freshness to manburst upon the crowded city in clear and radiant glory
through costlycoloured glass and papermended window through cathedral dome and rotten crevice it shed its equal ray
it lighted up the room where the murdered woman lay
it did
he tried to shut it out but it would stream in
if the sight had been a ghastly one in the dull morning what was it now in all that brilliant light
he had not moved he had been afraid to stir
there had been a moan and motion of the hand and with terror added to rage he had struck and struck again
once he threw a rug over it but it was worse to fancy the eyes and imagine them moving towards him than to see them glaring upward as if watching the reflection of the pool of gore that quivered and danced in the sunlight on the ceiling
he had plucked it off again
and there was the bodymere flesh and blood no morebut such flesh and so much blood
he struck a light kindled a fire and thrust the club into it
there was hair upon the end which blazed and shrunk into a light cinder and caught by the air whirled up the chimney
even that frightened him sturdy as he was but he held the weapon till it broke and then piled it on the coals to burn away and smoulder into ashes
he washed himself and rubbed his clothes there were spots that would not be removed but he cut the pieces out and burnt them
how those stains were dispersed about the room
the very feet of the dog were bloody
all this time he had never once turned his back upon the corpse no not for a moment
such preparations completed he moved backward towards the door dragging the dog with him lest he should soil his feet anew and carry out new evidence of the crime into the streets
he shut the door softly locked it took the key and left the house
he crossed over and glanced up at the window to be sure that nothing was visible from the outside
there was the curtain still drawn which she would have opened to admit the light she never saw again
it lay nearly under there
he knew that
god how the sun poured down upon the very spot
the glance was instantaneous
it was a relief to have got free of the room
he whistled on the dog and walked rapidly away
he went through islington strode up the hill at highgate on which stands the stone in honour of whittington turned down to highgate hill unsteady of purpose and uncertain where to go struck off to the right again almost as soon as he began to descend it and taking the footpath across the fields skirted caen wood and so came on hampstead heath
traversing the hollow by the vale of heath he mounted the opposite bank and crossing the road which joins the villages of hampstead and highgate made along the remaining portion of the heath to the fields at north end in one of which he laid himself down under a hedge and slept
soon he was up again and awaynot far into the country but back towards london by the highroadthen back againthen over another part of the same ground as he already traversedthen wandering up and down in fields and lying on ditches brinks to rest and starting up to make for some other spot and do the same and ramble on again
where could he go that was near and not too public to get some meat and drink
hendon
that was a good place not far off and out of most peoples way
thither he directed his stepsrunning sometimes and sometimes with a strange perversity loitering at a snails pace or stopping altogether and idly breaking the hedges with a stick
but when he got there all the people he metthe very children at the doorsseemed to view him with suspicion
back he turned again without the courage to purchase bit or drop though he had tasted no food for many hours and once more he lingered on the heath uncertain where to go
he wandered over miles and miles of ground and still came back to the old place
morning and noon had passed and the day was on the wane and still he rambled to and fro and up and down and round and round and still lingered about the same spot
at last he got away and shaped his course for hatfield
it was nine oclock at night when the man quite tired out and the dog limping and lame from the unaccustomed exercise turned down the hill by the church of the quiet village and plodding along the little street crept into a small publichouse whose scanty light had guided them to the spot
there was a fire in the taproom and some countrylabourers were drinking before it
they made room for the stranger but he sat down in the furthest corner and ate and drank alone or rather with his dog to whom he cast a morsel of food from time to time
the conversation of the men assembled here turned upon the neighbouring land and farmers and when those topics were exhausted upon the age of some old man who had been buried on the previous sunday the young men present considering him very old and the old men present declaring him to have been quite youngnot older one whitehaired grandfather said than he waswith ten or fifteen year of life in him at leastif he had taken care if he had taken care
there was nothing to attract attention or excite alarm in this
the robber after paying his reckoning sat silent and unnoticed in his corner and had almost dropped asleep when he was half wakened by the noisy entrance of a new comer
this was an antic fellow half pedlar and half mountebank who travelled about the country on foot to vend hones strops razors washballs harnesspaste medicine for dogs and horses cheap perfumery cosmetics and suchlike wares which he carried in a case slung to his back
his entrance was the signal for various homely jokes with the countrymen which slackened not until he had made his supper and opened his box of treasures when he ingeniously contrived to unite business with amusement
and what be that stoof
good to eat harry asked a grinning countryman pointing to some compositioncakes in one corner
this said the fellow producing one this is the infallible and invaluable composition for removing all sorts of stain rust dirt mildew spick speck spot or spatter from silk satin linen cambric cloth crape stuff carpet merino muslin bombazeen or woollen stuff
winestains fruitstains beerstains waterstains paintstains pitchstains any stains all come out at one rub with the infallible and invaluable composition
if a lady stains her honour she has only need to swallow one cake and shes cured at oncefor its poison
if a gentleman wants to prove this he has only need to bolt one little square and he has put it beyond questionfor its quite as satisfactory as a pistolbullet and a great deal nastier in the flavour consequently the more credit in taking it
one penny a square
with all these virtues one penny a square there were two buyers directly and more of the listeners plainly hesitated
the vendor observing this increased in loquacity
its all bought up as fast as it can be made said the fellow
there are fourteen watermills six steamengines and a galvanic battery always aworking upon it and they cant make it fast enough though the men work so hard that they die off and the widows is pensioned directly with twenty pound ayear for each of the children and a premium of fifty for twins
one penny a square
two halfpence is all the same and four farthings is received with joy
one penny a square
winestains fruitstains beerstains waterstains paintstains pitchstains mudstains bloodstains
here is a stain upon the hat of a gentleman in company that ill take clean out before he can order me a pint of ale hah cried sikes starting up
give that back ill take it clean out sir replied the man winking to the company before you can come across the room to get it
gentlemen all observe the dark stain upon this gentlemans hat no wider than a shilling but thicker than a halfcrown
whether it is a winestain fruitstain beerstain waterstain paintstain pitchstain mudstain or bloodstain the man got no further for sikes with a hideous imprecation overthrew the table and tearing the hat from him burst out of the house
with the same perversity of feeling and irresolution that had fastened upon him despite himself all day the murderer finding that he was not followed and that they most probably considered him some drunken sullen fellow turned back up the town and getting out of the glare of the lamps of a stagecoach that was standing in the street was walking past when he recognised the mail from london and saw that it was standing at the little postoffice
he almost knew what was to come but he crossed over and listened
the guard was standing at the door waiting for the letterbag
a man dressed like a gamekeeper came up at the moment and he handed him a basket which lay ready on the pavement
thats for your people said the guard
now look alive in there will you
damn that ere bag it warnt ready night afore last this wont do you know anything new up in town ben asked the gamekeeper drawing back to the windowshutters the better to admire the horses
no nothing that i knows on replied the man pulling on his gloves
corns up a little
i heerd talk of a murder too down spitalfields way but i dont reckon much upon it oh thats quite true said a gentleman inside who was looking out of the window
and a dreadful murder it was was it sir rejoined the guard touching his hat
man or woman pray sir a woman replied the gentleman
it is supposed now ben replied the coachman impatiently
damn that ere bag said the guard are you gone to sleep in there coming cried the office keeper running out
coming growled the guard
ah and sos the young ooman of property thats going to take a fancy to me but i dont know when
here give hold
all riight the horn sounded a few cheerful notes and the coach was gone
sikes remained standing in the street apparently unmoved by what he had just heard and agitated by no stronger feeling than a doubt where to go
at length he went back again and took the road which leads from hatfield to st albans
he went on doggedly but as he left the town behind him and plunged into the solitude and darkness of the road he felt a dread and awe creeping upon him which shook him to the core
every object before him substance or shadow still or moving took the semblance of some fearful thing but these fears were nothing compared to the sense that haunted him of that mornings ghastly figure following at his heels
he could trace its shadow in the gloom supply the smallest item of the outline and note how stiff and solemn it seemed to stalk along
he could hear its garments rustling in the leaves and every breath of wind came laden with that last low cry
if he stopped it did the same
if he ran it followednot running too that would have been a relief but like a corpse endowed with the mere machinery of life and borne on one slow melancholy wind that never rose or fell
at times he turned with desperate determination resolved to beat this phantom off though it should look him dead but the hair rose on his head and his blood stood still for it had turned with him and was behind him then
he had kept it before him that morning but it was behind nowalways
he leaned his back against a bank and felt that it stood above him visibly out against the cold nightsky
he threw himself upon the roadon his back upon the road
at his head it stood silent erect and stilla living gravestone with its epitaph in blood
let no man talk of murderers escaping justice and hint that providence must sleep
there were twenty score of violent deaths in one long minute of that agony of fear
there was a shed in a field he passed that offered shelter for the night
before the door were three tall poplar trees which made it very dark within and the wind moaned through them with a dismal wail
he could not walk on till daylight came again and here he stretched himself close to the wallto undergo new torture
for now a vision came before him as constant and more terrible than that from which he had escaped
those widely staring eyes so lustreless and so glassy that he had better borne to see them than think upon them appeared in the midst of the darkness light in themselves but giving light to nothing
there were but two but they were everywhere
if he shut out the sight there came the room with every wellknown objectsome indeed that he would have forgotten if he had gone over its contents from memoryeach in its accustomed place
the body was in its place and its eyes were as he saw them when he stole away
he got up and rushed into the field without
the figure was behind him
he reentered the shed and shrunk down once more
the eyes were there before he had laid himself along
and here he remained in such terror as none but he can know trembling in every limb and the cold sweat starting from every pore when suddenly there arose upon the nightwind the noise of distant shouting and the roar of voices mingled in alarm and wonder
any sound of men in that lonely place even though it conveyed a real cause of alarm was something to him
he regained his strength and energy at the prospect of personal danger and springing to his feet rushed into the open air
the broad sky seemed on fire
rising into the air with showers of sparks and rolling one above the other were sheets of flame lighting the atmosphere for miles round and driving clouds of smoke in the direction where he stood
the shouts grew louder as new voices swelled the roar and he could hear the cry of fire
mingled with the ringing of an alarmbell the fall of heavy bodies and the crackling of flames as they twined round some new obstacle and shot aloft as though refreshed by food
the noise increased as he looked
there were people theremen and womenlight bustle
it was like new life to him
he darted onwardstraight headlongdashing through brier and brake and leaping gate and fence as madly as his dog who careered with loud and sounding bark before him
he came upon the spot
there were halfdressed figures tearing to and fro some endeavouring to drag the frightened horses from the stables others driving the cattle from the yard and outhouses and others coming laden from the burning pile amidst a shower of falling sparks and the tumbling down of redhot beams
the apertures where doors and windows stood an hour ago disclosed a mass of raging fire walls rocked and crumbled into the burning well the molten lead and iron poured down white hot upon the ground
women and children shrieked and men encouraged each other with noisy shouts and cheers
the clanking of the enginepumps and the spirting and hissing of the water as it fell upon the blazing wood added to the tremendous roar
he shouted too till he was hoarse and flying from memory and himself plunged into the thickest of the throng
hither and thither he dived that night now working at the pumps and now hurrying through the smoke and flame but never ceasing to engage himself wherever noise and men were thickest
up and down the ladders upon the roofs of buildings over floors that quaked and trembled with his weight under the lee of falling bricks and stones in every part of that great fire was he but he bore a charmed life and had neither scratch nor bruise nor weariness nor thought till morning dawned again and only smoke and blackened ruins remained
this mad excitement over there returned with tenfold force the dreadful consciousness of his crime
he looked suspiciously about him for the men were conversing in groups and he feared to be the subject of their talk
the dog obeyed the significant beck of his finger and they drew off stealthily together
he passed near an engine where some men were seated and they called to him to share in their refreshment
he took some bread and meat and as he drank a draught of beer heard the firemen who were from london talking about the murder
he has gone to birmingham they say said one but theyll have him yet for the scouts are out and by tomorrow night therell be a cry all through the country he hurried off and walked till he almost dropped upon the ground then lay down in a lane and had a long but broken and uneasy sleep
he wandered on again irresolute and undecided and oppressed with the fear of another solitary night
suddenly he took the desperate resolution to going back to london
theres somebody to speak to there at all event he thought
a good hidingplace too
theyll never expect to nab me there after this country scent
why cant i lie by for a week or so and forcing blunt from fagin get abroad to france
damme ill risk it he acted upon this impulse without delay and choosing the least frequented roads began his journey back resolved to lie concealed within a short distance of the metropolis and entering it at dusk by a circuitous route to proceed straight to that part of it which he had fixed on for his destination
the dog though
if any description of him were out it would not be forgotten that the dog was missing and had probably gone with him
this might lead to his apprehension as he passed along the streets
he resolved to drown him and walked on looking about for a pond picking up a heavy stone and tying it to his handkerchief as he went
the animal looked up into his masters face while these preparations were making whether his instinct apprehended something of their purpose or the robbers sidelong look at him was sterner than ordinary he skulked a little farther in the rear than usual and cowered as he came more slowly along
when his master halted at the brink of a pool and looked round to call him he stopped outright
do you hear me call
come here cried sikes
the animal came up from the very force of habit but as sikes stooped to attach the handkerchief to his throat he uttered a low growl and started back
come back said the robber
the dog wagged his tail but moved not
sikes made a running noose and called him again
the dog advanced retreated paused an instant and scoured away at his hardest speed
the man whistled again and again and sat down and waited in the expectation that he would return
but no dog appeared and at length he resumed his journey
monks and mr brownlow at length meet
their conversation and the intelligence that interrupts it the twilight was beginning to close in when mr brownlow alighted from a hackneycoach at his own door and knocked softly
the door being opened a sturdy man got out of the coach and stationed himself on one side of the steps while another man who had been seated on the box dismounted too and stood upon the other side
at a sign from mr brownlow they helped out a third man and taking him between them hurried him into the house
this man was monks
they walked in the same manner up the stairs without speaking and mr brownlow preceding them led the way into a backroom
at the door of this apartment monks who had ascended with evident reluctance stopped
the two men looked at the old gentleman as if for instructions
he knows the alternative said mr browlow
if he hesitates or moves a finger but as you bid him drag him into the street call for the aid of the police and impeach him as a felon in my name how dare you say this of me asked monks
how dare you urge me to it young man replied mr brownlow confronting him with a steady look
are you mad enough to leave this house
unhand him
there sir
you are free to go and we to follow
but i warn you by all i hold most solemn and most sacred that instant will have you apprehended on a charge of fraud and robbery
i am resolute and immoveable
if you are determined to be the same your blood be upon your own head by what authority am i kidnapped in the street and brought here by these dogs asked monks looking from one to the other of the men who stood beside him
by mine replied mr brownlow
those persons are indemnified by me
if you complain of being deprived of your libertyyou had power and opportunity to retrieve it as you came along but you deemed it advisable to remain quieti say again throw yourself for protection on the law
i will appeal to the law too but when you have gone too far to recede do not sue to me for leniency when the power will have passed into other hands and do not say i plunged you down the gulf into which you rushed yourself monks was plainly disconcerted and alarmed besides
he hesitated
you will decide quickly said mr brownlow with perfect firmness and composure
if you wish me to prefer my charges publicly and consign you to a punishment the extent of which although i can with a shudder foresee i cannot control once more i say for you know the way
if not and you appeal to my forbearance and the mercy of those you have deeply injured seat yourself without a word in that chair
it has waited for you two whole days monks muttered some unintelligible words but wavered still
you will be prompt said mr brownlow
a word from me and the alternative has gone for ever still the man hesitated
i have not the inclination to parley said mr brownlow and as i advocate the dearest interests of others i have not the right is there demanded monks with a faltering tongueis thereno middle course none monks looked at the old gentleman with an anxious eye but reading in his countenance nothing but severity and determination walked into the room and shrugging his shoulders sat down
lock the door on the outside said mr brownlow to the attendants and come when i ring the men obeyed and the two were left alone together
this is pretty treatment sir said monks throwing down his hat and cloak from my fathers oldest friend it is because i was your fathers oldest friend young man returned mr brownlow it is because the hopes and wishes of young and happy years were bound up with him and that fair creature of his blood and kindred who rejoined her god in youth and left me here a solitary lonely man it is because he knelt with me beside his only sisterss deathbed when he was yet a boy on the morning that wouldbut heaven willed otherwisehave made her my young wife it is because my seared heart clung to him from that time forth through all his trials and errors till he died it is because old recollections and associations filled my heart and even the sight of you brings with it old thoughts of him it is because of all these things that i am moved to treat you gently nowyes edward leeford even nowand blush for your unworthiness who bear the name what has the name to do with it asked the other after contemplating half in silence and half in dogged wonder the agitation of his companion
what is the name to me nothing replied mr brownlow nothing to you
but it was hers and even at this distance of time brings back to me an old man the glow and thrill which i once felt only to hear it repeated by a stranger
i am very glad you have changed itveryvery this is all mighty fine said monks to retain his assumed designation after a long silence during which he had jerked himself in sullen defiance to and fro and mr brownlow had sat shading his face with his hand
but what do you want with me you have a brother said mr brownlow rousing himself a brother the whisper of whose name in your ear when i came behind you in the street was in itself almost enough to make you accompany me hither in wonder and alarm i have no brother replied monks
you know i was an only child
why do you talk to me of brothers
you know that as well as i attend to what i do know and you may not said mr brownlow
i shall interest you by and by
i know that of the wretched marriage into which family pride and the most sordid and narrowest of all ambition forced your unhappy father when a mere boy you were the sole and most unnatural issue i dont care for hard names interrupted monks with a jeering laugh
you know the fact and thats enough for me but i also know pursued the old gentleman the misery the slow torture the protracted anguish of that illassorted union
i know how listlessly and wearily each of that wretched pair dragged on their heavy chain through a world that was poisoned to them both
i know how cold formalities were succeeded by open taunts how indifference gave place to dislike dislike to hate and hate to loathing until at last they wrenched the clanking bond asunder and retiring a wide space apart carried each a galling fragment of which nothing but death could break the rivets to hide it in new society beneath the gayest looks they could assume
your mother succeeded she forgot it soon
but it rusted and cankered at your fathers heart for years well they were separated said monks and what of that when they had been separated for some time returned mr brownlow and your mother wholly given up to continental frivolities had utterly forgotten the young husband ten good years her junior who with prospects blighted lingered on at home he fell among new friends
this circumstance at least you know already not i said monks turning away his eyes and beating his foot upon the ground as a man who is determined to deny everything
not i your manner no less than your actions assures me that you have never forgotten it or ceased to think of it with bitterness returned mr brownlow
i speak of fifteen years ago when you were not more than eleven years old and your father but oneandthirtyfor he was i repeat a boy when his father ordered him to marry
must i go back to events which cast a shade upon the memory of your parent or will you spare it and disclose to me the truth i have nothing to disclose rejoined monks
you must talk on if you will these new friends then said mr brownlow were a naval officer retired from active service whose wife had died some halfayear before and left him with two childrenthere had been more but of all their family happily but two survived
they were both daughters one a beautiful creature of nineteen and the other a mere child of two or three years old whats this to me asked monks
they resided said mr brownlow without seeming to hear the interruption in a part of the country to which your father in his wandering had repaired and where he had taken up his abode
acquaintance intimacy friendship fast followed on each other
your father was gifted as few men are
he had his sisters soul and person
as the old officer knew him more and more he grew to love him
i would that it had ended there
his daughter did the same the old gentleman paused monks was biting his lips with his eyes fixed upon the floor seeing this he immediately resumed the end of a year found him contracted solemnly contracted to that daughter the object of the first true ardent only passion of a guileless girl your tale is of the longest observed monks moving restlessly in his chair
it is a true tale of grief and trial and sorrow young man returned mr brownlow and such tales usually are if it were one of unmixed joy and happiness it would be very brief
at length one of those rich relations to strengthen whose interest and importance your father had been sacrificed as others are oftenit is no uncommon casedied and to repair the misery he had been instrumental in occasioning left him his panacea for all griefsmoney
it was necessary that he should immediately repair to rome whither this man had sped for health and where he had died leaving his affairs in great confusion
he went was seized with mortal illness there was followed the moment the intelligence reached paris by your mother who carried you with her he died the day after her arrival leaving no willno willso that the whole property fell to her and you at this part of the recital monks held his breath and listened with a face of intense eagerness though his eyes were not directed towards the speaker
as mr brownlow paused he changed his position with the air of one who has experienced a sudden relief and wiped his hot face and hands
before he went abroad and as he passed through london on his way said mr brownlow slowly and fixing his eyes upon the others face he came to me i never heard of that interrupted monks in a tone intended to appear incredulous but savouring more of disagreeable surprise
he came to me and left with me among some other things a picturea portrait painted by himselfa likeness of this poor girlwhich he did not wish to leave behind and could not carry forward on his hasty journey
he was worn by anxiety and remorse almost to a shadow talked in a wild distracted way of ruin and dishonour worked by himself confided to me his intention to convert his whole property at any loss into money and having settled on his wife and you a portion of his recent acquisition to fly the countryi guessed too well he would not fly aloneand never see it more
even from me his old and early friend whose strong attachment had taken root in the earth that covered one most dear to botheven from me he withheld any more particular confession promising to write and tell me all and after that to see me once again for the last time on earth
alas
that was the last time
i had no letter and i never saw him more i went said mr brownlow after a short pause i went when all was over to the scene of hisi will use the term the world would freely use for worldly harshness or favour are now alike to himof his guilty love resolved that if my fears were realised that erring child should find one heart and home to shelter and compassionate her
the family had left that part a week before they had called in such trifling debts as were outstanding discharged them and left the place by night
why or whither none can tell monks drew his breath yet more freely and looked round with a smile of triumph
when your brother said mr brownlow drawing nearer to the others chair when your brother a feeble ragged neglected child was cast in my way by a stronger hand than chance and rescued by me from a life of vice and infamy what cried monks
by me said mr brownlow
i told you i should interest you before long
i say by mei see that your cunning associate suppressed my name although for aught he knew it would be quite strange to your ears
when he was rescued by me then and lay recovering from sickness in my house his strong resemblance to this picture i have spoken of struck me with astonishment
even when i first saw him in all his dirt and misery there was a lingering expression in his face that came upon me like a glimpse of some old friend flashing on one in a vivid dream
i need not tell you he was snared away before i knew his history why not asked monks hastily
because you know it well i denial to me is vain replied mr brownlow
i shall show you that i know more than that youyoucant prove anything against me stammered monks
i defy you to do it we shall see returned the old gentleman with a searching glance
i lost the boy and no efforts of mine could recover him
your mother being dead i knew that you alone could solve the mystery if anybody could and as when i had last heard of you you were on your own estate in the west indieswhither as you well know you retired upon your mothers death to escape the consequences of vicious courses herei made the voyage
you had left it months before and were supposed to be in london but no one could tell where
i returned
your agents had no clue to your residence
you came and went they said as strangely as you had ever done sometimes for days together and sometimes not for months keeping to all appearance the same low haunts and mingling with the same infamous herd who had been your associates when a fierce ungovernable boy
i wearied them with new applications
i paced the streets by night and day but until two hours ago all my efforts were fruitless and i never saw you for an instant and now you do see me said monks rising boldly what then
fraud and robbery are highsounding wordsjustified you think by a fancied resemblance in some young imp to an idle daub of a dead mans brother
you dont even know that a child was born of this maudlin pair you dont even know that i did not replied mr brownlow rising too but within the last fortnight i have learnt it all
you have a brother you know it and him
there was a will which your mother destroyed leaving the secret and the gain to you at her own death
it contained a reference to some child likely to be the result of this sad connection which child was born and accidentally encountered by you when your suspicions were first awakened by his resemblance to your father
you repaired to the place of his birth
there existed proofsproofs long suppressedof his birth and parentage
those proofs were destroyed by you and now in your own words to your accomplice the jew the only proofs of the boys identity lie at the bottom of the river and the old hag that received them from the mother is rotting in her coffin unworthy son coward liaryou who hold your councils with thieves and murderers in dark rooms at nightyou whose plots and wiles have brought a violent death upon the head of one worth millions such as youyou who from your cradle were gall and bitterness to your own fathers heart and in whom all evil passions vice and profligacy festered till they found a vent in a hideous disease which had made your face an index even to your mindyou edward leeford do you still brave me no no no returned the coward overwhelmed by these accumulated charges
every word cried the gentleman every word that has passed between you and this detested villain is known to me
shadows on the wall have caught your whispers and brought them to my ear the sight of the persecuted child has turned vice itself and given it the courage and almost the attributes of virtue
murder has been done to which you were morally if not really a party no no interposed monks
ii knew nothing of that i was going to inquire the truth of the story when you overtook me
i didnt know the cause
i thought it was a common quarrel it was the partial disclosure of your secrets replied mr brownlow
will you disclose the whole yes i will set your hand to a statement of truth and facts and repeat it before witnesses that i promise too remain quietly here until such a document is drawn up and proceed with me to such a place as i may deem most advisable for the purpose of attesting it if you insist upon that ill do that also replied monks
you must do more than that said mr brownlow
make restitution to an innocent and unoffending child for such he is although the offspring of a guilty and most miserable love
you have not forgotten the provisions of the will
carry them into execution so far as your brother is concerned and then go where you please
in this world you need meet no more while monks was pacing up and down meditating with dark and evil looks on this proposal and the possibilities of evading it torn by his fears on the one hand and his hatred on the other the door was hurriedly unlocked and a gentleman mr losberne entered the room in violent agitation
the man will be taken he cried
he will be taken tonight the murderer asked mr brownlow
yes yes replied the other
his dog has been seen lurking about some old haunt and there seems little doubt that his master either is or will be there under cover of the darkness
spies are hovering about in every direction
i have spoken to the men who are charged with his capture and they tell me he cannot escape
a reward of a hundred pounds is proclaimed by government tonight i will give fifty more said mr brownlow and proclaim it with my own lips upon the spot if i can reach it
where is mr maylie harry
as soon as he had seen your friend here safe in a coach with you he hurried off to where he heard this replied the doctor and mounting his horse sallied forth to join the first party at some place in the outskirts agreed upon between them fagin said mr brownlow what of him when i last heard he had not been taken but he will be or is by this time
theyre sure of him have you made up your mind asked mr brownlow in a low voice of monks
yes he replied
youyouwill be secret with me i will
remain here till i return
it is your only hope of safety they left the room and the door was again locked
what have you done asked the doctor in a whisper
all that i could hope to do and even more
coupling the poor girls intelligence with my previous knowledge and the result of our good friends inquiries on the spot i left him no loophole of escape and laid bare the whole villainy which by these lights became plain as day
write and appoint the evening after tomorrow at seven for the meeting
we shall be down there a few hours before but shall require rest especially the young lady who may have greater need of firmness than either you or i can quite foresee just now
but my blood boils to avenge this poor murdered creature
which way have they taken drive straight to the office and you will be in time replied mr losberne
i will remain here the two gentlemen hastily separated each in a fever of excitement wholly uncontrollable
the pursuit and escape near to that part of the thames on which the church at rotherhithe abuts where the buildings on the banks are dirtiest and the vessels on the river blackest with the dust of colliers and the smoke of closebuilt lowroofed houses there exists the filthiest the strangest the most extraordinary of the many localities that are hidden in london wholly unknown even by name to the great mass of its inhabitants
to reach this place the visitor has to penetrate through a maze of close narrow and muddy streets thronged by the roughest and poorest of waterside people and devoted to the traffic they may be supposed to occasion
the cheapest and least delicate provisions are heaped in the shops the coarsest and commonest articles of wearing apparel dangle at the salesmans door and stream from the houseparapet and windows
jostling with unemployed labourers of the lowest class ballastheavers coalwhippers brazen women ragged children and the raff and refuse of the river he makes his way with difficulty along assailed by offensive sights and smells from the narrow alleys which branch off on the right and left and deafened by the clash of ponderous waggons that bear great piles of merchandise from the stacks of warehouses that rise from every corner
arriving at length in streets remoter and lessfrequented than those through which he has passed he walks beneath tottering housefronts projecting over the pavement dismantled walls that seem to totter as he passes chimneys half crushed half hesitating to fall windows guarded by rusty iron bars that time and dirt have almost eaten away every imaginable sign of desolation and neglect
in such a neighborhood beyond dockhead in the borough of southwark stands jacobs island surrounded by a muddy ditch six or eight feet deep and fifteen or twenty wide when the tide is in once called mill pond but known in the days of this story as folly ditch
it is a creek or inlet from the thames and can always be filled at high water by opening the sluices at the lead mills from which it took its old name
at such times a stranger looking from one of the wooden bridges thrown across it at mill lane will see the inhabitants of the houses on either side lowering from their back doors and windows buckets pails domestic utensils of all kinds in which to haul the water up and when his eye is turned from these operations to the houses themselves his utmost astonishment will be excited by the scene before him
crazy wooden galleries common to the backs of half a dozen houses with holes from which to look upon the slime beneath windows broken and patched with poles thrust out on which to dry the linen that is never there rooms so small so filthy so confined that the air would seem too tainted even for the dirt and squalor which they shelter wooden chambers thrusting themselves out above the mud and threatening to fall into itas some have done dirtbesmeared walls and decaying foundations every repulsive lineament of poverty every loathsome indication of filth rot and garbage all these ornament the banks of folly ditch
in jacobs island the warehouses are roofless and empty the walls are crumbling down the windows are windows no more the doors are falling into the streets the chimneys are blackened but they yield no smoke
thirty or forty years ago before losses and chancery suits came upon it it was a thriving place but now it is a desolate island indeed
the houses have no owners they are broken open and entered upon by those who have the courage and there they live and there they die
they must have powerful motives for a secret residence or be reduced to a destitute condition indeed who seek a refuge in jacobs island
in an upper room of one of these housesa detached house of fair size ruinous in other respects but strongly defended at door and window of which house the back commanded the ditch in manner already describedthere were assembled three men who regarding each other every now and then with looks expressive of perplexity and expectation sat for some time in profound and gloomy silence
one of these was toby crackit another mr chitling and the third a robber of fifty years whose nose had been almost beaten in in some old scuffle and whose face bore a frightful scar which might probably be traced to the same occasion
this man was a returned transport and his name was kags
i wish said toby turning to mr chitling that you had picked out some other crib when the two old ones got too warm and had not come here my fine feller why didnt you blunderhead said kags
well i thought youd have been a little more glad to see me than this replied mr chitling with a melancholy air
why looke young gentleman said toby when a man keeps himself so very exclusive as i have done and by that means has a snug house over his head with nobody a prying and smelling about it its rather a startling thing to have the honour of a wisit from a young gentleman however respectable and pleasant a person he may be to play cards with at conweniency circumstanced as you are especially when the exclusive young man has got a friend stopping with him thats arrived sooner than was expected from foreign parts and is too modest to want to be presented to the judges on his return added mr kags
there was a short silence after which toby crackit seeming to abandon as hopeless any further effort to maintain his usual devilmaycare swagger turned to chitling and said when was fagin took then just at dinnertimetwo oclock this afternoon
charley and i made our lucky up the washus chimney and bolter got into the empty waterbutt head downwards but his legs were so precious long that they stuck out at the top and so they took him too and bet poor bet
she went to see the body to speak to who it was replied chitling his countenance falling more and more and went off mad screaming and raving and beating her head against the boards so they put a straitweskut on her and took her to the hospitaland there she is wots come of young bates demanded kags
he hung about not to come over here afore dark but hell be here soon replied chitling
theres nowhere else to go to now for the people at the cripples are all in custody and the bar of the keni went up there and see it with my own eyesis filled with traps this is a smash observed toby biting his lips
theres more than one will go with this the sessions are on said kags if they get the inquest over and bolter turns kings evidence as of course he will from what hes said already they can prove fagin an accessory before the fact and get the trial on on friday and hell swing in six days from this by g you should have heard the people groan said chitling the officers fought like devils or theyd have torn him away
he was down once but they made a ring round him and fought their way along
you should have seen how he looked about him all muddy and bleeding and clung to them as if they were his dearest friends
i can see em now not able to stand upright with the pressing of the mob and draggin him along amongst em i can see the people jumping up one behind another and snarling with their teeth and making at him i can see the blood upon his hair and beard and hear the cries with which the women worked themselves into the centre of the crowd at the street corner and swore theyd tear his heart out the horrorstricken witness of this scene pressed his hands upon his ears and with his eyes closed got up and paced violently to and fro like one distracted
while he was thus engaged and the two men sat by in silence with their eyes fixed upon the floor a pattering noise was heard upon the stairs and sikess dog bounded into the room
they ran to the window downstairs and into the street
the dog had jumped in at an open window he made no attempt to follow them nor was his master to be seen
whats the meaning of this said toby when they had returned
he cant be coming here
iihope not if he was coming here hed have come with the dog said kags stooping down to examine the animal who lay panting on the floor
here
give us some water for him he has run himself faint hes drunk it all up every drop said chitling after watching the dog some time in silence
covered with mudlamehalf blindhe must have come a long way where can he have come from exclaimed toby
hes been to the other kens of course and finding them filled with strangers come on here where hes been many a time and often
but where can he have come from first and how comes he here alone without the other henone of them called the murderer by his old namehe cant have made away with himself
what do you think said chitling
toby shook his head
if he had said kags the dog ud want to lead us away to where he did it
no
i think hes got out of the country and left the dog behind
he must have given him the slip somehow or he wouldnt be so easy this solution appearing the most probable one was adopted as the right the dog creeping under a chair coiled himself up to sleep without more notice from anybody
it being now dark the shutter was closed and a candle lighted and placed upon the table
the terrible events of the last two days had made a deep impression on all three increased by the danger and uncertainty of their own position
they drew their chairs closer together starting at every sound
they spoke little and that in whispers and were as silent and awestricken as if the remains of the murdered woman lay in the next room
they had sat thus some time when suddenly was heard a hurried knocking at the door below
young bates said kags looking angrily round to check the fear he felt himself
the knocking came again
no it wasnt he
he never knocked like that
crackit went to the window and shaking all over drew in his head
there was no need to tell them who it was his pale face was enough
the dog too was on the alert in an instant and ran whining to the door
we must let him in he said taking up the candle
isnt there any help for it asked the other man in a hoarse voice
none
he must come in dont leave us in the dark said kags taking down a candle from the chimneypiece and lighting it with such a trembling hand that the knocking was twice repeated before he had finished
crackit went down to the door and returned followed by a man with the lower part of his face buried in a handkerchief and another tied over his head under his hat
he drew them slowly off
blanched face sunken eyes hollow cheeks beard of three days growth wasted flesh short thick breath it was the very ghost of sikes
he laid his hand upon a chair which stood in the middle of the room but shuddering as he was about to drop into it and seeming to glance over his shoulder dragged it back close to the wallas close as it would goand ground it against itand sat down
not a word had been exchanged
he looked from one to another in silence
if an eye were furtively raised and met his it was instantly averted
when his hollow voice broke silence they all three started
they seemed never to have heard its tones before
how came that dog here he asked
alone
three hours ago tonights paper says that fagins took
is it true or a lie true they were silent again
damn you all said sikes passing his hand across his forehead
have you nothing to say to me there was an uneasy movement among them but nobody spoke
you that keep this house said sikes turning his face to crackit do you mean to sell me or to let me lie here till this hunt is over you may stop here if you think it safe returned the person addressed after some hesitation
sikes carried his eyes slowly up the wall behind him rather trying to turn his head than actually doing it and said isitthe bodyis it buried they shook their heads
why isnt it he retorted with the same glance behind him
wot do they keep such ugly things above the ground forwhos that knocking crackit intimated by a motion of his hand as he left the room that there was nothing to fear and directly came back with charley bates behind him
sikes sat opposite the door so that the moment the boy entered the room he encountered his figure
toby said the boy falling back as sikes turned his eyes towards him why didnt you tell me this downstairs there had been something so tremendous in the shrinking off of the three that the wretched man was willing to propitiate even this lad
accordingly he nodded and made as though he would shake hands with him
let me go into some other room said the boy retreating still farther
charley said sikes stepping forward
dont youdont you know me dont come nearer me answered the boy still retreating and looking with horror in his eyes upon the murderers face
you monster the man stopped halfway and they looked at each other but sikess eyes sunk gradually to the ground
witness you three cried the boy shaking his clenched fist and becoming more and more excited as he spoke
witness you threeim not afraid of himif they come here after him ill give him up i will
i tell you out at once
he may kill me for it if he likes or if he dares but if i am here ill give him up
id give him up if he was to be boiled alive
murder
help
if theres the pluck of a man among you three youll help me
murder
help
down with him pouring out these cries and accompanying them with violent gesticulation the boy actually threw himself singlehanded upon the strong man and in the intensity of his energy and the suddenness of his surprise brought him heavily to the ground
the three spectators seemed quite stupefied
they offered no interference and the boy and man rolled on the ground together the former heedless of the blows that showered upon him wrenching his hands tighter and tighter in the garments about the murderers breast and never ceasing to call for help with all his might
the contest however was too unequal to last long
sikes had him down and his knee was on his throat when crackit pulled him back with a look of alarm and pointed to the window
there were lights gleaming below voices in loud and earnest conversation the tramp of hurried footstepsendless they seemed in numbercrossing the nearest wooden bridge
one man on horseback seemed to be among the crowd for there was the noise of hoofs rattling on the uneven pavement
the gleam of lights increased the footsteps came more thickly and noisily on
then came a loud knocking at the door and then a hoarse murmur from such a multitude of angry voices as would have made the boldest quail
help shrieked the boy in a voice that rent the air
hes here
break down the door in the kings name cried the voices without and the hoarse cry arose again but louder
break down the door screamed the boy
i tell you theyll never open it
run straight to the room where the light is
break down the door strokes thick and heavy rattled upon the door and lower windowshutters as he ceased to speak and a loud huzzah burst from the crowd giving the listener for the first time some adequate idea of its immense extent
open the door of some place where i can lock this screeching hellbabe cried sikes fiercely running to and fro and dragging the boy now as easily as if he were an empty sack
that door
quick he flung him in bolted it and turned the key
is the downstairs door fast doublelocked and chained replied crackit who with the other two men still remained quite helpless and bewildered
the panelsare they strong lined with sheetiron and the windows too yes and the windows damn you cried the desperate ruffian throwing up the sash and menacing the crowd
do your worst
ill cheat you yet of all the terrific yells that ever fell on mortal ears none could exceed the cry of the infuriated throng
some shouted to those who were nearest to set the house on fire others roared to the officers to shoot him dead
among them all none showed such fury as the man on horseback who throwing himself out of the saddle and bursting through the crowd as if he were parting water cried beneath the window in a voice that rose above all others twenty guineas to the man who brings a ladder the nearest voices took up the cry and hundreds echoed it
some called for ladders some for sledgehammers some ran with torches to and fro as if to seek them and still came back and roared again some spent their breath in impotent curses and execrations some pressed forward with the ecstasy of madmen and thus impeded the progress of those below some among the boldest attempted to climb up by the waterspout and crevices in the wall and all waved to and fro in the darkness beneath like a field of corn moved by an angry wind and joined from time to time in one loud furious roar
the tide cried the murderer as he staggered back into the room and shut the faces out the tide was in as i came up
give me a rope a long rope
theyre all in front
i may drop into the folly ditch and clear off that way
give me a rope or i shall do three more murders and kill myself the panicstricken men pointed to where such articles were kept the murderer hastily selecting the longest and strongest cord hurried up to the housetop
all the windows in the rear of the house had been long ago bricked up except one small trap in the room where the boy was locked and that was too small even for the passage of his body
but from this aperture he had never ceased to call on those without to guard the back and thus when the murderer emerged at last on the housetop by the door in the roof a loud shout proclaimed the fact to those in front who immediately began to pour round pressing upon each other in an unbroken stream
he planted a board which he had carried up with him for the purpose so firmly against the door that it must be matter of great difficulty to open it from the inside and creeping over the tiles looked over the low parapet
the water was out and the ditch a bed of mud
the crowd had been hushed during these few moments watching his motions and doubtful of his purpose but the instant they perceived it and knew it was defeated they raised a cry of triumphant execration to which all their previous shouting had been whispers
again and again it rose
those who were at too great a distance to know its meaning took up the sound it echoed and reechoed it seemed as though the whole city had poured its population out to curse him
on pressed the people from the fronton on on in a strong struggling current of angry faces with here and there a glaring torch to lighten them up and show them out in all their wrath and passion
the houses on the opposite side of the ditch had been entered by the mob sashes were thrown up or torn bodily out there were tiers and tiers of faces in every window cluster upon cluster of people clinging to every housetop
each little bridge and there were three in sight bent beneath the weight of the crowd upon it
still the current poured on to find some nook or hole from which to vent their shouts and only for an instant see the wretch
they have him now cried a man on the nearest bridge
hurrah the crowd grew light with uncovered heads and again the shout uprose
i will give fifty pounds cried an old gentleman from the same quarter to the man who takes him alive
i will remain here till he come to ask me for it there was another roar
at this moment the word was passed among the crowd that the door was forced at last and that he who had first called for the ladder had mounted into the room
the stream abruptly turned as this intelligence ran from mouth to mouth and the people at the windows seeing those upon the bridges pouring back quitted their stations and running into the street joined the concourse that now thronged pellmell to the spot they had left each man crushing and striving with his neighbor and all panting with impatience to get near the door and look upon the criminal as the officers brought him out
the cries and shrieks of those who were pressed almost to suffocation or trampled down and trodden under foot in the confusion were dreadful the narrow ways were completely blocked up and at this time between the rush of some to regain the space in front of the house and the unavailing struggles of others to extricate themselves from the mass the immediate attention was distracted from the murderer although the universal eagerness for his capture was if possible increased
the man had shrunk down thoroughly quelled by the ferocity of the crowd and the impossibility of escape but seeing this sudden change with no less rapidity than it had occurred he sprang upon his feet determined to make one last effort for his life by dropping into the ditch and at the risk of being stifled endeavouring to creep away in the darkness and confusion
roused into new strength and energy and stimulated by the noise within the house which announced that an entrance had really been effected he set his foot against the stack of chimneys fastened one end of the rope tightly and firmly round it and with the other made a strong running noose by the aid of his hands and teeth almost in a second
he could let himself down by the cord to within a less distance of the ground than his own height and had his knife ready in his hand to cut it then and drop
at the very instant when he brought the loop over his head previous to slipping it beneath his armpits and when the old gentleman beforementioned who had clung so tight to the railing of the bridge as to resist the force of the crowd and retain his position earnestly warned those about him that the man was about to lower himself downat that very instant the murderer looking behind him on the roof threw his arms above his head and uttered a yell of terror
the eyes again he cried in an unearthly screech
staggering as if struck by lightning he lost his balance and tumbled over the parapet
the noose was on his neck
it ran up with his weight tight as a bowstring and swift as the arrow it speeds
he fell for fiveandthirty feet
there was a sudden jerk a terrific convulsion of the limbs and there he hung with the open knife clenched in his stiffening hand
the old chimney quivered with the shock but stood it bravely
the murderer swung lifeless against the wall and the boy thrusting aside the dangling body which obscured his view called to the people to come and take him out for gods sake
a dog which had lain concealed till now ran backwards and forwards on the parapet with a dismal howl and collecting himself for a spring jumped for the dead mans shoulders
missing his aim he fell into the ditch turning completely over as he went and striking his head against a stone dashed out his brains
affording an explanation of more mysteries than one and comprehending a proposal of marriage with no word of settlement or pinmoney the events narrated in the last chapter were yet but two days old when oliver found himself at three oclock in the afternoon in a travellingcarriage rolling fast towards his native town
mrs maylie and rose and mrs bedwin and the good doctor were with him and mr brownlow followed in a postchaise accompanied by one other person whose name had not been mentioned
they had not talked much upon the way for oliver was in a flutter of agitation and uncertainty which deprived him of the power of collecting his thoughts and almost of speech and appeared to have scarcely less effect on his companions who shared it in at least an equal degree
he and the two ladies had been very carefully made acquainted by mr brownlow with the nature of the admissions which had been forced from monks and although they knew that the object of their present journey was to complete the work which had been so well begun still the whole matter was enveloped in enough of doubt and mystery to leave them in endurance of the most intense suspense
the same kind friend had with mr losbernes assistance cautiously stopped all channels of communication through which they could receive intelligence of the dreadful occurrences that so recently taken place
it was quite true he said that they must know them before long but it might be at a better time than the present and it could not be at a worse so they travelled on in silence each busied with reflections on the object which had brought them together and no one disposed to give utterance to the thoughts which crowded upon all
but if oliver under these influences had remained silent while they journeyed towards his birthplace by a road he had never seen how the whole current of his recollections ran back to old times and what a crowd of emotions were wakened up in his breast when they turned into that which he had traversed on foot a poor houseless wandering boy without a friend to help him or a roof to shelter his head
see there there cried oliver eagerly clasping the hand of rose and pointing out at the carriage window thats the stile i came over there are the hedges i crept behind for fear any one should overtake me and force me back
yonder is the path across the fields leading to the old house where i was a little child
oh dick dick my dear old friend if i could only see you now you will see him soon replied rose gently taking his folded hands between her own
you shall tell him how happy you are and how rich you have grown and that in all your happiness you have none so great as the coming back to make him happy too yes yes said oliver and wellwell take him away from here and have him clothed and taught and send him to some quiet country place where he may grow strong and wellshall we rose nodded yes for the boy was smiling through such happy tears that she could not speak
you will be kind and good to him for you are to every one said oliver
it will make you cry i know to hear what he can tell but never mind never mind it will be all over and you will smile againi know that tooto think how changed he is you did the same with me
he said god bless you to me when i ran away cried the boy with a burst of affectionate emotion and i will say god bless you now and show him how i love him for it as they approached the town and at length drove through its narrow streets it became matter of no small difficulty to restrain the boy within reasonable bounds
there was sowerberrys the undertakers just as it used to be only smaller and less imposing in appearance than he remembered itthere were all the wellknown shops and houses with almost every one of which he had some slight incident connectedthere was gamfields cart the very cart he used to have standing at the old publichouse doorthere was the workhouse the dreary prison of his youthful days with its dismal windows frowning on the streetthere was the same lean porter standing at the gate at sight of whom oliver involuntarily shrunk back and then laughed at himself for being so foolish then cried then laughed againthere were scores of faces at the doors and windows that he knew quite wellthere was nearly everything as if he had left it but yesterday and all his recent life had been but a happy dream
but it was pure earnest joyful reality
they drove straight to the door of the chief hotel which oliver used to stare up at with awe and think a mighty palace but which had somehow fallen off in grandeur and size and here was mr grimwig all ready to receive them kissing the young lady and the old one too when they got out of the coach as if he were the grandfather of the whole party all smiles and kindness and not offering to eat his headno not once not even when he contradicted a very old postboy about the nearest road to london and maintained he knew it best though he had only come that way once and that time fast asleep
there was dinner prepared and there were bedrooms ready and everything was arranged as if by magic
notwithstanding all this when the hurry of the first halfhour was over the same silence and constraint prevailed that had marked their journey down
mr brownlow did not join them at dinner but remained in a separate room
the two other gentlemen hurried in and out with anxious faces and during the short intervals when they were present conversed apart
once mrs maylie was called away and after being absent for nearly an hour returned with eyes swollen with weeping
all these things made rose and oliver who were not in any new secrets nervous and uncomfortable
they sat wondering in silence or if they exchanged a few words spoke in whispers as if they were afraid to hear the sound of their own voices
at length when nine oclock had come and they began to think they were to hear no more that night mr losberne and mr grimwig entered the room followed by mr brownlow and a man whom oliver almost shrieked with surprise to see for they told him it was his brother and it was the same man he had met at the markettown and seen looking in with fagin at the window of his little room
monks cast a look of hate which even then he could not dissemble at the astonished boy and sat down near the door
mr brownlow who had papers in his hand walked to a table near which rose and oliver were seated
this is a painful task said he but these declarations which have been signed in london before many gentlemen must be in substance repeated here
i would have spared you the degradation but we must hear them from your own lips before we part and you know why go on said the person addressed turning away his face
quick
i have almost done enough i think
dont keep me here this child said mr brownlow drawing oliver to him and laying his hand upon his head is your halfbrother the illegitimate son of your father my dear friend edwin leeford by poor young agnes fleming who died in giving him birth yes said monks scowling at the trembling boy the beating of whose heart he might have heard
that is the bastard child the term you use said mr brownlow sternly is a reproach to those long since passed beyond the feeble censure of the world
it reflects disgrace on no one living except you who use it
let that pass
he was born in this town in the workhouse of this town was the sullen reply
you have the story there he pointed impatiently to the papers as he spoke
i must have it here too said mr brownlow looking round upon the listeners
listen then
you returned monks
his father being taken ill at rome was joined by his wife my mother from whom he had been long separated who went from paris and took me with herto look after his property for what i know for she had no great affection for him nor he for her
he knew nothing of us for his senses were gone and he slumbered on till next day when he died
among the papers in his desk were two dated on the night his illness first came on directed to yourself he addressed himself to mr brownlow and enclosed in a few short lines to you with an intimation on the cover of the package that it was not to be forwarded till after he was dead
one of these papers was a letter to this girl agnes the other a will what of the letter asked mr brownlow
the lettera sheet of paper crossed and crossed again with a penitent confession and prayers to god to help her
he had palmed a tale on the girl that some secret mysteryto be explained one dayprevented his marrying her just then and so she had gone on trusting patiently to him until she trusted too far and lost what none could ever give her back
she was at that time within a few months of her confinement
he told her all he had meant to do to hide her shame if he had lived and prayed her if he died not to curse his memory or think the consequences of their sin would be visited on her or their young child for all the guilt was his
he reminded her of the day he had given her the little locket and the ring with her christian name engraved upon it and a blank left for that which he hoped one day to have bestowed upon herprayed her yet to keep it and wear it next her heart as she had done beforeand then ran on wildly in the same words over and over again as if he had gone distracted
i believe he had the will said mr brownlow as olivers tears fell fast
monks was silent
the will said mr brownlow speaking for him was in the same spirit as the letter
he talked of miseries which his wife had brought upon him of the rebellious disposition vice malice and premature bad passions of you his only son who had been trained to hate him and left you and your mother each an annuity of eight hundred pounds
the bulk of his property he divided into two equal portionsone for agnes fleming and the other for their child if it should be born alive and ever come of age
if it were a girl it was to inherit the money unconditionally but if a boy only on the stipulation that in his minority he should never have stained his name with any public act of dishonour meanness cowardice or wrong
he did this he said to mark his confidence in the mother and his convictiononly strengthened by approaching deaththat the child would share her gentle heart and noble nature
if he were disappointed in this expectation then the money was to come to you for then and not till then when both children were equal would he recognise your prior claim upon his purse who had none upon his heart but had from an infant repulsed him with coldness and aversion my mother said monks in a louder tone did what a woman should have done
she burnt this will
the letter never reached its destination but that and other proofs she kept in case they ever tried to lie away the blot
the girls father had the truth from her with every aggravation that her violent hatei love her for it nowcould add
goaded by shame and dishonour he fled with his children into a remote corner of wales changing his very name that his friends might never know of his retreat and here no great while afterwards he was found dead in his bed
the girl had left her home in secret some weeks before he had searched for her on foot in every town and village near it was on the night when he returned home assured that she had destroyed herself to hide her shame and his that his old heart broke there was a short silence here until mr brownlow took up the thread of the narrative
years after this he said this mansedward leefordsmother came to me
he had left her when only eighteen robbed her of jewels and money gambled squandered forged and fled to london where for two years he had associated with the lowest outcasts
she was sinking under a painful and incurable disease and wished to recover him before she died
inquiries were set on foot and strict searches made
they were unavailing for a long time but ultimately successful and he went back with her to france there she died said monks after a lingering illness and on her deathbed she bequeathed these secrets to me together with her unquenchable and deadly hatred of all whom they involvedthough she need not have left me that for i had inherited it long before
she would not believe that the girl had destroyed herself and the child too but was filled with the impression that a male child had been born and was alive
i swore to her if ever it crossed my path to hunt it down never to let it rest to pursue it with the bitterest and most unrelenting animosity to vent upon it the hatred that i deeply felt and to spit upon the empty vaunt of that insulting will by dragging it if i could to the very gallowsfoot
she was right
he came in my way at last
i began well and but for babbling drabs i would have finished as i began as the villain folded his arms tight together and muttered curses on himself in the impotence of baffled malice mr brownlow turned to the terrified group beside him and explained that the jew who had been his old accomplice and confidant had a large reward for keeping oliver ensnared of which some part was to be given up in the event of his being rescued and that a dispute on this head had led to their visit to the country house for the purpose of identifying him
the locket and ring said mr brownlow turning to monks
i bought them from the man and woman i told you of who stole them from the nurse who stole them from the corpse answered monks without raising his eyes
you know what became of them mr brownlow merely nodded to mr grimwig who disappearing with great alacrity shortly returned pushing in mrs bumble and dragging her unwilling consort after him
do my his deceive me cried mr bumble with illfeigned enthusiasm or is that little oliver
oh oliver if you knowd how ive been agrieving for you hold your tongue fool murmured mrs bumble
isnt natur natur mrs bumble remonstrated the workhouse master
cant i be supposed to feeli as brought him up porochiallywhen i see him asetting here among ladies and gentlemen of the very affablest description
i always loved that boy as if hed been mymymy own grandfather said mr bumble halting for an appropriate comparison
master oliver my dear you remember the blessed gentleman in the white waistcoat
ah
he went to heaven last week in a oak coffin with plated handles oliver come sir said mr grimwig tartly suppress your feelings i will do my endeavours sir replied mr bumble
how do you do sir
i hope you are very well this salutation was addressed to mr brownlow who had stepped up to within a short distance of the respectable couple
he inquired as he pointed to monks do you know that person no replied mrs bumble flatly
perhaps you dont said mr brownlow addressing her spouse
i never saw him in all my life said mr bumble
nor sold him anything perhaps no replied mrs bumble
you never had perhaps a certain gold locket and ring said mr brownlow
certainly not replied the matron
why are we brought here to answer to such nonsense as this again mr brownlow nodded to mr grimwig and again that gentleman limped away with extraordinary readiness
but not again did he return with a stout man and wife for this time he led in two palsied women who shook and tottered as they walked
you shut the door the night old sally died said the foremost one raising her shrivelled hand but you couldnt shut out the sound nor stop the chinks no no said the other looking round her and wagging her toothless jaws
no no no we heard her try to tell you what shed done and saw you take a paper from her hand and watched you too next day to the pawnbrokers shop said the first
yes added the second and it was a locket and gold ring we found out that and saw it given you
we were by
oh
we were by and we know more than that resumed the first for she told us often long ago that the young mother had told her that feeling she should never get over it she was on her way at the time that she was taken ill to die near the grave of the father of the child would you like to see the pawnbroker himself asked mr grimwig with a motion towards the door
no replied the woman if heshe pointed to monkshas been coward enough to confess as i see he has and you have sounded all these hags till you have found the right ones i have nothing more to say
i did sell them and theyre where youll never get them
what then nothing replied mr brownlow except that it remains for us to take care that neither of you is employed in a situation of trust again
you may leave the room i hope said mr bumble looking about him with great ruefulness as mr grimwig disappeared with the two old women i hope that this unfortunate little circumstance will not deprive me of my porochial office indeed it will replied mr brownlow
you may make up your mind to that and think yourself well off besides it was all mrs bumble
she would do it urged mr bumble first looking round to ascertain that his partner had left the room
that is no excuse replied mr brownlow
you were present on the occasion of the destruction of these trinkets and indeed are the more guilty of the two in the eye of the law for the law supposes that your wife acts under your direction if the law supposes that said mr bumble squeezing his hat emphatically in both hands the law is a assa idiot
if thats the eye of the law the law is a bachelor and the worst i wish the law is that his eye may be opened by experienceby experience laying great stress on the repetition of these two words mr bumble fixed his hat on very tight and putting his hands in his pockets followed his helpmate downstairs
young lady said mr brownlow turning to rose give me your hand
do not tremble
you need not fear to hear the few remaining words we have to say if they havei do not know how they can but if they haveany reference to me said rose pray let me hear them at some other time
i have not strength or spirits now nay returned the old gentlman drawing her arm through his you have more fortitude than this i am sure
do you know this young lady sir yes replied monks
i never saw you before said rose faintly
i have seen you often returned monks
the father of the unhappy agnes had two daughters said mr brownlow
what was the fate of the otherthe child the child replied monks when her father died in a strange place in a strange name without a letter book or scrap of paper that yielded the faintest clue by which his friends or relatives could be tracedthe child was taken by some wretched cottagers who reared it as their own go on said mr brownlow signing to mrs maylie to approach
go on you couldnt find the spot to which these people had repaired said monks but where friendship fails hatred will often force a way
my mother found it after a year of cunning searchay and found the child she took it did she no
the people were poor and began to sickenat least the man didof their fine humanity so she left it with them giving them a small present of money which would not last long and promised more which she never meant to send
she didnt quite rely however on their discontent and poverty for the childs unhappiness but told the history of the sisters shame with such alterations as suited her bade them take good heed of the child for she came of bad blood and told them she was illegitimate and sure to go wrong at one time or other
the circumstances countenanced all this the people believed it and there the child dragged on an existence miserable enough even to satisfy us until a widow lady residing then at chester saw the girl by chance pitied her and took her home
there was some cursed spell i think against us for in spite of all our efforts she remained there and was happy
i lost sight of her two or three years ago and saw her no more until a few months back do you see her now yes
leaning on your arm but not the less my niece cried mrs maylie folding the fainting girl in her arms not the less my dearest child
i would not lose her now for all the treasures of the world
my sweet companion my own dear girl the only friend i ever had cried rose clinging to her
the kindest best of friends
my heart will burst
i cannot bear all this you have borne more and have been through all the best and gentlest creature that ever shed happiness on every one she knew said mrs maylie embracing her tenderly
come come my love remember who this is who waits to clasp you in his arms poor child
see herelook look my dear not aunt cried oliver throwing his arms about her neck ill never call her auntsister my own dear sister that something taught my heart to love so dearly from the first
rose dear darling rose let the tears which fell and the broken words which were exchanged in the long close embrace between the orphans be sacred
a father sister and mother were gained and lost in that one moment
joy and grief were mingled in the cup but there were no bitter tears for even grief itself arose so softened and clothed in such sweet and tender recollections that it became a solemn pleasure and lost all character of pain
they were a long long time alone
a soft tap at the door at length announced that some one was without
oliver opened it glided away and gave place to harry maylie
i know it all he said taking a seat beside the lovely girl
dear rose i know it all i am not here by accident he added after a lengthened silence nor have i heard all this tonight for i knew it yesterdayonly yesterday
do you guess that i have come to remind you of a promise stay said rose
you do know all all
you gave me leave at any time within a year to renew the subject of our last discourse i did not to press you to alter your determination pursued the young man but to hear you repeat it if you would
i was to lay whatever of station or fortune i might possess at your feet and if you still adhered to your former determination i pledged myself by no word or act to seek to change it the same reasons which influenced me then will influence me now said rose firmly
if i ever owed a strict and rigid duty to her whose goodness saved me from a life of indigence and suffering when should i ever feel it as i should tonight
it is a struggle said rose but one i am proud to make it is a pang but one my heart shall bear the disclosure of tonightharry began
the disclosure of tonight replied rose softly leaves me in the same position with reference to you as that in which i stood before you harden your heart against me rose urged her lover
oh harry harry said the young lady bursting into tears i wish i could and spare myself this pain then why inflict it on yourself said harry taking her hand
think dear rose think what you have heard tonight and what have i heard
what have i heard cried rose
that a sense of his deep disgrace so worked upon my own father that he shunned allthere we have said enough harry we have said enough not yet not yet said the young man detaining her as she rose
my hopes my wishes prospects feeling every thought in life except my love for you have undergone a change
i offer you now no distinction among a bustling crowd no mingling with a world of malice and detraction where the blood is called into honest cheeks by aught but real disgrace and shame but a homea heart and homeyes dearest rose and those and those alone are all i have to offer what do you mean she faltered
i mean but thisthat when i left you last i left you with a firm determination to level all fancied barriers between yourself and me resolved that if my world could not be yours i would make yours mine that no pride of birth should curl the lip at you for i would turn from it
this i have done
those who have shrunk from me because of this have shrunk from you and proved you so far right
such power and patronage such relatives of influence and rank as smiled upon me then look coldly now but there are smiling fields and waving trees in englands richest county and by one village churchmine rose my ownthere stands a rustic dwelling which you can make me prouder of than all the hopes i have renounced measured a thousandfold
this is my rank and station now and here i lay it down its a trying thing waiting supper for lovers said mr grimwig waking up and pulling his pockethandkerchief from over his head
truth to tell the supper had been waiting a most unreasonable time
neither mrs maylie nor harry nor rose who all came in together could offer a word in extenuation
i had serious thoughts of eating my head tonight said mr grimwig for i began to think i should get nothing else
ill take the liberty if youll allow me of saluting the bride that is to be mr grimwig lost no time in carrying this notice into effect upon the blushing girl and the example being contagious was followed both by the doctor and mr brownlow some people affirm that harry maylie had been observed to set it originally in a dark room adjoining but the best authorities consider this downright scandal he being young and a clergyman
oliver my child said mrs maylie where have you been and why do you look so sad
there are tears stealing down your face at this moment
what is the matter it is a world of disappointment often to the hopes we most cherish and hopes that do our nature the greatest honour
poor dick was dead
fagins last night alive the court was paved from floor to roof with human faces
inquisitive and eager eyes peered from every inch of space
from the rail before the dock away into the sharpest angle of the smallest corner in the galleries all looks were fixed upon one manfagin
before him and behind above below on the right and on the left he seemed to stand surrounded by a firmament all bright with gleaming eyes
he stood there in all this glare of living light with one hand resting on the wooden slab before him the other held to his ear and his head thrust forward to enable him to catch with greater distinctness every word that fell from the presiding judge who was delivering his charge to the jury
at times he turned his eyes sharply upon them to observe the effect of the slightest featherweight in his favour and when the points against him were stated with terrible distinctness looked towards his counsel in mute appeal that he would even then urge something in his behalf
beyond these manifestations of anxiety he stirred not hand or foot
he had scarcely moved since the trial began and now that the judge ceased to speak he still remained in the same strained attitude of close attention with his gaze bent on him as though he listened still
a slight bustle in the court recalled him to himself
looking round he saw that the jurymen had turned together to consider their verdict
as his eyes wandered to the gallery he could see the people rising above each other to see his face some hastily applying their glasses to their eyes and others whispering their neighbours with looks expressive of abhorrence
a few there were who seemed unmindful of him and looked only to the jury in impatient wonder how they could delay
but in no one facenot even among the women of whom there were many therecould he read the faintest sympathy with himself or any feeling but one of allabsorbing interest that he should be condemned
as he saw all this in one bewildered glance the deathlike stillness came again and looking back he saw that the jurymen had turned towards the judge
hush
they only sought permission to retire
he looked wistfully into their faces one by one when they passed out as though to see which way the greater number leant but that was fruitless
the jailer touched him on the shoulder
he followed mechanically to the end of the dock and sat down on a chair
the man pointed it out or he would not have seen it
he looked up into the gallery again
some of the people were eating and some fanning themselves with handkerchiefs for the crowded place was very hot
there was one young man sketching his face in a little notebook
he wondered whether it was like and looked on when the artist broke his pencilpoint and made another with his knife as any idle spectator might have done
in the same way when he turned his eyes towards the judge his mind began to busy itself with the fashion of his dress and what it cost and how he put it on
there was an old fat gentleman on the bench too who had gone out some half an hour before and now come back
he wondered within himself whether this man had been to get his dinner what he had had and where he had had it and pursued this train of careless thought until some new object caught his eye and roused another
not that all this time his mind was for an instant free from one oppressive overwhelming sense of the grave that opened at his feet it was ever present to him but in a vague and general way and he could not fix his thoughts upon it
thus even while he trembled and turned burning hot at the idea of speedy death he fell to counting the iron spikes before him and wondering how the head of one had been broken off and whether they would mend it or leave it as it was
then he thought of all the horrors of the gallows and the scaffoldand stopped to watch a man sprinkling the floor to cool itand then went on to think again
at length there was a cry of silence and a breathless look from all towards the door
the jury returned and passed him close
he could glean nothing from their faces they might as well have been of stone
perfect stillness ensuednot a rustlenot a breathguilty
the building rang with a tremendous shout and another and another and then it echoed loud groans that gathered strength as they swelled out like angry thunder
it was a peal of joy from the populace outside greeting the news that he would die on monday
the noise subsided and he was asked if he had anything to say why sentence of death should not be passed upon him
he had resumed his listening attitude and looked intently at his questioner while the demand was made but it was twice repeated before he seemed to hear it and then he only muttered that he was an old manan old manand so dropping into a whisper was silent again
the judge assumed the black cap and the prisoner still stood with the same air and gesture
a woman in the gallery uttered some exclamation called forth by this dread solemnity he looked hastily up as if angry at the interruption and bent forward yet more attentively
the address was solemn and impressive the sentence fearful to hear
but he stood like a marble figure without the motion of a nerve
his haggard face was still thrust forward his underjaw hanging down and his eyes staring out before him when the jailer put his hand upon his arm and beckoned him away
he gazed stupidly about him for an instant and obeyed
they led him through a paved room under the court where some prisoners were waiting till their turns came and others were talking to their friends who crowded round a grate which looked into the open yard
there was nobody there to speak to him but as he passed the prisoners fell back to render him more visible to the people who were clinging to the bars and they assailed him with opprobrious names and screeched and hissed
he shook his fist and would have spat upon them but his conductors hurried him on through a gloomy passage lighted by a few dim lamps into the interior of the prison
here he was searched that he might not have about him the means of anticipating the law this ceremony performed they led him to one of the condemned cells and left him therealone
he sat down on a stone bench opposite the door which served for seat and bedstead and casting his bloodshot eyes upon the ground tried to collect his thoughts
after awhile he began to remember a few disjointed fragments of what the judge had said though it had seemed to him at the time that he could not hear a word
these gradually fell into their proper places and by degrees suggested more so that in a little time he had the whole almost as it was delivered
to be hanged by the neck till he was deadthat was the end
to be hanged by the neck till he was dead
as it came on very dark he began to think of all the men he had known who had died upon the scaffold some of them through his means
they rose up in such quick succession that he could hardly count them
he had seen some of them dieand had joked too because they died with prayers upon their lips
with what a rattling noise the drop went down and how suddenly they changed from strong and vigorous men to dangling heaps of clothes
some of them might have inhabited that very cellsat upon that very spot
it was very dark why didnt they bring a light
the cell had been built for many years
scores of men must have passed their last hours there
it was like sitting in a vault strewn with dead bodiesthe cap the noose the pinioned arms the faces that he knew even beneath that hideous veillight light
at length when his hands were raw with beating against the heavy door and walls two men appeared one bearing a candle which he thrust into an iron candlestick fixed against the wall the other dragging in a mattress on which to pass the night for the prisoner was to be left alone no more
then came the nightdark dismal silent night
other watchers are glad to hear this churchclock strike for they tell of life and coming day
to him they brought despair
the boom of every iron bell came laden with the one deep hollow sounddeath
what availed the noise and bustle of cheerful morning which penetrated even there to him
it was another form of knell with mockery added to the warning
the day passed off
day
there was no day it was gone as soon as comeand night came on again night so long and yet so short long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours
at one time he raved and blasphemed and at another howled and tore his hair
venerable men of his own persuasion had come to pray beside him but he had driven them away with curses
they renewed their charitable efforts and he beat them off
saturday night
he had only one night more to live
and as he thought of this the day brokesunday
it was not until the night of this last awful day that a withering sense of his helpless desperate state came in its full intensity upon his blighted soul not that he had ever held any defined or positive hope of mercy but that he had never been able to consider more than the dim probability of dying so soon
he had spoken little to either of the two men who relieved each other in their attendance upon him and they for their parts made no effort to rouse his attention
he had sat there awake but dreaming
now he started up every minute and with gasping mouth and burning skin hurried to and fro in such a paroxysm of fear and wrath that even theyused to such sightsrecoiled from him with horror
he grew so terrible at last in all the tortures of his evil conscience that one man could not bear to sit there eyeing him alone and so the two kept watch together
he cowered down upon his stone bed and thought of the past
he had been wounded with some missiles from the crowd on the day of his capture and his head was bandaged with a linen cloth
his red hair hung down upon his bloodless face his beard was torn and twisted into knots his eyes shone with a terrible light his unwashed flesh crackled with the fever that burnt him up

if it was not a trick to frighten him and those were the real hours treading on each others heels where would he be when they came round again
eleven
another struck before the voice of the previous hour had ceased to vibrate
at eight he would be the only mourner in his own funeral train at eleven those dreadful walls of newgate which have hidden so much misery and such unspeakable anguish not only from the eyes but too often and too long from the thoughts of men never held so dread a spectacle as that
the few who lingered as they passed and wondered what the man was doing who was to be hanged tomorrow would have slept but ill that night if they could have seen him
from early in the evening until nearly midnight little groups of two and three presented themselves at the lodgegate and inquired with anxious faces whether any reprieve had been received
these being answered in the negative communicated the welcome intelligence to clusters in the street who pointed out to one another the door from which he must come out and showed where the scaffold would be built and walking with unwilling steps away turned back to conjure up the scene
by degrees they fell off one by one and for an hour in the dead of night the street was left to solitude and darkness
the space before the prison was cleared and a few strong barriers painted black had been already thrown across the road to break the pressure of the expected crowd when mr brownlow and oliver appeared at the wicket and presented an order of admission to the prisoner signed by one of the sheriffs
they were immediately admitted into the lodge
is the young gentleman to come too sir said the man whose duty it was to conduct them
its not a sight for children sir it is not indeed my friend rejoined mr brownlow but my business with this man is intimately connected with him and as this child has seen him in the full career of his success and villainy i think it as welleven at the cost of some pain and fearthat he should see him now these few words had been said apart so as to be inaudible to oliver
the man touched his hat and glancing at oliver with some curiousity opened another gate opposite to that by which they had entered and led them on through dark and winding ways towards the cells
this said the man stopping in a gloomy passage where a couple of workmen were making some preparations in profound silencethis is the place he passes through
if you step this way you can see the door he goes out at he led them into a stone kitchen fitted with coppers for dressing the prison food and pointed to a door
there was an open grating above it through which came the sound of mens voices mingled with the noise of hammering and the throwing down of boards
they were putting up the scaffold
from this place they passed through several strong gates opened by other turnkeys from the inner side and having entered an open yard ascended a flight of narrow steps and came into a passage with a row of strong doors on the left hand
motioning them to remain where they were the turnkey knocked at one of these with his bunch of keys
the two attendants after a little whispering came out into the passage stretching themselves as if glad of the temporary relief and motioned the visitors to follow the jailer into the cell
they did so
the condemned criminal was seated on his bed rocking himself from side to side with a countenance more like that of a snared beast than the face of a man
his mind was evidently wandering to his old life for he continued to mutter without appearing conscious of their presence otherwise than as a part of his vision
good boy charleywell done he mumbled
oliver too ha
ha
ha
oliver tooquite the gentleman nowquite thetake that boy away to bed the jailer took the disengaged hand of oliver and whispering him not to be alarmed looked on without speaking
take him away to bed cried fagin
do you hear me some of you
he has been thethesomehow the cause of all this
its worth the money to bring him up to itbolters throat bill never mind the girlbolters throat as deep as you can cut
saw his head off fagin said the jailer
thats me cried the jew falling instantly into the attitude of listening he had assumed upon his trial
an old man my lord a very old old man here said the turnkey laying his hand upon his breast to keep him down
heres somebody wants to see you to ask you some questions i suppose
fagin fagin
are you a man i shant be one long he replied looking up with a face retaining no human expression but rage and terror
strike them all dead
what right have they to butcher me as he spoke he caught sight of oliver and mr brownlow
shrinking to the furthest corner of the seat he demanded to know what they wanted there
steady said the turnkey still holding him down
now sir tell him what you want
quick if you please for he grows worse as the time gets on you have some papers said mr brownlow advancing which were placed in your hands for better security by a man called monks its all a lie together replied fagin
i havent onenot one for the love of god said mr brownlow solemnly do not say that now upon the very verge of death but tell me where they are
you know that sikes is dead that monks has confessed that there is no hope of any further gain
where are those papers oliver cried fagin beckoning to him
here here
let me whisper to you i am not afraid said oliver in a low voice as he relinquished mr brownlows hand
the papers said fagin drawing oliver towards him are in a canvas bag in a hole a little way up the chimney in the top frontroom
i want to talk to you my dear
i want to talk to you yes yes returned oliver
let me say a prayer
do
let me say one prayer
say only one upon your knees with me and we will talk till morning outside outside replied fagin pushing the boy before him towards the door and looking vacantly over his head
say ive gone to sleeptheyll believe you
you can get me out if you take me so
now then now then oh
god forgive this wretched man cried the boy with a burst of tears
thats right thats right said fagin
thatll help us on
this door first
if i shake and tremble as we pass the gallows dont you mind but hurry on
now now now have you nothing else to ask him sir inquired the turnkey
no other question replied mr brownlow
if i hoped we could recall him to a sense of his position nothing will do that sir replied the man shaking his head
you had better leave him the door of the cell opened and the attendants returned
press on press on cried fagin
softly but not so slow
faster faster the men laid hands upon him and disengaging oliver from his grasp held him back
he struggled with the power of desperation for an instant and then sent up cry upon cry that penetrated even those massive walls and rang in their ears until they reached the open yard
it was some time before they left the prison
oliver nearly swooned after this frightful scene and was so weak that for an hour or more he had not the strength to walk
day was dawning when they again emerged
a great multitude had already assembled the windows were filled with people smoking and playing cards to beguile the time the crowd were pushing quarrelling joking
everything told of life and animation but one dark cluster of objects in the centre of allthe black stage the crossbeam the rope and all the hideous apparatus of death
and last the fortunes of those who have figured in this tale are nearly closed
the little that remains to their historian to relate is told in few and simple words
before three months had passed rose fleming and harry maylie were married in the village church which was henceforth to be the scene of the young clergymans labours on the same day they entered into possession of their new and happy home
mrs maylie took up her abode with her son and daughterinlaw to enjoy during the tranquil remainder of her days the greatest felicity that age and worth can knowthe contemplation of the happiness of those on whom the warmest affections and tenderest cares of a wellspent life have been unceasingly bestowed
it appeared on full and careful investigation that if the wreck of property remaining in the custody of monks which had never prospered either in his hands or in those of his mother were equally divided between himself and oliver it would yield to each little more than three thousand pounds
by the provisions of his fathers will oliver would have been entitled to the whole but mr brownlow unwilling to deprive the elder son of the opportunity of retrieving his former vices and pursuing an honest career proposed this mode of distribution to which his young charge joyfully acceded
monks still bearing that assumed name retired with his portion to a distant part of the new world where having quickly squandered it he once more fell into his old courses and after undergoing a long confinement for some fresh act of fraud and knavery at length sunk under an attack of his old disorder and died in prison
as far from home died the chief remaining members of his friend fagins gang
mr brownlow adopted oliver as his son
removing with him and the old housekeeper to within a mile of the parsonagehouse where his dear friends resided he gratified the only remaining wish of olivers warm and earnest heart and thus linked together a little society whose condition approached as nearly to one of perfect happiness as can ever be known in this changing world
soon after the marriage of the young people the worthy doctor returned to chertsey where bereft of the presence of his old friends he would have been discontented if his temperament had admitted of such a feeling and would have turned quite peevish if he had known how
for two or three months he contented himself with hinting that he feared the air began to disagree with him then finding that the place really no longer was to him what it had been he settled his business on his assistant took a bachelors cottage outside the village of which his young friend was pastor and instantaneously recovered
here he took to gardening planting fishing carpentering and various other pursuits of a similar kind all undertaken with his characteristic impetuosity
in each and all he has since become famous throughout the neighborhood as a most profound authority
before his removal he had managed to contract a strong friendship for mr grimwig which that eccentric gentleman cordially reciprocated
he is accordingly visited by mr grimwig a great many times in the course of the year
on all such occasions mr grimwig plants fishes and carpenters with great ardour doing everything in a very singular and unprecedented manner but always maintaining with his favourite asseveration that his mode is the right one
on sundays he never fails to criticise the sermon to the young clergymans face always informing mr losberne in strict confidence afterwards that he considers it an excellent performance but deems it as well not to say so
it is a standing and very favourite joke for mr brownlow to rally him on his old prophecy concerning oliver and to remind him of the night on which they sat with the watch between them waiting his return but mr grimwig contends that he was right in the main and in proof thereof remarks that oliver did not come back after all which always calls forth a laugh on his side and increases his good humour
mr noah claypole receiving a free pardon from the crown in consequence of being admitted approver against fagin and considering his profession not altogether as safe a one as he could wish was for some little time at a loss for the means of a livelihood not burdened with too much work
after some consideration he went into business as an informer in which calling he realises a genteel subsistence
his plan is to walk out once a week during church time attended by charlotte in respectable attire
the lady faints away at the doors of charitable publicans and the gentleman being accommodated with threepenny worth of brandy to restore her lays an information next day and pockets half the penalty
sometimes mr claypole faints himself but the result is the same
mr and mrs bumble deprived of their situations were gradually reduced to great indigence and misery and finally became paupers in that very same workhouse in which they had once lorded it over others
mr bumble has been heard to say that in this reverse and degradation he has not even spirits to be thankful for being separated from his wife
as to mr giles and brittles they still remain in their old posts although the former is bald and the lastnamed boy quite grey
they sleep at the parsonage but divide their attentions so equally among its inmates and oliver and mr brownlow and mr losberne that to this day the villagers have never been able to discover to which establishment they properly belong
master charles bates appalled by sikess crime fell into a train of reflection whether an honest life was not after all the best
arriving at the conclusion that it certainly was he turned his back upon the scenes of the past resolved to amend it in some new sphere of action
he struggled hard and suffered much for some time but having a contented disposition and a good purpose succeeded in the end and from being a farmers drudge and a carriers lad he is now the merriest young grazier in all northamptonshire
and now the hand that traces these words falters as it approaches the conclusion of its task and would weave for a little longer space the thread of these adventures
i would fain linger yet with a few of those among whom i have so long moved and share their happiness by endeavouring to depict it
i would show rose maylie in all the bloom and grace of early womanhood shedding on her secluded path in life soft and gentle light that fell on all who trod it with her and shone into their hearts
i would paint her the life and joy of the fireside circle and the lively summer group i would follow her through the sultry fields at noon and hear the low tones of her sweet voice in the moonlit evening walk i would watch her in all her goodness and charity abroad and the smiling untiring discharge of domestic duties at home i would paint her and her dead sisters child happy in their love for one another and passing whole hours together in picturing the friends whom they had so sadly lost i would summon before me once again those joyous little faces that clustered round her knee and listen to their merry prattle i would recall the tones of that clear laugh and conjure up the sympathising tear that glistened in the soft blue eye
these and a thousand looks and smiles and turns of thought and speechi would fain recall them every one
how mr brownlow went on from day to day filling the mind of his adopted child with stores of knowledge and becoming attached to him more and more as his nature developed itself and showed the thriving seeds of all he wished him to becomehow he traced in him new traits of his early friend that awakened in his own bosom old remembrances melancholy and yet sweet and soothinghow the two orphans tried by adversity remembered its lessons in mercy to others and mutual love and fervent thanks to him who had protected and preserved themthese are all matters which need not to be told
i have said that they were truly happy and without strong affection and humanity of heart and gratitude to that being whose code is mercy and whose great attribute is benevolence to all things that breathe happiness can never be attained
within the altar of the old village church there stands a white marble tablet which bears as yet but one word agnes there is no coffin in that tomb and may it be many many years before another name is placed above it
but if the spirits of the dead ever come back to earth to visit spots hallowed by the lovethe love beyond the graveof those whom they knew in life i believe that the shade of agnes sometimes hovers round that solemn nook
i believe it none the less because that nook is in a church and she was weak and erring
