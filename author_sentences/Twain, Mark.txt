the author
huckleberry finn scene the mississippi valley time forty to fifty years ago you don't know about me without you have read a book by the name of the adventures of tom sawyer but that ain't no matter
that book was made by mr mark twain and he told the truth mainly
there was things which he stretched but mainly he told the truth
that is nothing
i never seen anybody but lied one time or another without it was aunt polly or the widow or maybe mary
aunt pollytom's aunt polly she isand mary and the widow douglas is all told about in that book which is mostly a true book with some stretchers as i said before
now the way that the book winds up is this tom and me found the money that the robbers hid in the cave and it made us rich
we got six thousand dollars apieceall gold
it was an awful sight of money when it was piled up
well judge thatcher he took it and put it out at interest and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year roundmore than a body could tell what to do with
the widow douglas she took me for her son and allowed she would sivilize me but it was rough living in the house all the time considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her ways and so when i couldn't stand it no longer i lit out
i got into my old rags and my sugarhogshead again and was free and satisfied
but tom sawyer he hunted me up and said he was going to start a band of robbers and i might join if i would go back to the widow and be respectable
so i went back
the widow she cried over me and called me a poor lost lamb and she called me a lot of other names too but she never meant no harm by it
she put me in them new clothes again and i couldn't do nothing but sweat and sweat and feel all cramped up
well then the old thing commenced again
the widow rung a bell for supper and you had to come to time
when you got to the table you couldn't go right to eating but you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little over the victuals though there warn't really anything the matter with themthat is nothing only everything was cooked by itself
in a barrel of odds and ends it is different things get mixed up and the juice kind of swaps around and the things go better
after supper she got out her book and learned me about moses and the bulrushers and i was in a sweat to find out all about him but by and by she let it out that moses had been dead a considerable long time so then i didn't care no more about him because i don't take no stock in dead people
pretty soon i wanted to smoke and asked the widow to let me
but she wouldn't
she said it was a mean practice and wasn't clean and i must try to not do it any more
that is just the way with some people
they get down on a thing when they don't know nothing about it
here she was abothering about moses which was no kin to her and no use to anybody being gone you see yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a thing that had some good in it
and she took snuff too of course that was all right because she done it herself
her sister miss watson a tolerable slim old maid with goggles on had just come to live with her and took a set at me now with a spellingbook
she worked me middling hard for about an hour and then the widow made her ease up
i couldn't stood it much longer
then for an hour it was deadly dull and i was fidgety
miss watson would say don't put your feet up there huckleberry and don't scrunch up like that huckleberryset up straight and pretty soon she would say don't gap and stretch like that huckleberrywhy don't you try to behave then she told me all about the bad place and i said i wished i was there
she got mad then but i didn't mean no harm
all i wanted was to go somewheres all i wanted was a change i warn't particular
she said it was wicked to say what i said said she wouldn't say it for the whole world she was going to live so as to go to the good place
well i couldn't see no advantage in going where she was going so i made up my mind i wouldn't try for it
but i never said so because it would only make trouble and wouldn't do no good
now she had got a start and she went on and told me all about the good place
she said all a body would have to do there was to go around all day long with a harp and sing forever and ever
so i didn't think much of it
but i never said so
i asked her if she reckoned tom sawyer would go there and she said not by a considerable sight
i was glad about that because i wanted him and me to be together
miss watson she kept pecking at me and it got tiresome and lonesome
by and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers and then everybody was off to bed
i went up to my room with a piece of candle and put it on the table
then i set down in a chair by the window and tried to think of something cheerful but it warn't no use
i felt so lonesome i most wished i was dead
the stars were shining and the leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful and i heard an owl away off whowhooing about somebody that was dead and a whippowill and a dog crying about somebody that was going to die and the wind was trying to whisper something to me and i couldn't make out what it was and so it made the cold shivers run over me
then away out in the woods i heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about something that's on its mind and can't make itself understood and so can't rest easy in its grave and has to go about that way every night grieving
i got so downhearted and scared i did wish i had some company
pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder and i flipped it off and it lit in the candle and before i could budge it was all shriveled up
i didn't need anybody to tell me that that was an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck so i was scared and most shook the clothes off of me
i got up and turned around in my tracks three times and crossed my breast every time and then i tied up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away
but i hadn't no confidence
you do that when you've lost a horseshoe that you've found instead of nailing it up over the door but i hadn't ever heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you'd killed a spider
i set down again ashaking all over and got out my pipe for a smoke for the house was all as still as death now and so the widow wouldn't know
well after a long time i heard the clock away off in the town go boomboomboomtwelve licks and all still againstiller than ever
pretty soon i heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the treessomething was a stirring
i set still and listened
directly i could just barely hear a meyow
meyow down there
that was good
says i meyow
meyow as soft as i could and then i put out the light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed
then i slipped down to the ground and crawled in among the trees and sure enough there was tom sawyer waiting for me
we went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of the widow's garden stooping down so as the branches wouldn't scrape our heads
when we was passing by the kitchen i fell over a root and made a noise
we scrouched down and laid still
miss watson's big nigger named jim was setting in the kitchen door we could see him pretty clear because there was a light behind him
he got up and stretched his neck out about a minute listening
then he says who dah he listened some more then he come tiptoeing down and stood right between us we could a touched him nearly
well likely it was minutes and minutes that there warn't a sound and we all there so close together
there was a place on my ankle that got to itching but i dasn't scratch it and then my ear begun to itch and next my back right between my shoulders
seemed like i'd die if i couldn't scratch
well i've noticed that thing plenty times since
if you are with the quality or at a funeral or trying to go to sleep when you ain't sleepyif you are anywheres where it won't do for you to scratch why you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places
pretty soon jim says say who is you
whar is you
dog my cats ef i didn' hear sumf'n
well i know what i's gwyne to do i's gwyne to set down here and listen tell i hears it agin so he set down on the ground betwixt me and tom
he leaned his back up against a tree and stretched his legs out till one of them most touched one of mine
my nose begun to itch
it itched till the tears come into my eyes
but i dasn't scratch
then it begun to itch on the inside
next i got to itching underneath
i didn't know how i was going to set still
this miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes but it seemed a sight longer than that
i was itching in eleven different places now
i reckoned i couldn't stand it more'n a minute longer but i set my teeth hard and got ready to try
just then jim begun to breathe heavy next he begun to snoreand then i was pretty soon comfortable again
tom he made a sign to mekind of a little noise with his mouthand we went creeping away on our hands and knees
when we was ten foot off tom whispered to me and wanted to tie jim to the tree for fun
but i said no he might wake and make a disturbance and then they'd find out i warn't in
then tom said he hadn't got candles enough and he would slip in the kitchen and get some more
i didn't want him to try
i said jim might wake up and come
but tom wanted to resk it so we slid in there and got three candles and tom laid five cents on the table for pay
then we got out and i was in a sweat to get away but nothing would do tom but he must crawl to where jim was on his hands and knees and play something on him
i waited and it seemed a good while everything was so still and lonesome
as soon as tom was back we cut along the path around the garden fence and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of the house
tom said he slipped jim's hat off of his head and hung it on a limb right over him and jim stirred a little but he didn't wake
afterwards jim said the witches be witched him and put him in a trance and rode him all over the state and then set him under the trees again and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it
and next time jim told it he said they rode him down to new orleans and after that every time he told it he spread it more and more till by and by he said they rode him all over the world and tired him most to death and his back was all over saddleboils
jim was monstrous proud about it and he got so he wouldn't hardly notice the other niggers
niggers would come miles to hear jim tell about it and he was more looked up to than any nigger in that country
strange niggers would stand with their mouths open and look him all over same as if he was a wonder
niggers is always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire but whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things jim would happen in and say hm
what you know 'bout witches and that nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat
jim always kept that fivecenter piece round his neck with a string and said it was a charm the devil give to him with his own hands and told him he could cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by saying something to it but he never told what it was he said to it
niggers would come from all around there and give jim anything they had just for a sight of that fivecenter piece but they wouldn't touch it because the devil had had his hands on it
jim was most ruined for a servant because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil and been rode by witches
well when tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling where there was sick folks maybe and the stars over us was sparkling ever so fine and down by the village was the river a whole mile broad and awful still and grand
we went down the hill and found jo harper and ben rogers and two or three more of the boys hid in the old tanyard
so we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half to the big scar on the hillside and went ashore
we went to a clump of bushes and tom made everybody swear to keep the secret and then showed them a hole in the hill right in the thickest part of the bushes
then we lit the candles and crawled in on our hands and knees
we went about two hundred yards and then the cave opened up
tom poked about amongst the passages and pretty soon ducked under a wall where you wouldn't a noticed that there was a hole
we went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room all damp and sweaty and cold and there we stopped
tom says now we'll start this band of robbers and call it tom sawyer's gang
everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath and write his name in blood everybody was willing
so tom got out a sheet of paper that he had wrote the oath on and read it
it swore every boy to stick to the band and never tell any of the secrets and if anybody done anything to any boy in the band whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and his family must do it and he mustn't eat and he mustn't sleep till he had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts which was the sign of the band
and nobody that didn't belong to the band could use that mark and if he did he must be sued and if he done it again he must be killed
and if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets he must have his throat cut and then have his carcass burnt up and the ashes scattered all around and his name blotted off of the list with blood and never mentioned again by the gang but have a curse put on it and be forgot forever
everybody said it was a real beautiful oath and asked tom if he got it out of his own head
he said some of it but the rest was out of piratebooks and robberbooks and every gang that was hightoned had it
some thought it would be good to kill the families of boys that told the secrets
tom said it was a good idea so he took a pencil and wrote it in
then ben rogers says here's huck finn he hain't got no family what you going to do 'bout him well hain't he got a father says tom sawyer
yes he's got a father but you can't never find him these days
he used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard but he hain't been seen in these parts for a year or more they talked it over and they was going to rule me out because they said every boy must have a family or somebody to kill or else it wouldn't be fair and square for the others
well nobody could think of anything to doeverybody was stumped and set still
i was most ready to cry but all at once i thought of a way and so i offered them miss watsonthey could kill her
everybody said oh she'll do
that's all right
huck can come in then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with and i made my mark on the paper
now says ben rogers what's the line of business of this gang nothing only robbery and murder tom said
but who are we going to robhouses or cattle or stuff
stealing cattle and such things ain't robbery it's burglary says tom sawyer
we ain't burglars
that ain't no sort of style
we are highwaymen
we stop stages and carriages on the road with masks on and kill the people and take their watches and money must we always kill the people oh certainly
it's best
some authorities think different but mostly it's considered best to kill themexcept some that you bring to the cave here and keep them till they're ransomed ransomed
what's that i don't know
but that's what they do
i've seen it in books and so of course that's what we've got to do but how can we do it if we don't know what it is why blame it all we've got to do it
don't i tell you it's in the books
do you want to go to doing different from what's in the books and get things all muddled up oh that's all very fine to say tom sawyer but how in the nation are these fellows going to be ransomed if we don't know how to do it to themthat's the thing i want to get at
now what do you reckon it is well i don't know
but per'aps if we keep them till they're ransomed it means that we keep them till they're dead now that's something like
that'll answer
why couldn't you said that before
we'll keep them till they're ransomed to death and a bothersome lot they'll be tooeating up everything and always trying to get loose how you talk ben rogers
how can they get loose when there's a guard over them ready to shoot them down if they move a peg a guard
well that is good
so somebody's got to set up all night and never get any sleep just so as to watch them
i think that's foolishness
why can't a body take a club and ransom them as soon as they get here because it ain't in the books sothat's why
now ben rogers do you want to do things regular or don't youthat's the idea
don't you reckon that the people that made the books knows what's the correct thing to do
do you reckon you can learn 'em anything
not by a good deal
no sir we'll just go on and ransom them in the regular way all right
i don't mind but i say it's a fool way anyhow
say do we kill the women too well ben rogers if i was as ignorant as you i wouldn't let on
kill the women
no nobody ever saw anything in the books like that
you fetch them to the cave and you're always as polite as pie to them and by and by they fall in love with you and never want to go home any more well if that's the way i'm agreed but i don't take no stock in it
mighty soon we'll have the cave so cluttered up with women and fellows waiting to be ransomed that there won't be no place for the robbers
but go ahead i ain't got nothing to say little tommy barnes was asleep now and when they waked him up he was scared and cried and said he wanted to go home to his ma and didn't want to be a robber any more
so they all made fun of him and called him crybaby and that made him mad and he said he would go straight and tell all the secrets
but tom give him five cents to keep quiet and said we would all go home and meet next week and rob somebody and kill some people
ben rogers said he couldn't get out much only sundays and so he wanted to begin next sunday but all the boys said it would be wicked to do it on sunday and that settled the thing
they agreed to get together and fix a day as soon as they could and then we elected tom sawyer first captain and jo harper second captain of the gang and so started home
i clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was breaking
my new clothes was all greased up and clayey and i was dogtired
well i got a good goingover in the morning from old miss watson on account of my clothes but the widow she didn't scold but only cleaned off the grease and clay and looked so sorry that i thought i would behave awhile if i could
then miss watson she took me in the closet and prayed but nothing come of it
she told me to pray every day and whatever i asked for i would get it
but it warn't so
i tried it
once i got a fishline but no hooks
it warn't any good to me without hooks
i tried for the hooks three or four times but somehow i couldn't make it work
by and by one day i asked miss watson to try for me but she said i was a fool
she never told me why and i couldn't make it out no way
i set down one time back in the woods and had a long think about it
i says to myself if a body can get anything they pray for why don't deacon winn get back the money he lost on pork
why can't the widow get back her silver snuffbox that was stole
why can't miss watson fat up
no says i to my self there ain't nothing in it
i went and told the widow about it and she said the thing a body could get by praying for it was spiritual gifts this was too many for me but she told me what she meanti must help other people and do everything i could for other people and look out for them all the time and never think about myself
this was including miss watson as i took it
i went out in the woods and turned it over in my mind a long time but i couldn't see no advantage about itexcept for the other people so at last i reckoned i wouldn't worry about it any more but just let it go
sometimes the widow would take me one side and talk about providence in a way to make a body's mouth water but maybe next day miss watson would take hold and knock it all down again
i judged i could see that there was two providences and a poor chap would stand considerable show with the widow's providence but if miss watson's got him there warn't no help for him any more
i thought it all out and reckoned i would belong to the widow's if he wanted me though i couldn't make out how he was agoing to be any better off then than what he was before seeing i was so ignorant and so kind of lowdown and ornery
pap he hadn't been seen for more than a year and that was comfortable for me i didn't want to see him no more
he used to always whale me when he was sober and could get his hands on me though i used to take to the woods most of the time when he was around
well about this time he was found in the river drownded about twelve mile above town so people said
they judged it was him anyway said this drownded man was just his size and was ragged and had uncommon long hair which was all like pap but they couldn't make nothing out of the face because it had been in the water so long it warn't much like a face at all
they said he was floating on his back in the water
they took him and buried him on the bank
but i warn't comfortable long because i happened to think of something
i knowed mighty well that a drownded man don't float on his back but on his face
so i knowed then that this warn't pap but a woman dressed up in a man's clothes
so i was uncomfortable again
i judged the old man would turn up again by and by though i wished he wouldn't
we played robber now and then about a month and then i resigned
all the boys did
we hadn't robbed nobody hadn't killed any people but only just pretended
we used to hop out of the woods and go charging down on hogdrivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market but we never hived any of them
tom sawyer called the hogs ingots and he called the turnips and stuff julery and we would go to the cave and powwow over what we had done and how many people we had killed and marked
but i couldn't see no profit in it
one time tom sent a boy to run about town with a blazing stick which he called a slogan which was the sign for the gang to get together and then he said he had got secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel of spanish merchants and rich arabs was going to camp in cave hollow with two hundred elephants and six hundred camels and over a thousand sumter mules all loaded down with di'monds and they didn't have only a guard of four hundred soldiers and so we would lay in ambuscade as he called it and kill the lot and scoop the things
he said we must slick up our swords and guns and get ready
he never could go after even a turnipcart but he must have the swords and guns all scoured up for it though they was only lath and broomsticks and you might scour at them till you rotted and then they warn't worth a mouthful of ashes more than what they was before
i didn't believe we could lick such a crowd of spaniards and arabs but i wanted to see the camels and elephants so i was on hand next day saturday in the ambuscade and when we got the word we rushed out of the woods and down the hill
but there warn't no spaniards and arabs and there warn't no camels nor no elephants
it warn't anything but a sundayschool picnic and only a primerclass at that
we busted it up and chased the children up the hollow but we never got anything but some doughnuts and jam though ben rogers got a rag doll and jo harper got a hymnbook and a tract and then the teacher charged in and made us drop everything and cut
i didn't see no di'monds and i told tom sawyer so
he said there was loads of them there anyway and he said there was arabs there too and elephants and things
i said why couldn't we see them then
he said if i warn't so ignorant but had read a book called don quixote i would know without asking
he said it was all done by enchantment
he said there was hundreds of soldiers there and elephants and treasure and so on but we had enemies which he called magicians and they had turned the whole thing into an infant sundayschool just out of spite
i said all right then the thing for us to do was to go for the magicians
tom sawyer said i was a numskull
why said he a magician could call up a lot of genies and they would hash you up like nothing before you could say jack robinson
they are as tall as a tree and as big around as a church well i says s'pose we got some genies to help uscan't we lick the other crowd then how you going to get them i don't know
how do they get them why they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring and then the genies come tearing in with the thunder and lightning aripping around and the smoke arolling and everything they're told to do they up and do it
they don't think nothing of pulling a shottower up by the roots and belting a sundayschool superintendent over the head with itor any other man who makes them tear around so why whoever rubs the lamp or the ring
they belong to whoever rubs the lamp or the ring and they've got to do whatever he says
if he tells them to build a palace forty miles long out of di'monds and fill it full of chewinggum or whatever you want and fetch an emperor's daughter from china for you to marry they've got to do itand they've got to do it before sunup next morning too
and more they've got to waltz that palace around over the country wherever you want it you understand well says i i think they are a pack of flatheads for not keeping the palace themselves 'stead of fooling them away like that
and what's moreif i was one of them i would see a man in jericho before i would drop my business and come to him for the rubbing of an old tin lamp how you talk huck finn
why you'd have to come when he rubbed it whether you wanted to or not what
and i as high as a tree and as big as a church
all right then i would come but i lay i'd make that man climb the highest tree there was in the country shucks it ain't no use to talk to you huck finn
you don't seem to know anything somehowperfect saphead i thought all this over for two or three days and then i reckoned i would see if there was anything in it
i got an old tin lamp and an iron ring and went out in the woods and rubbed and rubbed till i sweat like an injun calculating to build a palace and sell it but it warn't no use none of the genies come
so then i judged that all that stuff was only just one of tom sawyer's lies
i reckoned he believed in the arabs and the elephants but as for me i think different
it had all the marks of a sundayschool
well three or four months run along and it was well into the winter now
i had been to school most all the time and could spell and read and write just a little and could say the multiplication table up to six times seven is thirtyfive and i don't reckon i could ever get any further than that if i was to live forever
i don't take no stock in mathematics anyway
at first i hated the school but by and by i got so i could stand it
whenever i got uncommon tired i played hookey and the hiding i got next day done me good and cheered me up
so the longer i went to school the easier it got to be
i was getting sort of used to the widow's ways too and they warn't so raspy on me
living in a house and sleeping in a bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly but before the cold weather i used to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes and so that was a rest to me
i liked the old ways best but i was getting so i liked the new ones too a little bit
the widow said i was coming along slow but sure and doing very satisfactory
she said she warn't ashamed of me
one morning i happened to turn over the saltcellar at breakfast
i reached for some of it as quick as i could to throw over my left shoulder and keep off the bad luck but miss watson was in ahead of me and crossed me off
she says take your hands away huckleberry what a mess you are always making the widow put in a good word for me but that warn't going to keep off the bad luck i knowed that well enough
i started out after breakfast feeling worried and shaky and wondering where it was going to fall on me and what it was going to be
there is ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck but this wasn't one of them kind so i never tried to do anything but just poked along lowspirited and on the watchout
i went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you go through the high board fence
there was an inch of new snow on the ground and i seen somebody's tracks
they had come up from the quarry and stood around the stile a while and then went on around the garden fence
it was funny they hadn't come in after standing around so
i couldn't make it out
it was very curious somehow
i was going to follow around but i stooped down to look at the tracks first
i didn't notice anything at first but next i did
there was a cross in the left bootheel made with big nails to keep off the devil
i was up in a second and shinning down the hill
i looked over my shoulder every now and then but i didn't see nobody
i was at judge thatcher's as quick as i could get there
he said why my boy you are all out of breath
did you come for your interest no sir i says is there some for me oh yes a halfyearly is in last nightover a hundred and fifty dollars
quite a fortune for you
you had better let me invest it along with your six thousand because if you take it you'll spend it no sir i says i don't want to spend it
i don't want it at allnor the six thousand nuther
i want you to take it i want to give it to youthe six thousand and all he looked surprised
he couldn't seem to make it out
he says why what can you mean my boy i says don't you ask me no questions about it please
you'll take itwon't you he says well i'm puzzled
is something the matter please take it says i and don't ask me nothingthen i won't have to tell no lies he studied a while and then he says ohoo
i think i see
you want to sell all your property to menot give it
that's the correct idea then he wrote something on a paper and read it over and says there you see it says 'for a consideration'
that means i have bought it of you and paid you for it
here's a dollar for you
now you sign it so i signed it and left
miss watson's nigger jim had a hairball as big as your fist which had been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox and he used to do magic with it
he said there was a spirit inside of it and it knowed everything
so i went to him that night and told him pap was here again for i found his tracks in the snow
what i wanted to know was what he was going to do and was he going to stay
jim got out his hairball and said something over it and then he held it up and dropped it on the floor
it fell pretty solid and only rolled about an inch
jim tried it again and then another time and it acted just the same
jim got down on his knees and put his ear against it and listened
but it warn't no use he said it wouldn't talk
he said sometimes it wouldn't talk without money
i told him i had an old slick counterfeit quarter that warn't no good because the brass showed through the silver a little and it wouldn't pass nohow even if the brass didn't show because it was so slick it felt greasy and so that would tell on it every time
i reckoned i wouldn't say nothing about the dollar i got from the judge
i said it was pretty bad money but maybe the hairball would take it because maybe it wouldn't know the difference
jim smelt it and bit it and rubbed it and said he would manage so the hairball would think it was good
he said he would split open a raw irish potato and stick the quarter in between and keep it there all night and next morning you couldn't see no brass and it wouldn't feel greasy no more and so anybody in town would take it in a minute let alone a hairball
well i knowed a potato would do that before but i had forgot it
jim put the quarter under the hairball and got down and listened again
this time he said the hairball was all right
he said it would tell my whole fortune if i wanted it to
i says go on
so the hairball talked to jim and jim told it to me
he says yo' ole father doan' know yit what he's agwyne to do

i had shut the door to
then i turned around and there he was
i used to be scared of him all the time he tanned me so much
i reckoned i was scared now too but in a minute i see i was mistakenthat is after the first jolt as you may say when my breath sort of hitched he being so unexpected but right away after i see i warn't scared of him worth bothring about
he was most fifty and he looked it
his hair was long and tangled and greasy and hung down and you could see his eyes shining through like he was behind vines
it was all black no gray so was his long mixedup whiskers
there warn't no color in his face where his face showed it was white not like another man's white but a white to make a body sick a white to make a body's flesh crawla treetoad white a fishbelly white
as for his clothesjust rags that was all
he had one ankle resting on t'other knee the boot on that foot was busted and two of his toes stuck through and he worked them now and then
his hat was laying on the flooran old black slouch with the top caved in like a lid
i stood alooking at him he set there alooking at me with his chair tilted back a little
i set the candle down
i noticed the window was up so he had clumb in by the shed
he kept alooking me all over
by and by he says starchy clothesvery

i can't and here you're aswelling yourself up like this
i ain't the man to stand ityou hear
say lemme hear you read i took up a book and begun something about general washington and the wars
when i'd read about a half a minute he fetched the book a whack with his hand and knocked it across the house
he says it's so

i had my doubts when you told me
now looky here you stop that putting on frills
i won't have it
i'll lay for you my smarty and if i catch you about that school i'll tan you good

i never see such a son he took up a little blue and yaller picture of some cows and a boy and says what's this it's something they give me for learning my lessons good he tore it up and says i'll give you something betteri'll give you a cowhide he set there amumbling and agrowling a minute and then he says ain't you a sweetscented dandy though
a bed and bedclothes and a look'n'glass and a piece of carpet on the floorand your own father got to sleep with the hogs in the tanyard
i never see such a son
i bet i'll take some o' these frills out o' you before i'm done with you
why there ain't no end to your airsthey say you're rich
heyhow's that they liethat's how looky heremind how you talk to me i'm astanding about all i can stand nowso don't gimme no sass
i've been in town two days and i hain't heard nothing but about you bein' rich
i heard about it away down the river too
that's why i come
you git me that money tomorrowi want it i hain't got no money it's a lie
judge thatcher's got it
you git it
i want it i hain't got no money i tell you
you ask judge thatcher he'll tell you the same all right
i'll ask him and i'll make him pungle too or i'll know the reason why
say how much you got in your pocket
i want it i hain't got only a dollar and i want that to it don't make no difference what you want it foryou just shell it out he took it and bit it to see if it was good and then he said he was going down town to get some whisky said he hadn't had a drink all day
when he had got out on the shed he put his head in again and cussed me for putting on frills and trying to be better than him and when i reckoned he was gone he come back and put his head in again and told me to mind about that school because he was going to lay for me and lick me if i didn't drop that
next day he was drunk and he went to judge thatcher's and bullyragged him and tried to make him give up the money but he couldn't and then he swore he'd make the law force him
the judge and the widow went to law to get the court to take me away from him and let one of them be my guardian but it was a new judge that had just come and he didn't know the old man so he said courts mustn't interfere and separate families if they could help it said he'd druther not take a child away from its father
so judge thatcher and the widow had to quit on the business
that pleased the old man till he couldn't rest
he said he'd cowhide me till i was black and blue if i didn't raise some money for him
i borrowed three dollars from judge thatcher and pap took it and got drunk and went ablowing around and cussing and whooping and carrying on and he kept it up all over town with a tin pan till most midnight then they jailed him and next day they had him before court and jailed him again for a week
but he said he was satisfied said he was boss of his son and he'd make it warm for him
when he got out the new judge said he was agoing to make a man of him
so he took him to his own house and dressed him up clean and nice and had him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family and was just old pie to him so to speak
and after supper he talked to him about temperance and such things till the old man cried and said he'd been a fool and fooled away his life but now he was agoing to turn over a new leaf and be a man nobody wouldn't be ashamed of and he hoped the judge would help him and not look down on him
the judge said he could hug him for them words so he cried and his wife she cried again pap said he'd been a man that had always been misunderstood before and the judge said he believed it
the old man said that what a man wanted that was down was sympathy and the judge said it was so so they cried again
and when it was bedtime the old man rose up and held out his hand and says look at it gentlemen and ladies all take ahold of it shake it
there's a hand that was the hand of a hog but it ain't so no more it's the hand of a man that's started in on a new life and'll die before he'll go back
you mark them wordsdon't forget i said them
it's a clean hand now shake itdon't be afeard so they shook it one after the other all around and cried
the judge's wife she kissed it
then the old man he signed a pledgemade his mark
the judge said it was the holiest time on record or something like that
then they tucked the old man into a beautiful room which was the spare room and in the night some time he got powerful thirsty and clumb out on to the porchroof and slid down a stanchion and traded his new coat for a jug of fortyrod and clumb back again and had a good old time and towards daylight he crawled out again drunk as a fiddler and rolled off the porch and broke his left arm in two places and was most froze to death when somebody found him after sunup
and when they come to look at that spare room they had to take soundings before they could navigate it
the judge he felt kind of sore
he said he reckoned a body could reform the old man with a shotgun maybe but he didn't know no other way
well pretty soon the old man was up and around again and then he went for judge thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money and he went for me too for not stopping school
he catched me a couple of times and thrashed me but i went to school just the same and dodged him or outrun him most of the time
i didn't want to go to school much before but i reckoned i'd go now to spite pap
that law trial was a slow businessappeared like they warn't ever going to get started on it so every now and then i'd borrow two or three dollars off of the judge for him to keep from getting a cowhiding
every time he got money he got drunk and every time he got drunk he raised cain around town and every time he raised cain he got jailed
he was just suitedthis kind of thing was right in his line
he got to hanging around the widow's too much and so she told him at last that if he didn't quit using around there she would make trouble for him
well wasn't he mad
he said he would show who was huck finn's boss
so he watched out for me one day in the spring and catched me and took me up the river about three mile in a skiff and crossed over to the illinois shore where it was woody and there warn't no houses but an old log hut in a place where the timber was so thick you couldn't find it if you didn't know where it was
he kept me with him all the time and i never got a chance to run off
we lived in that old cabin and he always locked the door and put the key under his head nights
he had a gun which he had stole i reckon and we fished and hunted and that was what we lived on
every little while he locked me in and went down to the store three miles to the ferry and traded fish and game for whisky and fetched it home and got drunk and had a good time and licked me
the widow she found out where i was by and by and she sent a man over to try to get hold of me but pap drove him off with the gun and it warn't long after that till i was used to being where i was and liked itall but the cowhide part
it was kind of lazy and jolly laying off comfortable all day smoking and fishing and no books nor study
two months or more run along and my clothes got to be all rags and dirt and i didn't see how i'd ever got to like it so well at the widow's where you had to wash and eat on a plate and comb up and go to bed and get up regular and be forever bothering over a book and have old miss watson pecking at you all the time
i didn't want to go back no more
i had stopped cussing because the widow didn't like it but now i took to it again because pap hadn't no objections
it was pretty good times up in the woods there take it all around
but by and by pap got too handy with his hick'ry and i couldn't stand it
i was all over welts
he got to going away so much too and locking me in
once he locked me in and was gone three days
it was dreadful lonesome
i judged he had got drownded and i wasn't ever going to get out any more
i was scared
i made up my mind i would fix up some way to leave there
i had tried to get out of that cabin many a time but i couldn't find no way
there warn't a window to it big enough for a dog to get through
i couldn't get up the chimbly it was too narrow
the door was thick solid oak slabs
pap was pretty careful not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was away i reckon i had hunted the place over as much as a hundred times well i was most all the time at it because it was about the only way to put in the time
but this time i found something at last i found an old rusty woodsaw without any handle it was laid in between a rafter and the clapboards of the roof
i greased it up and went to work
there was an old horseblanket nailed against the logs at the far end of the cabin behind the table to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks and putting the candle out
i got under the table and raised the blanket and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log outbig enough to let me through
well it was a good long job but i was getting towards the end of it when i heard pap's gun in the woods
i got rid of the signs of my work and dropped the blanket and hid my saw and pretty soon pap come in
pap warn't in a good humorso he was his natural self
he said he was down town and everything was going wrong
his lawyer said he reckoned he would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got started on the trial but then there was ways to put it off a long time and judge thatcher knowed how to do it
and he said people allowed there'd be another trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for my guardian and they guessed it would win this time
this shook me up considerable because i didn't want to go back to the widow's any more and be so cramped up and sivilized as they called it
then the old man got to cussing and cussed everything and everybody he could think of and then cussed them all over again to make sure he hadn't skipped any and after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all round including a considerable parcel of people which he didn't know the names of and so called them what'shisname when he got to them and went right along with his cussing
he said he would like to see the widow get me
he said he would watch out and if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a place six or seven mile off to stow me in where they might hunt till they dropped and they couldn't find me
that made me pretty uneasy again but only for a minute i reckoned i wouldn't stay on hand till he got that chance
the old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had got
there was a fiftypound sack of corn meal and a side of bacon ammunition and a fourgallon jug of whisky and an old book and two newspapers for wadding besides some tow
i toted up a load and went back and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest
i thought it all over and i reckoned i would walk off with the gun and some lines and take to the woods when i run away
i guessed i wouldn't stay in one place but just tramp right across the country mostly night times and hunt and fish to keep alive and so get so far away that the old man nor the widow couldn't ever find me any more
i judged i would saw out and leave that night if pap got drunk enough and i reckoned he would
i got so full of it i didn't notice how long i was staying till the old man hollered and asked me whether i was asleep or drownded
i got the things all up to the cabin and then it was about dark
while i was cooking supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort of warmed up and went to ripping again
he had been drunk over in town and laid in the gutter all night and he was a sight to look at
a body would a thought he was adamhe was just all mud
whenever his liquor begun to work he most always went for the govment this time he says call this a govment
why just look at it and see what it's like
here's the law astanding ready to take a man's son away from hima man's own son which he has had all the trouble and all the anxiety and all the expense of raising
yes just as that man has got that son raised at last and ready to go to work and begin to do suthin' for him and give him a rest the law up and goes for him
and they call that govment
that ain't all nuther
the law backs that old judge thatcher up and helps him to keep me out o' my property
here's what the law does the law takes a man worth six thousand dollars and up'ards and jams him into an old trap of a cabin like this and lets him go round in clothes that ain't fitten for a hog
they call that govment
a man can't get his rights in a govment like this
sometimes i've a mighty notion to just leave the country for good and all
yes and i told 'em so i told old thatcher so to his face
lots of 'em heard me and can tell what i said
says i for two cents i'd leave the blamed country and never come anear it agin
them's the very words
i says look at my hatif you call it a hatbut the lid raises up and the rest of it goes down till it's below my chin and then it ain't rightly a hat at all but more like my head was shoved up through a jint o' stovepipe
look at it says isuch a hat for me to wearone of the wealthiest men in this town if i could git my rights
oh yes this is a wonderful govment wonderful
why looky here
there was a free nigger there from ohioa mulatter most as white as a white man
he had the whitest shirt on you ever see too and the shiniest hat and there ain't a man in that town that's got as fine clothes as what he had and he had a gold watch and chain and a silverheaded canethe awfulest old grayheaded nabob in the state
and what do you think
they said he was a p'fessor in a college and could talk all kinds of languages and knowed everything
and that ain't the wust
they said he could vote when he was at home
well that let me out
thinks i what is the country acoming to
it was 'lection day and i was just about to go and vote myself if i warn't too drunk to get there but when they told me there was a state in this country where they'd let that nigger vote i drawed out
i says i'll never vote agin
them's the very words i said they all heard me and the country may rot for all mei'll never vote agin as long as i live
and to see the cool way of that niggerwhy he wouldn't a give me the road if i hadn't shoved him out o' the way
i says to the people why ain't this nigger put up at auction and soldthat's what i want to know
and what do you reckon they said
why they said he couldn't be sold till he'd been in the state six months and he hadn't been there that long yet
there nowthat's a specimen
they call that a govment that can't sell a free nigger till he's been in the state six months
here's a govment that calls itself a govment and lets on to be a govment and thinks it is a govment and yet's got to set stockstill for six whole months before it can take a hold of a prowling thieving infernal whiteshirted free nigger and pap was agoing on so he never noticed where his old limber legs was taking him to so he went head over heels over the tub of salt pork and barked both shins and the rest of his speech was all the hottest kind of languagemostly hove at the nigger and the govment though he give the tub some too all along here and there
he hopped around the cabin considerable first on one leg and then on the other holding first one shin and then the other one and at last he let out with his left foot all of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick
but it warn't good judgment because that was the boot that had a couple of his toes leaking out of the front end of it so now he raised a howl that fairly made a body's hair raise and down he went in the dirt and rolled there and held his toes and the cussing he done then laid over anything he had ever done previous
he said so his own self afterwards
he had heard old sowberry hagan in his best days and he said it laid over him too but i reckon that was sort of piling it on maybe
after supper pap took the jug and said he had enough whisky there for two drunks and one delirium tremens
that was always his word
i judged he would be blind drunk in about an hour and then i would steal the key or saw myself out one or t'other
he drank and drank and tumbled down on his blankets by and by but luck didn't run my way
he didn't go sound asleep but was uneasy
he groaned and moaned and thrashed around this way and that for a long time
at last i got so sleepy i couldn't keep my eyes open all i could do and so before i knowed what i was about i was sound asleep and the candle burning
i don't know how long i was asleep but all of a sudden there was an awful scream and i was up
there was pap looking wild and skipping around every which way and yelling about snakes
he said they was crawling up his legs and then he would give a jump and scream and say one had bit him on the cheekbut i couldn't see no snakes
he started and run round and round the cabin hollering take him off
take him off
he's biting me on the neck i never see a man look so wild in the eyes
pretty soon he was all fagged out and fell down panting then he rolled over and over wonderful fast kicking things every which way and striking and grabbing at the air with his hands and screaming and saying there was devils ahold of him
he wore out by and by and laid still a while moaning
then he laid stiller and didn't make a sound
i could hear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods and it seemed terrible still
he was laying over by the corner
by and by he raised up part way and listened with his head to one side
he says very low tramptramptramp that's the dead tramptramptramp they're coming after me but i won't go
oh they're here
don't touch medon't
hands offthey're cold let go
oh let a poor devil alone then he went down on all fours and crawled off begging them to let him alone and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under the old pine table still abegging and then he went to crying
i could hear him through the blanket
by and by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild and he see me and went for me
he chased me round and round the place with a claspknife calling me the angel of death and saying he would kill me and then i couldn't come for him no more
i begged and told him i was only huck but he laughed such a screechy laugh and roared and cussed and kept on chasing me up
once when i turned short and dodged under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my shoulders and i thought i was gone but i slid out of the jacket quick as lightning and saved myself
pretty soon he was all tired out and dropped down with his back against the door and said he would rest a minute and then kill me
he put his knife under him and said he would sleep and get strong and then he would see who was who
so he dozed off pretty soon
by and by i got the old splitbottom chair and clumb up as easy as i could not to make any noise and got down the gun
i slipped the ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded then i laid it across the turnip barrel pointing towards pap and set down behind it to wait for him to stir
and how slow and still the time did drag along
git up
what you 'bout i opened my eyes and looked around trying to make out where i was
it was after sunup and i had been sound asleep
pap was standing over me looking sour and sick too
he says what you doin' with this gun i judged he didn't know nothing about what he had been doing so i says somebody tried to get in so i was laying for him why didn't you roust me out well i tried to but i couldn't i couldn't budge you well all right
don't stand there palavering all day but out with you and see if there's a fish on the lines for breakfast
i'll be along in a minute he unlocked the door and i cleared out up the riverbank
i noticed some pieces of limbs and such things floating down and a sprinkling of bark so i knowed the river had begun to rise
i reckoned i would have great times now if i was over at the town
the june rise used to be always luck for me because as soon as that rise begins here comes cordwood floating down and pieces of log raftssometimes a dozen logs together so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to the woodyards and the sawmill
i went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and t'other one out for what the rise might fetch along
well all at once here comes a canoe just a beauty too about thirteen or fourteen foot long riding high like a duck
i shot headfirst off of the bank like a frog clothes and all on and struck out for the canoe
i just expected there'd be somebody laying down in it because people often done that to fool folks and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it they'd raise up and laugh at him
but it warn't so this time
it was a driftcanoe sure enough and i clumb in and paddled her ashore
thinks i the old man will be glad when he sees thisshe's worth ten dollars
but when i got to shore pap wasn't in sight yet and as i was running her into a little creek like a gully all hung over with vines and willows i struck another idea i judged i'd hide her good and then 'stead of taking to the woods when i run off i'd go down the river about fifty mile and camp in one place for good and not have such a rough time tramping on foot
it was pretty close to the shanty and i thought i heard the old man coming all the time but i got her hid and then i out and looked around a bunch of willows and there was the old man down the path a piece just drawing a bead on a bird with his gun
so he hadn't seen anything
when he got along i was hard at it taking up a trot line
he abused me a little for being so slow but i told him i fell in the river and that was what made me so long
i knowed he would see i was wet and then he would be asking questions
we got five catfish off the lines and went home
while we laid off after breakfast to sleep up both of us being about wore out i got to thinking that if i could fix up some way to keep pap and the widow from trying to follow me it would be a certainer thing than trusting to luck to get far enough off before they missed me you see all kinds of things might happen
well i didn't see no way for a while but by and by pap raised up a minute to drink another barrel of water and he says another time a man comes aprowling round here you roust me out you hear
that man warn't here for no good
i'd a shot him
next time you roust me out you hear then he dropped down and went to sleep again but what he had been saying give me the very idea i wanted
i says to myself i can fix it now so nobody won't think of following me
about twelve o'clock we turned out and went along up the bank
the river was coming up pretty fast and lots of driftwood going by on the rise
by and by along comes part of a log raftnine logs fast together
we went out with the skiff and towed it ashore
then we had dinner
anybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through so as to catch more stuff but that warn't pap's style
nine logs was enough for one time he must shove right over to town and sell
so he locked me in and took the skiff and started off towing the raft about halfpast three
i judged he wouldn't come back that night
i waited till i reckoned he had got a good start then i out with my saw and went to work on that log again
before he was t'other side of the river i was out of the hole him and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder
i took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid and shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in then i done the same with the side of bacon then the whiskyjug
i took all the coffee and sugar there was and all the ammunition i took the wadding i took the bucket and gourd i took a dipper and a tin cup and my old saw and two blankets and the skillet and the coffeepot
i took fishlines and matches and other thingseverything that was worth a cent
i cleaned out the place
i wanted an axe but there wasn't any only the one out at the woodpile and i knowed why i was going to leave that
i fetched out the gun and now i was done
i had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging out so many things
so i fixed that as good as i could from the outside by scattering dust on the place which covered up the smoothness and the sawdust
then i fixed the piece of log back into its place and put two rocks under it and one against it to hold it there for it was bent up at that place and didn't quite touch ground
if you stood four or five foot away and didn't know it was sawed you wouldn't never notice it and besides this was the back of the cabin and it warn't likely anybody would go fooling around there
it was all grass clear to the canoe so i hadn't left a track
i followed around to see
i stood on the bank and looked out over the river
all safe
so i took the gun and went up a piece into the woods and was hunting around for some birds when i see a wild pig hogs soon went wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the prairie farms
i shot this fellow and took him into camp
i took the axe and smashed in the door
i beat it and hacked it considerable adoing it
i fetched the pig in and took him back nearly to the table and hacked into his throat with the axe and laid him down on the ground to bleed i say ground because it was groundhard packed and no boards
well next i took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks in itall i could dragand i started it from the pig and dragged it to the door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in and down it sunk out of sight
you could easy see that something had been dragged over the ground
i did wish tom sawyer was there i knowed he would take an interest in this kind of business and throw in the fancy touches
nobody could spread himself like tom sawyer in such a thing as that
well last i pulled out some of my hair and blooded the axe good and stuck it on the back side and slung the axe in the corner
then i took up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket so he couldn't drip till i got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into the river
now i thought of something else
so i went and got the bag of meal and my old saw out of the canoe and fetched them to the house
i took the bag to where it used to stand and ripped a hole in the bottom of it with the saw for there warn't no knives and forks on the placepap done everything with his claspknife about the cooking
then i carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through the willows east of the house to a shallow lake that was five mile wide and full of rushesand ducks too you might say in the season
there was a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that went miles away i don't know where but it didn't go to the river
the meal sifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake
i dropped pap's whetstone there too so as to look like it had been done by accident
then i tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string so it wouldn't leak no more and took it and my saw to the canoe again
it was about dark now so i dropped the canoe down the river under some willows that hung over the bank and waited for the moon to rise
i made fast to a willow then i took a bite to eat and by and by laid down in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan
i says to myself they'll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then drag the river for me
and they'll follow that meal track to the lake and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers that killed me and took the things
they won't ever hunt the river for anything but my dead carcass
they'll soon get tired of that and won't bother no more about me
all right i can stop anywhere i want to
jackson's island is good enough for me i know that island pretty well and nobody ever comes there
and then i can paddle over to town nights and slink around and pick up things i want
jackson's island's the place
i was pretty tired and the first thing i knowed i was asleep
when i woke up i didn't know where i was for a minute
i set up and looked around a little scared
then i remembered
the river looked miles and miles across
the moon was so bright i could a counted the drift logs that went aslipping along black and still hundreds of yards out from shore
everything was dead quiet and it looked late and smelt late
you know what i meani don't know the words to put it in
i took a good gap and a stretch and was just going to unhitch and start when i heard a sound away over the water
i listened
pretty soon i made it out
it was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from oars working in rowlocks when it's a still night
i peeped out through the willow branches and there it wasa skiff away across the water
i couldn't tell how many was in it
it kept acoming and when it was abreast of me i see there warn't but one man in it
think's i maybe it's pap though i warn't expecting him
he dropped below me with the current and by and by he came aswinging up shore in the easy water and he went by so close i could a reached out the gun and touched him
well it was pap sure enoughand sober too by the way he laid his oars
i didn't lose no time
the next minute i was aspinning down stream soft but quick in the shade of the bank
i made two mile and a half and then struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle of the river because pretty soon i would be passing the ferry landing and people might see me and hail me
i got out amongst the driftwood and then laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float
i laid there and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe looking away into the sky not a cloud in it
the sky looks ever so deep when you lay down on your back in the moonshine i never knowed it before
and how far a body can hear on the water such nights
i heard people talking at the ferry landing
i heard what they said tooevery word of it
one man said it was getting towards the long days and the short nights now
t'other one said this warn't one of the short ones he reckonedand then they laughed and he said it over again and they laughed again then they waked up another fellow and told him and laughed but he didn't laugh he ripped out something brisk and said let him alone
the first fellow said he 'lowed to tell it to his old womanshe would think it was pretty good but he said that warn't nothing to some things he had said in his time
i heard one man say it was nearly three o'clock and he hoped daylight wouldn't wait more than about a week longer
after that the talk got further and further away and i couldn't make out the words any more but i could hear the mumble and now and then a laugh too but it seemed a long ways off
i was away below the ferry now
i rose up and there was jackson's island about two mile and a half down stream heavy timbered and standing up out of the middle of the river big and dark and solid like a steamboat without any lights
there warn't any signs of the bar at the headit was all under water now
it didn't take me long to get there
i shot past the head at a ripping rate the current was so swift and then i got into the dead water and landed on the side towards the illinois shore
i run the canoe into a deep dent in the bank that i knowed about i had to part the willow branches to get in and when i made fast nobody could a seen the canoe from the outside
i went up and set down on a log at the head of the island and looked out on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town three mile away where there was three or four lights twinkling
a monstrous big lumberraft was about a mile up stream coming along down with a lantern in the middle of it
i watched it come creeping down and when it was most abreast of where i stood i heard a man say stern oars there
heave her head to stabboard i heard that just as plain as if the man was by my side
there was a little gray in the sky now so i stepped into the woods and laid down for a nap before breakfast
the sun was up so high when i waked that i judged it was after eight o'clock
i laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about things and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied
i could see the sun out at one or two holes but mostly it was big trees all about and gloomy in there amongst them
there was freckled places on the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves and the freckled places swapped about a little showing there was a little breeze up there
a couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me very friendly
i was powerful lazy and comfortabledidn't want to get up and cook breakfast
well i was dozing off again when i thinks i hears a deep sound of boom away up the river
i rouses up and rests on my elbow and listens pretty soon i hears it again
i hopped up and went and looked out at a hole in the leaves and i see a bunch of smoke laying on the water a long ways upabout abreast the ferry
and there was the ferryboat full of people floating along down
i knowed what was the matter now
boom i see the white smoke squirt out of the ferryboat's side
you see they was firing cannon over the water trying to make my carcass come to the top
i was pretty hungry but it warn't going to do for me to start a fire because they might see the smoke
so i set there and watched the cannonsmoke and listened to the boom
the river was a mile wide there and it always looks pretty on a summer morningso i was having a good enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if i only had a bite to eat
well then i happened to think how they always put quicksilver in loaves of bread and float them off because they always go right to the drownded carcass and stop there
so says i i'll keep a lookout and if any of them's floating around after me i'll give them a show
i changed to the illinois edge of the island to see what luck i could have and i warn't disappointed
a big double loaf come along and i most got it with a long stick but my foot slipped and she floated out further
of course i was where the current set in the closest to the shorei knowed enough for that
but by and by along comes another one and this time i won
i took out the plug and shook out the little dab of quicksilver and set my teeth in
it was baker's breadwhat the quality eat none of your lowdown cornpone
i got a good place amongst the leaves and set there on a log munching the bread and watching the ferryboat and very well satisfied
and then something struck me
i says now i reckon the widow or the parson or somebody prayed that this bread would find me and here it has gone and done it
so there ain't no doubt but there is something in that thingthat is there's something in it when a body like the widow or the parson prays but it don't work for me and i reckon it don't work for only just the right kind
i lit a pipe and had a good long smoke and went on watching
the ferryboat was floating with the current and i allowed i'd have a chance to see who was aboard when she come along because she would come in close where the bread did
when she'd got pretty well along down towards me i put out my pipe and went to where i fished out the bread and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place
where the log forked i could peep through
by and by she come along and she drifted in so close that they could a run out a plank and walked ashore
most everybody was on the boat
pap and judge thatcher and bessie thatcher and jo harper and tom sawyer and his old aunt polly and sid and mary and plenty more
everybody was talking about the murder but the captain broke in and says look sharp now the current sets in the closest here and maybe he's washed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water's edge
i hope so anyway i didn't hope so
they all crowded up and leaned over the rails nearly in my face and kept still watching with all their might
i could see them firstrate but they couldn't see me
then the captain sung out stand away and the cannon let off such a blast right before me that it made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke and i judged i was gone
if they'd a had some bullets in i reckon they'd a got the corpse they was after
well i see i warn't hurt thanks to goodness
the boat floated on and went out of sight around the shoulder of the island
i could hear the booming now and then further and further off and by and by after an hour i didn't hear it no more
the island was three mile long
i judged they had got to the foot and was giving it up
but they didn't yet a while
they turned around the foot of the island and started up the channel on the missouri side under steam and booming once in a while as they went
i crossed over to that side and watched them
when they got abreast the head of the island they quit shooting and dropped over to the missouri shore and went home to the town
i knowed i was all right now
nobody else would come ahunting after me
i got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick woods
i made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my things under so the rain couldn't get at them
i catched a catfish and haggled him open with my saw and towards sundown i started my camp fire and had supper
then i set out a line to catch some fish for breakfast
when it was dark i set by my camp fire smoking and feeling pretty well satisfied but by and by it got sort of lonesome and so i went and set on the bank and listened to the current swashing along and counted the stars and drift logs and rafts that come down and then went to bed there ain't no better way to put in time when you are lonesome you can't stay so you soon get over it
and so for three days and nights
no differencejust the same thing
but the next day i went exploring around down through the island
i was boss of it it all belonged to me so to say and i wanted to know all about it but mainly i wanted to put in the time
i found plenty strawberries ripe and prime and green summer grapes and green razberries and the green blackberries was just beginning to show
they would all come handy by and by i judged
well i went fooling along in the deep woods till i judged i warn't far from the foot of the island
i had my gun along but i hadn't shot nothing it was for protection thought i would kill some game nigh home
about this time i mighty near stepped on a goodsized snake and it went sliding off through the grass and flowers and i after it trying to get a shot at it
i clipped along and all of a sudden i bounded right on to the ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking
my heart jumped up amongst my lungs
i never waited for to look further but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as fast as ever i could
every now and then i stopped a second amongst the thick leaves and listened but my breath come so hard i couldn't hear nothing else
i slunk along another piece further then listened again and so on and so on
if i see a stump i took it for a man if i trod on a stick and broke it it made me feel like a person had cut one of my breaths in two and i only got half and the short half too
when i got to camp i warn't feeling very brash there warn't much sand in my craw but i says this ain't no time to be fooling around
so i got all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight and i put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an old last year's camp and then clumb a tree
i reckon i was up in the tree two hours but i didn't see nothing i didn't hear nothingi only thought i heard and seen as much as a thousand things
well i couldn't stay up there forever so at last i got down but i kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the time
all i could get to eat was berries and what was left over from breakfast
by the time it was night i was pretty hungry
so when it was good and dark i slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the illinois bankabout a quarter of a mile
i went out in the woods and cooked a supper and i had about made up my mind i would stay there all night when i hear a plunketyplunk plunketyplunk and says to myself horses coming and next i hear people's voices
i got everything into the canoe as quick as i could and then went creeping through the woods to see what i could find out
i hadn't got far when i hear a man say we better camp here if we can find a good place the horses is about beat out
let's look around i didn't wait but shoved out and paddled away easy
i tied up in the old place and reckoned i would sleep in the canoe
i didn't sleep much
i couldn't somehow for thinking
and every time i waked up i thought somebody had me by the neck
so the sleep didn't do me no good
by and by i says to myself i can't live this way i'm agoing to find out who it is that's here on the island with me i'll find it out or bust
well i felt better right off
so i took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two and then let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows
the moon was shining and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day
i poked along well on to an hour everything still as rocks and sound asleep
well by this time i was most down to the foot of the island
a little ripply cool breeze begun to blow and that was as good as saying the night was about done
i give her a turn with the paddle and brung her nose to shore then i got my gun and slipped out and into the edge of the woods
i sat down there on a log and looked out through the leaves
i see the moon go off watch and the darkness begin to blanket the river
but in a little while i see a pale streak over the treetops and knowed the day was coming
so i took my gun and slipped off towards where i had run across that camp fire stopping every minute or two to listen
but i hadn't no luck somehow i couldn't seem to find the place
but by and by sure enough i catched a glimpse of fire away through the trees
i went for it cautious and slow
by and by i was close enough to have a look and there laid a man on the ground
it most give me the fantods
he had a blanket around his head and his head was nearly in the fire
i set there behind a clump of bushes in about six foot of him and kept my eyes on him steady
it was getting gray daylight now
pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hove off the blanket and it was miss watson's jim
i bet i was glad to see him
i says hello jim and skipped out
he bounced up and stared at me wild
then he drops down on his knees and puts his hands together and says doan' hurt medon't
i hain't ever done no harm to a ghos'
i alwuz liked dead people en done all i could for 'em
you go en git in de river agin whah you b'longs en doan' do nuffn to ole jim 'at 'uz awluz yo' fren' well i warn't long making him understand i warn't dead
i was ever so glad to see jim
i warn't lonesome now
i told him i warn't afraid of him telling the people where i was
i talked along but he only set there and looked at me never said nothing
then i says it's good daylight
le's get breakfast
make up your camp fire good what's de use er makin' up de camp fire to cook strawbries en sich truck
but you got a gun hain't you
den we kin git sumfn better den strawbries strawberries and such truck i says
is that what you live on i couldn' git nuffn else he says
why how long you been on the island jim i come heah de night arter you's killed what all that time yesindeedy and ain't you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat no sahnuffn else well you must be most starved ain't you i reck'n i could eat a hoss
i think i could
how long you ben on de islan' since the night i got killed no
w'y what has you lived on
but you got a gun
oh yes you got a gun
dat's good
now you kill sumfn en i'll make up de fire so we went over to where the canoe was and while he built a fire in a grassy open place amongst the trees i fetched meal and bacon and coffee and coffeepot and fryingpan and sugar and tin cups and the nigger was set back considerable because he reckoned it was all done with witchcraft
i catched a good big catfish too and jim cleaned him with his knife and fried him
when breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot
jim laid it in with all his might for he was most about starved
then when we had got pretty well stuffed we laid off and lazied
by and by jim says but looky here huck who wuz it dat 'uz killed in dat shanty ef it warn't you then i told him the whole thing and he said it was smart
he said tom sawyer couldn't get up no better plan than what i had
then i says how do you come to be here jim and how'd you get here he looked pretty uneasy and didn't say nothing for a minute
then he says maybe i better not tell why jim well dey's reasons
but you wouldn' tell on me ef i uz to tell you would you huck blamed if i would jim well i b'lieve you huck
ii run off jim but mind you said you wouldn' tellyou know you said you wouldn' tell huck well i did
i said i wouldn't and i'll stick to it
honest injun i will
people would call me a lowdown abolitionist and despise me for keeping mumbut that don't make no difference
i ain't agoing to tell and i ain't agoing back there anyways
so now le's know all about it well you see it 'uz dis way
ole missusdat's miss watsonshe pecks on me all de time en treats me pooty rough but she awluz said she wouldn' sell me down to orleans
but i noticed dey wuz a nigger trader roun' de place considable lately en i begin to git oneasy

de widder she try to git her to say she wouldn' do it but i never waited to hear de res'
i lit out mighty quick i tell you
i tuck out en shin down de hill en 'spec to steal a skift 'long de sho' som'ers 'bove de town but dey wuz people astirring yit so i hid in de ole tumbledown coopershop on de bank to wait for everybody to go 'way
well i wuz dah all night
dey wuz somebody roun' all de time
'long 'bout six in de mawnin' skifts begin to go by en 'bout eight er nine every skift dat went 'long wuz talkin' 'bout how yo' pap come over to de town en say you's killed
dese las' skifts wuz full o' ladies en genlmen agoin' over for to see de place
sometimes dey'd pull up at de sho' en take a res' b'fo' dey started acrost so by de talk i got to know all 'bout de killin'
i 'uz powerful sorry you's killed huck but i ain't no mo' now
i laid dah under de shavin's all day
i 'uz hungry but i warn't afeard bekase i knowed ole missus en de widder wuz goin' to start to de campmeet'n' right arter breakfas' en be gone all day en dey knows i goes off wid de cattle 'bout daylight so dey wouldn' 'spec to see me roun' de place en so dey wouldn' miss me tell arter dark in de evenin'
de yuther servants wouldn' miss me kase dey'd shin out en take holiday soon as de ole folks 'uz out'n de way
well when it come dark i tuck out up de river road en went 'bout two mile er more to whah dey warn't no houses
i'd made up my mine 'bout what i's agwyne to do
you see ef i kep' on tryin' to git away afoot de dogs 'ud track me ef i stole a skift to cross over dey'd miss dat skift you see en dey'd know 'bout whah i'd lan' on de yuther side en whah to pick up my track
so i says a raff is what i's arter it doan' make no track
i see a light acomin' roun' de p'int bymeby so i wade' in en shove' a log ahead o' me en swum more'n half way acrost de river en got in 'mongst de driftwood en kep' my head down low en kinder swum agin de current tell de raff come along
den i swum to de stern uv it en tuck aholt
it clouded up en 'uz pooty dark for a little while
so i clumb up en laid down on de planks
de men 'uz all 'way yonder in de middle whah de lantern wuz
de river wuz arisin' en dey wuz a good current so i reck'n'd 'at by fo' in de mawnin' i'd be twentyfive mile down de river en den i'd slip in jis b'fo' daylight en swim asho' en take to de woods on de illinois side
but i didn' have no luck
when we 'uz mos' down to de head er de islan' a man begin to come aft wid de lantern i see it warn't no use fer to wait so i slid overboard en struck out fer de islan'
well i had a notion i could lan' mos' anywhers but i couldn'tbank too bluff
i 'uz mos' to de foot er de islan' b'fo' i found' a good place
i went into de woods en jedged i wouldn' fool wid raffs no mo' long as dey move de lantern roun' so
i had my pipe en a plug er dogleg en some matches in my cap en dey warn't wet so i 'uz all right and so you ain't had no meat nor bread to eat all this time
why didn't you get mudturkles how you gwyne to git 'm
you can't slip up on um en grab um en how's a body gwyne to hit um wid a rock
how could a body do it in de night
en i warn't gwyne to show mysef on de bank in de daytime well that's so
you've had to keep in the woods all the time of course
did you hear 'em shooting the cannon oh yes
i knowed dey was arter you
i see um go by heahwatched um thoo de bushes some young birds come along flying a yard or two at a time and lighting
jim said it was a sign it was going to rain
he said it was a sign when young chickens flew that way and so he reckoned it was the same way when young birds done it
i was going to catch some of them but jim wouldn't let me
he said it was death
he said his father laid mighty sick once and some of them catched a bird and his old granny said his father would die and he did
and jim said you mustn't count the things you are going to cook for dinner because that would bring bad luck
the same if you shook the tablecloth after sundown
and he said if a man owned a beehive and that man died the bees must be told about it before sunup next morning or else the bees would all weaken down and quit work and die
jim said bees wouldn't sting idiots but i didn't believe that because i had tried them lots of times myself and they wouldn't sting me
i had heard about some of these things before but not all of them
jim knowed all kinds of signs
he said he knowed most everything
i said it looked to me like all the signs was about bad luck and so i asked him if there warn't any goodluck signs
he says mighty fewan' dey ain't no use to a body
what you want to know when good luck's acomin' for
want to keep it off and he said ef you's got hairy arms en a hairy breas' it's a sign dat you's agwyne to be rich
well dey's some use in a sign like dat 'kase it's so fur ahead
you see maybe you's got to be po' a long time fust en so you might git discourage' en kill yo'sef 'f you didn' know by de sign dat you gwyne to be rich bymeby have you got hairy arms and a hairy breast jim what's de use to ax dat question

i owns mysef en i's wuth eight hund'd dollars
i wisht i had de money i wouldn' want no mo' i wanted to go and look at a place right about the middle of the island that i'd found when i was exploring so we started and soon got to it because the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a mile wide
this place was a tolerable long steep hill or ridge about forty foot high
we had a rough time getting to the top the sides was so steep and the bushes so thick
we tramped and clumb around all over it and by and by found a good big cavern in the rock most up to the top on the side towards illinois
the cavern was as big as two or three rooms bunched together and jim could stand up straight in it
it was cool in there
jim was for putting our traps in there right away but i said we didn't want to be climbing up and down there all the time
jim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place and had all the traps in the cavern we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island and they would never find us without dogs
and besides he said them little birds had said it was going to rain and did i want the things to get wet
so we went back and got the canoe and paddled up abreast the cavern and lugged all the traps up there
then we hunted up a place close by to hide the canoe in amongst the thick willows
we took some fish off of the lines and set them again and begun to get ready for dinner
the door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in and on one side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit and was flat and a good place to build a fire on
so we built it there and cooked dinner
we spread the blankets inside for a carpet and eat our dinner in there
we put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern
pretty soon it darkened up and begun to thunder and lighten so the birds was right about it
directly it begun to rain and it rained like all fury too and i never see the wind blow so
it was one of these regular summer storms
it would get so dark that it looked all blueblack outside and lovely and the rain would thrash along by so thick that the trees off a little ways looked dim and spiderwebby and here would come a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and turn up the pale underside of the leaves and then a perfect ripper of a gust would follow along and set the branches to tossing their arms as if they was just wild and next when it was just about the bluest and blackestfst
it was as bright as glory and you'd have a little glimpse of treetops aplunging about away off yonder in the storm hundreds of yards further than you could see before dark as sin again in a second and now you'd hear the thunder let go with an awful crash and then go rumbling grumbling tumbling down the sky towards the under side of the world like rolling empty barrels down stairswhere it's long stairs and they bounce a good deal you know
jim this is nice i says
i wouldn't want to be nowhere else but here
pass me along another hunk of fish and some hot cornbread well you wouldn't a ben here 'f it hadn't a ben for jim
you'd a ben down dah in de woods widout any dinner en gittn' mos' drownded too dat you would honey
chickens knows when it's gwyne to rain en so do de birds chile the river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days till at last it was over the banks
the water was three or four foot deep on the island in the low places and on the illinois bottom
on that side it was a good many miles wide but on the missouri side it was the same old distance acrossa half a milebecause the missouri shore was just a wall of high bluffs
daytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe it was mighty cool and shady in the deep woods even if the sun was blazing outside
we went winding in and out amongst the trees and sometimes the vines hung so thick we had to back away and go some other way
well on every old brokendown tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things and when the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame on account of being hungry that you could paddle right up and put your hand on them if you wanted to but not the snakes and turtlesthey would slide off in the water
the ridge our cavern was in was full of them
we could a had pets enough if we'd wanted them
one night we catched a little section of a lumber raftnice pine planks
it was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long and the top stood above water six or seven inchesa solid level floor
we could see sawlogs go by in the daylight sometimes but we let them go we didn't show ourselves in daylight
another night when we was up at the head of the island just before daylight here comes a framehouse down on the west side
she was a twostory and tilted over considerable
we paddled out and got aboardclumb in at an upstairs window
but it was too dark to see yet so we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight
the light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island
then we looked in at the window
we could make out a bed and a table and two old chairs and lots of things around about on the floor and there was clothes hanging against the wall
there was something laying on the floor in the far corner that looked like a man
so jim says hello you but it didn't budge
so i hollered again and then jim says de man ain't asleephe's dead
you hold stilli'll go en see he went and bent down and looked and says it's a dead man
yes indeedy naked too
he's ben shot in de back
i reck'n he's ben dead two er three days
come in huck but doan' look at his faceit's too gashly i didn't look at him at all
jim throwed some old rags over him but he needn't done it i didn't want to see him
there was heaps of old greasy cards scattered around over the floor and old whisky bottles and a couple of masks made out of black cloth and all over the walls was the ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal
there was two old dirty calico dresses and a sunbonnet and some women's underclothes hanging against the wall and some men's clothing too
we put the lot into the canoeit might come good
there was a boy's old speckled straw hat on the floor i took that too
and there was a bottle that had had milk in it and it had a rag stopper for a baby to suck
we would a took the bottle but it was broke
there was a seedy old chest and an old hair trunk with the hinges broke
they stood open but there warn't nothing left in them that was any account
the way things was scattered about we reckoned the people left in a hurry and warn't fixed so as to carry off most of their stuff
we got an old tin lantern and a butcherknife without any handle and a brannew barlow knife worth two bits in any store and a lot of tallow candles and a tin candlestick and a gourd and a tin cup and a ratty old bedquilt off the bed and a reticule with needles and pins and beeswax and buttons and thread and all such truck in it and a hatchet and some nails and a fishline as thick as my little finger with some monstrous hooks on it and a roll of buckskin and a leather dogcollar and a horseshoe and some vials of medicine that didn't have no label on them and just as we was leaving i found a tolerable good currycomb and jim he found a ratty old fiddlebow and a wooden leg
the straps was broke off of it but barring that it was a good enough leg though it was too long for me and not long enough for jim and we couldn't find the other one though we hunted all around
and so take it all around we made a good haul
when we was ready to shove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island and it was pretty broad day so i made jim lay down in the canoe and cover up with the quilt because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a good ways off
i paddled over to the illinois shore and drifted down most a half a mile doing it
i crept up the dead water under the bank and hadn't no accidents and didn't see nobody
we got home all safe
after breakfast i wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out how he come to be killed but jim didn't want to
he said it would fetch bad luck and besides he said he might come and ha'nt us he said a man that warn't buried was more likely to go aha'nting around than one that was planted and comfortable
that sounded pretty reasonable so i didn't say no more but i couldn't keep from studying over it and wishing i knowed who shot the man and what they done it for
we rummaged the clothes we'd got and found eight dollars in silver sewed up in the lining of an old blanket overcoat
jim said he reckoned the people in that house stole the coat because if they'd a knowed the money was there they wouldn't a left it
i said i reckoned they killed him too but jim didn't want to talk about that
i says now you think it's bad luck but what did you say when i fetched in the snakeskin that i found on the top of the ridge day before yesterday
you said it was the worst bad luck in the world to touch a snakeskin with my hands
well here's your bad luck
we've raked in all this truck and eight dollars besides
i wish we could have some bad luck like this every day jim never you mind honey never you mind
don't you git too peart
it's acomin'
mind i tell you it's acomin' it did come too
it was a tuesday that we had that talk
well after dinner friday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of the ridge and got out of tobacco
i went to the cavern to get some and found a rattlesnake in there
i killed him and curled him up on the foot of jim's blanket ever so natural thinking there'd be some fun when jim found him there
well by night i forgot all about the snake and when jim flung himself down on the blanket while i struck a light the snake's mate was there and bit him
he jumped up yelling and the first thing the light showed was the varmint curled up and ready for another spring
i laid him out in a second with a stick and jim grabbed pap's whiskyjug and begun to pour it down
he was barefooted and the snake bit him right on the heel
that all comes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave a dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it
jim told me to chop off the snake's head and throw it away and then skin the body and roast a piece of it
i done it and he eat it and said it would help cure him
he made me take off the rattles and tie them around his wrist too
he said that that would help
then i slid out quiet and throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes for i warn't going to let jim find out it was all my fault not if i could help it
jim sucked and sucked at the jug and now and then he got out of his head and pitched around and yelled but every time he come to himself he went to sucking at the jug again
his foot swelled up pretty big and so did his leg but by and by the drunk begun to come and so i judged he was all right but i'd druther been bit with a snake than pap's whisky
jim was laid up for four days and nights
then the swelling was all gone and he was around again
i made up my mind i wouldn't ever take aholt of a snakeskin again with my hands now that i see what had come of it
jim said he reckoned i would believe him next time
and he said that handling a snakeskin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadn't got to the end of it yet
he said he druther see the new moon over his left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snakeskin in his hand
well i was getting to feel that way myself though i've always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder is one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do
old hank bunker done it once and bragged about it and in less than two years he got drunk and fell off of the shottower and spread himself out so that he was just a kind of a layer as you may say and they slid him edgeways between two barn doors for a coffin and buried him so so they say but i didn't see it
pap told me
but anyway it all come of looking at the moon that way like a fool
well the days went along and the river went down between its banks again and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big hooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was as big as a man being six foot two inches long and weighed over two hundred pounds
we couldn't handle him of course he would a flung us into illinois
we just set there and watched him rip and tear around till he drownded
we found a brass button in his stomach and a round ball and lots of rubbage
we split the ball open with the hatchet and there was a spool in it
jim said he'd had it there a long time to coat it over so and make a ball of it
it was as big a fish as was ever catched in the mississippi i reckon
jim said he hadn't ever seen a bigger one
he would a been worth a good deal over at the village
they peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the markethouse there everybody buys some of him his meat's as white as snow and makes a good fry
next morning i said it was getting slow and dull and i wanted to get a stirring up some way
i said i reckoned i would slip over the river and find out what was going on
jim liked that notion but he said i must go in the dark and look sharp
then he studied it over and said couldn't i put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl
that was a good notion too
so we shortened up one of the calico gowns and i turned up my trouserlegs to my knees and got into it
jim hitched it behind with the hooks and it was a fair fit
i put on the sunbonnet and tied it under my chin and then for a body to look in and see my face was like looking down a joint of stovepipe
jim said nobody would know me even in the daytime hardly
i practiced around all day to get the hang of the things and by and by i could do pretty well in them only jim said i didn't walk like a girl and he said i must quit pulling up my gown to get at my britchespocket
i took notice and done better
i started up the illinois shore in the canoe just after dark
i started across to the town from a little below the ferrylanding and the drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town
i tied up and started along the bank
there was a light burning in a little shanty that hadn't been lived in for a long time and i wondered who had took up quarters there
i slipped up and peeped in at the window
there was a woman about forty year old in there knitting by a candle that was on a pine table
i didn't know her face she was a stranger for you couldn't start a face in that town that i didn't know
now this was lucky because i was weakening i was getting afraid i had come people might know my voice and find me out
but if this woman had been in such a little town two days she could tell me all i wanted to know so i knocked at the door and made up my mind i wouldn't forget i was a girl
come in says the woman and i did
she says take a cheer i done it
she looked me all over with her little shiny eyes and says what might your name be sarah williams where 'bouts do you live
in this neighborhood'
no'm
in hookerville seven mile below
i've walked all the way and i'm all tired out hungry too i reckon
i'll find you something no'm i ain't hungry
i was so hungry i had to stop two miles below here at a farm so i ain't hungry no more
it's what makes me so late
my mother's down sick and out of money and everything and i come to tell my uncle abner moore
he lives at the upper end of the town she says
i hain't ever been here before
do you know him no but i don't know everybody yet
i haven't lived here quite two weeks
it's a considerable ways to the upper end of the town
you better stay here all night
take off your bonnet no i says i'll rest a while i reckon and go on
i ain't afeared of the dark she said she wouldn't let me go by myself but her husband would be in by and by maybe in a hour and a half and she'd send him along with me
then she got to talking about her husband and about her relations up the river and her relations down the river and about how much better off they used to was and how they didn't know but they'd made a mistake coming to our town instead of letting well aloneand so on and so on till i was afeard i had made a mistake coming to her to find out what was going on in the town but by and by she dropped on to pap and the murder and then i was pretty willing to let her clatter right along
she told about me and tom sawyer finding the six thousand dollars only she got it ten and all about pap and what a hard lot he was and what a hard lot i was and at last she got down to where i was murdered
i says who done it
we've heard considerable about these goings on down in hookerville but we don't know who 'twas that killed huck finn well i reckon there's a right smart chance of people here that'd like to know who killed him
some think old finn done it himself nois that so most everybody thought it at first
he'll never know how nigh he come to getting lynched
but before night they changed around and judged it was done by a runaway nigger named jim why he i stopped
i reckoned i better keep still
she run on and never noticed i had put in at all the nigger run off the very night huck finn was killed
so there's a reward out for himthree hundred dollars
and there's a reward out for old finn tootwo hundred dollars
you see he come to town the morning after the murder and told about it and was out with 'em on the ferryboat hunt and right away after he up and left
before night they wanted to lynch him but he was gone you see
well next day they found out the nigger was gone they found out he hadn't ben seen sence ten o'clock the night the murder was done
so then they put it on him you see and while they was full of it next day back comes old finn and went boohooing to judge thatcher to get money to hunt for the nigger all over illinois with
the judge gave him some and that evening he got drunk and was around till after midnight with a couple of mighty hardlooking strangers and then went off with them
well he hain't come back sence and they ain't looking for him back till this thing blows over a little for people thinks now that he killed his boy and fixed things so folks would think robbers done it and then he'd get huck's money without having to bother a long time with a lawsuit
people do say he warn't any too good to do it
oh he's sly i reckon
if he don't come back for a year he'll be all right
you can't prove anything on him you know everything will be quieted down then and he'll walk in huck's money as easy as nothing yes i reckon so 'm
i don't see nothing in the way of it
has everybody quit thinking the nigger done it oh no not everybody
a good many thinks he done it
but they'll get the nigger pretty soon now and maybe they can scare it out of him why are they after him yet well you're innocent ain't you
does three hundred dollars lay around every day for people to pick up
some folks think the nigger ain't far from here
i'm one of thembut i hain't talked it around
a few days ago i was talking with an old couple that lives next door in the log shanty and they happened to say hardly anybody ever goes to that island over yonder that they call jackson's island
don't anybody live there
says i
no nobody says they
i didn't say any more but i done some thinking
i was pretty near certain i'd seen smoke over there about the head of the island a day or two before that so i says to myself like as not that nigger's hiding over there anyway says i it's worth the trouble to give the place a hunt
i hain't seen any smoke sence so i reckon maybe he's gone if it was him but husband's going over to seehim and another man
he was gone up the river but he got back today and i told him as soon as he got here two hours ago i had got so uneasy i couldn't set still
i had to do something with my hands so i took up a needle off of the table and went to threading it
my hands shook and i was making a bad job of it
when the woman stopped talking i looked up and she was looking at me pretty curious and smiling a little
i put down the needle and thread and let on to be interestedand i was tooand says three hundred dollars is a power of money
i wish my mother could get it
is your husband going over there tonight oh yes
he went uptown with the man i was telling you of to get a boat and see if they could borrow another gun
they'll go over after midnight couldn't they see better if they was to wait till daytime yes
and couldn't the nigger see better too
after midnight he'll likely be asleep and they can slip around through the woods and hunt up his camp fire all the better for the dark if he's got one i didn't think of that the woman kept looking at me pretty curious and i didn't feel a bit comfortable
pretty soon she says what did you say your name was honey mmary williams somehow it didn't seem to me that i said it was mary before so i didn't look upseemed to me i said it was sarah so i felt sort of cornered and was afeared maybe i was looking it too
i wished the woman would say something more the longer she set still the uneasier i was
but now she says honey i thought you said it was sarah when you first come in oh yes'm i did
sarah mary williams
sarah's my first name
some calls me sarah some calls me mary oh that's the way of it yes'm i was feeling better then but i wished i was out of there anyway
i couldn't look up yet
well the woman fell to talking about how hard times was and how poor they had to live and how the rats was as free as if they owned the place and so forth and so on and then i got easy again
she was right about the rats
you'd see one stick his nose out of a hole in the corner every little while
she said she had to have things handy to throw at them when she was alone or they wouldn't give her no peace
she showed me a bar of lead twisted up into a knot and said she was a good shot with it generly but she'd wrenched her arm a day or two ago and didn't know whether she could throw true now
but she watched for a chance and directly banged away at a rat but she missed him wide and said ouch it hurt her arm so
then she told me to try for the next one
i wanted to be getting away before the old man got back but of course i didn't let on
i got the thing and the first rat that showed his nose i let drive and if he'd a stayed where he was he'd a been a tolerable sick rat
she said that was firstrate and she reckoned i would hive the next one
she went and got the lump of lead and fetched it back and brought along a hank of yarn which she wanted me to help her with
i held up my two hands and she put the hank over them and went on talking about her and her husband's matters
but she broke off to say keep your eye on the rats
you better have the lead in your lap handy so she dropped the lump into my lap just at that moment and i clapped my legs together on it and she went on talking
but only about a minute
then she took off the hank and looked me straight in the face and very pleasant and says come now what's your real name whwhat mum what's your real name
is it bill or tom or bobor what is it i reckon i shook like a leaf and i didn't know hardly what to do
but i says please to don't poke fun at a poor girl like me mum
if i'm in the way here i'll no you won't
set down and stay where you are
i ain't going to hurt you and i ain't going to tell on you nuther
you just tell me your secret and trust me
i'll keep it and what's more i'll help you
so'll my old man if you want him to
you see you're a runaway 'prentice that's all
it ain't anything
there ain't no harm in it
you've been treated bad and you made up your mind to cut
bless you child i wouldn't tell on you
tell me all about it now that's a good boy so i said it wouldn't be no use to try to play it any longer and i would just make a clean breast and tell her everything but she musn't go back on her promise
then i told her my father and mother was dead and the law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the country thirty mile back from the river and he treated me so bad i couldn't stand it no longer he went away to be gone a couple of days and so i took my chance and stole some of his daughter's old clothes and cleared out and i had been three nights coming the thirty miles
i traveled nights and hid daytimes and slept and the bag of bread and meat i carried from home lasted me all the way and i had aplenty
i said i believed my uncle abner moore would take care of me and so that was why i struck out for this town of goshen
goshen child
this ain't goshen
this is st petersburg
goshen's ten mile further up the river
who told you this was goshen why a man i met at daybreak this morning just as i was going to turn into the woods for my regular sleep
he told me when the roads forked i must take the right hand and five mile would fetch me to goshen he was drunk i reckon
he told you just exactly wrong well he did act like he was drunk but it ain't no matter now
i got to be moving along
i'll fetch goshen before daylight hold on a minute
i'll put you up a snack to eat
you might want it so she put me up a snack and says say when a cow's laying down which end of her gets up first
answer up prompt nowdon't stop to study over it
which end gets up first the hind end mum well then a horse the for'rard end mum which side of a tree does the moss grow on north side if fifteen cows is browsing on a hillside how many of them eats with their heads pointed the same direction the whole fifteen mum well i reckon you have lived in the country
i thought maybe you was trying to hocus me again
what's your real name now george peters mum well try to remember it george
don't forget and tell me it's elexander before you go and then get out by saying it's george elexander when i catch you
and don't go about women in that old calico
you do a girl tolerable poor but you might fool men maybe
bless you child when you set out to thread a needle don't hold the thread still and fetch the needle up to it hold the needle still and poke the thread at it that's the way a woman most always does but a man always does t'other way
and when you throw at a rat or anything hitch yourself up a tiptoe and fetch your hand up over your head as awkward as you can and miss your rat about six or seven foot
throw stiffarmed from the shoulder like there was a pivot there for it to turn on like a girl not from the wrist and elbow with your arm out to one side like a boy
and mind you when a girl tries to catch anything in her lap she throws her knees apart she don't clap them together the way you did when you catched the lump of lead
why i spotted you for a boy when you was threading the needle and i contrived the other things just to make certain
now trot along to your uncle sarah mary williams george elexander peters and if you get into trouble you send word to mrs judith loftus which is me and i'll do what i can to get you out of it
keep the river road all the way and next time you tramp take shoes and socks with you
the river road's a rocky one and your feet'll be in a condition when you get to goshen i reckon i went up the bank about fifty yards and then i doubled on my tracks and slipped back to where my canoe was a good piece below the house
i jumped in and was off in a hurry
i went upstream far enough to make the head of the island and then started across
i took off the sunbonnet for i didn't want no blinders on then
when i was about the middle i heard the clock begin to strike so i stops and listens the sound come faint over the water but cleareleven
when i struck the head of the island i never waited to blow though i was most winded but i shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to be and started a good fire there on a high and dry spot
then i jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place a mile and a half below as hard as i could go
i landed and slopped through the timber and up the ridge and into the cavern
there jim laid sound asleep on the ground
i roused him out and says git up and hump yourself jim
there ain't a minute to lose
they're after us jim never asked no questions he never said a word but the way he worked for the next half an hour showed about how he was scared
by that time everything we had in the world was on our raft and she was ready to be shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid
we put out the camp fire at the cavern the first thing and didn't show a candle outside after that
i took the canoe out from the shore a little piece and took a look but if there was a boat around i couldn't see it for stars and shadows ain't good to see by
then we got out the raft and slipped along down in the shade past the foot of the island dead stillnever saying a word
it must a been close on to one o'clock when we got below the island at last and the raft did seem to go mighty slow
if a boat was to come along we was going to take to the canoe and break for the illinois shore and it was well a boat didn't come for we hadn't ever thought to put the gun in the canoe or a fishingline or anything to eat
we was in ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many things
it warn't good judgment to put everything on the raft
if the men went to the island i just expect they found the camp fire i built and watched it all night for jim to come
anyways they stayed away from us and if my building the fire never fooled them it warn't no fault of mine
i played it as low down on them as i could
when the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in a big bend on the illinois side and hacked off cottonwood branches with the hatchet and covered up the raft with them so she looked like there had been a cavein in the bank there
a towhead is a sandbar that has cottonwoods on it as thick as harrowteeth
we had mountains on the missouri shore and heavy timber on the illinois side and the channel was down the missouri shore at that place so we warn't afraid of anybody running across us
we laid there all day and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the missouri shore and upbound steamboats fight the big river in the middle
i told jim all about the time i had jabbering with that woman and jim said she was a smart one and if she was to start after us herself she wouldn't set down and watch a camp fireno sir she'd fetch a dog
well then i said why couldn't she tell her husband to fetch a dog
jim said he bet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to start and he believed they must a gone uptown to get a dog and so they lost all that time or else we wouldn't be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen mile below the villageno indeedy we would be in that same old town again
so i said i didn't care what was the reason they didn't get us as long as they didn't
when it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the cottonwood thicket and looked up and down and across nothing in sight so jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug wigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy and to keep the things dry
jim made a floor for the wigwam and raised it a foot or more above the level of the raft so now the blankets and all the traps was out of reach of steamboat waves
right in the middle of the wigwam we made a layer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for to hold it to its place this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather or chilly the wigwam would keep it from being seen
we made an extra steeringoar too because one of the others might get broke on a snag or something
we fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern on because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat coming downstream to keep from getting run over but we wouldn't have to light it for upstream boats unless we see we was in what they call a crossing for the river was pretty high yet very low banks being still a little under water so upbound boats didn't always run the channel but hunted easy water
this second night we run between seven and eight hours with a current that was making over four mile an hour
we catched fish and talked and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness
it was kind of solemn drifting down the big still river laying on our backs looking up at the stars and we didn't ever feel like talking loud and it warn't often that we laughedonly a little kind of a low chuckle
we had mighty good weather as a general thing and nothing ever happened to us at allthat night nor the next nor the next
every night we passed towns some of them away up on black hillsides nothing but just a shiny bed of lights not a house could you see
the fifth night we passed st louis and it was like the whole world lit up
in st petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand people in st louis but i never believed it till i see that wonderful spread of lights at two o'clock that still night
there warn't a sound there everybody was asleep
every night now i used to slip ashore towards ten o'clock at some little village and buy ten or fifteen cents' worth of meal or bacon or other stuff to eat and sometimes i lifted a chicken that warn't roosting comfortable and took him along
pap always said take a chicken when you get a chance because if you don't want him yourself you can easy find somebody that does and a good deed ain't ever forgot
i never see pap when he didn't want the chicken himself but that is what he used to say anyway
mornings before daylight i slipped into cornfields and borrowed a watermelon or a mushmelon or a punkin or some new corn or things of that kind
pap always said it warn't no harm to borrow things if you was meaning to pay them back some time but the widow said it warn't anything but a soft name for stealing and no decent body would do it
jim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partly right so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three things from the list and say we wouldn't borrow them any morethen he reckoned it wouldn't be no harm to borrow the others
so we talked it over all one night drifting along down the river trying to make up our minds whether to drop the watermelons or the cantelopes or the mushmelons or what
but towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory and concluded to drop crabapples and p'simmons
we warn't feeling just right before that but it was all comfortable now
i was glad the way it come out too because crabapples ain't ever good and the p'simmons wouldn't be ripe for two or three months yet
we shot a waterfowl now and then that got up too early in the morning or didn't go to bed early enough in the evening
take it all round we lived pretty high
the fifth night below st louis we had a big storm after midnight with a power of thunder and lightning and the rain poured down in a solid sheet
we stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself
when the lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead and high rocky bluffs on both sides
by and by says i hello jim looky yonder it was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock
we was drifting straight down for her
the lightning showed her very distinct
she was leaning over with part of her upper deck above water and you could see every little chimblyguy clean and clear and a chair by the big bell with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of it when the flashes come
well it being away in the night and stormy and all so mysteriouslike i felt just the way any other boy would a felt when i see that wreck laying there so mournful and lonesome in the middle of the river
i wanted to get aboard of her and slink around a little and see what there was there
so i says le's land on her jim but jim was dead against it at first
he says i doan' want to go fool'n 'long er no wrack
we's doin' blame' well en we better let blame' well alone as de good book says
like as not dey's a watchman on dat wrack watchman your grandmother i says there ain't nothing to watch but the texas and the pilothouse and do you reckon anybody's going to resk his life for a texas and a pilothouse such a night as this when it's likely to break up and wash off down the river any minute jim couldn't say nothing to that so he didn't try
and besides i says we might borrow something worth having out of the captain's stateroom
seegars i bet youand cost five cents apiece solid cash
steamboat captains is always rich and get sixty dollars a month and they don't care a cent what a thing costs you know long as they want it
stick a candle in your pocket i can't rest jim till we give her a rummaging
do you reckon tom sawyer would ever go by this thing
not for pie he wouldn't
he'd call it an adventurethat's what he'd call it and he'd land on that wreck if it was his last act
and wouldn't he throw style into itwouldn't he spread himself nor nothing
why you'd think it was christopher c'lumbus discovering kingdomcome
i wish tom sawyer was here jim he grumbled a little but give in
he said we mustn't talk any more than we could help and then talk mighty low
the lightning showed us the wreck again just in time and we fetched the stabboard derrick and made fast there
the deck was high out here
we went sneaking down the slope of it to labboard in the dark towards the texas feeling our way slow with our feet and spreading our hands out to fend off the guys for it was so dark we couldn't see no sign of them
pretty soon we struck the forward end of the skylight and clumb on to it and the next step fetched us in front of the captain's door which was open and by jimminy away down through the texashall we see a light
and all in the same second we seem to hear low voices in yonder
jim whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick and told me to come along
i says all right and was going to start for the raft but just then i heard a voice wail out and say oh please don't boys i swear i won't ever tell another voice said pretty loud it's a lie jim turner
you've acted this way before
you always want more'n your share of the truck and you've always got it too because you've swore 't if you didn't you'd tell
but this time you've said it jest one time too many
you're the meanest treacherousest hound in this country by this time jim was gone for the raft
i was just abiling with curiosity and i says to myself tom sawyer wouldn't back out now and so i won't either i'm agoing to see what's going on here
so i dropped on my hands and knees in the little passage and crept aft in the dark till there warn't but one stateroom betwixt me and the crosshall of the texas
then in there i see a man stretched on the floor and tied hand and foot and two men standing over him and one of them had a dim lantern in his hand and the other one had a pistol
this one kept pointing the pistol at the man's head on the floor and saying i'd like to
and i orter tooa mean skunk the man on the floor would shrivel up and say oh please don't bill i hain't ever goin' to tell and every time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh and say 'deed you ain't you never said no truer thing 'n that you bet you and once he said hear him beg
and yit if we hadn't got the best of him and tied him he'd a killed us both
and what for
jist for noth'n
jist because we stood on our rightsthat's what for
but i lay you ain't agoin' to threaten nobody any more jim turner
put up that pistol bill bill says i don't want to jake packard
i'm for killin' himand didn't he kill old hatfield jist the same wayand don't he deserve it but i don't want him killed and i've got my reasons for it bless yo' heart for them words jake packard
i'll never forgit you long's i live says the man on the floor sort of blubbering
packard didn't take no notice of that but hung up his lantern on a nail and started towards where i was there in the dark and motioned bill to come
i crawfished as fast as i could about two yards but the boat slanted so that i couldn't make very good time so to keep from getting run over and catched i crawled into a stateroom on the upper side
the man came apawing along in the dark and when packard got to my stateroom he says herecome in here and in he come and bill after him
but before they got in i was up in the upper berth cornered and sorry i come
then they stood there with their hands on the ledge of the berth and talked
i couldn't see them but i could tell where they was by the whisky they'd been having
i was glad i didn't drink whisky but it wouldn't made much difference anyway because most of the time they couldn't a treed me because i didn't breathe
i was too scared
and besides a body couldn't breathe and hear such talk
they talked low and earnest
bill wanted to kill turner
he says he's said he'll tell and he will
if we was to give both our shares to him now it wouldn't make no difference after the row and the way we've served him
shore's you're born he'll turn state's evidence now you hear me
i'm for putting him out of his troubles so'm i says packard very quiet
blame it i'd sorter begun to think you wasn't
well then that's all right
le's go and do it hold on a minute i hain't had my say yit
you listen to me
shooting's good but there's quieter ways if the thing's got to be done
but what i say is this it ain't good sense to go court'n around after a halter if you can git at what you're up to in some way that's jist as good and at the same time don't bring you into no resks
ain't that so you bet it is
but how you goin' to manage it this time well my idea is this we'll rustle around and gather up whatever pickins we've overlooked in the staterooms and shove for shore and hide the truck
then we'll wait
now i say it ain't agoin' to be more'n two hours befo' this wrack breaks up and washes off down the river
see
he'll be drownded and won't have nobody to blame for it but his own self
i reckon that's a considerble sight better 'n killin' of him
i'm unfavorable to killin' a man as long as you can git aroun' it it ain't good sense it ain't good morals
ain't i right yes i reck'n you are
but s'pose she don't break up and wash off well we can wait the two hours anyway and see can't we all right then come along so they started and i lit out all in a cold sweat and scrambled forward
it was dark as pitch there but i said in a kind of a coarse whisper jim and he answered up right at my elbow with a sort of a moan and i says quick jim it ain't no time for fooling around and moaning there's a gang of murderers in yonder and if we don't hunt up their boat and set her drifting down the river so these fellows can't get away from the wreck there's one of 'em going to be in a bad fix
but if we find their boat we can put all of 'em in a bad fixfor the sheriff 'll get 'em
quickhurry
i'll hunt the labboard side you hunt the stabboard
you start at the raft and oh my lordy lordy
raf'
dey ain' no raf' no mo' she done broke loose en gone ien here we is well i catched my breath and most fainted
shut up on a wreck with such a gang as that
but it warn't no time to be sentimentering
we'd got to find that boat nowhad to have it for ourselves
so we went aquaking and shaking down the stabboard side and slow work it was tooseemed a week before we got to the stern
no sign of a boat
jim said he didn't believe he could go any furtherso scared he hadn't hardly any strength left he said
but i said come on if we get left on this wreck we are in a fix sure
so on we prowled again
we struck for the stern of the texas and found it and then scrabbled along forwards on the skylight hanging on from shutter to shutter for the edge of the skylight was in the water
when we got pretty close to the crosshall door there was the skiff sure enough
i could just barely see her
i felt ever so thankful
in another second i would a been aboard of her but just then the door opened
one of the men stuck his head out only about a couple of foot from me and i thought i was gone but he jerked it in again and says heave that blame lantern out o' sight bill he flung a bag of something into the boat and then got in himself and set down
it was packard
then bill he come out and got in
packard says in a low voice all readyshove off i couldn't hardly hang on to the shutters i was so weak
but bill says hold on'd you go through him no
didn't you no
so he's got his share o' the cash yet well then come along no use to take truck and leave money say won't he suspicion what we're up to maybe he won't
but we got to have it anyway
come along so they got out and went in
the door slammed to because it was on the careened side and in a half second i was in the boat and jim come tumbling after me
i out with my knife and cut the rope and away we went
we didn't touch an oar and we didn't speak nor whisper nor hardly even breathe
we went gliding swift along dead silent past the tip of the paddlebox and past the stern then in a second or two more we was a hundred yards below the wreck and the darkness soaked her up every last sign of her and we was safe and knowed it
when we was three or four hundred yards downstream we see the lantern show like a little spark at the texas door for a second and we knowed by that that the rascals had missed their boat and was beginning to understand that they was in just as much trouble now as jim turner was
then jim manned the oars and we took out after our raft
now was the first time that i begun to worry about the meni reckon i hadn't had time to before
i begun to think how dreadful it was even for murderers to be in such a fix
i says to myself there ain't no telling but i might come to be a murderer myself yet and then how would i like it
so says i to jim the first light we see we'll land a hundred yards below it or above it in a place where it's a good hidingplace for you and the skiff and then i'll go and fix up some kind of a yarn and get somebody to go for that gang and get them out of their scrape so they can be hung when their time comes but that idea was a failure for pretty soon it begun to storm again and this time worse than ever
the rain poured down and never a light showed everybody in bed i reckon
we boomed along down the river watching for lights and watching for our raft
after a long time the rain let up but the clouds stayed and the lightning kept whimpering and by and by a flash showed us a black thing ahead floating and we made for it
it was the raft and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it again
we seen a light now away down to the right on shore
so i said i would go for it
the skiff was half full of plunder which that gang had stole there on the wreck
we hustled it on to the raft in a pile and i told jim to float along down and show a light when he judged he had gone about two mile and keep it burning till i come then i manned my oars and shoved for the light
as i got down towards it three or four more showedup on a hillside
it was a village
i closed in above the shore light and laid on my oars and floated
as i went by i see it was a lantern hanging on the jackstaff of a doublehull ferryboat
i skimmed around for the watchman awondering whereabouts he slept and by and by i found him roosting on the bitts forward with his head down between his knees
i gave his shoulder two or three little shoves and begun to cry
he stirred up in a kind of a startlish way but when he see it was only me he took a good gap and stretch and then he says hello what's up
don't cry bub
what's the trouble i says pap and mam and sis and then i broke down
he says oh dang it now don't take on so we all has to have our troubles and this 'n 'll come out all right
what's the matter with 'em they'rethey'reare you the watchman of the boat yes he says kind of prettywellsatisfied like
i'm the captain and the owner and the mate and the pilot and watchman and head deckhand and sometimes i'm the freight and passengers
i ain't as rich as old jim hornback and i can't be so blame' generous and good to tom dick and harry as what he is and slam around money the way he does but i've told him a many a time 't i wouldn't trade places with him for says i a sailor's life's the life for me and i'm derned if i'd live two mile out o' town where there ain't nothing ever goin' on not for all his spondulicks and as much more on top of it
says i i broke in and says they're in an awful peck of trouble and who is why pap and mam and sis and miss hooker and if you'd take your ferryboat and go up there up where
where are they on the wreck what wreck why there ain't but one what you don't mean the walter scott yes good land
what are they doin' there for gracious sakes well they didn't go there apurpose i bet they didn't
why great goodness there ain't no chance for 'em if they don't git off mighty quick
why how in the nation did they ever git into such a scrape easy enough
miss hooker was avisiting up there to the town yes booth's landinggo on she was avisiting there at booth's landing and just in the edge of the evening she started over with her nigger woman in the horseferry to stay all night at her friend's house miss whatyoumaycallher i disremember her nameand they lost their steeringoar and swung around and went afloating down stern first about two mile and saddlebaggsed on the wreck and the ferryman and the nigger woman and the horses was all lost but miss hooker she made a grab and got aboard the wreck
well about an hour after dark we come along down in our tradingscow and it was so dark we didn't notice the wreck till we was right on it and so we saddlebaggsed but all of us was saved but bill whippleand oh he was the best creturi most wish 't it had been me i do my george
it's the beatenest thing i ever struck
and then what did you all do well we hollered and took on but it's so wide there we couldn't make nobody hear
so pap said somebody got to get ashore and get help somehow
i was the only one that could swim so i made a dash for it and miss hooker she said if i didn't strike help sooner come here and hunt up her uncle and he'd fix the thing
i made the land about a mile below and been fooling along ever since trying to get people to do something but they said 'what in such a night and such a current
there ain't no sense in it go for the steam ferry'
now if you'll go and by jackson i'd like to and blame it i don't know but i will but who in the dingnation's agoing' to pay for it
do you reckon your pap why that's all right
miss hooker she tole me particular that her uncle hornback great guns
is he her uncle
looky here you break for that light over yonderway and turn out west when you git there and about a quarter of a mile out you'll come to the tavern tell 'em to dart you out to jim hornback's and he'll foot the bill
and don't you fool around any because he'll want to know the news
tell him i'll have his niece all safe before he can get to town
hump yourself now i'm agoing up around the corner here to roust out my engineer i struck for the light but as soon as he turned the corner i went back and got into my skiff and bailed her out and then pulled up shore in the easy water about six hundred yards and tucked myself in among some woodboats for i couldn't rest easy till i could see the ferryboat start
but take it all around i was feeling ruther comfortable on accounts of taking all this trouble for that gang for not many would a done it
i wished the widow knowed about it
i judged she would be proud of me for helping these rapscallions because rapscallions and dead beats is the kind the widow and good people takes the most interest in
well before long here comes the wreck dim and dusky sliding along down
a kind of cold shiver went through me and then i struck out for her
she was very deep and i see in a minute there warn't much chance for anybody being alive in her
i pulled all around her and hollered a little but there wasn't any answer all dead still
i felt a little bit heavyhearted about the gang but not much for i reckoned if they could stand it i could
then here comes the ferryboat so i shoved for the middle of the river on a long downstream slant and when i judged i was out of eyereach i laid on my oars and looked back and see her go and smell around the wreck for miss hooker's remainders because the captain would know her uncle hornback would want them and then pretty soon the ferryboat give it up and went for the shore and i laid into my work and went abooming down the river
it did seem a powerful long time before jim's light showed up and when it did show it looked like it was a thousand mile off
by the time i got there the sky was beginning to get a little gray in the east so we struck for an island and hid the raft and sunk the skiff and turned in and slept like dead people
by and by when we got up we turned over the truck the gang had stole off of the wreck and found boots and blankets and clothes and all sorts of other things and a lot of books and a spyglass and three boxes of seegars
we hadn't ever been this rich before in neither of our lives
the seegars was prime
we laid off all the afternoon in the woods talking and me reading the books and having a general good time
i told jim all about what happened inside the wreck and at the ferryboat and i said these kinds of things was adventures but he said he didn't want no more adventures
he said that when i went in the texas and he crawled back to get on the raft and found her gone he nearly died because he judged it was all up with him anyway it could be fixed for if he didn't get saved he would get drownded and if he did get saved whoever saved him would send him back home so as to get the reward and then miss watson would sell him south sure
well he was right he was most always right he had an uncommon level head for a nigger
i read considerable to jim about kings and dukes and earls and such and how gaudy they dressed and how much style they put on and called each other your majesty and your grace and your lordship and so on 'stead of mister and jim's eyes bugged out and he was interested
he says i didn' know dey was so many un um
i hain't hearn 'bout none un um skasely but ole king sollermun onless you counts dem kings dat's in a pack er k'yards
how much do a king git get i says why they get a thousand dollars a month if they want it they can have just as much as they want everything belongs to them ain' dat gay
en what dey got to do huck they don't do nothing
why how you talk
they just set around no is dat so of course it is
they just set aroundexcept maybe when there's a war then they go to the war
but other times they just lazy around or go hawkingjust hawking and spshd' you hear a noise we skipped out and looked but it warn't nothing but the flutter of a steamboat's wheel away down coming around the point so we come back
yes says i and other times when things is dull they fuss with the parlyment and if everybody don't go just so he whacks their heads off
but mostly they hang round the harem roun' de which harem what's de harem the place where he keeps his wives
don't you know about the harem
solomon had one he had about a million wives why yes dat's so ii'd done forgot it
a harem's a bo'd'nhouse i reck'n

i doan' take no stock in dat
bekase why would a wise man want to live in de mids' er sich a blimblammin' all de time
no'deed he wouldn't
a wise man 'ud take en buil' a bilerfactry en den he could shet down de bilerfactry when he want to res' well but he was the wisest man anyway because the widow she told me so her own self i doan k'yer what de widder say he warn't no wise man nuther

if he got a notion in his head once there warn't no getting it out again
he was the most down on solomon of any nigger i ever see
so i went to talking about other kings and let solomon slide
i told about louis sixteenth that got his head cut off in france long time ago and about his little boy the dolphin that would a been a king but they took and shut him up in jail and some say he died there
po' little chap but some says he got out and got away and come to america dat's good

is a frenchman a man yes well den
dad blame it why doan' he talk like a man
you answer me dat i see it warn't no use wasting wordsyou can't learn a nigger to argue
so i quit
we judged that three nights more would fetch us to cairo at the bottom of illinois where the ohio river comes in and that was what we was after
we would sell the raft and get on a steamboat and go way up the ohio amongst the free states and then be out of trouble
well the second night a fog begun to come on and we made for a towhead to tie to for it wouldn't do to try to run in a fog but when i paddled ahead in the canoe with the line to make fast there warn't anything but little saplings to tie to
i passed the line around one of them right on the edge of the cut bank but there was a stiff current and the raft come booming down so lively she tore it out by the roots and away she went
i see the fog closing down and it made me so sick and scared i couldn't budge for most a half a minute it seemed to meand then there warn't no raft in sight you couldn't see twenty yards
i jumped into the canoe and run back to the stern and grabbed the paddle and set her back a stroke
but she didn't come
i was in such a hurry i hadn't untied her
i got up and tried to untie her but i was so excited my hands shook so i couldn't hardly do anything with them
as soon as i got started i took out after the raft hot and heavy right down the towhead
that was all right as far as it went but the towhead warn't sixty yards long and the minute i flew by the foot of it i shot out into the solid white fog and hadn't no more idea which way i was going than a dead man
thinks i it won't do to paddle first i know i'll run into the bank or a towhead or something i got to set still and float and yet it's mighty fidgety business to have to hold your hands still at such a time
i whooped and listened
away down there somewheres i hears a small whoop and up comes my spirits
i went tearing after it listening sharp to hear it again
the next time it come i see i warn't heading for it but heading away to the right of it
and the next time i was heading away to the left of itand not gaining on it much either for i was flying around this way and that and t'other but it was going straight ahead all the time
i did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan and beat it all the time but he never did and it was the still places between the whoops that was making the trouble for me
well i fought along and directly i hears the whoop behind me
i was tangled good now
that was somebody else's whoop or else i was turned around
i throwed the paddle down
i heard the whoop again it was behind me yet but in a different place it kept coming and kept changing its place and i kept answering till by and by it was in front of me again and i knowed the current had swung the canoe's head downstream and i was all right if that was jim and not some other raftsman hollering
i couldn't tell nothing about voices in a fog for nothing don't look natural nor sound natural in a fog
the whooping went on and in about a minute i come abooming down on a cut bank with smoky ghosts of big trees on it and the current throwed me off to the left and shot by amongst a lot of snags that fairly roared the currrent was tearing by them so swift
in another second or two it was solid white and still again
i set perfectly still then listening to my heart thump and i reckon i didn't draw a breath while it thumped a hundred
i just give up then
i knowed what the matter was
that cut bank was an island and jim had gone down t'other side of it
it warn't no towhead that you could float by in ten minutes
it had the big timber of a regular island it might be five or six miles long and more than half a mile wide
i kept quiet with my ears cocked about fifteen minutes i reckon
i was floating along of course four or five miles an hour but you don't ever think of that
no you feel like you are laying dead still on the water and if a little glimpse of a snag slips by you don't think to yourself how fast you're going but you catch your breath and think my
how that snag's tearing along
if you think it ain't dismal and lonesome out in a fog that way by yourself in the night you try it onceyou'll see
next for about a half an hour i whoops now and then at last i hears the answer a long ways off and tries to follow it but i couldn't do it and directly i judged i'd got into a nest of towheads for i had little dim glimpses of them on both sides of mesometimes just a narrow channel between and some that i couldn't see i knowed was there because i'd hear the wash of the current against the old dead brush and trash that hung over the banks
well i warn't long loosing the whoops down amongst the towheads and i only tried to chase them a little while anyway because it was worse than chasing a jacko'lantern
you never knowed a sound dodge around so and swap places so quick and so much
i had to claw away from the bank pretty lively four or five times to keep from knocking the islands out of the river and so i judged the raft must be butting into the bank every now and then or else it would get further ahead and clear out of hearingit was floating a little faster than what i was
well i seemed to be in the open river again by and by but i couldn't hear no sign of a whoop nowheres
i reckoned jim had fetched up on a snag maybe and it was all up with him
i was good and tired so i laid down in the canoe and said i wouldn't bother no more
i didn't want to go to sleep of course but i was so sleepy i couldn't help it so i thought i would take jest one little catnap
but i reckon it was more than a catnap for when i waked up the stars was shining bright the fog was all gone and i was spinning down a big bend stern first
first i didn't know where i was i thought i was dreaming and when things began to come back to me they seemed to come up dim out of last week
it was a monstrous big river here with the tallest and the thickest kind of timber on both banks just a solid wall as well as i could see by the stars
i looked away downstream and seen a black speck on the water
i took after it but when i got to it it warn't nothing but a couple of sawlogs made fast together
then i see another speck and chased that then another and this time i was right
it was the raft
when i got to it jim was setting there with his head down between his knees asleep with his right arm hanging over the steeringoar
the other oar was smashed off and the raft was littered up with leaves and branches and dirt
so she'd had a rough time
i made fast and laid down under jim's nose on the raft and began to gap and stretch my fists out against jim and says hello jim have i been asleep
why didn't you stir me up goodness gracious is dat you huck

well you answer me dis didn't you tote out de line in de canoe fer to make fas' to de towhead no i didn't
what towhead

looky here didn't de line pull loose en de raf' go ahummin' down de river en leave you en de canoe behine in de fog what fog why de fogde fog dat's been aroun' all night
en didn't you whoop en didn't i whoop tell we got mix' up in de islands en one un us got los' en t'other one was jis' as good as los' 'kase he didn' know whah he wuz
en didn't i bust up agin a lot er dem islands en have a turrible time en mos' git drownded
now ain' dat so bossain't it so
you answer me dat well this is too many for me jim
i hain't seen no fog nor no islands nor no troubles nor nothing
i been setting here talking with you all night till you went to sleep about ten minutes ago and i reckon i done the same
you couldn't a got drunk in that time so of course you've been dreaming dad fetch it how is i gwyne to dream all dat in ten minutes well hang it all you did dream it because there didn't any of it happen but huck it's all jis' as plain to me as it don't make no difference how plain it is there ain't nothing in it
i know because i've been here all the time jim didn't say nothing for about five minutes but set there studying over it
then he says well den i reck'n i did dream it huck but dog my cats ef it ain't de powerfullest dream i ever see
en i hain't ever had no dream b'fo' dat's tired me like dis one oh well that's all right because a dream does tire a body like everything sometimes
but this one was a staving dream tell me all about it jim so jim went to work and told me the whole thing right through just as it happened only he painted it up considerable
then he said he must start in and 'terpret it because it was sent for a warning
he said the first towhead stood for a man that would try to do us some good but the current was another man that would get us away from him
the whoops was warnings that would come to us every now and then and if we didn't try hard to make out to understand them they'd just take us into bad luck 'stead of keeping us out of it
the lot of towheads was troubles we was going to get into with quarrelsome people and all kinds of mean folks but if we minded our business and didn't talk back and aggravate them we would pull through and get out of the fog and into the big clear river which was the free states and wouldn't have no more trouble
it had clouded up pretty dark just after i got on to the raft but it was clearing up again now
oh well that's all interpreted well enough as far as it goes jim i says but what does these things stand for it was the leaves and rubbish on the raft and the smashed oar
you could see them firstrate now
jim looked at the trash and then looked at me and back at the trash again
he had got the dream fixed so strong in his head that he couldn't seem to shake it loose and get the facts back into its place again right away
but when he did get the thing straightened around he looked at me steady without ever smiling and says what do dey stan' for
i'se gwyne to tell you
when i got all wore out wid work en wid de callin' for you en went to sleep my heart wuz mos' broke bekase you wuz los' en i didn' k'yer no' mo' what become er me en de raf'
en when i wake up en fine you back agin all safe en soun' de tears come en i could a got down on my knees en kiss yo' foot i's so thankful
en all you wuz thinkin' 'bout wuz how you could make a fool uv ole jim wid a lie
dat truck dah is trash en trash is what people is dat puts dirt on de head er dey fren's en makes 'em ashamed then he got up slow and walked to the wigwam and went in there without saying anything but that
but that was enough
it made me feel so mean i could almost kissed his foot to get him to take it back
it was fifteen minutes before i could work myself up to go and humble myself to a nigger but i done it and i warn't ever sorry for it afterwards neither
i didn't do him no more mean tricks and i wouldn't done that one if i'd a knowed it would make him feel that way
we slept most all day and started out at night a little ways behind a monstrous long raft that was as long going by as a procession
she had four long sweeps at each end so we judged she carried as many as thirty men likely
she had five big wigwams aboard wide apart and an open camp fire in the middle and a tall flagpole at each end
there was a power of style about her
it amounted to something being a raftsman on such a craft as that
we went drifting down into a big bend and the night clouded up and got hot
the river was very wide and was walled with solid timber on both sides you couldn't see a break in it hardly ever or a light
we talked about cairo and wondered whether we would know it when we got to it
i said likely we wouldn't because i had heard say there warn't but about a dozen houses there and if they didn't happen to have them lit up how was we going to know we was passing a town
jim said if the two big rivers joined together there that would show
but i said maybe we might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming into the same old river again
that disturbed jimand me too
so the question was what to do
i said paddle ashore the first time a light showed and tell them pap was behind coming along with a tradingscow and was a green hand at the business and wanted to know how far it was to cairo
jim thought it was a good idea so we took a smoke on it and waited
there warn't nothing to do now but to look out sharp for the town and not pass it without seeing it
he said he'd be mighty sure to see it because he'd be a free man the minute he seen it but if he missed it he'd be in a slave country again and no more show for freedom
every little while he jumps up and says dah she is but it warn't
it was jacko'lanterns or lightning bugs so he set down again and went to watching same as before
jim said it made him all over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom
well i can tell you it made me all over trembly and feverish too to hear him because i begun to get it through my head that he was most freeand who was to blame for it
why me
i couldn't get that out of my conscience no how nor no way
it got to troubling me so i couldn't rest i couldn't stay still in one place
it hadn't ever come home to me before what this thing was that i was doing
but now it did and it stayed with me and scorched me more and more
i tried to make out to myself that i warn't to blame because i didn't run jim off from his rightful owner but it warn't no use conscience up and says every time but you knowed he was running for his freedom and you could a paddled ashore and told somebody that was soi couldn't get around that noway
that was where it pinched
conscience says to me what had poor miss watson done to you that you could see her nigger go off right under your eyes and never say one single word
what did that poor old woman do to you that you could treat her so mean
why she tried to learn you your book she tried to learn you your manners she tried to be good to you every way she knowed how
that's what she done i got to feeling so mean and so miserable i most wished i was dead
i fidgeted up and down the raft abusing myself to myself and jim was fidgeting up and down past me
we neither of us could keep still
every time he danced around and says dah's cairo it went through me like a shot and i thought if it was cairo i reckoned i would die of miserableness
jim talked out loud all the time while i was talking to myself
he was saying how the first thing he would do when he got to a free state he would go to saving up money and never spend a single cent and when he got enough he would buy his wife which was owned on a farm close to where miss watson lived and then they would both work to buy the two children and if their master wouldn't sell them they'd get an ab'litionist to go and steal them
it most froze me to hear such talk
he wouldn't ever dared to talk such talk in his life before
just see what a difference it made in him the minute he judged he was about free
it was according to the old saying give a nigger an inch and he'll take an ell thinks i this is what comes of my not thinking
here was this nigger which i had as good as helped to run away coming right out flatfooted and saying he would steal his childrenchildren that belonged to a man i didn't even know a man that hadn't ever done me no harm
i was sorry to hear jim say that it was such a lowering of him
my conscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever until at last i says to it let up on meit ain't too late yeti'll paddle ashore at the first light and tell i felt easy and happy and light as a feather right off
all my troubles was gone
i went to looking out sharp for a light and sort of singing to myself
by and by one showed
jim sings out we's safe huck we's safe
jump up and crack yo' heels
dat's de good ole cairo at las' i jis knows it i says i'll take the canoe and go and see jim
it mightn't be you know he jumped and got the canoe ready and put his old coat in the bottom for me to set on and give me the paddle and as i shoved off he says pooty soon i'll be ashout'n' for joy en i'll say it's all on accounts o' huck i's a free man en i couldn't ever ben free ef it hadn' ben for huck huck done it
jim won't ever forgit you huck you's de bes' fren' jim's ever had en you's de only fren' ole jim's got now i was paddling off all in a sweat to tell on him but when he says this it seemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me
i went along slow then and i warn't right down certain whether i was glad i started or whether i warn't
when i was fifty yards off jim says dah you goes de ole true huck de on'y white genlman dat ever kep' his promise to ole jim well i just felt sick
but i says i got to do iti can't get out of it
right then along comes a skiff with two men in it with guns and they stopped and i stopped
one of them says what's that yonder a piece of a raft i says
do you belong on it yes sir any men on it only one sir well there's five niggers run off tonight up yonder above the head of the bend
is your man white or black i didn't answer up prompt
i tried to but the words wouldn't come
i tried for a second or two to brace up and out with it but i warn't man enoughhadn't the spunk of a rabbit
i see i was weakening so i just give up trying and up and says he's white i reckon we'll go and see for ourselves i wish you would says i because it's pap that's there and maybe you'd help me tow the raft ashore where the light is
he's sickand so is mam and mary ann oh the devil
we're in a hurry boy
but i s'pose we've got to
come buckle to your paddle and let's get along i buckled to my paddle and they laid to their oars
when we had made a stroke or two i says pap'll be mighty much obleeged to you i can tell you
everybody goes away when i want them to help me tow the raft ashore and i can't do it by myself well that's infernal mean
odd too
say boy what's the matter with your father it's theathewell it ain't anything much they stopped pulling
it warn't but a mighty little ways to the raft now
one says boy that's a lie
what is the matter with your pap
answer up square now and it'll be the better for you i will sir i will honestbut don't leave us please
it's thethegentlemen if you'll only pull ahead and let me heave you the headline you won't have to come anear the raftplease do set her back john set her back says one
they backed water
keep away boykeep to looard
confound it i just expect the wind has blowed it to us
your pap's got the smallpox and you know it precious well
why didn't you come out and say so
do you want to spread it all over well says i ablubbering i've told everybody before and they just went away and left us poor devil there's something in that
we are right down sorry for you but wewell hang it we don't want the smallpox you see
look here i'll tell you what to do
don't you try to land by yourself or you'll smash everything to pieces
you float along down about twenty miles and you'll come to a town on the lefthand side of the river
it will be long after sunup then and when you ask for help you tell them your folks are all down with chills and fever
don't be a fool again and let people guess what is the matter
now we're trying to do you a kindness so you just put twenty miles between us that's a good boy
it wouldn't do any good to land yonder where the light isit's only a woodyard
say i reckon your father's poor and i'm bound to say he's in pretty hard luck
here i'll put a twentydollar gold piece on this board and you get it when it floats by
i feel mighty mean to leave you but my kingdom
it won't do to fool with smallpox don't you see hold on parker says the other man here's a twenty to put on the board for me
goodbye boy you do as mr parker told you and you'll be all right that's so my boygoodbye goodbye
if you see any runaway niggers you get help and nab them and you can make some money by it goodbye sir says i i won't let no runaway niggers get by me if i can help it they went off and i got aboard the raft feeling bad and low because i knowed very well i had done wrong and i see it warn't no use for me to try to learn to do right a body that don't get started right when he's little ain't got no showwhen the pinch comes there ain't nothing to back him up and keep him to his work and so he gets beat
then i thought a minute and says to myself hold on s'pose you'd a done right and give jim up would you felt better than what you do now
no says i i'd feel badi'd feel just the same way i do now
well then says i what's the use you learning to do right when it's troublesome to do right and ain't no trouble to do wrong and the wages is just the same
i was stuck
i couldn't answer that
so i reckoned i wouldn't bother no more about it but after this always do whichever come handiest at the time
i went into the wigwam jim warn't there
i looked all around he warn't anywhere
i says jim here i is huck
is dey out o' sight yit
don't talk loud he was in the river under the stern oar with just his nose out
i told him they were out of sight so he come aboard
he says i was alistenin' to all de talk en i slips into de river en was gwyne to shove for sho' if dey come aboard
den i was gwyne to swim to de raf' agin when dey was gone
but lawsy how you did fool 'em huck
dat wuz de smartes' dodge
i tell you chile i'spec it save' ole jimole jim ain't going to forgit you for dat honey then we talked about the money
it was a pretty good raisetwenty dollars apiece
jim said we could take deck passage on a steamboat now and the money would last us as far as we wanted to go in the free states
he said twenty mile more warn't far for the raft to go but he wished we was already there
towards daybreak we tied up and jim was mighty particular about hiding the raft good
then he worked all day fixing things in bundles and getting all ready to quit rafting
that night about ten we hove in sight of the lights of a town away down in a lefthand bend
i went off in the canoe to ask about it
pretty soon i found a man out in the river with a skiff setting a trotline
i ranged up and says mister is that town cairo cairo
no
you must be a blame' fool what town is it mister if you want to know go and find out
if you stay here botherin' around me for about a half a minute longer you'll get something you won't want i paddled to the raft
jim was awful disappointed but i said never mind cairo would be the next place i reckoned
we passed another town before daylight and i was going out again but it was high ground so i didn't go
no high ground about cairo jim said
i had forgot it
we laid up for the day on a towhead tolerable close to the lefthand bank
i begun to suspicion something
so did jim
i says maybe we went by cairo in the fog that night he says doan' le's talk about it huck
po' niggers can't have no luck
i awluz 'spected dat rattlesnakeskin warn't done wid its work i wish i'd never seen that snakeskin jimi do wish i'd never laid eyes on it it ain't yo' fault huck you didn' know
don't you blame yo'self 'bout it when it was daylight here was the clear ohio water inshore sure enough and outside was the old regular muddy
so it was all up with cairo
we talked it all over
it wouldn't do to take to the shore we couldn't take the raft up the stream of course
there warn't no way but to wait for dark and start back in the canoe and take the chances
so we slept all day amongst the cottonwood thicket so as to be fresh for the work and when we went back to the raft about dark the canoe was gone
we didn't say a word for a good while
there warn't anything to say
we both knowed well enough it was some more work of the rattlesnakeskin so what was the use to talk about it
it would only look like we was finding fault and that would be bound to fetch more bad luckand keep on fetching it too till we knowed enough to keep still
by and by we talked about what we better do and found there warn't no way but just to go along down with the raft till we got a chance to buy a canoe to go back in
we warn't going to borrow it when there warn't anybody around the way pap would do for that might set people after us
so we shoved out after dark on the raft
anybody that don't believe yet that it's foolishness to handle a snakeskin after all that that snakeskin done for us will believe it now if they read on and see what more it done for us
the place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore
but we didn't see no rafts laying up so we went along during three hours and more
well the night got gray and ruther thick which is the next meanest thing to fog
you can't tell the shape of the river and you can't see no distance
it got to be very late and still and then along comes a steamboat up the river
we lit the lantern and judged she would see it
upstream boats didn't generly come close to us they go out and follow the bars and hunt for easy water under the reefs but nights like this they bull right up the channel against the whole river
we could hear her pounding along but we didn't see her good till she was close
she aimed right for us
often they do that and try to see how close they can come without touching sometimes the wheel bites off a sweep and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs and thinks he's mighty smart
well here she comes and we said she was going to try and shave us but she didn't seem to be sheering off a bit
she was a big one and she was coming in a hurry too looking like a black cloud with rows of glowworms around it but all of a sudden she bulged out big and scary with a long row of wideopen furnace doors shining like redhot teeth and her monstrous bows and guards hanging right over us
there was a yell at us and a jingling of bells to stop the engines a powwow of cussing and whistling of steamand as jim went overboard on one side and i on the other she come smashing straight through the raft
i divedand i aimed to find the bottom too for a thirtyfoot wheel had got to go over me and i wanted it to have plenty of room
i could always stay under water a minute this time i reckon i stayed under a minute and a half
then i bounced for the top in a hurry for i was nearly busting
i popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out of my nose and puffed a bit
of course there was a booming current and of course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after she stopped them for they never cared much for raftsmen so now she was churning along up the river out of sight in the thick weather though i could hear her
i sung out for jim about a dozen times but i didn't get any answer so i grabbed a plank that touched me while i was treading water and struck out for shore shoving it ahead of me
but i made out to see that the drift of the current was towards the lefthand shore which meant that i was in a crossing so i changed off and went that way
it was one of these long slanting twomile crossings so i was a good long time in getting over
i made a safe landing and clumb up the bank
i couldn't see but a little ways but i went poking along over rough ground for a quarter of a mile or more and then i run across a big oldfashioned double loghouse before i noticed it
i was going to rush by and get away but a lot of dogs jumped out and went to howling and barking at me and i knowed better than to move another peg
in about a minute somebody spoke out of a window without putting his head out and says be done boys
who's there i says it's me who's me george jackson sir what do you want i don't want nothing sir
i only want to go along by but the dogs won't let me what are you prowling around here this time of night forhey i warn't prowling around sir i fell overboard off of the steamboat oh you did did you
strike a light there somebody
what did you say your name was george jackson sir
i'm only a boy look here if you're telling the truth you needn't be afraidnobody'll hurt you
but don't try to budge stand right where you are
rouse out bob and tom some of you and fetch the guns
george jackson is there anybody with you no sir nobody i heard the people stirring around in the house now and see a light
the man sung out snatch that light away betsy you old foolain't you got any sense
put it on the floor behind the front door
bob if you and tom are ready take your places all ready now george jackson do you know the shepherdsons no sir i never heard of them well that may be so and it mayn't
now all ready
step forward george jackson
and mind don't you hurrycome mighty slow
if there's anybody with you let him keep backif he shows himself he'll be shot
come along now
come slow push the door open yourselfjust enough to squeeze in d' you hear i didn't hurry i couldn't if i'd a wanted to
i took one slow step at a time and there warn't a sound only i thought i could hear my heart
the dogs were as still as the humans but they followed a little behind me
when i got to the three log doorsteps i heard them unlocking and unbarring and unbolting
i put my hand on the door and pushed it a little and a little more till somebody said there that's enoughput your head in i done it but i judged they would take it off
the candle was on the floor and there they all was looking at me and me at them for about a quarter of a minute three big men with guns pointed at me which made me wince i tell you the oldest gray and about sixty the other two thirty or moreall of them fine and handsomeand the sweetest old grayheaded lady and back of her two young women which i couldn't see right well
the old gentleman says there i reckon it's all right
come in as soon as i was in the old gentleman he locked the door and barred it and bolted it and told the young men to come in with their guns and they all went in a big parlor that had a new rag carpet on the floor and got together in a corner that was out of the range of the front windowsthere warn't none on the side
they held the candle and took a good look at me and all said why he ain't a shepherdsonno there ain't any shepherdson about him then the old man said he hoped i wouldn't mind being searched for arms because he didn't mean no harm by itit was only to make sure
so he didn't pry into my pockets but only felt outside with his hands and said it was all right
he told me to make myself easy and at home and tell all about myself but the old lady says why bless you saul the poor thing's as wet as he can be and don't you reckon it may be he's hungry true for you racheli forgot so the old lady says betsy this was a nigger woman you fly around and get him something to eat as quick as you can poor thing and one of you girls go and wake up buck and tell himoh here he is himself
buck take this little stranger and get the wet clothes off from him and dress him up in some of yours that's dry buck looked about as old as methirteen or fourteen or along there though he was a little bigger than me
he hadn't on anything but a shirt and he was very frowzyheaded
he came in gaping and digging one fist into his eyes and he was dragging a gun along with the other one
he says ain't they no shepherdsons around they said no 'twas a false alarm
well he says if they'd a ben some i reckon i'd a got one they all laughed and bob says why buck they might have scalped us all you've been so slow in coming well nobody come after me and it ain't right i'm always kept down i don't get no show never mind buck my boy says the old man you'll have show enough all in good time don't you fret about that
go 'long with you now and do as your mother told you when we got upstairs to his room he got me a coarse shirt and a roundabout and pants of his and i put them on
while i was at it he asked me what my name was but before i could tell him he started to tell me about a bluejay and a young rabbit he had catched in the woods day before yesterday and he asked me where moses was when the candle went out
i said i didn't know i hadn't heard about it before no way
well guess he says
how'm i going to guess says i when i never heard tell of it before but you can guess can't you
it's just as easy which candle i says
why any candle he says
i don't know where he was says i where was he why he was in the dark
that's where he was well if you knowed where he was what did you ask me for why blame it it's a riddle don't you see
say how long are you going to stay here
you got to stay always
we can just have booming timesthey don't have no school now
do you own a dog
i've got a dogand he'll go in the river and bring out chips that you throw in
do you like to comb up sundays and all that kind of foolishness
you bet i don't but ma she makes me
confound these ole britches
i reckon i'd better put 'em on but i'd ruther not it's so warm
are you all ready
all right
come along old hoss cold cornpone cold cornbeef butter and buttermilkthat is what they had for me down there and there ain't nothing better that ever i've come across yet
buck and his ma and all of them smoked cob pipes except the nigger woman which was gone and the two young women
they all smoked and talked and i eat and talked
the young women had quilts around them and their hair down their backs
they all asked me questions and i told them how pap and me and all the family was living on a little farm down at the bottom of arkansaw and my sister mary ann run off and got married and never was heard of no more and bill went to hunt them and he warn't heard of no more and tom and mort died and then there warn't nobody but just me and pap left and he was just trimmed down to nothing on account of his troubles so when he died i took what there was left because the farm didn't belong to us and started up the river deck passage and fell overboard and that was how i come to be here
so they said i could have a home there as long as i wanted it
then it was most daylight and everybody went to bed and i went to bed with buck and when i waked up in the morning drat it all i had forgot what my name was
so i laid there about an hour trying to think and when buck waked up i says can you spell buck yes he says
i bet you can't spell my name says i
i bet you what you dare i can says he
all right says i go ahead george jaxonthere now he says
well says i you done it but i didn't think you could
it ain't no slouch of a name to spellright off without studying i set it down private because somebody might want me to spell it next and so i wanted to be handy with it and rattle it off like i was used to it
it was a mighty nice family and a mighty nice house too
i hadn't seen no house out in the country before that was so nice and had so much style
it didn't have an iron latch on the front door nor a wooden one with a buckskin string but a brass knob to turn the same as houses in town
there warn't no bed in the parlor nor a sign of a bed but heaps of parlors in towns has beds in them
there was a big fireplace that was bricked on the bottom and the bricks was kept clean and red by pouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick sometimes they wash them over with red waterpaint that they call spanishbrown same as they do in town
they had big brass dogirons that could hold up a sawlog
there was a clock on the middle of the mantelpiece with a picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the glass front and a round place in the middle of it for the sun and you could see the pendulum swinging behind it
it was beautiful to hear that clock tick and sometimes when one of these peddlers had been along and scoured her up and got her in good shape she would start in and strike a hundred and fifty before she got tuckered out
they wouldn't took any money for her
well there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock made out of something like chalk and painted up gaudy
by one of the parrots was a cat made of crockery and a crockery dog by the other and when you pressed down on them they squeaked but didn't open their mouths nor look different nor interested
they squeaked through underneath
there was a couple of big wildturkeywing fans spread out behind those things
on the table in the middle of the room was a kind of a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and grapes piled up in it which was much redder and yellower and prettier than real ones is but they warn't real because you could see where pieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk or whatever it was underneath
this table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth with a red and blue spreadeagle painted on it and a painted border all around
it come all the way from philadelphia they said
there was some books too piled up perfectly exact on each corner of the table
one was a big family bible full of pictures
one was pilgrim's progress about a man that left his family it didn't say why
i read considerable in it now and then
the statements was interesting but tough
another was friendship's offering full of beautiful stuff and poetry but i didn't read the poetry
another was henry clay's speeches and another was dr gunn's family medicine which told you all about what to do if a body was sick or dead
there was a hymn book and a lot of other books
and there was nice splitbottom chairs and perfectly sound toonot bagged down in the middle and busted like an old basket
they had pictures hung on the wallsmainly washingtons and lafayettes and battles and highland marys and one called signing the declaration there was some that they called crayons which one of the daughters which was dead made her own self when she was only fifteen years old
they was different from any pictures i ever see beforeblacker mostly than is common
one was a woman in a slim black dress belted small under the armpits with bulges like a cabbage in the middle of the sleeves and a large black scoopshovel bonnet with a black veil and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape and very wee black slippers like a chisel and she was leaning pensive on a tombstone on her right elbow under a weeping willow and her other hand hanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule and underneath the picture it said shall i never see thee more alas another one was a young lady with her hair all combed up straight to the top of her head and knotted there in front of a comb like a chairback and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird laying on its back in her other hand with its heels up and underneath the picture it said i shall never hear thy sweet chirrup more alas there was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at the moon and tears running down her cheeks and she had an open letter in one hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it and she was mashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth and underneath the picture it said and art thou gone yes thou art gone alas these was all nice pictures i reckon but i didn't somehow seem to take to them because if ever i was down a little they always give me the fantods
everybody was sorry she died because she had laid out a lot more of these pictures to do and a body could see by what she had done what they had lost
but i reckoned that with her disposition she was having a better time in the graveyard
she was at work on what they said was her greatest picture when she took sick and every day and every night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got it done but she never got the chance
it was a picture of a young woman in a long white gown standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jump off with her hair all down her back and looking up to the moon with the tears running down her face and she had two arms folded across her breast and two arms stretched out in front and two more reaching up towards the moonand the idea was to see which pair would look best and then scratch out all the other arms but as i was saying she died before she got her mind made up and now they kept this picture over the head of the bed in her room and every time her birthday come they hung flowers on it
other times it was hid with a little curtain
the young woman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face but there was so many arms it made her look too spidery seemed to me
this young girl kept a scrapbook when she was alive and used to paste obituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out of the presbyterian observer and write poetry after them out of her own head
it was very good poetry
this is what she wrote about a boy by the name of stephen dowling bots that fell down a well and was drownded ode to stephen dowling bots dec'd and did young stephen sicken and did young stephen die
and did the sad hearts thicken and did the mourners cry
no such was not the fate of young stephen dowling bots though sad hearts round him thickened 'twas not from sickness' shots
no whoopingcough did rack his frame nor measles drear with spots not these impaired the sacred name of stephen dowling bots
despised love struck not with woe that head of curly knots nor stomach troubles laid him low young stephen dowling bots
o no
then list with tearful eye whilst i his fate do tell
his soul did from this cold world fly by falling down a well
they got him out and emptied him alas it was too late his spirit was gone for to sport aloft in the realms of the good and great
if emmeline grangerford could make poetry like that before she was fourteen there ain't no telling what she could a done by and by
buck said she could rattle off poetry like nothing
she didn't ever have to stop to think
he said she would slap down a line and if she couldn't find anything to rhyme with it would just scratch it out and slap down another one and go ahead
she warn't particular she could write about anything you choose to give her to write about just so it was sadful
every time a man died or a woman died or a child died she would be on hand with her tribute before he was cold
she called them tributes
the neighbors said it was the doctor first then emmeline then the undertakerthe undertaker never got in ahead of emmeline but once and then she hung fire on a rhyme for the dead person's name which was whistler
she warn't ever the same after that she never complained but she kinder pined away and did not live long
poor thing many's the time i made myself go up to the little room that used to be hers and get out her poor old scrapbook and read in it when her pictures had been aggravating me and i had soured on her a little
i liked all that family dead ones and all and warn't going to let anything come between us
poor emmeline made poetry about all the dead people when she was alive and it didn't seem right that there warn't nobody to make some about her now she was gone so i tried to sweat out a verse or two myself but i couldn't seem to make it go somehow
they kept emmeline's room trim and nice and all the things fixed in it just the way she liked to have them when she was alive and nobody ever slept there
the old lady took care of the room herself though there was plenty of niggers and she sewed there a good deal and read her bible there mostly
well as i was saying about the parlor there was beautiful curtains on the windows white with pictures painted on them of castles with vines all down the walls and cattle coming down to drink
there was a little old piano too that had tin pans in it i reckon and nothing was ever so lovely as to hear the young ladies sing the last link is broken and play the battle of prague on it
the walls of all the rooms was plastered and most had carpets on the floors and the whole house was whitewashed on the outside
it was a double house and the big open place betwixt them was roofed and floored and sometimes the table was set there in the middle of the day and it was a cool comfortable place
nothing couldn't be better
and warn't the cooking good and just bushels of it too
col grangerford was a gentleman you see
he was a gentleman all over and so was his family
he was well born as the saying is and that's worth as much in a man as it is in a horse so the widow douglas said and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy in our town and pap he always said it too though he warn't no more quality than a mudcat himself
col grangerford was very tall and very slim and had a darkishpaly complexion not a sign of red in it anywheres he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face and he had the thinnest kind of lips and the thinnest kind of nostrils and a high nose and heavy eyebrows and the blackest kind of eyes sunk so deep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at you as you may say
his forehead was high and his hair was black and straight and hung to his shoulders
his hands was long and thin and every day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head to foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it and on sundays he wore a blue tailcoat with brass buttons on it
he carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it
there warn't no frivolishness about him not a bit and he warn't ever loud
he was as kind as he could beyou could feel that you know and so you had confidence
sometimes he smiled and it was good to see but when he straightened himself up like a libertypole and the lightning begun to flicker out from under his eyebrows you wanted to climb a tree first and find out what the matter was afterwards
he didn't ever have to tell anybody to mind their mannerseverybody was always goodmannered where he was
everybody loved to have him around too he was sunshine most alwaysi mean he made it seem like good weather
when he turned into a cloudbank it was awful dark for half a minute and that was enough there wouldn't nothing go wrong again for a week
when him and the old lady come down in the morning all the family got up out of their chairs and give them goodday and didn't set down again till they had set down
then tom and bob went to the sideboard where the decanter was and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to him and he held it in his hand and waited till tom's and bob's was mixed and then they bowed and said our duty to you sir and madam and they bowed the least bit in the world and said thank you and so they drank all three and bob and tom poured a spoonful of water on the sugar and the mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of their tumblers and give it to me and buck and we drank to the old people too
bob was the oldest and tom nexttall beautiful men with very broad shoulders and brown faces and long black hair and black eyes
they dressed in white linen from head to foot like the old gentleman and wore broad panama hats
then there was miss charlotte she was twentyfive and tall and proud and grand but as good as she could be when she warn't stirred up but when she was she had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks like her father
she was beautiful
so was her sister miss sophia but it was a different kind
she was gentle and sweet like a dove and she was only twenty
each person had their own nigger to wait on thembuck too
my nigger had a monstrous easy time because i warn't used to having anybody do anything for me but buck's was on the jump most of the time
this was all there was of the family now but there used to be morethree sons they got killed and emmeline that died
the old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over a hundred niggers
sometimes a stack of people would come there horseback from ten or fifteen mile around and stay five or six days and have such junketings round about and on the river and dances and picnics in the woods daytimes and balls at the house nights
these people was mostly kinfolks of the family
the men brought their guns with them
it was a handsome lot of quality i tell you
there was another clan of aristocracy around therefive or six familiesmostly of the name of shepherdson
they was as hightoned and well born and rich and grand as the tribe of grangerfords
the shepherdsons and grangerfords used the same steamboat landing which was about two mile above our house so sometimes when i went up there with a lot of our folks i used to see a lot of the shepherdsons there on their fine horses
one day buck and me was away out in the woods hunting and heard a horse coming
we was crossing the road
buck says quick
jump for the woods we done it and then peeped down the woods through the leaves
pretty soon a splendid young man come galloping down the road setting his horse easy and looking like a soldier
he had his gun across his pommel
i had seen him before
it was young harney shepherdson
i heard buck's gun go off at my ear and harney's hat tumbled off from his head
he grabbed his gun and rode straight to the place where we was hid
but we didn't wait
we started through the woods on a run
the woods warn't thick so i looked over my shoulder to dodge the bullet and twice i seen harney cover buck with his gun and then he rode away the way he cometo get his hat i reckon but i couldn't see
we never stopped running till we got home
the old gentleman's eyes blazed a minute'twas pleasure mainly i judgedthen his face sort of smoothed down and he says kind of gentle i don't like that shooting from behind a bush
why didn't you step into the road my boy the shepherdsons don't father
they always take advantage miss charlotte she held her head up like a queen while buck was telling his tale and her nostrils spread and her eyes snapped
the two young men looked dark but never said nothing
miss sophia she turned pale but the color come back when she found the man warn't hurt
soon as i could get buck down by the corncribs under the trees by ourselves i says did you want to kill him buck well i bet i did what did he do to you him
he never done nothing to me well then what did you want to kill him for why nothingonly it's on account of the feud what's a feud why where was you raised
don't you know what a feud is never heard of it beforetell me about it well says buck a feud is this way a man has a quarrel with another man and kills him then that other man's brother kills him then the other brothers on both sides goes for one another then the cousins chip inand by and by everybody's killed off and there ain't no more feud
but it's kind of slow and takes a long time has this one been going on long buck well i should reckon
it started thirty year ago or som'ers along there
there was trouble 'bout something and then a lawsuit to settle it and the suit went agin one of the men and so he up and shot the man that won the suitwhich he would naturally do of course
anybody would what was the trouble about buckland i reckon maybei don't know well who done the shooting
was it a grangerford or a shepherdson laws how do i know
it was so long ago don't anybody know oh yes pa knows i reckon and some of the other old people but they don't know now what the row was about in the first place has there been many killed buck yes right smart chance of funerals
but they don't always kill
pa's got a few buckshot in him but he don't mind it 'cuz he don't weigh much anyway
bob's been carved up some with a bowie and tom's been hurt once or twice has anybody been killed this year buck yes we got one and they got one
'bout three months ago my cousin bud fourteen year old was riding through the woods on t'other side of the river and didn't have no weapon with him which was blame' foolishness and in a lonesome place he hears a horse acoming behind him and sees old baldy shepherdson alinkin' after him with his gun in his hand and his white hair aflying in the wind and 'stead of jumping off and taking to the brush bud 'lowed he could outrun him so they had it nip and tuck for five mile or more the old man againing all the time so at last bud seen it warn't any use so he stopped and faced around so as to have the bullet holes in front you know and the old man he rode up and shot him down
but he didn't git much chance to enjoy his luck for inside of a week our folks laid him out i reckon that old man was a coward buck i reckon he warn't a coward
not by a blame' sight
there ain't a coward amongst them shepherdsonsnot a one
and there ain't no cowards amongst the grangerfords either
why that old man kep' up his end in a fight one day for half an hour against three grangerfords and come out winner
they was all ahorseback he lit off of his horse and got behind a little woodpile and kep' his horse before him to stop the bullets but the grangerfords stayed on their horses and capered around the old man and peppered away at him and he peppered away at them
him and his horse both went home pretty leaky and crippled but the grangerfords had to be fetched homeand one of 'em was dead and another died the next day
no sir if a body's out hunting for cowards he don't want to fool away any time amongst them shepherdsons becuz they don't breed any of that kind next sunday we all went to church about three mile everybody ahorseback
the men took their guns along so did buck and kept them between their knees or stood them handy against the wall
the shepherdsons done the same
it was pretty ornery preachingall about brotherly love and suchlike tiresomeness but everybody said it was a good sermon and they all talked it over going home and had such a powerful lot to say about faith and good works and free grace and preforeordestination and i don't know what all that it did seem to me to be one of the roughest sundays i had run across yet
about an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around some in their chairs and some in their rooms and it got to be pretty dull
buck and a dog was stretched out on the grass in the sun sound asleep
i went up to our room and judged i would take a nap myself
i found that sweet miss sophia standing in her door which was next to ours and she took me in her room and shut the door very soft and asked me if i liked her and i said i did and she asked me if i would do something for her and not tell anybody and i said i would
then she said she'd forgot her testament and left it in the seat at church between two other books and would i slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her and not say nothing to nobody
i said i would
so i slid out and slipped off up the road and there warn't anybody at the church except maybe a hog or two for there warn't any lock on the door and hogs likes a puncheon floor in summertime because it's cool
if you notice most folks don't go to church only when they've got to but a hog is different
says i to myself something's up it ain't natural for a girl to be in such a sweat about a testament
so i give it a shake and out drops a little piece of paper with halfpast two wrote on it with a pencil
i ransacked it but couldn't find anything else
i couldn't make anything out of that so i put the paper in the book again and when i got home and upstairs there was miss sophia in her door waiting for me
she pulled me in and shut the door then she looked in the testament till she found the paper and as soon as she read it she looked glad and before a body could think she grabbed me and give me a squeeze and said i was the best boy in the world and not to tell anybody
she was mighty red in the face for a minute and her eyes lighted up and it made her powerful pretty
i was a good deal astonished but when i got my breath i asked her what the paper was about and she asked me if i had read it and i said no and she asked me if i could read writing and i told her no only coarsehand and then she said the paper warn't anything but a bookmark to keep her place and i might go and play now
i went off down to the river studying over this thing and pretty soon i noticed that my nigger was following along behind
when we was out of sight of the house he looked back and around a second and then comes arunning and says mars jawge if you'll come down into de swamp i'll show you a whole stack o' watermoccasins thinks i that's mighty curious he said that yesterday
he oughter know a body don't love watermoccasins enough to go around hunting for them
what is he up to anyway
so i says all right trot ahead i followed a half a mile then he struck out over the swamp and waded ankle deep as much as another halfmile
we come to a little flat piece of land which was dry and very thick with trees and bushes and vines and he says you shove right in dah jist a few steps mars jawge dah's whah dey is
i's seed 'm befo' i don't k'yer to see 'em no mo' then he slopped right along and went away and pretty soon the trees hid him
i poked into the place aways and come to a little open patch as big as a bedroom all hung around with vines and found a man laying there asleepand by jings it was my old jim
i waked him up and i reckoned it was going to be a grand surprise to him to see me again but it warn't
he nearly cried he was so glad but he warn't surprised
said he swum along behind me that night and heard me yell every time but dasn't answer because he didn't want nobody to pick him up and take him into slavery again
says he i got hurt a little en couldn't swim fas' so i wuz a considable ways behine you towards de las' when you landed i reck'ned i could ketch up wid you on de lan' 'dout havin' to shout at you but when i see dat house i begin to go slow

dat jack's a good nigger en pooty smart yes he is
he ain't ever told me you was here told me to come and he'd show me a lot of watermoccasins
if anything happens he ain't mixed up in it
he can say he never seen us together and it 'll be the truth i don't want to talk much about the next day
i reckon i'll cut it pretty short
i waked up about dawn and was agoing to turn over and go to sleep again when i noticed how still it wasdidn't seem to be anybody stirring
that warn't usual
next i noticed that buck was up and gone
well i gets up awondering and goes down stairsnobody around everything as still as a mouse
just the same outside
thinks i what does it mean
down by the woodpile i comes across my jack and says what's it all about says he don't you know mars jawge no says i i don't well den miss sophia's run off

mars buck he loaded up his gun en 'lowed he's gwyne to fetch home a shepherdson or bust
well dey'll be plenty un 'm dah i reck'n en you bet you he'll fetch one ef he gits a chanst i took up the river road as hard as i could put
by and by i begin to hear guns a good ways off
when i come in sight of the log store and the woodpile where the steamboats lands i worked along under the trees and brush till i got to a good place and then i clumb up into the forks of a cottonwood that was out of reach and watched
there was a woodrank four foot high a little ways in front of the tree and first i was going to hide behind that but maybe it was luckier i didn't
there was four or five men cavorting around on their horses in the open place before the log store cussing and yelling and trying to get at a couple of young chaps that was behind the woodrank alongside of the steamboat landing but they couldn't come it
every time one of them showed himself on the river side of the woodpile he got shot at
the two boys was squatting back to back behind the pile so they could watch both ways
by and by the men stopped cavorting around and yelling
they started riding towards the store then up gets one of the boys draws a steady bead over the woodrank and drops one of them out of his saddle
all the men jumped off of their horses and grabbed the hurt one and started to carry him to the store and that minute the two boys started on the run
they got half way to the tree i was in before the men noticed
then the men see them and jumped on their horses and took out after them
they gained on the boys but it didn't do no good the boys had too good a start they got to the woodpile that was in front of my tree and slipped in behind it and so they had the bulge on the men again
one of the boys was buck and the other was a slim young chap about nineteen years old
the men ripped around awhile and then rode away
as soon as they was out of sight i sung out to buck and told him
he didn't know what to make of my voice coming out of the tree at first
he was awful surprised
he told me to watch out sharp and let him know when the men come in sight again said they was up to some devilment or otherwouldn't be gone long
i wished i was out of that tree but i dasn't come down
buck begun to cry and rip and 'lowed that him and his cousin joe that was the other young chap would make up for this day yet
he said his father and his two brothers was killed and two or three of the enemy
said the shepherdsons laid for them in ambush
buck said his father and brothers ought to waited for their relationsthe shepherdsons was too strong for them
i asked him what was become of young harney and miss sophia
he said they'd got across the river and was safe
i was glad of that but the way buck did take on because he didn't manage to kill harney that day he shot at himi hain't ever heard anything like it
all of a sudden bang
bang
bang
goes three or four gunsthe men had slipped around through the woods and come in from behind without their horses
the boys jumped for the riverboth of them hurtand as they swum down the current the men run along the bank shooting at them and singing out kill them kill them it made me so sick i most fell out of the tree
i ain't agoing to tell all that happenedit would make me sick again if i was to do that
i wished i hadn't ever come ashore that night to see such things
i ain't ever going to get shut of themlots of times i dream about them
i stayed in the tree till it begun to get dark afraid to come down
sometimes i heard guns away off in the woods and twice i seen little gangs of men gallop past the log store with guns so i reckoned the trouble was still agoing on
i was mighty downhearted so i made up my mind i wouldn't ever go anear that house again because i reckoned i was to blame somehow
i judged that that piece of paper meant that miss sophia was to meet harney somewheres at halfpast two and run off and i judged i ought to told her father about that paper and the curious way she acted and then maybe he would a locked her up and this awful mess wouldn't ever happened
when i got down out of the tree i crept along down the river bank a piece and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the water and tugged at them till i got them ashore then i covered up their faces and got away as quick as i could
i cried a little when i was covering up buck's face for he was mighty good to me
it was just dark now
i never went near the house but struck through the woods and made for the swamp
jim warn't on his island so i tramped off in a hurry for the crick and crowded through the willows redhot to jump aboard and get out of that awful country
the raft was gone
my souls but i was scared
i couldn't get my breath for most a minute
then i raised a yell
a voice not twentyfive foot from me says good lan'
is dat you honey
doan' make no noise it was jim's voicenothing ever sounded so good before
i run along the bank a piece and got aboard and jim he grabbed me and hugged me he was so glad to see me
he says laws bless you chile i 'uz right down sho' you's dead agin
jack's been heah he say he reck'n you's ben shot kase you didn' come home no mo' so i's jes' dis minute a startin' de raf' down towards de mouf er de crick so's to be all ready for to shove out en leave soon as jack comes agin en tells me for certain you is dead
lawsy i's mighty glad to git you back again honey i says all rightthat's mighty good they won't find me and they'll think i've been killed and floated down the riverthere's something up there that 'll help them think soso don't you lose no time jim but just shove off for the big water as fast as ever you can i never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out in the middle of the mississippi
then we hung up our signal lantern and judged that we was free and safe once more
i hadn't had a bite to eat since yesterday so jim he got out some corndodgers and buttermilk and pork and cabbage and greensthere ain't nothing in the world so good when it's cooked rightand whilst i eat my supper we talked and had a good time
i was powerful glad to get away from the feuds and so was jim to get away from the swamp
we said there warn't no home like a raft after all
other places do seem so cramped up and smothery but a raft don't
you feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft
two or three days and nights went by i reckon i might say they swum by they slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely
here is the way we put in the time
it was a monstrous big river down theresometimes a mile and a half wide we run nights and laid up and hid daytimes soon as night was most gone we stopped navigating and tied upnearly always in the dead water under a towhead and then cut young cottonwoods and willows and hid the raft with them
then we set out the lines
next we slid into the river and had a swim so as to freshen up and cool off then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water was about knee deep and watched the daylight come
not a sound anywheresperfectly stilljust like the whole world was asleep only sometimes the bullfrogs acluttering maybe
the first thing to see looking away over the water was a kind of dull linethat was the woods on t'other side you couldn't make nothing else out then a pale place in the sky then more paleness spreading around then the river softened up away off and warn't black any more but gray you could see little dark spots drifting along ever so far awaytrading scows and such things and long black streaksrafts sometimes you could hear a sweep screaking or jumbled up voices it was so still and sounds come so far and by and by you could see a streak on the water which you know by the look of the streak that there's a snag there in a swift current which breaks on it and makes that streak look that way and you see the mist curl up off of the water and the east reddens up and the river and you make out a logcabin in the edge of the woods away on the bank on t'other side of the river being a woodyard likely and piled by them cheats so you can throw a dog through it anywheres then the nice breeze springs up and comes fanning you from over there so cool and fresh and sweet to smell on account of the woods and the flowers but sometimes not that way because they've left dead fish laying around gars and such and they do get pretty rank and next you've got the full day and everything smiling in the sun and the songbirds just going it
a little smoke couldn't be noticed now so we would take some fish off of the lines and cook up a hot breakfast
and afterwards we would watch the lonesomeness of the river and kind of lazy along and by and by lazy off to sleep
wake up by and by and look to see what done it and maybe see a steamboat coughing along upstream so far off towards the other side you couldn't tell nothing about her only whether she was a sternwheel or sidewheel then for about an hour there wouldn't be nothing to hear nor nothing to seejust solid lonesomeness
next you'd see a raft sliding by away off yonder and maybe a galoot on it chopping because they're most always doing it on a raft you'd see the axe flash and come downyou don't hear nothing you see that axe go up again and by the time it's above the man's head then you hear the k'chunkit had took all that time to come over the water
so we would put in the day lazying around listening to the stillness
once there was a thick fog and the rafts and things that went by was beating tin pans so the steamboats wouldn't run over them
a scow or a raft went by so close we could hear them talking and cussing and laughingheard them plain but we couldn't see no sign of them it made you feel crawly it was like spirits carrying on that way in the air
jim said he believed it was spirits but i says no spirits wouldn't say 'dern the dern fog
' soon as it was night out we shoved when we got her out to about the middle we let her alone and let her float wherever the current wanted her to then we lit the pipes and dangled our legs in the water and talked about all kinds of thingswe was always naked day and night whenever the mosquitoes would let usthe new clothes buck's folks made for me was too good to be comfortable and besides i didn't go much on clothes nohow
sometimes we'd have that whole river all to ourselves for the longest time
yonder was the banks and the islands across the water and maybe a sparkwhich was a candle in a cabin window and sometimes on the water you could see a spark or twoon a raft or a scow you know and maybe you could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of them crafts
it's lovely to live on a raft
we had the sky up there all speckled with stars and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them and discuss about whether they was made or only just happened
jim he allowed they was made but i allowed they happened i judged it would have took too long to make so many
jim said the moon could a laid them well that looked kind of reasonable so i didn't say nothing against it because i've seen a frog lay most as many so of course it could be done
we used to watch the stars that fell too and see them streak down
jim allowed they'd got spoiled and was hove out of the nest
once or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in the dark and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up out of her chimbleys and they would rain down in the river and look awful pretty then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink out and her powwow shut off and leave the river still again and by and by her waves would get to us a long time after she was gone and joggle the raft a bit and after that you wouldn't hear nothing for you couldn't tell how long except maybe frogs or something
after midnight the people on shore went to bed and then for two or three hours the shores was blackno more sparks in the cabin windows
these sparks was our clockthe first one that showed again meant morning was coming so we hunted a place to hide and tie up right away
one morning about daybreak i found a canoe and crossed over a chute to the main shoreit was only two hundred yardsand paddled about a mile up a crick amongst the cypress woods to see if i couldn't get some berries
just as i was passing a place where a kind of a cowpath crossed the crick here comes a couple of men tearing up the path as tight as they could foot it
i thought i was a goner for whenever anybody was after anybody i judged it was meor maybe jim
i was about to dig out from there in a hurry but they was pretty close to me then and sung out and begged me to save their livessaid they hadn't been doing nothing and was being chased for itsaid there was men and dogs acoming
they wanted to jump right in but i says don't you do it
i don't hear the dogs and horses yet you've got time to crowd through the brush and get up the crick a little ways then you take to the water and wade down to me and get inthat'll throw the dogs off the scent they done it and soon as they was aboard i lit out for our towhead and in about five or ten minutes we heard the dogs and the men away off shouting
we heard them come along towards the crick but couldn't see them they seemed to stop and fool around a while then as we got further and further away all the time we couldn't hardly hear them at all by the time we had left a mile of woods behind us and struck the river everything was quiet and we paddled over to the towhead and hid in the cottonwoods and was safe
one of these fellows was about seventy or upwards and had a bald head and very gray whiskers
he had an old batteredup slouch hat on and a greasy blue woollen shirt and ragged old blue jeans britches stuffed into his boottops and homeknit gallusesno he only had one
he had an old longtailed blue jeans coat with slick brass buttons flung over his arm and both of them had big fat rattylooking carpetbags
the other fellow was about thirty and dressed about as ornery
after breakfast we all laid off and talked and the first thing that come out was that these chaps didn't know one another
what got you into trouble says the baldhead to t'other chap
well i'd been selling an article to take the tartar off the teethand it does take it off too and generly the enamel along with itbut i stayed about one night longer than i ought to and was just in the act of sliding out when i ran across you on the trail this side of town and you told me they were coming and begged me to help you to get off
so i told you i was expecting trouble myself and would scatter out with you
that's the whole yarnwhat's yourn
well i'd ben arunning' a little temperance revival thar 'bout a week and was the pet of the women folks big and little for i was makin' it mighty warm for the rummies i tell you and takin' as much as five or six dollars a nightten cents a head children and niggers freeand business agrowin' all the time when somehow or another a little report got around last night that i had a way of puttin' in my time with a private jug on the sly
a nigger rousted me out this mornin' and told me the people was getherin' on the quiet with their dogs and horses and they'd be along pretty soon and give me 'bout half an hour's start and then run me down if they could and if they got me they'd tar and feather me and ride me on a rail sure
i didn't wait for no breakfasti warn't hungry old man said the young one i reckon we might doubleteam it together what do you think i ain't undisposed

preachin's my line too and workin' campmeetin's and missionaryin' around nobody never said anything for a while then the young man hove a sigh and says alas what 're you alassin' about says the baldhead
to think i should have lived to be leading such a life and be degraded down into such company and he begun to wipe the corner of his eye with a rag
dern your skin ain't the company good enough for you says the baldhead pretty pert and uppish
yes it is good enough for me it's as good as i deserve for who fetched me so low when i was so high
i did myself
i don't blame you gentlemenfar from it i don't blame anybody
i deserve it all
let the cold world do its worst one thing i knowthere's a grave somewhere for me

some day i'll lie down in it and forget it all and my poor broken heart will be at rest he went on awiping

do you mean to say gentlemen says the young man very solemn i will reveal it to you for i feel i may have confidence in you
by rights i am a duke jim's eyes bugged out when he heard that and i reckon mine did too
then the baldhead says no
you can't mean it yes
my greatgrandfather eldest son of the duke of bridgewater fled to this country about the end of the last century to breathe the pure air of freedom married here and died leaving a son his own father dying about the same time
the second son of the late duke seized the titles and estatesthe infant real duke was ignored
i am the lineal descendant of that infanti am the rightful duke of bridgewater and here am i forlorn torn from my high estate hunted of men despised by the cold world ragged worn heartbroken and degraded to the companionship of felons on a raft jim pitied him ever so much and so did i
we tried to comfort him but he said it warn't much use he couldn't be much comforted said if we was a mind to acknowledge him that would do him more good than most anything else so we said we would if he would tell us how
he said we ought to bow when we spoke to him and say your grace or my lord or your lordshipand he wouldn't mind it if we called him plain bridgewater which he said was a title anyway and not a name and one of us ought to wait on him at dinner and do any little thing for him he wanted done
well that was all easy so we done it
all through dinner jim stood around and waited on him and says will yo' grace have some o' dis or some o' dat and so on and a body could see it was mighty pleasing to him
but the old man got pretty silent by and bydidn't have much to say and didn't look pretty comfortable over all that petting that was going on around that duke
he seemed to have something on his mind
so along in the afternoon he says looky here bilgewater he says i'm nation sorry for you but you ain't the only person that's had troubles like that no no you ain't
you ain't the only person that's ben snaked down wrongfully out'n a high place alas no you ain't the only person that's had a secret of his birth and by jings he begins to cry
hold
what do you mean bilgewater kin i trust you says the old man still sort of sobbing
to the bitter death he took the old man by the hand and squeezed it and says that secret of your being speak bilgewater i am the late dauphin you bet you jim and me stared this time
then the duke says you are what yes my friend it is too trueyour eyes is lookin' at this very moment on the pore disappeared dauphin looy the seventeen son of looy the sixteen and marry antonette you
at your age
no
you mean you're the late charlemagne you must be six or seven hundred years old at the very least trouble has done it bilgewater trouble has done it trouble has brung these gray hairs and this premature balditude
yes gentlemen you see before you in blue jeans and misery the wanderin' exiled trampledon and sufferin' rightful king of france well he cried and took on so that me and jim didn't know hardly what to do we was so sorryand so glad and proud we'd got him with us too
so we set in like we done before with the duke and tried to comfort him
but he said it warn't no use nothing but to be dead and done with it all could do him any good though he said it often made him feel easier and better for a while if people treated him according to his rights and got down on one knee to speak to him and always called him your majesty and waited on him first at meals and didn't set down in his presence till he asked them
so jim and me set to majestying him and doing this and that and t'other for him and standing up till he told us we might set down
this done him heaps of good and so he got cheerful and comfortable
but the duke kind of soured on him and didn't look a bit satisfied with the way things was going still the king acted real friendly towards him and said the duke's greatgrandfather and all the other dukes of bilgewater was a good deal thought of by his father and was allowed to come to the palace considerable but the duke stayed huffy a good while till by and by the king says like as not we got to be together a blamed long time on this hyer raft bilgewater and so what's the use o' your bein' sour
it 'll only make things oncomfortable
it ain't my fault i warn't born a duke it ain't your fault you warn't born a kingso what's the use to worry
make the best o' things the way you find 'em says ithat's my motto
this ain't no bad thing that we've struck hereplenty grub and an easy lifecome give us your hand duke and le's all be friends the duke done it and jim and me was pretty glad to see it
it took away all the uncomfortableness and we felt mighty good over it because it would a been a miserable business to have any unfriendliness on the raft for what you want above all things on a raft is for everybody to be satisfied and feel right and kind towards the others
it didn't take me long to make up my mind that these liars warn't no kings nor dukes at all but just lowdown humbugs and frauds
but i never said nothing never let on kept it to myself it's the best way then you don't have no quarrels and don't get into no trouble
if they wanted us to call them kings and dukes i hadn't no objections 'long as it would keep peace in the family and it warn't no use to tell jim so i didn't tell him
if i never learnt nothing else out of pap i learnt that the best way to get along with his kind of people is to let them have their own way
they asked us considerable many questions wanted to know what we covered up the raft that way for and laid by in the daytime instead of runningwas jim a runaway nigger
says i goodness sakes
would a runaway nigger run south no they allowed he wouldn't
i had to account for things some way so i says my folks was living in pike county in missouri where i was born and they all died off but me and pa and my brother ike
pa he 'lowed he'd break up and go down and live with uncle ben who's got a little onehorse place on the river fortyfour mile below orleans
pa was pretty poor and had some debts so when he'd squared up there warn't nothing left but sixteen dollars and our nigger jim
that warn't enough to take us fourteen hundred mile deck passage nor no other way
well when the river rose pa had a streak of luck one day he ketched this piece of a raft so we reckoned we'd go down to orleans on it
pa's luck didn't hold out a steamboat run over the forrard corner of the raft one night and we all went overboard and dove under the wheel jim and me come up all right but pa was drunk and ike was only four years old so they never come up no more
well for the next day or two we had considerable trouble because people was always coming out in skiffs and trying to take jim away from me saying they believed he was a runaway nigger
we don't run daytimes no more now nights they don't bother us the duke says leave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the daytime if we want to
i'll think the thing overi'll invent a plan that'll fix it
we'll let it alone for today because of course we don't want to go by that town yonder in daylightit mightn't be healthy towards night it begun to darken up and look like rain the heat lightning was squirting around low down in the sky and the leaves was beginning to shiverit was going to be pretty ugly it was easy to see that
so the duke and the king went to overhauling our wigwam to see what the beds was like
my bed was a straw tick better than jim's which was a cornshuck tick there's always cobs around about in a shuck tick and they poke into you and hurt and when you roll over the dry shucks sound like you was rolling over in a pile of dead leaves it makes such a rustling that you wake up
well the duke allowed he would take my bed but the king allowed he wouldn't
he says i should a reckoned the difference in rank would a sejested to you that a cornshuck bed warn't just fitten for me to sleep on
your grace 'll take the shuck bed yourself jim and me was in a sweat again for a minute being afraid there was going to be some more trouble amongst them so we was pretty glad when the duke says 'tis my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron heel of oppression
misfortune has broken my once haughty spirit i yield i submit 'tis my fate
i am alone in the worldlet me suffer can bear it we got away as soon as it was good and dark
the king told us to stand well out towards the middle of the river and not show a light till we got a long ways below the town
we come in sight of the little bunch of lights by and bythat was the town you knowand slid by about a half a mile out all right
when we was threequarters of a mile below we hoisted up our signal lantern and about ten o'clock it come on to rain and blow and thunder and lighten like everything so the king told us to both stay on watch till the weather got better then him and the duke crawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night
it was my watch below till twelve but i wouldn't a turned in anyway if i'd had a bed because a body don't see such a storm as that every day in the week not by a long sight
my souls how the wind did scream along
and every second or two there'd come a glare that lit up the whitecaps for a half a mile around and you'd see the islands looking dusty through the rain and the trees thrashing around in the wind then comes a hwhackbum
bum
bumbleumbleumbumbumbumbumand the thunder would go rumbling and grumbling away and quitand then rip comes another flash and another sockdolager
the waves most washed me off the raft sometimes but i hadn't any clothes on and didn't mind
we didn't have no trouble about snags the lightning was glaring and flittering around so constant that we could see them plenty soon enough to throw her head this way or that and miss them
i had the middle watch you know but i was pretty sleepy by that time so jim he said he would stand the first half of it for me he was always mighty good that way jim was
i crawled into the wigwam but the king and the duke had their legs sprawled around so there warn't no show for me so i laid outsidei didn't mind the rain because it was warm and the waves warn't running so high now
about two they come up again though and jim was going to call me but he changed his mind because he reckoned they warn't high enough yet to do any harm but he was mistaken about that for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes a regular ripper and washed me overboard
it most killed jim alaughing
he was the easiest nigger to laugh that ever was anyway
i took the watch and jim he laid down and snored away and by and by the storm let up for good and all and the first cabinlight that showed i rousted him out and we slid the raft into hiding quarters for the day
the king got out an old ratty deck of cards after breakfast and him and the duke played sevenup a while five cents a game
then they got tired of it and allowed they would lay out a campaign as they called it
the duke went down into his carpetbag and fetched up a lot of little printed bills and read them out loud
one bill said the celebrated dr armand de montalban of paris would lecture on the science of phrenology at such and such a place on the blank day of blank at ten cents admission and furnish charts of character at twentyfive cents apiece the duke said that was him
in another bill he was the worldrenowned shakespearian tragedian garrick the younger of drury lane london in other bills he had a lot of other names and done other wonderful things like finding water and gold with a diviningrod dissipating witch spells and so on
by and by he says but the histrionic muse is the darling
have you ever trod the boards royalty no says the king
you shall then before you're three days older fallen grandeur says the duke
the first good town we come to we'll hire a hall and do the sword fight in richard iii
and the balcony scene in romeo and juliet
how does that strike you i'm in up to the hub for anything that will pay bilgewater but you see i don't know nothing about playactin' and hain't ever seen much of it
i was too small when pap used to have 'em at the palace
do you reckon you can learn me easy all right
i'm jist afreezn' for something fresh anyway
le's commence right away so the duke he told him all about who romeo was and who juliet was and said he was used to being romeo so the king could be juliet
but if juliet's such a young gal duke my peeled head and my white whiskers is goin' to look oncommon odd on her maybe no don't you worry these country jakes won't ever think of that
besides you know you'll be in costume and that makes all the difference in the world juliet's in a balcony enjoying the moonlight before she goes to bed and she's got on her nightgown and her ruffled nightcap
here are the costumes for the parts he got out two or three curtaincalico suits which he said was meedyevil armor for richard iii
and t'other chap and a long white cotton nightshirt and a ruffled nightcap to match
the king was satisfied so the duke got out his book and read the parts over in the most splendid spreadeagle way prancing around and acting at the same time to show how it had got to be done then he give the book to the king and told him to get his part by heart
there was a little onehorse town about three mile down the bend and after dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea about how to run in daylight without it being dangersome for jim so he allowed he would go down to the town and fix that thing
the king allowed he would go too and see if he couldn't strike something
we was out of coffee so jim said i better go along with them in the canoe and get some
when we got there there warn't nobody stirring streets empty and perfectly dead and still like sunday
we found a sick nigger sunning himself in a back yard and he said everybody that warn't too young or too sick or too old was gone to campmeeting about two mile back in the woods
the king got the directions and allowed he'd go and work that campmeeting for all it was worth and i might go too
the duke said what he was after was a printingoffice
we found it a little bit of a concern up over a carpenter shopcarpenters and printers all gone to the meeting and no doors locked
it was a dirty litteredup place and had ink marks and handbills with pictures of horses and runaway niggers on them all over the walls
the duke shed his coat and said he was all right now
so me and the king lit out for the campmeeting
we got there in about a half an hour fairly dripping for it was a most awful hot day
there was as much as a thousand people there from twenty mile around
the woods was full of teams and wagons hitched everywheres feeding out of the wagontroughs and stomping to keep off the flies
there was sheds made out of poles and roofed over with branches where they had lemonade and gingerbread to sell and piles of watermelons and green corn and suchlike truck
the preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds only they was bigger and held crowds of people
the benches was made out of outside slabs of logs with holes bored in the round side to drive sticks into for legs
they didn't have no backs
the preachers had high platforms to stand on at one end of the sheds
the women had on sunbonnets and some had linseywoolsey frocks some gingham ones and a few of the young ones had on calico
some of the young men was barefooted and some of the children didn't have on any clothes but just a towlinen shirt
some of the old women was knitting and some of the young folks was courting on the sly
the first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn
he lined out two lines everybody sung it and it was kind of grand to hear it there was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way then he lined out two more for them to singand so on
the people woke up more and more and sung louder and louder and towards the end some begun to groan and some begun to shout
then the preacher begun to preach and begun in earnest too and went weaving first to one side of the platform and then the other and then aleaning down over the front of it with his arms and his body going all the time and shouting his words out with all his might and every now and then he would hold up his bible and spread it open and kind of pass it around this way and that shouting it's the brazen serpent in the wilderness
look upon it and live and people would shout out gloryaamen and so he went on and the people groaning and crying and saying amen oh come to the mourners' bench
come black with sin
amen
come sick and sore
amen
come lame and halt and blind
amen
come pore and needy sunk in shame
aamen
come all that's worn and soiled and sufferingcome with a broken spirit
come with a contrite heart
come in your rags and sin and dirt
the waters that cleanse is free the door of heaven stands openoh enter in and be at rest aamen
glory glory hallelujah and so on
you couldn't make out what the preacher said any more on account of the shouting and crying
folks got up everywheres in the crowd and worked their way just by main strength to the mourners' bench with the tears running down their faces and when all the mourners had got up there to the front benches in a crowd they sung and shouted and flung themselves down on the straw just crazy and wild
well the first i knowed the king got agoing and you could hear him over everybody and next he went acharging up on to the platform and the preacher he begged him to speak to the people and he done it
he told them he was a piratebeen a pirate for thirty years out in the indian oceanand his crew was thinned out considerable last spring in a fight and he was home now to take out some fresh men and thanks to goodness he'd been robbed last night and put ashore off of a steamboat without a cent and he was glad of it it was the blessedest thing that ever happened to him because he was a changed man now and happy for the first time in his life and poor as he was he was going to start right off and work his way back to the indian ocean and put in the rest of his life trying to turn the pirates into the true path for he could do it better than anybody else being acquainted with all pirate crews in that ocean and though it would take him a long time to get there without money he would get there anyway and every time he convinced a pirate he would say to him don't you thank me don't you give me no credit it all belongs to them dear people in pokeville campmeeting natural brothers and benefactors of the race and that dear preacher there the truest friend a pirate ever had and then he busted into tears and so did everybody
then somebody sings out take up a collection for him take up a collection well a half a dozen made a jump to do it but somebody sings out let him pass the hat around then everybody said it the preacher too
so the king went all through the crowd with his hat swabbing his eyes and blessing the people and praising them and thanking them for being so good to the poor pirates away off there and every little while the prettiest kind of girls with the tears running down their cheeks would up and ask him would he let them kiss him for to remember him by and he always done it and some of them he hugged and kissed as many as five or six timesand he was invited to stay a week and everybody wanted him to live in their houses and said they'd think it was an honor but he said as this was the last day of the campmeeting he couldn't do no good and besides he was in a sweat to get to the indian ocean right off and go to work on the pirates
when we got back to the raft and he come to count up he found he had collected eightyseven dollars and seventyfive cents
and then he had fetched away a threegallon jug of whisky too that he found under a wagon when he was starting home through the woods
the king said take it all around it laid over any day he'd ever put in in the missionarying line
he said it warn't no use talking heathens don't amount to shucks alongside of pirates to work a campmeeting with
the duke was thinking he'd been doing pretty well till the king come to show up but after that he didn't think so so much
he had set up and printed off two little jobs for farmers in that printingofficehorse billsand took the money four dollars
and he had got in ten dollars' worth of advertisements for the paper which he said he would put in for four dollars if they would pay in advanceso they done it
the price of the paper was two dollars a year but he took in three subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on condition of them paying him in advance they were going to pay in cordwood and onions as usual but he said he had just bought the concern and knocked down the price as low as he could afford it and was going to run it for cash
he set up a little piece of poetry which he made himself out of his own headthree verseskind of sweet and saddishthe name of it was yes crush cold world this breaking heartand he left that all set up and ready to print in the paper and didn't charge nothing for it
well he took in nine dollars and a half and said he'd done a pretty square day's work for it
then he showed us another little job he'd printed and hadn't charged for because it was for us
it had a picture of a runaway nigger with a bundle on a stick over his shoulder and reward under it
the reading was all about jim and just described him to a dot
it said he run away from st jacques' plantation forty mile below new orleans last winter and likely went north and whoever would catch him and send him back he could have the reward and expenses
now says the duke after tonight we can run in the daytime if we want to
whenever we see anybody coming we can tie jim hand and foot with a rope and lay him in the wigwam and show this handbill and say we captured him up the river and were too poor to travel on a steamboat so we got this little raft on credit from our friends and are going down to get the reward
handcuffs and chains would look still better on jim but it wouldn't go well with the story of us being so poor
too much like jewelry
ropes are the correct thingwe must preserve the unities as we say on the boards we all said the duke was pretty smart and there couldn't be no trouble about running daytimes
we judged we could make miles enough that night to get out of the reach of the powwow we reckoned the duke's work in the printing office was going to make in that little town then we could boom right along if we wanted to
we laid low and kept still and never shoved out till nearly ten o'clock then we slid by pretty wide away from the town and didn't hoist our lantern till we was clear out of sight of it
when jim called me to take the watch at four in the morning he says huck does you reck'n we gwyne to run acrost any mo' kings on dis trip no i says i reckon not well says he dat's all right den
i doan' mine one er two kings but dat's enough
dis one's powerful drunk en de duke ain' much better i found jim had been trying to get him to talk french so he could hear what it was like but he said he had been in this country so long and had so much trouble he'd forgot it
it was after sunup now but we went right on and didn't tie up
the king and the duke turned out by and by looking pretty rusty but after they'd jumped overboard and took a swim it chippered them up a good deal
after breakfast the king he took a seat on the corner of the raft and pulled off his boots and rolled up his britches and let his legs dangle in the water so as to be comfortable and lit his pipe and went to getting his romeo and juliet by heart
when he had got it pretty good him and the duke begun to practice it together
the duke had to learn him over and over again how to say every speech and he made him sigh and put his hand on his heart and after a while he said he done it pretty well only he says you mustn't bellow out romeo
that way like a bullyou must say it soft and sick and languishy soroomeo
that is the idea for juliet's a dear sweet mere child of a girl you know and she doesn't bray like a jackass well next they got out a couple of long swords that the duke made out of oak laths and begun to practice the sword fightthe duke called himself richard iii
and the way they laid on and pranced around the raft was grand to see
but by and by the king tripped and fell overboard and after that they took a rest and had a talk about all kinds of adventures they'd had in other times along the river
after dinner the duke says well capet we'll want to make this a firstclass show you know so i guess we'll add a little more to it
we want a little something to answer encores with anyway what's onkores bilgewater the duke told him and then says i'll answer by doing the highland fling or the sailor's hornpipe and youwell let me seeoh i've got ityou can do hamlet's soliloquy hamlet's which hamlet's soliloquy you know the most celebrated thing in shakespeare
ah it's sublime sublime
always fetches the house
i haven't got it in the booki've only got one volumebut i reckon i can piece it out from memory
i'll just walk up and down a minute and see if i can call it back from recollection's vaults so he went to marching up and down thinking and frowning horrible every now and then then he would hoist up his eyebrows next he would squeeze his hand on his forehead and stagger back and kind of moan next he would sigh and next he'd let on to drop a tear
it was beautiful to see him
by and by he got it
he told us to give attention
then he strikes a most noble attitude with one leg shoved forwards and his arms stretched away up and his head tilted back looking up at the sky and then he begins to rip and rave and grit his teeth and after that all through his speech he howled and spread around and swelled up his chest and just knocked the spots out of any acting ever i see before
this is the speechi learned it easy enough while he was learning it to the king to be or not to be that is the bare bodkin that makes calamity of so long life for who would fardels bear till birnam wood do come to dunsinane but that the fear of something after death murders the innocent sleep great nature's second course and makes us rather sling the arrows of outrageous fortune than fly to others that we know not of
there's the respect must give us pause wake duncan with thy knocking
i would thou couldst for who would bear the whips and scorns of time the oppressor's wrong the proud man's contumely the law's delay and the quietus which his pangs might take
in the dead waste and middle of the night when churchyards yawn in customary suits of solemn black but that the undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns breathes forth contagion on the world and thus the native hue of resolution like the poor cat i' the adage is sicklied o'er with care
and all the clouds that lowered o'er our housetops with this regard their currents turn awry and lose the name of action
'tis a consummation devoutly to be wished
but soft you the fair ophelia ope not thy ponderous and marble jaws
but get thee to a nunnerymdashgo
well the old man he liked that speech and he mighty soon got it so he could do it first rate
it seemed like he was just born for it and when he had his hand in and was excited it was perfectly lovely the way he would rip and tear and rair up behind when he was getting it off
the first chance we got the duke he had some show bills printed and after that for two or three days as we floated along the raft was a most uncommon lively place for there warn't nothing but swordfighting and rehearsingas the duke called itgoing on all the time
one morning when we was pretty well down the state of arkansaw we come in sight of a little onehorse town in a big bend so we tied up about threequarters of a mile above it in the mouth of a crick which was shut in like a tunnel by the cypress trees and all of us but jim took the canoe and went down there to see if there was any chance in that place for our show
we struck it mighty lucky there was going to be a circus there that afternoon and the country people was already beginning to come in in all kinds of old shackly wagons and on horses
the circus would leave before night so our show would have a pretty good chance
the duke he hired the court house and we went around and stuck up our bills

then we went loafing around the town
the stores and houses was most all old shackly driedup frame concerns that hadn't ever been painted they was set up three or four foot above ground on stilts so as to be out of reach of the water when the river was overflowed
the houses had little gardens around them but they didn't seem to raise hardly anything in them but jimpson weeds and sunflowers and ashpiles and old curledup boots and shoes and pieces of bottles and rags and playedout tinware
the fences was made of different kinds of boards nailed on at different times and they leaned every whichway and had gates that didn't generly have but one hingea leather one
some of the fences had been whitewashed some time or another but the duke said it was in clumbus's time like enough
there was generly hogs in the garden and people driving them out
all the stores was along one street
they had white domestic awnings in front and the country people hitched their horses to the awningposts
there was empty drygoods boxes under the awnings and loafers roosting on them all day long whittling them with their barlow knives and chawing tobacco and gaping and yawning and stretchinga mighty ornery lot
they generly had on yellow straw hats most as wide as an umbrella but didn't wear no coats nor waistcoats they called one another bill and buck and hank and joe and andy and talked lazy and drawly and used considerable many cuss words
there was as many as one loafer leaning up against every awningpost and he most always had his hands in his britchespockets except when he fetched them out to lend a chaw of tobacco or scratch
what a body was hearing amongst them all the time was gimme a chaw 'v tobacker hank cain't i hain't got but one chaw left
ask bill maybe bill he gives him a chaw maybe he lies and says he ain't got none
some of them kinds of loafers never has a cent in the world nor a chaw of tobacco of their own
they get all their chawing by borrowing they say to a fellow i wisht you'd len' me a chaw jack i jist this minute give ben thompson the last chaw i hadwhich is a lie pretty much everytime it don't fool nobody but a stranger but jack ain't no stranger so he says you give him a chaw did you
so did your sister's cat's grandmother
you pay me back the chaws you've awready borry'd off'n me lafe buckner then i'll loan you one or two ton of it and won't charge you no back intrust nuther well i did pay you back some of it wunst yes you did'bout six chaws
you borry'd store tobacker and paid back niggerhead store tobacco is flat black plug but these fellows mostly chaws the natural leaf twisted
when they borrow a chaw they don't generly cut it off with a knife but set the plug in between their teeth and gnaw with their teeth and tug at the plug with their hands till they get it in two then sometimes the one that owns the tobacco looks mournful at it when it's handed back and says sarcastic here gimme the chaw and you take the plug all the streets and lanes was just mud they warn't nothing else but mudmud as black as tar and nigh about a foot deep in some places and two or three inches deep in all the places
the hogs loafed and grunted around everywheres
you'd see a muddy sow and a litter of pigs come lazying along the street and whollop herself right down in the way where folks had to walk around her and she'd stretch out and shut her eyes and wave her ears whilst the pigs was milking her and look as happy as if she was on salary
and pretty soon you'd hear a loafer sing out hi
so boy
sick him tige and away the sow would go squealing most horrible with a dog or two swinging to each ear and three or four dozen more acoming and then you would see all the loafers get up and watch the thing out of sight and laugh at the fun and look grateful for the noise
then they'd settle back again till there was a dog fight
there couldn't anything wake them up all over and make them happy all over like a dog fightunless it might be putting turpentine on a stray dog and setting fire to him or tying a tin pan to his tail and see him run himself to death
on the river front some of the houses was sticking out over the bank and they was bowed and bent and about ready to tumble in
the people had moved out of them
the bank was caved away under one corner of some others and that corner was hanging over
people lived in them yet but it was dangersome because sometimes a strip of land as wide as a house caves in at a time
sometimes a belt of land a quarter of a mile deep will start in and cave along and cave along till it all caves into the river in one summer
such a town as that has to be always moving back and back and back because the river's always gnawing at it
the nearer it got to noon that day the thicker and thicker was the wagons and horses in the streets and more coming all the time
families fetched their dinners with them from the country and eat them in the wagons
there was considerable whisky drinking going on and i seen three fights
by and by somebody sings out here comes old boggsin from the country for his little old monthly drunk here he comes boys all the loafers looked glad i reckoned they was used to having fun out of boggs
one of them says wonder who he's agwyne to chaw up this time
if he'd achawed up all the men he's ben agwyne to chaw up in the last twenty year he'd have considerable ruputation now another one says i wisht old boggs 'd threaten me 'cuz then i'd know i warn't gwyne to die for a thousan' year boggs comes atearing along on his horse whooping and yelling like an injun and singing out cler the track thar
i'm on the wawpath and the price uv coffins is agwyne to raise he was drunk and weaving about in his saddle he was over fifty year old and had a very red face
everybody yelled at him and laughed at him and sassed him and he sassed back and said he'd attend to them and lay them out in their regular turns but he couldn't wait now because he'd come to town to kill old colonel sherburn and his motto was meat first and spoon vittles to top off on he see me and rode up and says whar'd you come f'm boy
you prepared to die then he rode on
i was scared but a man says he don't mean nothing he's always acarryin' on like that when he's drunk
he's the best naturedest old fool in arkansawnever hurt nobody drunk nor sober boggs rode up before the biggest store in town and bent his head down so he could see under the curtain of the awning and yells come out here sherburn
come out and meet the man you've swindled
you're the houn' i'm after and i'm agwyne to have you too and so he went on calling sherburn everything he could lay his tongue to and the whole street packed with people listening and laughing and going on
by and by a proudlooking man about fiftyfiveand he was a heap the best dressed man in that town toosteps out of the store and the crowd drops back on each side to let him come
he says to boggs mighty ca'm and slowhe says i'm tired of this but i'll endure it till one o'clock
till one o'clock mindno longer
if you open your mouth against me only once after that time you can't travel so far but i will find you then he turns and goes in
the crowd looked mighty sober nobody stirred and there warn't no more laughing
boggs rode off blackguarding sherburn as loud as he could yell all down the street and pretty soon back he comes and stops before the store still keeping it up
some men crowded around him and tried to get him to shut up but he wouldn't they told him it would be one o'clock in about fifteen minutes and so he must go homehe must go right away
but it didn't do no good
he cussed away with all his might and throwed his hat down in the mud and rode over it and pretty soon away he went araging down the street again with his gray hair aflying
everybody that could get a chance at him tried their best to coax him off of his horse so they could lock him up and get him sober but it warn't no useup the street he would tear again and give sherburn another cussing
by and by somebody says go for his daughterquick go for his daughter sometimes he'll listen to her
if anybody can persuade him she can so somebody started on a run
i walked down street a ways and stopped
in about five or ten minutes here comes boggs again but not on his horse
he was areeling across the street towards me bareheaded with a friend on both sides of him aholt of his arms and hurrying him along
he was quiet and looked uneasy and he warn't hanging back any but was doing some of the hurrying himself
somebody sings out boggs i looked over there to see who said it and it was that colonel sherburn
he was standing perfectly still in the street and had a pistol raised in his right handnot aiming it but holding it out with the barrel tilted up towards the sky
the same second i see a young girl coming on the run and two men with her
boggs and the men turned round to see who called him and when they see the pistol the men jumped to one side and the pistolbarrel come down slow and steady to a levelboth barrels cocked
boggs throws up both of his hands and says o lord don't shoot bang
goes the first shot and he staggers back clawing at the airbang
goes the second one and he tumbles backwards on to the ground heavy and solid with his arms spread out
that young girl screamed out and comes rushing and down she throws herself on her father crying and saying oh he's killed him he's killed him the crowd closed up around them and shouldered and jammed one another with their necks stretched trying to see and people on the inside trying to shove them back and shouting back back
give him air give him air colonel sherburn he tossed his pistol on to the ground and turned around on his heels and walked off
they took boggs to a little drug store the crowd pressing around just the same and the whole town following and i rushed and got a good place at the window where i was close to him and could see in
they laid him on the floor and put one large bible under his head and opened another one and spread it on his breast but they tore open his shirt first and i seen where one of the bullets went in
he made about a dozen long gasps his breast lifting the bible up when he drawed in his breath and letting it down again when he breathed it outand after that he laid still he was dead
then they pulled his daughter away from him screaming and crying and took her off
she was about sixteen and very sweet and gentle looking but awful pale and scared
well pretty soon the whole town was there squirming and scrouging and pushing and shoving to get at the window and have a look but people that had the places wouldn't give them up and folks behind them was saying all the time say now you've looked enough you fellows 'tain't right and 'tain't fair for you to stay thar all the time and never give nobody a chance other folks has their rights as well as you there was considerable jawing back so i slid out thinking maybe there was going to be trouble
the streets was full and everybody was excited
everybody that seen the shooting was telling how it happened and there was a big crowd packed around each one of these fellows stretching their necks and listening
one long lanky man with long hair and a big white fur stovepipe hat on the back of his head and a crookedhandled cane marked out the places on the ground where boggs stood and where sherburn stood and the people following him around from one place to t'other and watching everything he done and bobbing their heads to show they understood and stooping a little and resting their hands on their thighs to watch him mark the places on the ground with his cane and then he stood up straight and stiff where sherburn had stood frowning and having his hatbrim down over his eyes and sung out boggs and then fetched his cane down slow to a level and says bang staggered backwards says bang again and fell down flat on his back
the people that had seen the thing said he done it perfect said it was just exactly the way it all happened
then as much as a dozen people got out their bottles and treated him
well by and by somebody said sherburn ought to be lynched
in about a minute everybody was saying it so away they went mad and yelling and snatching down every clothesline they come to to do the hanging with
they swarmed up towards sherburn's house awhooping and raging like injuns and everything had to clear the way or get run over and tromped to mush and it was awful to see
children was heeling it ahead of the mob screaming and trying to get out of the way and every window along the road was full of women's heads and there was nigger boys in every tree and bucks and wenches looking over every fence and as soon as the mob would get nearly to them they would break and skaddle back out of reach
lots of the women and girls was crying and taking on scared most to death
they swarmed up in front of sherburn's palings as thick as they could jam together and you couldn't hear yourself think for the noise
it was a little twentyfoot yard
some sung out tear down the fence
tear down the fence then there was a racket of ripping and tearing and smashing and down she goes and the front wall of the crowd begins to roll in like a wave
just then sherburn steps out on to the roof of his little front porch with a doublebarrel gun in his hand and takes his stand perfectly ca'm and deliberate not saying a word
the racket stopped and the wave sucked back
sherburn never said a wordjust stood there looking down
the stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable
sherburn run his eye slow along the crowd and wherever it struck the people tried a little to outgaze him but they couldn't they dropped their eyes and looked sneaky
then pretty soon sherburn sort of laughed not the pleasant kind but the kind that makes you feel like when you are eating bread that's got sand in it
then he says slow and scornful the idea of you lynching anybody
it's amusing
the idea of you thinking you had pluck enough to lynch a man
because you're brave enough to tar and feather poor friendless castout women that come along here did that make you think you had grit enough to lay your hands on a man
why a man's safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kindas long as it's daytime and you're not behind him
do i know you
i know you clear through
i was born and raised in the south and i've lived in the north so i know the average all around
the average man's a coward
in the north he lets anybody walk over him that wants to and goes home and prays for a humble spirit to bear it
in the south one man all by himself has stopped a stage full of men in the daytime and robbed the lot
your newspapers call you a brave people so much that you think you are braver than any other peoplewhereas you're just as brave and no braver
why don't your juries hang murderers
because they're afraid the man's friends will shoot them in the back in the darkand it's just what they would do
so they always acquit and then a man goes in the night with a hundred masked cowards at his back and lynches the rascal
your mistake is that you didn't bring a man with you that's one mistake and the other is that you didn't come in the dark and fetch your masks
you brought part of a manbuck harkness thereand if you hadn't had him to start you you'd a taken it out in blowing
you didn't want to come
the average man don't like trouble and danger
you don't like trouble and danger
but if only half a manlike buck harkness thereshouts 'lynch him
lynch him'
you're afraid to back downafraid you'll be found out to be what you arecowardsand so you raise a yell and hang yourselves on to that halfaman's coattail and come raging up here swearing what big things you're going to do
the pitifulest thing out is a mob that's what an army isa mob they don't fight with courage that's born in them but with courage that's borrowed from their mass and from their officers
but a mob without any man at the head of it is beneath pitifulness
now the thing for you to do is to droop your tails and go home and crawl in a hole
if any real lynching's going to be done it will be done in the dark southern fashion and when they come they'll bring their masks and fetch a man along
now leaveand take your halfaman with youtossing his gun up across his left arm and cocking it when he says this
the crowd washed back sudden and then broke all apart and went tearing off every which way and buck harkness he heeled it after them looking tolerable cheap
i could a stayed if i wanted to but i didn't want to
i went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the watchman went by and then dived in under the tent
i had my twentydollar gold piece and some other money but i reckoned i better save it because there ain't no telling how soon you are going to need it away from home and amongst strangers that way
you can't be too careful
i ain't opposed to spending money on circuses when there ain't no other way but there ain't no use in wasting it on them
it was a real bully circus
it was the splendidest sight that ever was when they all come riding in two and two a gentleman and lady side by side the men just in their drawers and undershirts and no shoes nor stirrups and resting their hands on their thighs easy and comfortablethere must a been twenty of themand every lady with a lovely complexion and perfectly beautiful and looking just like a gang of real sureenough queens and dressed in clothes that cost millions of dollars and just littered with diamonds
it was a powerful fine sight i never see anything so lovely
and then one by one they got up and stood and went aweaving around the ring so gentle and wavy and graceful the men looking ever so tall and airy and straight with their heads bobbing and skimming along away up there under the tentroof and every lady's roseleafy dress flapping soft and silky around her hips and she looking like the most loveliest parasol
and then faster and faster they went all of them dancing first one foot out in the air and then the other the horses leaning more and more and the ringmaster going round and round the centerpole cracking his whip and shouting hihi and the clown cracking jokes behind him and by and by all hands dropped the reins and every lady put her knuckles on her hips and every gentleman folded his arms and then how the horses did lean over and hump themselves
and so one after the other they all skipped off into the ring and made the sweetest bow i ever see and then scampered out and everybody clapped their hands and went just about wild
well all through the circus they done the most astonishing things and all the time that clown carried on so it most killed the people
the ringmaster couldn't ever say a word to him but he was back at him quick as a wink with the funniest things a body ever said and how he ever could think of so many of them and so sudden and so pat was what i couldn't noway understand
why i couldn't a thought of them in a year
and by and by a drunk man tried to get into the ringsaid he wanted to ride said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was
they argued and tried to keep him out but he wouldn't listen and the whole show come to a standstill
then the people begun to holler at him and make fun of him and that made him mad and he begun to rip and tear so that stirred up the people and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the benches and swarm towards the ring saying knock him down
throw him out and one or two women begun to scream
so then the ringmaster he made a little speech and said he hoped there wouldn't be no disturbance and if the man would promise he wouldn't make no more trouble he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse
so everybody laughed and said all right and the man got on
the minute he was on the horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around with two circus men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him and the drunk man hanging on to his neck and his heels flying in the air every jump and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing till tears rolled down
and at last sure enough all the circus men could do the horse broke loose and away he went like the very nation round and round the ring with that sot laying down on him and hanging to his neck with first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side and then t'other one on t'other side and the people just crazy
it warn't funny to me though i was all of a tremble to see his danger
but pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle areeling this way and that and the next minute he sprung up and dropped the bridle and stood
and the horse agoing like a house afire too
he just stood up there asailing around as easy and comfortable as if he warn't ever drunk in his lifeand then he begun to pull off his clothes and sling them
he shed them so thick they kind of clogged up the air and altogether he shed seventeen suits
and then there he was slim and handsome and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you ever saw and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairly humand finally skipped off and made his bow and danced off to the dressingroom and everybody just ahowling with pleasure and astonishment
then the ringmaster he see how he had been fooled and he was the sickest ringmaster you ever see i reckon
why it was one of his own men
he had got up that joke all out of his own head and never let on to nobody
well i felt sheepish enough to be took in so but i wouldn't a been in that ringmaster's place not for a thousand dollars
i don't know there may be bullier circuses than what that one was but i never struck them yet
anyways it was plenty good enough for me and wherever i run across it it can have all of my custom every time
well that night we had our show but there warn't only about twelve people therejust enough to pay expenses
and they laughed all the time and that made the duke mad and everybody left anyway before the show was over but one boy which was asleep
so the duke said these arkansaw lunkheads couldn't come up to shakespeare what they wanted was low comedyand maybe something ruther worse than low comedy he reckoned
he said he could size their style
so next morning he got some big sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint and drawed off some handbills and stuck them up all over the village
the bills said at the court house
for nights only
the worldrenowned tragedians david garrick the younger
and edmund kean the elder
of the london and continental theatres in their thrilling tragedy of the kings camelopard or the royal nonesuch
admission cents
then at the bottom was the biggest line of allwhich said ladies and children not admitted
there says he if that line dont fetch them i dont know arkansaw well all day him and the king was hard at it rigging up a stage and a curtain and a row of candles for footlights and that night the house was jam full of men in no time
when the place couldn't hold no more the duke he quit tending door and went around the back way and come on to the stage and stood up before the curtain and made a little speech and praised up this tragedy and said it was the most thrillingest one that ever was and so he went on abragging about the tragedy and about edmund kean the elder which was to play the main principal part in it and at last when he'd got everybody's expectations up high enough he rolled up the curtain and the next minute the king come aprancing out on all fours naked and he was painted all over ringstreakedandstriped all sorts of colors as splendid as a rainbow
andbut never mind the rest of his outfit it was just wild but it was awful funny
the people most killed themselves laughing and when the king got done capering and capered off behind the scenes they roared and clapped and stormed and hawhawed till he come back and done it over again and after that they made him do it another time
well it would make a cow laugh to see the shines that old idiot cut
then the duke he lets the curtain down and bows to the people and says the great tragedy will be performed only two nights more on accounts of pressing london engagements where the seats is all sold already for it in drury lane and then he makes them another bow and says if he has succeeded in pleasing them and instructing them he will be deeply obleeged if they will mention it to their friends and get them to come and see it
twenty people sings out what is it over
is that all the duke says yes
then there was a fine time
everybody sings out sold and rose up mad and was agoing for that stage and them tragedians
but a big fine looking man jumps up on a bench and shouts hold on
just a word gentlemen they stopped to listen
we are soldmighty badly sold
but we don't want to be the laughing stock of this whole town i reckon and never hear the last of this thing as long as we live
no
what we want is to go out of here quiet and talk this show up and sell the rest of the town
then we'll all be in the same boat
ain't that sensible you bet it isthe jedge is right everybody sings out
all right thennot a word about any sell
go along home and advise everybody to come and see the tragedy next day you couldn't hear nothing around that town but how splendid that show was
house was jammed again that night and we sold this crowd the same way
when me and the king and the duke got home to the raft we all had a supper and by and by about midnight they made jim and me back her out and float her down the middle of the river and fetch her in and hide her about two mile below town
the third night the house was crammed againand they warn't newcomers this time but people that was at the show the other two nights
i stood by the duke at the door and i see that every man that went in had his pockets bulging or something muffled up under his coatand i see it warn't no perfumery neither not by a long sight
i smelt sickly eggs by the barrel and rotten cabbages and such things and if i know the signs of a dead cat being around and i bet i do there was sixtyfour of them went in
i shoved in there for a minute but it was too various for me i couldn't stand it
well when the place couldn't hold no more people the duke he give a fellow a quarter and told him to tend door for him a minute and then he started around for the stage door i after him but the minute we turned the corner and was in the dark he says walk fast now till you get away from the houses and then shin for the raft like the dickens was after you i done it and he done the same
we struck the raft at the same time and in less than two seconds we was gliding down stream all dark and still and edging towards the middle of the river nobody saying a word
i reckoned the poor king was in for a gaudy time of it with the audience but nothing of the sort pretty soon he crawls out from under the wigwam and says well how'd the old thing pan out this time duke he hadn't been uptown at all
we never showed a light till we was about ten mile below the village
then we lit up and had a supper and the king and the duke fairly laughed their bones loose over the way they'd served them people
the duke says greenhorns flatheads
i knew the first house would keep mum and let the rest of the town get roped in and i knew they'd lay for us the third night and consider it was their turn now
well it is their turn and i'd give something to know how much they'd take for it
i would just like to know how they're putting in their opportunity
they can turn it into a picnic if they want tothey brought plenty provisions them rapscallions took in four hundred and sixtyfive dollars in that three nights
i never see money hauled in by the wagonload like that before
by and by when they was asleep and snoring jim says don't it s'prise you de way dem kings carries on huck no i says it don't why don't it huck well it don't because it's in the breed
i reckon they're all alike but huck dese kings o' ourn is reglar rapscallions dat's jist what dey is dey's reglar rapscallions well that's what i'm asaying all kings is mostly rapscallions as fur as i can make out is dat so you read about them onceyou'll see
look at henry the eight this 'n 's a sundayschool superintendent to him
and look at charles second and louis fourteen and louis fifteen and james second and edward second and richard third and forty more besides all them saxon heptarchies that used to rip around so in old times and raise cain
my you ought to seen old henry the eight when he was in bloom
he was a blossom
he used to marry a new wife every day and chop off her head next morning
and he would do it just as indifferent as if he was ordering up eggs
'fetch up nell gwynn' he says
they fetch her up
next morning 'chop off her head'
and they chop it off
'fetch up jane shore' he says and up she comes next morning 'chop off her head'and they chop it off
'ring up fair rosamun'
fair rosamun answers the bell
next morning 'chop off her head'
and he made every one of them tell him a tale every night and he kept that up till he had hogged a thousand and one tales that way and then he put them all in a book and called it domesday bookwhich was a good name and stated the case
you don't know kings jim but i know them and this old rip of ourn is one of the cleanest i've struck in history
well henry he takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country
how does he go at itgive noticegive the country a show
no
all of a sudden he heaves all the tea in boston harbor overboard and whacks out a declaration of independence and dares them to come on
that was his stylehe never give anybody a chance
he had suspicions of his father the duke of wellington
well what did he do
ask him to show up
nodrownded him in a butt of mamsey like a cat
s'pose people left money laying around where he waswhat did he do
he collared it
s'pose he contracted to do a thing and you paid him and didn't set down there and see that he done itwhat did he do
he always done the other thing
s'pose he opened his mouthwhat then
if he didn't shut it up powerful quick he'd lose a lie every time
that's the kind of a bug henry was and if we'd a had him along 'stead of our kings he'd a fooled that town a heap worse than ourn done
i don't say that ourn is lambs because they ain't when you come right down to the cold facts but they ain't nothing to that old ram anyway
all i say is kings is kings and you got to make allowances
take them all around they're a mighty ornery lot
it's the way they're raised but dis one do smell so like de nation huck well they all do jim
we can't help the way a king smells history don't tell no way now de duke he's a tolerble likely man in some ways yes a duke's different
but not very different
this one's a middling hard lot for a duke
when he's drunk there ain't no nearsighted man could tell him from a king well anyways i doan' hanker for no mo' un um huck
dese is all i kin stan' it's the way i feel too jim
but we've got them on our hands and we got to remember what they are and make allowances
sometimes i wish we could hear of a country that's out of kings what was the use to tell jim these warn't real kings and dukes
it wouldn't a done no good and besides it was just as i said you couldn't tell them from the real kind
i went to sleep and jim didn't call me when it was my turn
he often done that
when i waked up just at daybreak he was sitting there with his head down betwixt his knees moaning and mourning to himself
i didn't take notice nor let on
i knowed what it was about
he was thinking about his wife and his children away up yonder and he was low and homesick because he hadn't ever been away from home before in his life and i do believe he cared just as much for his people as white folks does for their'n
it don't seem natural but i reckon it's so
he was often moaning and mourning that way nights when he judged i was asleep and saying po' little 'lizabeth
po' little johnny
it's mighty hard i spec' i ain't ever gwyne to see you no mo' no mo' he was a mighty good nigger jim was
but this time i somehow got to talking to him about his wife and young ones and by and by he says what makes me feel so bad dis time 'uz bekase i hear sumpn over yonder on de bank like a whack er a slam while ago en it mine me er de time i treat my little 'lizabeth so ornery
she warn't on'y 'bout fo' year ole en she tuck de sk'yarlet fever en had a powful rough spell but she got well en one day she was astannin' aroun' en i says to her i says 'shet de do''
she never done it jis' stood dah kiner smilin' up at me

shet de do''
she jis stood de same way kiner smilin' up
i was abilin'
i says 'i lay i make you mine'
en wid dat i fetch' her a slap side de head dat sont her asprawlin'
den i went into de yuther room en 'uz gone 'bout ten minutes en when i come back dah was dat do' astannin' open yit en dat chile stannin' mos' right in it alookin' down and mournin' en de tears runnin' down
my but i wuz mad

she never budge oh huck i bust out acryin' en grab her up in my arms en say 'oh de po' little thing
de lord god amighty fogive po' ole jim kaze he never gwyne to fogive hisself as long's he live'
oh she was plumb deef en dumb huck plumb deef en dumben i'd ben atreat'n her so next day towards night we laid up under a little willow towhead out in the middle where there was a village on each side of the river and the duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns
jim he spoke to the duke and said he hoped it wouldn't take but a few hours because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to lay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope
you see when we left him all alone we had to tie him because if anybody happened on to him all by himself and not tied it wouldn't look much like he was a runaway nigger you know
so the duke said it was kind of hard to have to lay roped all day and he'd cipher out some way to get around it
he was uncommon bright the duke was and he soon struck it
he dressed jim up in king lear's outfitit was a long curtaincalico gown and a white horsehair wig and whiskers and then he took his theater paint and painted jim's face and hands and ears and neck all over a dead dull solid blue like a man that's been drownded nine days
blamed if he warn't the horriblest looking outrage i ever see
then the duke took and wrote out a sign on a shingle so sick arabbut harmless when not out of his head
and he nailed that shingle to a lath and stood the lath up four or five foot in front of the wigwam
jim was satisfied
he said it was a sight better than lying tied a couple of years every day and trembling all over every time there was a sound
the duke told him to make himself free and easy and if anybody ever come meddling around he must hop out of the wigwam and carry on a little and fetch a howl or two like a wild beast and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone
which was sound enough judgment but you take the average man and he wouldn't wait for him to howl
why he didn't only look like he was dead he looked considerable more than that
these rapscallions wanted to try the nonesuch again because there was so much money in it but they judged it wouldn't be safe because maybe the news might a worked along down by this time
they couldn't hit no project that suited exactly so at last the duke said he reckoned he'd lay off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he couldn't put up something on the arkansaw village and the king he allowed he would drop over to t'other village without any plan but just trust in providence to lead him the profitable waymeaning the devil i reckon
we had all bought store clothes where we stopped last and now the king put his'n on and he told me to put mine on
i done it of course
the king's duds was all black and he did look real swell and starchy
i never knowed how clothes could change a body before
why before he looked like the orneriest old rip that ever was but now when he'd take off his new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile he looked that grand and good and pious that you'd say he had walked right out of the ark and maybe was old leviticus himself
jim cleaned up the canoe and i got my paddle ready
there was a big steamboat laying at the shore away up under the point about three mile above the townbeen there a couple of hours taking on freight
says the king seein' how i'm dressed i reckon maybe i better arrive down from st louis or cincinnati or some other big place
go for the steamboat huckleberry we'll come down to the village on her i didn't have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat ride
i fetched the shore a half a mile above the village and then went scooting along the bluff bank in the easy water
pretty soon we come to a nice innocentlooking young country jake setting on a log swabbing the sweat off of his face for it was powerful warm weather and he had a couple of big carpetbags by him
run her nose in shore says the king
i done it
wher' you bound for young man for the steamboat going to orleans git aboard says the king
hold on a minute my servant 'll he'p you with them bags
jump out and he'p the gentleman adolphusmeaning me i see
i done so and then we all three started on again
the young chap was mighty thankful said it was tough work toting his baggage such weather
he asked the king where he was going and the king told him he'd come down the river and landed at the other village this morning and now he was going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there
the young fellow says when i first see you i says to myself 'it's mr wilks sure and he come mighty near getting here in time'
but then i says again 'no i reckon it ain't him or else he wouldn't be paddling up the river'
you ain't him are you no my name's blodgettelexander blodgettreverend elexander blodgett i s'pose i must say as i'm one o' the lord's poor servants
but still i'm jist as able to be sorry for mr wilks for not arriving in time all the same if he's missed anything by itwhich i hope he hasn't well he don't miss any property by it because he'll get that all right but he's missed seeing his brother peter diewhich he mayn't mind nobody can tell as to thatbut his brother would a give anything in this world to see him before he died never talked about nothing else all these three weeks hadn't seen him since they was boys togetherand hadn't ever seen his brother william at allthat's the deef and dumb onewilliam ain't more than thirty or thirtyfive
peter and george were the only ones that come out here george was the married brother him and his wife both died last year
harvey and william's the only ones that's left now and as i was saying they haven't got here in time did anybody send 'em word oh yes a month or two ago when peter was first took because peter said then that he sorter felt like he warn't going to get well this time
you see he was pretty old and george's g'yirls was too young to be much company for him except mary jane the redheaded one and so he was kinder lonesome after george and his wife died and didn't seem to care much to live
he most desperately wanted to see harveyand william too for that matterbecause he was one of them kind that can't bear to make a will
he left a letter behind for harvey and said he'd told in it where his money was hid and how he wanted the rest of the property divided up so george's g'yirls would be all rightfor george didn't leave nothing
and that letter was all they could get him to put a pen to why do you reckon harvey don't come
wher' does he live oh he lives in englandsheffieldpreaches therehasn't ever been in this country
he hasn't had any too much timeand besides he mightn't a got the letter at all you know too bad too bad he couldn't a lived to see his brothers poor soul
you going to orleans you say yes but that ain't only a part of it
i'm going in a ship next wednesday for ryo janeero where my uncle lives it's a pretty long journey
but it'll be lovely wisht i was agoing
is mary jane the oldest
how old is the others mary jane's nineteen susan's fifteen and joanna's about fourteenthat's the one that gives herself to good works and has a harelip poor things
to be left alone in the cold world so well they could be worse off
old peter had friends and they ain't going to let them come to no harm
there's hobson the babtis' preacher and deacon lot hovey and ben rucker and abner shackleford and levi bell the lawyer and dr robinson and their wives and the widow bartley andwell there's a lot of them but these are the ones that peter was thickest with and used to write about sometimes when he wrote home so harvey 'll know where to look for friends when he gets here well the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly emptied that young fellow
blamed if he didn't inquire about everybody and everything in that blessed town and all about the wilkses and about peter's businesswhich was a tanner and about george'swhich was a carpenter and about harvey'swhich was a dissentering minister and so on and so on
then he says what did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for because she's a big orleans boat and i was afeard she mightn't stop there
when they're deep they won't stop for a hail
a cincinnati boat will but this is a st louis one was peter wilks well off oh yes pretty well off
he had houses and land and it's reckoned he left three or four thousand in cash hid up som'ers when did you say he died i didn't say but it was last night funeral tomorrow likely yes 'bout the middle of the day well it's all terrible sad but we've all got to go one time or another
so what we want to do is to be prepared then we're all right yes sir it's the best way
ma used to always say that when we struck the boat she was about done loading and pretty soon she got off
the king never said nothing about going aboard so i lost my ride after all
when the boat was gone the king made me paddle up another mile to a lonesome place and then he got ashore and says now hustle back right off and fetch the duke up here and the new carpetbags
and if he's gone over to t'other side go over there and git him
and tell him to git himself up regardless
shove along now i see what he was up to but i never said nothing of course
when i got back with the duke we hid the canoe and then they set down on a log and the king told him everything just like the young fellow had said itevery last word of it
and all the time he was adoing it he tried to talk like an englishman and he done it pretty well too for a slouch
i can't imitate him and so i ain't agoing to try to but he really done it pretty good
then he says how are you on the deef and dumb bilgewater the duke said leave him alone for that said he had played a deef and dumb person on the histronic boards
so then they waited for a steamboat
about the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along but they didn't come from high enough up the river but at last there was a big one and they hailed her
she sent out her yawl and we went aboard and she was from cincinnati and when they found we only wanted to go four or five mile they was booming mad and gave us a cussing and said they wouldn't land us
but the king was ca'm
he says if gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be took on and put off in a yawl a steamboat kin afford to carry 'em can't it so they softened down and said it was all right and when we got to the village they yawled us ashore
about two dozen men flocked down when they see the yawl acoming and when the king says kin any of you gentlemen tell me wher' mr peter wilks lives they give a glance at one another and nodded their heads as much as to say what d' i tell you then one of them says kind of soft and gentle i'm sorry sir but the best we can do is to tell you where he did live yesterday evening sudden as winking the ornery old cretur went an to smash and fell up against the man and put his chin on his shoulder and cried down his back and says alas alas our poor brothergone and we never got to see him oh it's too too hard then he turns around blubbering and makes a lot of idiotic signs to the duke on his hands and blamed if he didn't drop a carpetbag and bust out acrying
if they warn't the beatenest lot them two frauds that ever i struck
well the men gathered around and sympathized with them and said all sorts of kind things to them and carried their carpetbags up the hill for them and let them lean on them and cry and told the king all about his brother's last moments and the king he told it all over again on his hands to the duke and both of them took on about that dead tanner like they'd lost the twelve disciples
well if ever i struck anything like it i'm a nigger
it was enough to make a body ashamed of the human race
the news was all over town in two minutes and you could see the people tearing down on the run from every which way some of them putting on their coats as they come
pretty soon we was in the middle of a crowd and the noise of the tramping was like a soldier march
the windows and dooryards was full and every minute somebody would say over a fence is it them and somebody trotting along with the gang would answer back and say you bet it is when we got to the house the street in front of it was packed and the three girls was standing in the door
mary jane was redheaded but that don't make no difference she was most awful beautiful and her face and her eyes was all lit up like glory she was so glad her uncles was come
the king he spread his arms and mary jane she jumped for them and the harelip jumped for the duke and there they had it
everybody most leastways women cried for joy to see them meet again at last and have such good times
then the king he hunched the duke privatei see him do itand then he looked around and see the coffin over in the corner on two chairs so then him and the duke with a hand across each other's shoulder and t'other hand to their eyes walked slow and solemn over there everybody dropping back to give them room and all the talk and noise stopping people saying sh and all the men taking their hats off and drooping their heads so you could a heard a pin fall
and when they got there they bent over and looked in the coffin and took one sight and then they bust out acrying so you could a heard them to orleans most and then they put their arms around each other's necks and hung their chins over each other's shoulders and then for three minutes or maybe four i never see two men leak the way they done
and mind you everybody was doing the same and the place was that damp i never see anything like it
then one of them got on one side of the coffin and t'other on t'other side and they kneeled down and rested their foreheads on the coffin and let on to pray all to themselves
well when it come to that it worked the crowd like you never see anything like it and everybody broke down and went to sobbing right out loudthe poor girls too and every woman nearly went up to the girls without saying a word and kissed them solemn on the forehead and then put their hand on their head and looked up towards the sky with the tears running down and then busted out and went off sobbing and swabbing and give the next woman a show
i never see anything so disgusting
well by and by the king he gets up and comes forward a little and works himself up and slobbers out a speech all full of tears and flapdoodle about its being a sore trial for him and his poor brother to lose the diseased and to miss seeing diseased alive after the long journey of four thousand mile but it's a trial that's sweetened and sanctified to us by this dear sympathy and these holy tears and so he thanks them out of his heart and out of his brother's heart because out of their mouths they can't words being too weak and cold and all that kind of rot and slush till it was just sickening and then he blubbers out a pious goodygoody amen and turns himself loose and goes to crying fit to bust
and the minute the words were out of his mouth somebody over in the crowd struck up the doxolojer and everybody joined in with all their might and it just warmed you up and made you feel as good as church letting out
music is a good thing and after all that soulbutter and hogwash i never see it freshen up things so and sound so honest and bully
then the king begins to work his jaw again and says how him and his nieces would be glad if a few of the main principal friends of the family would take supper here with them this evening and help set up with the ashes of the diseased and says if his poor brother laying yonder could speak he knows who he would name for they was names that was very dear to him and mentioned often in his letters and so he will name the same to wit as follows vizzrev
mr hobson and deacon lot hovey and mr ben rucker and abner shackleford and levi bell and dr robinson and their wives and the widow bartley
rev
hobson and dr robinson was down to the end of the town ahunting togetherthat is i mean the doctor was shipping a sick man to t'other world and the preacher was pinting him right
lawyer bell was away up to louisville on business
but the rest was on hand and so they all come and shook hands with the king and thanked him and talked to him and then they shook hands with the duke and didn't say nothing but just kept asmiling and bobbing their heads like a passel of sapheads whilst he made all sorts of signs with his hands and said googoogoogoogoo all the time like a baby that can't talk
so the king he blattered along and managed to inquire about pretty much everybody and dog in town by his name and mentioned all sorts of little things that happened one time or another in the town or to george's family or to peter
and he always let on that peter wrote him the things but that was a lie he got every blessed one of them out of that young flathead that we canoed up to the steamboat
then mary jane she fetched the letter her father left behind and the king he read it out loud and cried over it
it give the dwellinghouse and three thousand dollars gold to the girls and it give the tanyard which was doing a good business along with some other houses and land worth about seven thousand and three thousand dollars in gold to harvey and william and told where the six thousand cash was hid down cellar
so these two frauds said they'd go and fetch it up and have everything square and aboveboard and told me to come with a candle
we shut the cellar door behind us and when they found the bag they spilt it out on the floor and it was a lovely sight all them yallerboys
my the way the king's eyes did shine
he slaps the duke on the shoulder and says oh this ain't bully nor noth'n
oh no i reckon not
why bully it beats the nonesuch don't it the duke allowed it did
they pawed the yallerboys and sifted them through their fingers and let them jingle down on the floor and the king says it ain't no use talkin' bein' brothers to a rich dead man and representatives of furrin heirs that's got left is the line for you and me bilge
thish yer comes of trust'n to providence
it's the best way in the long run
i've tried 'em all and ther' ain't no better way most everybody would a been satisfied with the pile and took it on trust but no they must count it
so they counts it and it comes out four hundred and fifteen dollars short
says the king dern him i wonder what he done with that four hundred and fifteen dollars they worried over that awhile and ransacked all around for it
then the duke says well he was a pretty sick man and likely he made a mistakei reckon that's the way of it
the best way's to let it go and keep still about it
we can spare it oh shucks yes we can spare it
i don't k'yer noth'n 'bout thatit's the count i'm thinkin' about
we want to be awful square and open and aboveboard here you know
we want to lug this hyer money up stairs and count it before everybodythen ther' ain't noth'n suspicious
but when the dead man says ther's six thous'n dollars you know we don't want to hold on says the duke
le's make up the deffisit and he begun to haul out yallerboys out of his pocket
it's a most amaz'n' good idea dukeyou have got a rattlin' clever head on you says the king
blest if the old nonesuch ain't a heppin' us out agin and he begun to haul out yallerjackets and stack them up
it most busted them but they made up the six thousand clean and clear
say says the duke i got another idea
le's go up stairs and count this money and then take and give it to the girls good land duke lemme hug you
it's the most dazzling idea 'at ever a man struck
you have cert'nly got the most astonishin' head i ever see
oh this is the boss dodge ther' ain't no mistake 'bout it
let 'em fetch along their suspicions now if they want tothis 'll lay 'em out when we got upstairs everybody gethered around the table and the king he counted it and stacked it up three hundred dollars in a piletwenty elegant little piles
everybody looked hungry at it and licked their chops
then they raked it into the bag again and i see the king begin to swell himself up for another speech
he says friends all my poor brother that lays yonder has done generous by them that's left behind in the vale of sorrers
he has done generous by these yer poor little lambs that he loved and sheltered and that's left fatherless and motherless
yes and we that knowed him knows that he would a done more generous by 'em if he hadn't ben afeard o' woundin' his dear william and me
now wouldn't he
ther' ain't no question 'bout it in my mind
well then what kind o' brothers would it be that 'd stand in his way at sech a time
and what kind o' uncles would it be that 'd robyes robsech poor sweet lambs as these 'at he loved so at sech a time
if i know williamand i think i dohewell i'll jest ask him he turns around and begins to make a lot of signs to the duke with his hands and the duke he looks at him stupid and leatherheaded a while then all of a sudden he seems to catch his meaning and jumps for the king googooing with all his might for joy and hugs him about fifteen times before he lets up
then the king says i knowed it i reckon that 'll convince anybody the way he feels about it
here mary jane susan joanner take the moneytake it all
it's the gift of him that lays yonder cold but joyful mary jane she went for him susan and the harelip went for the duke and then such another hugging and kissing i never see yet
and everybody crowded up with the tears in their eyes and most shook the hands off of them frauds saying all the time you dear good soulshow lovelyhow could you well then pretty soon all hands got to talking about the diseased again and how good he was and what a loss he was and all that and before long a big ironjawed man worked himself in there from outside and stood alistening and looking and not saying anything and nobody saying anything to him either because the king was talking and they was all busy listening
the king was sayingin the middle of something he'd started in on they bein' partickler friends o' the diseased
that's why they're invited here this evenin' but tomorrow we want all to comeeverybody for he respected everybody he liked everybody and so it's fitten that his funeral orgies sh'd be public and so he went amooning on and on liking to hear himself talk and every little while he fetched in his funeral orgies again till the duke he couldn't stand it no more so he writes on a little scrap of paper obsequies you old fool and folds it up and goes to googooing and reaching it over people's heads to him
the king he reads it and puts it in his pocket and says poor william afflicted as he is his heart's aluz right
asks me to invite everybody to come to the funeralwants me to make 'em all welcome
but he needn't a worriedit was jest what i was at then he weaves along again perfectly ca'm and goes to dropping in his funeral orgies again every now and then just like he done before
and when he done it the third time he says i say orgies not because it's the common term because it ain'tobsequies bein' the common termbut because orgies is the right term
obsequies ain't used in england no more nowit's gone out
we say orgies now in england
orgies is better because it means the thing you're after more exact
it's a word that's made up out'n the greek orgo outside open abroad and the hebrew jeesum to plant cover up hence inter so you see funeral orgies is an open er public funeral he was the worst i ever struck
well the ironjawed man he laughed right in his face
everybody was shocked
everybody says why doctor and abner shackleford says why robinson hain't you heard the news
this is harvey wilks the king he smiled eager and shoved out his flapper and says is it my poor brother's dear good friend and physician
i keep your hands off of me says the doctor
you talk like an englishman don't you
it's the worst imitation i ever heard
you peter wilks's brother
you're a fraud that's what you are well how they all took on
they crowded around the doctor and tried to quiet him down and tried to explain to him and tell him how harvey 'd showed in forty ways that he was harvey and knowed everybody by name and the names of the very dogs and begged and begged him not to hurt harvey's feelings and the poor girl's feelings and all that
but it warn't no use he stormed right along and said any man that pretended to be an englishman and couldn't imitate the lingo no better than what he did was a fraud and a liar
the poor girls was hanging to the king and crying and all of a sudden the doctor ups and turns on them
he says i was your father's friend and i'm your friend and i warn you as a friend and an honest one that wants to protect you and keep you out of harm and trouble to turn your backs on that scoundrel and have nothing to do with him the ignorant tramp with his idiotic greek and hebrew as he calls it
he is the thinnest kind of an impostorhas come here with a lot of empty names and facts which he picked up somewheres and you take them for proofs and are helped to fool yourselves by these foolish friends here who ought to know better
mary jane wilks you know me for your friend and for your unselfish friend too
now listen to me turn this pitiful rascal outi beg you to do it
will you mary jane straightened herself up and my but she was handsome
she says here is my answer she hove up the bag of money and put it in the king's hands and says take this six thousand dollars and invest for me and my sisters any way you want to and don't give us no receipt for it then she put her arm around the king on one side and susan and the harelip done the same on the other
everybody clapped their hands and stomped on the floor like a perfect storm whilst the king held up his head and smiled proud
the doctor says all right i wash my hands of the matter
but i warn you all that a time 's coming when you're going to feel sick whenever you think of this day and away he went
all right doctor says the king kinder mocking him we'll try and get 'em to send for you which made them all laugh and they said it was a prime good hit
well when they was all gone the king he asks mary jane how they was off for spare rooms and she said she had one spare room which would do for uncle william and she'd give her own room to uncle harvey which was a little bigger and she would turn into the room with her sisters and sleep on a cot and up garret was a little cubby with a pallet in it
the king said the cubby would do for his valleymeaning me
so mary jane took us up and she showed them their rooms which was plain but nice
she said she'd have her frocks and a lot of other traps took out of her room if they was in uncle harvey's way but he said they warn't
the frocks was hung along the wall and before them was a curtain made out of calico that hung down to the floor
there was an old hair trunk in one corner and a guitarbox in another and all sorts of little knickknacks and jimcracks around like girls brisken up a room with
the king said it was all the more homely and more pleasanter for these fixings and so don't disturb them
the duke's room was pretty small but plenty good enough and so was my cubby
that night they had a big supper and all them men and women was there and i stood behind the king and the duke's chairs and waited on them and the niggers waited on the rest
mary jane she set at the head of the table with susan alongside of her and said how bad the biscuits was and how mean the preserves was and how ornery and tough the fried chickens wasand all that kind of rot the way women always do for to force out compliments and the people all knowed everything was tiptop and said sosaid how do you get biscuits to brown so nice and where for the land's sake did you get these amaz'n pickles and all that kind of humbug talkytalk just the way people always does at a supper you know
and when it was all done me and the harelip had supper in the kitchen off of the leavings whilst the others was helping the niggers clean up the things
the harelip she got to pumping me about england and blest if i didn't think the ice was getting mighty thin sometimes
she says did you ever see the king who
william fourth
well i bet i havehe goes to our church i knowed he was dead years ago but i never let on
so when i says he goes to our church she says whatregular yesregular
his pew's right over opposite ournon t'other side the pulpit i thought he lived in london well he does
where would he live but i thought you lived in sheffield i see i was up a stump
i had to let on to get choked with a chicken bone so as to get time to think how to get down again
then i says i mean he goes to our church regular when he's in sheffield
that's only in the summer time when he comes there to take the sea baths why how you talksheffield ain't on the sea well who said it was why you did i didn't nuther you did i didn't you did i never said nothing of the kind well what did you say then said he come to take the sea bathsthat's what i said well then how's he going to take the sea baths if it ain't on the sea looky here i says did you ever see any congresswater yes well did you have to go to congress to get it why no well neither does william fourth have to go to the sea to get a sea bath how does he get it then gets it the way people down here gets congresswaterin barrels
there in the palace at sheffield they've got furnaces and he wants his water hot
they can't bile that amount of water away off there at the sea
they haven't got no conveniences for it oh i see now
you might a said that in the first place and saved time when she said that i see i was out of the woods again and so i was comfortable and glad
next she says do you go to church too yesregular where do you set why in our pew whose pew why ournyour uncle harvey's his'n
what does he want with a pew wants it to set in
what did you reckon he wanted with it why i thought he'd be in the pulpit rot him i forgot he was a preacher
i see i was up a stump again so i played another chicken bone and got another think
then i says blame it do you suppose there ain't but one preacher to a church why what do they want with more whatto preach before a king
i never did see such a girl as you
they don't have no less than seventeen seventeen
my land
why i wouldn't set out such a string as that not if i never got to glory
it must take 'em a week shucks they don't all of 'em preach the same dayonly one of 'em well then what does the rest of 'em do oh nothing much
loll around pass the plateand one thing or another
but mainly they don't do nothing well then what are they for why they're for style
don't you know nothing well i don't want to know no such foolishness as that
how is servants treated in england
do they treat 'em better 'n we treat our niggers no
a servant ain't nobody there
they treat them worse than dogs don't they give 'em holidays the way we do christmas and new year's week and fourth of july oh just listen
a body could tell you hain't ever been to england by that
why harelwhy joanna they never see a holiday from year's end to year's end never go to the circus nor theater nor nigger shows nor nowheres nor church nor church but you always went to church well i was gone up again
i forgot i was the old man's servant
but next minute i whirled in on a kind of an explanation how a valley was different from a common servant and had to go to church whether he wanted to or not and set with the family on account of its being the law
but i didn't do it pretty good and when i got done i see she warn't satisfied
she says honest injun now hain't you been telling me a lot of lies honest injun says i
none of it at all none of it at all
not a lie in it says i
lay your hand on this book and say it i see it warn't nothing but a dictionary so i laid my hand on it and said it
so then she looked a little better satisfied and says well then i'll believe some of it but i hope to gracious if i'll believe the rest what is it you won't believe joe says mary jane stepping in with susan behind her
it ain't right nor kind for you to talk so to him and him a stranger and so far from his people
how would you like to be treated so that's always your way maimalways sailing in to help somebody before they're hurt
i hain't done nothing to him
he's told some stretchers i reckon and i said i wouldn't swallow it all and that's every bit and grain i did say
i reckon he can stand a little thing like that can't he i don't care whether 'twas little or whether 'twas big he's here in our house and a stranger and it wasn't good of you to say it
if you was in his place it would make you feel ashamed and so you oughtn't to say a thing to another person that will make them feel ashamed why mam he said it don't make no difference what he saidthat ain't the thing
the thing is for you to treat him kind and not be saying things to make him remember he ain't in his own country and amongst his own folks i says to myself this is a girl that i'm letting that old reptile rob her of her money
then susan she waltzed in and if you'll believe me she did give harelip hark from the tomb
says i to myself and this is another one that i'm letting him rob her of her money
then mary jane she took another inning and went in sweet and lovely againwhich was her way but when she got done there warn't hardly anything left o' poor harelip
so she hollered
all right then says the other girls you just ask his pardon she done it too and she done it beautiful
she done it so beautiful it was good to hear and i wished i could tell her a thousand lies so she could do it again
i says to myself this is another one that i'm letting him rob her of her money
and when she got through they all jest laid theirselves out to make me feel at home and know i was amongst friends
i felt so ornery and low down and mean that i says to myself my mind's made up i'll hive that money for them or bust
so then i lit outfor bed i said meaning some time or another
when i got by myself i went to thinking the thing over
i says to myself shall i go to that doctor private and blow on these frauds
nothat won't do
he might tell who told him then the king and the duke would make it warm for me
shall i go private and tell mary jane
noi dasn't do it
her face would give them a hint sure they've got the money and they'd slide right out and get away with it
if she was to fetch in help i'd get mixed up in the business before it was done with i judge
no there ain't no good way but one
i got to steal that money somehow and i got to steal it some way that they won't suspicion that i done it
they've got a good thing here and they ain't agoing to leave till they've played this family and this town for all they're worth so i'll find a chance time enough
i'll steal it and hide it and by and by when i'm away down the river i'll write a letter and tell mary jane where it's hid
but i better hive it tonight if i can because the doctor maybe hasn't let up as much as he lets on he has he might scare them out of here yet
so thinks i i'll go and search them rooms
upstairs the hall was dark but i found the duke's room and started to paw around it with my hands but i recollected it wouldn't be much like the king to let anybody else take care of that money but his own self so then i went to his room and begun to paw around there
but i see i couldn't do nothing without a candle and i dasn't light one of course
so i judged i'd got to do the other thinglay for them and eavesdrop
about that time i hears their footsteps coming and was going to skip under the bed i reached for it but it wasn't where i thought it would be but i touched the curtain that hid mary jane's frocks so i jumped in behind that and snuggled in amongst the gowns and stood there perfectly still
they come in and shut the door and the first thing the duke done was to get down and look under the bed
then i was glad i hadn't found the bed when i wanted it
and yet you know it's kind of natural to hide under the bed when you are up to anything private
they sets down then and the king says well what is it
and cut it middlin' short because it's better for us to be down there awhoopin' up the mournin' than up here givin' 'em a chance to talk us over well this is it capet
i ain't easy i ain't comfortable
that doctor lays on my mind
i wanted to know your plans
i've got a notion and i think it's a sound one what is it duke that we better glide out of this before three in the morning and clip it down the river with what we've got
specially seeing we got it so easygiven back to us flung at our heads as you may say when of course we allowed to have to steal it back
i'm for knocking off and lighting out that made me feel pretty bad
about an hour or two ago it would a been a little different but now it made me feel bad and disappointed the king rips out and says what
and not sell out the rest o' the property
march off like a passel of fools and leave eight or nine thous'n' dollars' worth o' property layin' around jest sufferin' to be scooped inand all good salable stuff too the duke he grumbled said the bag of gold was enough and he didn't want to go no deeperdidn't want to rob a lot of orphans of everything they had
why how you talk says the king
we sha'n't rob 'em of nothing at all but jest this money
the people that buys the property is the suff'rers because as soon 's it's found out 'at we didn't own itwhich won't be long after we've slidthe sale won't be valid and it 'll all go back to the estate
these yer orphans 'll git their house back agin and that's enough for them they're young and spry and k'n easy earn a livin'
they ain't agoin to suffer
why jest thinkthere's thous'n's and thous'n's that ain't nigh so well off
bless you they ain't got noth'n' to complain of well the king he talked him blind so at last he give in and said all right but said he believed it was blamed foolishness to stay and that doctor hanging over them
but the king says cuss the doctor
what do we k'yer for him
hain't we got all the fools in town on our side
and ain't that a big enough majority in any town so they got ready to go down stairs again
the duke says i don't think we put that money in a good place that cheered me up
i'd begun to think i warn't going to get a hint of no kind to help me
the king says why because mary jane 'll be in mourning from this out and first you know the nigger that does up the rooms will get an order to box these duds up and put 'em away and do you reckon a nigger can run across money and not borrow some of it your head's level agin duke says the king and he comes afumbling under the curtain two or three foot from where i was
i stuck tight to the wall and kept mighty still though quivery and i wondered what them fellows would say to me if they catched me and i tried to think what i'd better do if they did catch me
but the king he got the bag before i could think more than about a half a thought and he never suspicioned i was around
they took and shoved the bag through a rip in the straw tick that was under the featherbed and crammed it in a foot or two amongst the straw and said it was all right now because a nigger only makes up the featherbed and don't turn over the straw tick only about twice a year and so it warn't in no danger of getting stole now
but i knowed better
i had it out of there before they was halfway down stairs
i groped along up to my cubby and hid it there till i could get a chance to do better
i judged i better hide it outside of the house somewheres because if they missed it they would give the house a good ransacking i knowed that very well
then i turned in with my clothes all on but i couldn't a gone to sleep if i'd a wanted to i was in such a sweat to get through with the business
by and by i heard the king and the duke come up so i rolled off my pallet and laid with my chin at the top of my ladder and waited to see if anything was going to happen
but nothing did
so i held on till all the late sounds had quit and the early ones hadn't begun yet and then i slipped down the ladder
i crept to their doors and listened they was snoring
so i tiptoed along and got down stairs all right
there warn't a sound anywheres
i peeped through a crack of the diningroom door and see the men that was watching the corpse all sound asleep on their chairs
the door was open into the parlor where the corpse was laying and there was a candle in both rooms
i passed along and the parlor door was open but i see there warn't nobody in there but the remainders of peter so i shoved on by but the front door was locked and the key wasn't there
just then i heard somebody coming down the stairs back behind me
i run in the parlor and took a swift look around and the only place i see to hide the bag was in the coffin
the lid was shoved along about a foot showing the dead man's face down in there with a wet cloth over it and his shroud on
i tucked the moneybag in under the lid just down beyond where his hands was crossed which made me creep they was so cold and then i run back across the room and in behind the door
the person coming was mary jane
she went to the coffin very soft and kneeled down and looked in then she put up her handkerchief and i see she begun to cry though i couldn't hear her and her back was to me
i slid out and as i passed the diningroom i thought i'd make sure them watchers hadn't seen me so i looked through the crack and everything was all right
they hadn't stirred
i slipped up to bed feeling ruther blue on accounts of the thing playing out that way after i had took so much trouble and run so much resk about it
says i if it could stay where it is all right because when we get down the river a hundred mile or two i could write back to mary jane and she could dig him up again and get it but that ain't the thing that's going to happen the thing that's going to happen is the money 'll be found when they come to screw on the lid
then the king 'll get it again and it 'll be a long day before he gives anybody another chance to smouch it from him
of course i wanted to slide down and get it out of there but i dasn't try it
every minute it was getting earlier now and pretty soon some of them watchers would begin to stir and i might get catchedcatched with six thousand dollars in my hands that nobody hadn't hired me to take care of
i don't wish to be mixed up in no such business as that i says to myself
when i got down stairs in the morning the parlor was shut up and the watchers was gone
there warn't nobody around but the family and the widow bartley and our tribe
i watched their faces to see if anything had been happening but i couldn't tell
towards the middle of the day the undertaker come with his man and they set the coffin in the middle of the room on a couple of chairs and then set all our chairs in rows and borrowed more from the neighbors till the hall and the parlor and the diningroom was full
i see the coffin lid was the way it was before but i dasn't go to look in under it with folks around
then the people begun to flock in and the beats and the girls took seats in the front row at the head of the coffin and for a half an hour the people filed around slow in single rank and looked down at the dead man's face a minute and some dropped in a tear and it was all very still and solemn only the girls and the beats holding handkerchiefs to their eyes and keeping their heads bent and sobbing a little
there warn't no other sound but the scraping of the feet on the floor and blowing nosesbecause people always blows them more at a funeral than they do at other places except church
when the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in his black gloves with his softy soothering ways putting on the last touches and getting people and things all shipshape and comfortable and making no more sound than a cat
he never spoke he moved people around he squeezed in late ones he opened up passageways and done it with nods and signs with his hands
then he took his place over against the wall
he was the softest glidingest stealthiest man i ever see and there warn't no more smile to him than there is to a ham
they had borrowed a melodeuma sick one and when everything was ready a young woman set down and worked it and it was pretty skreeky and colicky and everybody joined in and sung and peter was the only one that had a good thing according to my notion
then the reverend hobson opened up slow and solemn and begun to talk and straight off the most outrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard it was only one dog but he made a most powerful racket and he kept it up right along the parson he had to stand there over the coffin and waityou couldn't hear yourself think
it was right down awkward and nobody didn't seem to know what to do
but pretty soon they see that longlegged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to say don't you worryjust depend on me then he stooped down and begun to glide along the wall just his shoulders showing over the people's heads
so he glided along and the powwow and racket getting more and more outrageous all the time and at last when he had gone around two sides of the room he disappears down cellar
then in about two seconds we heard a whack and the dog he finished up with a most amazing howl or two and then everything was dead still and the parson begun his solemn talk where he left off
in a minute or two here comes this undertaker's back and shoulders gliding along the wall again and so he glided and glided around three sides of the room and then rose up and shaded his mouth with his hands and stretched his neck out towards the preacher over the people's heads and says in a kind of a coarse whisper he had a rat then he drooped down and glided along the wall again to his place
you could see it was a great satisfaction to the people because naturally they wanted to know
a little thing like that don't cost nothing and it's just the little things that makes a man to be looked up to and liked
there warn't no more popular man in town than what that undertaker was
well the funeral sermon was very good but pison long and tiresome and then the king he shoved in and got off some of his usual rubbage and at last the job was through and the undertaker begun to sneak up on the coffin with his screwdriver
i was in a sweat then and watched him pretty keen
but he never meddled at all just slid the lid along as soft as mush and screwed it down tight and fast
so there i was
i didn't know whether the money was in there or not
so says i s'pose somebody has hogged that bag on the slynow how do i know whether to write to mary jane or not
s'pose she dug him up and didn't find nothing what would she think of me
blame it i says i might get hunted up and jailed i'd better lay low and keep dark and not write at all the thing's awful mixed now trying to better it i've worsened it a hundred times and i wish to goodness i'd just let it alone dad fetch the whole business
they buried him and we come back home and i went to watching faces againi couldn't help it and i couldn't rest easy
but nothing come of it the faces didn't tell me nothing
the king he visited around in the evening and sweetened everybody up and made himself ever so friendly and he give out the idea that his congregation over in england would be in a sweat about him so he must hurry and settle up the estate right away and leave for home
he was very sorry he was so pushed and so was everybody they wished he could stay longer but they said they could see it couldn't be done
and he said of course him and william would take the girls home with them and that pleased everybody too because then the girls would be well fixed and amongst their own relations and it pleased the girls tootickled them so they clean forgot they ever had a trouble in the world and told him to sell out as quick as he wanted to they would be ready
them poor things was that glad and happy it made my heart ache to see them getting fooled and lied to so but i didn't see no safe way for me to chip in and change the general tune
well blamed if the king didn't bill the house and the niggers and all the property for auction straight offsale two days after the funeral but anybody could buy private beforehand if they wanted to
so the next day after the funeral along about noontime the girls' joy got the first jolt
a couple of nigger traders come along and the king sold them the niggers reasonable for threeday drafts as they called it and away they went the two sons up the river to memphis and their mother down the river to orleans
i thought them poor girls and them niggers would break their hearts for grief they cried around each other and took on so it most made me down sick to see it
the girls said they hadn't ever dreamed of seeing the family separated or sold away from the town
i can't ever get it out of my memory the sight of them poor miserable girls and niggers hanging around each other's necks and crying and i reckon i couldn't a stood it all but would a had to bust out and tell on our gang if i hadn't knowed the sale warn't no account and the niggers would be back home in a week or two
the thing made a big stir in the town too and a good many come out flatfooted and said it was scandalous to separate the mother and the children that way
it injured the frauds some but the old fool he bulled right along spite of all the duke could say or do and i tell you the duke was powerful uneasy
next day was auction day
about broad day in the morning the king and the duke come up in the garret and woke me up and i see by their look that there was trouble
the king says was you in my room night before last no your majestywhich was the way i always called him when nobody but our gang warn't around
was you in there yisterday er last night no your majesty honor bright nowno lies honor bright your majesty i'm telling you the truth
i hain't been anear your room since miss mary jane took you and the duke and showed it to you the duke says have you seen anybody else go in there no your grace not as i remember i believe stop and think i studied awhile and see my chance then i says well i see the niggers go in there several times both of them gave a little jump and looked like they hadn't ever expected it and then like they had
then the duke says what all of them noleastways not all at oncethat is i don't think i ever see them all come out at once but just one time hello
when was that it was the day we had the funeral
in the morning
it warn't early because i overslept
i was just starting down the ladder and i see them well go on go on
what did they do
how'd they act they didn't do nothing
and they didn't act anyway much as fur as i see
they tiptoed away so i seen easy enough that they'd shoved in there to do up your majesty's room or something s'posing you was up and found you warn't up and so they was hoping to slide out of the way of trouble without waking you up if they hadn't already waked you up great guns this is a go says the king and both of them looked pretty sick and tolerable silly
they stood there athinking and scratching their heads a minute and the duke he bust into a kind of a little raspy chuckle and says it does beat all how neat the niggers played their hand
they let on to be sorry they was going out of this region
and i believed they was sorry and so did you and so did everybody
don't ever tell me any more that a nigger ain't got any histrionic talent
why the way they played that thing it would fool anybody
in my opinion there's a fortune in 'em
if i had capital and a theater i wouldn't want a better layout than thatand here we've gone and sold 'em for a song
yes and ain't privileged to sing the song yet
say where is that songthat draft in the bank for to be collected
where would it be well that's all right then thank goodness says i kind of timidlike is something gone wrong the king whirls on me and rips out none o' your business
you keep your head shet and mind y'r own affairsif you got any
long as you're in this town don't you forgit thatyou hear then he says to the duke we got to jest swaller it and say noth'n' mum's the word for us as they was starting down the ladder the duke he chuckles again and says quick sales and small profits
it's a good businessyes the king snarls around on him and says i was trying to do for the best in sellin' 'em out so quick
if the profits has turned out to be none lackin' considable and none to carry is it my fault any more'n it's yourn well they'd be in this house yet and we wouldn't if i could a got my advice listened to the king sassed back as much as was safe for him and then swapped around and lit into me again
he give me down the banks for not coming and telling him i see the niggers come out of his room acting that waysaid any fool would a knowed something was up
and then waltzed in and cussed himself awhile and said it all come of him not laying late and taking his natural rest that morning and he'd be blamed if he'd ever do it again
so they went off ajawing and i felt dreadful glad i'd worked it all off on to the niggers and yet hadn't done the niggers no harm by it
by and by it was gettingup time
so i come down the ladder and started for downstairs but as i come to the girls' room the door was open and i see mary jane setting by her old hair trunk which was open and she'd been packing things in itgetting ready to go to england
but she had stopped now with a folded gown in her lap and had her face in her hands crying
i felt awful bad to see it of course anybody would
i went in there and says miss mary jane you can't abear to see people in trouble and i can'tmost always
tell me about it so she done it
and it was the niggersi just expected it
she said the beautiful trip to england was most about spoiled for her she didn't know how she was ever going to be happy there knowing the mother and the children warn't ever going to see each other no moreand then busted out bitterer than ever and flung up her hands and says oh dear dear to think they ain't ever going to see each other any more but they willand inside of two weeksand i know it says i
laws it was out before i could think
and before i could budge she throws her arms around my neck and told me to say it again say it again say it again
i see i had spoke too sudden and said too much and was in a close place
i asked her to let me think a minute and she set there very impatient and excited and handsome but looking kind of happy and easedup like a person that's had a tooth pulled out
so i went to studying it out
i says to myself i reckon a body that ups and tells the truth when he is in a tight place is taking considerable many resks though i ain't had no experience and can't say for certain but it looks so to me anyway and yet here's a case where i'm blest if it don't look to me like the truth is better and actuly safer than a lie
i must lay it by in my mind and think it over some time or other it's so kind of strange and unregular
i never see nothing like it
well i says to myself at last i'm agoing to chance it i'll up and tell the truth this time though it does seem most like setting down on a kag of powder and touching it off just to see where you'll go to
then i says miss mary jane is there any place out of town a little ways where you could go and stay three or four days yes mr lothrop's
why never mind why yet
if i'll tell you how i know the niggers will see each other again inside of two weekshere in this houseand prove how i know itwill you go to mr lothrop's and stay four days four days she says i'll stay a year all right i says i don't want nothing more out of you than just your wordi druther have it than another man's kissthebible she smiled and reddened up very sweet and i says if you don't mind it i'll shut the doorand bolt it then i come back and set down again and says don't you holler
just set still and take it like a man
i got to tell the truth and you want to brace up miss mary because it's a bad kind and going to be hard to take but there ain't no help for it
these uncles of yourn ain't no uncles at all they're a couple of fraudsregular deadbeats
there now we're over the worst of it you can stand the rest middling easy it jolted her up like everything of course but i was over the shoal water now so i went right along her eyes ablazing higher and higher all the time and told her every blame thing from where we first struck that young fool going up to the steamboat clear through to where she flung herself on to the king's breast at the front door and he kissed her sixteen or seventeen timesand then up she jumps with her face afire like sunset and says the brute
come don't waste a minutenot a secondwe'll have them tarred and feathered and flung in the river says i cert'nly
but do you mean before you go to mr lothrop's or oh she says what am i thinking about she says and set right down again
don't mind what i saidplease don'tyou won't now will you laying her silky hand on mine in that kind of a way that i said i would die first
i never thought i was so stirred up she says now go on and i won't do so any more
you tell me what to do and whatever you say i'll do it well i says it's a rough gang them two frauds and i'm fixed so i got to travel with them a while longer whether i want to or noti druther not tell you why and if you was to blow on them this town would get me out of their claws and i'd be all right but there'd be another person that you don't know about who'd be in big trouble
well we got to save him hain't we
of course
well then we won't blow on them saying them words put a good idea in my head
i see how maybe i could get me and jim rid of the frauds get them jailed here and then leave
but i didn't want to run the raft in the daytime without anybody aboard to answer questions but me so i didn't want the plan to begin working till pretty late tonight
i says miss mary jane i'll tell you what we'll do and you won't have to stay at mr lothrop's so long nuther
how fur is it a little short of four milesright out in the country back here well that 'll answer
now you go along out there and lay low till nine or halfpast tonight and then get them to fetch you home againtell them you've thought of something
if you get here before eleven put a candle in this window and if i don't turn up wait till eleven and then if i don't turn up it means i'm gone and out of the way and safe
then you come out and spread the news around and get these beats jailed good she says i'll do it and if it just happens so that i don't get away but get took up along with them you must up and say i told you the whole thing beforehand and you must stand by me all you can stand by you
indeed i will
they sha'n't touch a hair of your head she says and i see her nostrils spread and her eyes snap when she said it too
if i get away i sha'n't be here i says to prove these rapscallions ain't your uncles and i couldn't do it if i was here
i could swear they was beats and bummers that's all though that's worth something
well there's others can do that better than what i can and they're people that ain't going to be doubted as quick as i'd be
i'll tell you how to find them
gimme a pencil and a piece of paper
there'royal nonesuch bricksville'
put it away and don't lose it
when the court wants to find out something about these two let them send up to bricksville and say they've got the men that played the royal nonesuch and ask for some witnesseswhy you'll have that entire town down here before you can hardly wink miss mary
and they'll come abiling too i judged we had got everything fixed about right now
so i says just let the auction go right along and don't worry
nobody don't have to pay for the things they buy till a whole day after the auction on accounts of the short notice and they ain't going out of this till they get that money and the way we've fixed it the sale ain't going to count and they ain't going to get no money
it's just like the way it was with the niggersit warn't no sale and the niggers will be back before long
why they can't collect the money for the niggers yetthey're in the worst kind of a fix miss mary well she says i'll run down to breakfast now and then i'll start straight for mr lothrop's 'deed that ain't the ticket miss mary jane i says by no manner of means go before breakfast why what did you reckon i wanted you to go at all for miss mary well i never thoughtand come to think i don't know
what was it why it's because you ain't one of these leatherface people
i don't want no better book than what your face is
a body can set down and read it off like coarse print
do you reckon you can go and face your uncles when they come to kiss you goodmorning and never there there don't
yes i'll go before breakfasti'll be glad to
and leave my sisters with them yes never mind about them
they've got to stand it yet a while
they might suspicion something if all of you was to go
i don't want you to see them nor your sisters nor nobody in this town if a neighbor was to ask how is your uncles this morning your face would tell something
no you go right along miss mary jane and i'll fix it with all of them
i'll tell miss susan to give your love to your uncles and say you've went away for a few hours for to get a little rest and change or to see a friend and you'll be back tonight or early in the morning gone to see a friend is all right but i won't have my love given to them well then it sha'n't be it was well enough to tell her sono harm in it
it was only a little thing to do and no trouble and it's the little things that smooths people's roads the most down here below it would make mary jane comfortable and it wouldn't cost nothing
then i says there's one more thingthat bag of money well they've got that and it makes me feel pretty silly to think how they got it no you're out there
they hain't got it why who's got it i wish i knowed but i don't
i had it because i stole it from them and i stole it to give to you and i know where i hid it but i'm afraid it ain't there no more
i'm awful sorry miss mary jane i'm just as sorry as i can be but i done the best i could i did honest
i come nigh getting caught and i had to shove it into the first place i come to and runand it warn't a good place oh stop blaming yourselfit's too bad to do it and i won't allow ityou couldn't help it it wasn't your fault
where did you hide it i didn't want to set her to thinking about her troubles again and i couldn't seem to get my mouth to tell her what would make her see that corpse laying in the coffin with that bag of money on his stomach
so for a minute i didn't say nothing then i says i'd ruther not tell you where i put it miss mary jane if you don't mind letting me off but i'll write it for you on a piece of paper and you can read it along the road to mr lothrop's if you want to
do you reckon that 'll do oh yes so i wrote i put it in the coffin
it was in there when you was crying there away in the night
i was behind the door and i was mighty sorry for you miss mary jane it made my eyes water a little to remember her crying there all by herself in the night and them devils laying there right under her own roof shaming her and robbing her and when i folded it up and give it to her i see the water come into her eyes too and she shook me by the hand hard and says goodbye
i'm going to do everything just as you've told me and if i don't ever see you again i sha'n't ever forget you and i'll think of you a many and a many a time and i'll pray for you tooand she was gone
pray for me
i reckoned if she knowed me she'd take a job that was more nearer her size
but i bet she done it just the sameshe was just that kind
she had the grit to pray for judus if she took the notionthere warn't no backdown to her i judge
you may say what you want to but in my opinion she had more sand in her than any girl i ever see in my opinion she was just full of sand
it sounds like flattery but it ain't no flattery
and when it comes to beautyand goodness tooshe lays over them all
i hain't ever seen her since that time that i see her go out of that door no i hain't ever seen her since but i reckon i've thought of her a many and a many a million times and of her saying she would pray for me and if ever i'd a thought it would do any good for me to pray for her blamed if i wouldn't a done it or bust
well mary jane she lit out the back way i reckon because nobody see her go
when i struck susan and the harelip i says what's the name of them people over on t'other side of the river that you all goes to see sometimes they says there's several but it's the proctors mainly that's the name i says i most forgot it
well miss mary jane she told me to tell you she's gone over there in a dreadful hurryone of them's sick which one i don't know leastways i kinder forget but i thinks it's sakes alive i hope it ain't hanner i'm sorry to say it i says but hanner's the very one my goodness and she so well only last week
is she took bad it ain't no name for it
they set up with her all night miss mary jane said and they don't think she'll last many hours only think of that now
what's the matter with her i couldn't think of anything reasonable right off that way so i says mumps mumps your granny
they don't set up with people that's got the mumps they don't don't they
you better bet they do with these mumps
these mumps is different
it's a new kind miss mary jane said how's it a new kind because it's mixed up with other things what other things well measles and whoopingcough and erysiplas and consumption and yaller janders and brainfever and i don't know what all my land
and they call it the mumps that's what miss mary jane said well what in the nation do they call it the mumps for why because it is the mumps
that's what it starts with well ther' ain't no sense in it
a body might stump his toe and take pison and fall down the well and break his neck and bust his brains out and somebody come along and ask what killed him and some numskull up and say 'why he stumped his toe'
would ther' be any sense in that
no
and ther' ain't no sense in this nuther
is it ketching is it ketching
why how you talk
is a harrow catchingin the dark
if you don't hitch on to one tooth you're bound to on another ain't you
and you can't get away with that tooth without fetching the whole harrow along can you
well these kind of mumps is a kind of a harrow as you may sayand it ain't no slouch of a harrow nuther you come to get it hitched on good well it's awful i think says the harelip
i'll go to uncle harvey and oh yes i says i would
of course i would
i wouldn't lose no time well why wouldn't you just look at it a minute and maybe you can see
hain't your uncles obleegd to get along home to england as fast as they can
and do you reckon they'd be mean enough to go off and leave you to go all that journey by yourselves
you know they'll wait for you
so fur so good
your uncle harvey's a preacher ain't he
very well then is a preacher going to deceive a steamboat clerk
is he going to deceive a ship clerkso as to get them to let miss mary jane go aboard
now you know he ain't
what will he do then
why he'll say 'it's a great pity but my church matters has got to get along the best way they can for my niece has been exposed to the dreadful pluribusunum mumps and so it's my bounden duty to set down here and wait the three months it takes to show on her if she's got it'
but never mind if you think it's best to tell your uncle harvey shucks and stay fooling around here when we could all be having good times in england whilst we was waiting to find out whether mary jane's got it or not
why you talk like a muggins well anyway maybe you'd better tell some of the neighbors listen at that now
you do beat all for natural stupidness
can't you see that they'd go and tell
ther' ain't no way but just to not tell anybody at all well maybe you're rightyes i judge you are right but i reckon we ought to tell uncle harvey she's gone out a while anyway so he won't be uneasy about her yes miss mary jane she wanted you to do that
she says 'tell them to give uncle harvey and william my love and a kiss and say i've run over the river to see mr'mrwhat is the name of that rich family your uncle peter used to think so much ofi mean the one that why you must mean the apthorps ain't it of course bother them kind of names a body can't ever seem to remember them half the time somehow
yes she said say she has run over for to ask the apthorps to be sure and come to the auction and buy this house because she allowed her uncle peter would ruther they had it than anybody else and she's going to stick to them till they say they'll come and then if she ain't too tired she's coming home and if she is she'll be home in the morning anyway
she said don't say nothing about the proctors but only about the apthorpswhich 'll be perfectly true because she is going there to speak about their buying the house i know it because she told me so herself all right they said and cleared out to lay for their uncles and give them the love and the kisses and tell them the message
everything was all right now
the girls wouldn't say nothing because they wanted to go to england and the king and the duke would ruther mary jane was off working for the auction than around in reach of doctor robinson
i felt very good i judged i had done it pretty neati reckoned tom sawyer couldn't a done it no neater himself
of course he would a throwed more style into it but i can't do that very handy not being brung up to it
well they held the auction in the public square along towards the end of the afternoon and it strung along and strung along and the old man he was on hand and looking his level pisonest up there longside of the auctioneer and chipping in a little scripture now and then or a little goodygoody saying of some kind and the duke he was around googooing for sympathy all he knowed how and just spreading himself generly
but by and by the thing dragged through and everything was soldeverything but a little old trifling lot in the graveyard
so they'd got to work that offi never see such a girafft as the king was for wanting to swallow everything
well whilst they was at it a steamboat landed and in about two minutes up comes a crowd awhooping and yelling and laughing and carrying on and singing out here's your opposition line
here's your two sets o' heirs to old peter wilksand you pays your money and you takes your choice they was fetching a very nicelooking old gentleman along and a nicelooking younger one with his right arm in a sling
and my souls how the people yelled and laughed and kept it up
but i didn't see no joke about it and i judged it would strain the duke and the king some to see any
i reckoned they'd turn pale
but no nary a pale did they turn
the duke he never let on he suspicioned what was up but just went a googooing around happy and satisfied like a jug that's googling out buttermilk and as for the king he just gazed and gazed down sorrowful on them newcomers like it give him the stomachache in his very heart to think there could be such frauds and rascals in the world
oh he done it admirable
lots of the principal people gethered around the king to let him see they was on his side
that old gentleman that had just come looked all puzzled to death
pretty soon he begun to speak and i see straight off he pronounced like an englishmannot the king's way though the king's was pretty good for an imitation
i can't give the old gent's words nor i can't imitate him but he turned around to the crowd and says about like this this is a surprise to me which i wasn't looking for and i'll acknowledge candid and frank i ain't very well fixed to meet it and answer it for my brother and me has had misfortunes he's broke his arm and our baggage got put off at a town above here last night in the night by a mistake
i am peter wilks' brother harvey and this is his brother william which can't hear nor speakand can't even make signs to amount to much now't he's only got one hand to work them with
we are who we say we are and in a day or two when i get the baggage i can prove it
but up till then i won't say nothing more but go to the hotel and wait so him and the new dummy started off and the king he laughs and blethers out broke his armvery likely ain't itand very convenient too for a fraud that's got to make signs and ain't learnt how
lost their baggage
that's mighty goodand mighty ingeniousunder the circumstances so he laughed again and so did everybody else except three or four or maybe half a dozen
one of these was that doctor another one was a sharplooking gentleman with a carpetbag of the oldfashioned kind made out of carpetstuff that had just come off of the steamboat and was talking to him in a low voice and glancing towards the king now and then and nodding their headsit was levi bell the lawyer that was gone up to louisville and another one was a big rough husky that come along and listened to all the old gentleman said and was listening to the king now
and when the king got done this husky up and says say looky here if you are harvey wilks when'd you come to this town the day before the funeral friend says the king
but what time o' day in the evenin''bout an hour er two before sundown how'd you come i come down on the susan powell from cincinnati well then how'd you come to be up at the pint in the mornin'in a canoe i warn't up at the pint in the mornin' it's a lie several of them jumped for him and begged him not to talk that way to an old man and a preacher
preacher be hanged he's a fraud and a liar
he was up at the pint that mornin'
i live up there don't i
well i was up there and he was up there
i see him there
he come in a canoe along with tim collins and a boy the doctor he up and says would you know the boy again if you was to see him hines i reckon i would but i don't know
why yonder he is now
i know him perfectly easy it was me he pointed at
the doctor says neighbors i don't know whether the new couple is frauds or not but if these two ain't frauds i am an idiot that's all
i think it's our duty to see that they don't get away from here till we've looked into this thing
come along hines come along the rest of you
we'll take these fellows to the tavern and affront them with t'other couple and i reckon we'll find out something before we get through it was nuts for the crowd though maybe not for the king's friends so we all started
it was about sundown
the doctor he led me along by the hand and was plenty kind enough but he never let go my hand
we all got in a big room in the hotel and lit up some candles and fetched in the new couple
first the doctor says i don't wish to be too hard on these two men but i think they're frauds and they may have complices that we don't know nothing about
if they have won't the complices get away with that bag of gold peter wilks left
it ain't unlikely
if these men ain't frauds they won't object to sending for that money and letting us keep it till they prove they're all rightain't that so everybody agreed to that
so i judged they had our gang in a pretty tight place right at the outstart
but the king he only looked sorrowful and says gentlemen i wish the money was there for i ain't got no disposition to throw anything in the way of a fair open outandout investigation o' this misable business but alas the money ain't there you k'n send and see if you want to where is it then well when my niece give it to me to keep for her i took and hid it inside o' the straw tick o' my bed not wishin' to bank it for the few days we'd be here and considerin' the bed a safe place we not bein' used to niggers and suppos'n' 'em honest like servants in england
the niggers stole it the very next mornin' after i had went down stairs and when i sold 'em i hadn't missed the money yit so they got clean away with it
my servant here k'n tell you 'bout it gentlemen the doctor and several said shucks and i see nobody didn't altogether believe him
one man asked me if i see the niggers steal it
i said no but i see them sneaking out of the room and hustling away and i never thought nothing only i reckoned they was afraid they had waked up my master and was trying to get away before he made trouble with them
that was all they asked me
then the doctor whirls on me and says are you english too i says yes and him and some others laughed and said stuff well then they sailed in on the general investigation and there we had it up and down hour in hour out and nobody never said a word about supper nor ever seemed to think about itand so they kept it up and kept it up and it was the worst mixedup thing you ever see
they made the king tell his yarn and they made the old gentleman tell his'n and anybody but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would a seen that the old gentleman was spinning truth and t'other one lies
and by and by they had me up to tell what i knowed
the king he give me a lefthanded look out of the corner of his eye and so i knowed enough to talk on the right side
i begun to tell about sheffield and how we lived there and all about the english wilkses and so on but i didn't get pretty fur till the doctor begun to laugh and levi bell the lawyer says set down my boy i wouldn't strain myself if i was you
i reckon you ain't used to lying it don't seem to come handy what you want is practice
you do it pretty awkward i didn't care nothing for the compliment but i was glad to be let off anyway
the doctor he started to say something and turns and says if you'd been in town at first levi bell the king broke in and reached out his hand and says why is this my poor dead brother's old friend that he's wrote so often about the lawyer and him shook hands and the lawyer smiled and looked pleased and they talked right along awhile and then got to one side and talked low and at last the lawyer speaks up and says that 'll fix it
i'll take the order and send it along with your brother's and then they'll know it's all right so they got some paper and a pen and the king he set down and twisted his head to one side and chawed his tongue and scrawled off something and then they give the pen to the dukeand then for the first time the duke looked sick
but he took the pen and wrote
so then the lawyer turns to the new old gentleman and says you and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names the old gentleman wrote but nobody couldn't read it
the lawyer looked powerful astonished and says well it beats meand snaked a lot of old letters out of his pocket and examined them and then examined the old man's writing and then them again and then says these old letters is from harvey wilks and here's these two handwritings and anybody can see they didn't write them the king and the duke looked sold and foolish i tell you to see how the lawyer had took them in and here's this old gentleman's hand writing and anybody can tell easy enough he didn't write themfact is the scratches he makes ain't properly writing at all
now here's some letters from the new old gentleman says if you please let me explain
nobody can read my hand but my brother thereso he copies for me
it's his hand you've got there not mine well says the lawyer this is a state of things
i've got some of william's letters too so if you'll get him to write a line or so we can com he can't write with his left hand says the old gentleman
if he could use his right hand you would see that he wrote his own letters and mine too
look at both pleasethey're by the same hand the lawyer done it and says i believe it's soand if it ain't so there's a heap stronger resemblance than i'd noticed before anyway
well well well
i thought we was right on the track of a solution but it's gone to grass partly
but anyway one thing is provedthese two ain't either of 'em wilksesand he wagged his head towards the king and the duke
well what do you think
that muleheaded old fool wouldn't give in then
indeed he wouldn't
said it warn't no fair test
said his brother william was the cussedest joker in the world and hadn't tried to writehe see william was going to play one of his jokes the minute he put the pen to paper
and so he warmed up and went warbling and warbling right along till he was actuly beginning to believe what he was saying himself but pretty soon the new gentleman broke in and says i've thought of something
is there anybody here that helped to lay out my brhelped to lay out the late peter wilks for burying yes says somebody me and ab turner done it
we're both here then the old man turns towards the king and says perhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breast blamed if the king didn't have to brace up mighty quick or he'd a squshed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under it took him so sudden and mind you it was a thing that was calculated to make most anybody sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without any notice because how was he going to know what was tattooed on the man
he whitened a little he couldn't help it and it was mighty still in there and everybody bending a little forwards and gazing at him
says i to myself now he'll throw up the spongethere ain't no more use
well did he
a body can't hardly believe it but he didn't
i reckon he thought he'd keep the thing up till he tired them people out so they'd thin out and him and the duke could break loose and get away
anyway he set there and pretty soon he begun to smile and says mf
it's a very tough question ain't it
yes sir i k'n tell you what's tattooed on his breast
it's jest a small thin blue arrowthat's what it is and if you don't look clost you can't see it
now what do you sayhey well i never see anything like that old blister for clean outandout cheek
the new old gentleman turns brisk towards ab turner and his pard and his eye lights up like he judged he'd got the king this time and says thereyou've heard what he said
was there any such mark on peter wilks' breast both of them spoke up and says we didn't see no such mark good says the old gentleman
now what you did see on his breast was a small dim p and a b which is an initial he dropped when he was young and a w with dashes between them so pbwand he marked them that way on a piece of paper
come ain't that what you saw both of them spoke up again and says no we didn't
we never seen any marks at all well everybody was in a state of mind now and they sings out the whole bilin' of 'm 's frauds
le's duck 'em
le's drown 'em
le's ride 'em on a rail and everybody was whooping at once and there was a rattling powwow
but the lawyer he jumps on the table and yells and says gentlemengentlemen hear me just a wordjust a single wordif you please
there's one way yetlet's go and dig up the corpse and look that took them
hooray they all shouted and was starting right off but the lawyer and the doctor sung out hold on hold on
collar all these four men and the boy and fetch them along too we'll do it they all shouted and if we don't find them marks we'll lynch the whole gang i was scared now i tell you
but there warn't no getting away you know
they gripped us all and marched us right along straight for the graveyard which was a mile and a half down the river and the whole town at our heels for we made noise enough and it was only nine in the evening
as we went by our house i wished i hadn't sent mary jane out of town because now if i could tip her the wink she'd light out and save me and blow on our deadbeats
well we swarmed along down the river road just carrying on like wildcats and to make it more scary the sky was darking up and the lightning beginning to wink and flitter and the wind to shiver amongst the leaves
this was the most awful trouble and most dangersome i ever was in and i was kinder stunned everything was going so different from what i had allowed for stead of being fixed so i could take my own time if i wanted to and see all the fun and have mary jane at my back to save me and set me free when the closefit come here was nothing in the world betwixt me and sudden death but just them tattoomarks
if they didn't find them i couldn't bear to think about it and yet somehow i couldn't think about nothing else
it got darker and darker and it was a beautiful time to give the crowd the slip but that big husky had me by the wristhinesand a body might as well try to give goliar the slip
he dragged me right along he was so excited and i had to run to keep up
when they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over it like an overflow
and when they got to the grave they found they had about a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted but nobody hadn't thought to fetch a lantern
but they sailed into digging anyway by the flicker of the lightning and sent a man to the nearest house a half a mile off to borrow one
so they dug and dug like everything and it got awful dark and the rain started and the wind swished and swushed along and the lightning come brisker and brisker and the thunder boomed but them people never took no notice of it they was so full of this business and one minute you could see everything and every face in that big crowd and the shovelfuls of dirt sailing up out of the grave and the next second the dark wiped it all out and you couldn't see nothing at all
at last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid and then such another crowding and shouldering and shoving as there was to scrouge in and get a sight you never see and in the dark that way it was awful
hines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging so and i reckon he clean forgot i was in the world he was so excited and panting
all of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare and somebody sings out by the living jingo here's the bag of gold on his breast hines let out a whoop like everybody else and dropped my wrist and give a big surge to bust his way in and get a look and the way i lit out and shinned for the road in the dark there ain't nobody can tell
i had the road all to myself and i fairly flewleastways i had it all to myself except the solid dark and the nowandthen glares and the buzzing of the rain and the thrashing of the wind and the splitting of the thunder and sure as you are born i did clip it along
when i struck the town i see there warn't nobody out in the storm so i never hunted for no back streets but humped it straight through the main one and when i begun to get towards our house i aimed my eye and set it
no light there the house all darkwhich made me feel sorry and disappointed i didn't know why
but at last just as i was sailing by flash comes the light in mary jane's window
and my heart swelled up sudden like to bust and the same second the house and all was behind me in the dark and wasn't ever going to be before me no more in this world
she was the best girl i ever see and had the most sand
the minute i was far enough above the town to see i could make the towhead i begun to look sharp for a boat to borrow and the first time the lightning showed me one that wasn't chained i snatched it and shoved
it was a canoe and warn't fastened with nothing but a rope
the towhead was a rattling big distance off away out there in the middle of the river but i didn't lose no time and when i struck the raft at last i was so fagged i would a just laid down to blow and gasp if i could afforded it
but i didn't
as i sprung aboard i sung out out with you jim and set her loose
glory be to goodness we're shut of them jim lit out and was acoming for me with both arms spread he was so full of joy but when i glimpsed him in the lightning my heart shot up in my mouth and i went overboard backwards for i forgot he was old king lear and a drownded arab all in one and it most scared the livers and lights out of me
but jim fished me out and was going to hug me and bless me and so on he was so glad i was back and we was shut of the king and the duke but i says not now have it for breakfast have it for breakfast
cut loose and let her slide so in two seconds away we went asliding down the river and it did seem so good to be free again and all by ourselves on the big river and nobody to bother us
i had to skip around a bit and jump up and crack my heels a few timesi couldn't help it but about the third crack i noticed a sound that i knowed mighty well and held my breath and listened and waited and sure enough when the next flash busted out over the water here they comeand just alaying to their oars and making their skiff hum
it was the king and the duke
so i wilted right down on to the planks then and give up and it was all i could do to keep from crying
when they got aboard the king went for me and shook me by the collar and says tryin' to give us the slip was ye you pup
tired of our company hey i says no your majesty we warn'tplease don't your majesty quick then and tell us what was your idea or i'll shake the insides out o' you honest i'll tell you everything just as it happened your majesty
the man that had aholt of me was very good to me and kept saying he had a boy about as big as me that died last year and he was sorry to see a boy in such a dangerous fix and when they was all took by surprise by finding the gold and made a rush for the coffin he lets go of me and whispers 'heel it now or they'll hang ye sure'
and i lit out
it didn't seem no good for me to stayi couldn't do nothing and i didn't want to be hung if i could get away
so i never stopped running till i found the canoe and when i got here i told jim to hurry or they'd catch me and hang me yet and said i was afeard you and the duke wasn't alive now and i was awful sorry and so was jim and was awful glad when we see you coming you may ask jim if i didn't jim said it was so and the king told him to shut up and said oh yes it's mighty likely and shook me up again and said he reckoned he'd drownd me
but the duke says leggo the boy you old idiot
would you a done any different
did you inquire around for him when you got loose
i don't remember it so the king let go of me and begun to cuss that town and everybody in it
but the duke says you better a blame' sight give yourself a good cussing for you're the one that's entitled to it most
you hain't done a thing from the start that had any sense in it except coming out so cool and cheeky with that imaginary bluearrow mark
that was brightit was right down bully and it was the thing that saved us
for if it hadn't been for that they'd a jailed us till them englishmen's baggage comeand thenthe penitentiary you bet
but that trick took 'em to the graveyard and the gold done us a still bigger kindness for if the excited fools hadn't let go all holts and made that rush to get a look we'd a slept in our cravats tonightcravats warranted to wear toolonger than we'd need 'em they was still a minutethinking then the king says kind of absentminded like mf
and we reckoned the niggers stole it that made me squirm
yes says the duke kinder slow and deliberate and sarcastic we did after about a half a minute the king drawls out leastways i did the duke says the same way on the contrary i did the king kind of ruffles up and says looky here bilgewater what'r you referrin' to the duke says pretty brisk when it comes to that maybe you'll let me ask what was you referring to shucks says the king very sarcastic but i don't knowmaybe you was asleep and didn't know what you was about the duke bristles up now and says oh let up on this cussed nonsense do you take me for a blame' fool
don't you reckon i know who hid that money in that coffin yes sir
i know you do know because you done it yourself it's a lieand the duke went for him
the king sings out take y'r hands offleggo my throati take it all back the duke says well you just own up first that you did hide that money there intending to give me the slip one of these days and come back and dig it up and have it all to yourself wait jest a minute dukeanswer me this one question honest and fair if you didn't put the money there say it and i'll b'lieve you and take back everything i said you old scoundrel i didn't and you know i didn't
there now well then i b'lieve you
but answer me only jest this one morenow don't git mad didn't you have it in your mind to hook the money and hide it the duke never said nothing for a little bit then he says well i don't care if i did i didn't do it anyway
but you not only had it in mind to do it but you done it i wisht i never die if i done it duke and that's honest
i won't say i warn't goin' to do it because i was but youi mean somebodygot in ahead o' me it's a lie
you done it and you got to say you done it or the king began to gurgle and then he gasps out 'noughi own up i was very glad to hear him say that it made me feel much more easier than what i was feeling before
so the duke took his hands off and says if you ever deny it again i'll drown you
it's well for you to set there and blubber like a babyit's fitten for you after the way you've acted
i never see such an old ostrich for wanting to gobble everythingand i atrusting you all the time like you was my own father
you ought to been ashamed of yourself to stand by and hear it saddled on to a lot of poor niggers and you never say a word for 'em
it makes me feel ridiculous to think i was soft enough to believe that rubbage
cuss you i can see now why you was so anxious to make up the deffisityou wanted to get what money i'd got out of the nonesuch and one thing or another and scoop it all the king says timid and still asnuffling why duke it was you that said make up the deffisit it warn't me dry up
i don't want to hear no more out of you says the duke
and now you see what you got by it
they've got all their own money back and all of ourn but a shekel or two besides
g'long to bed and don't you deffersit me no more deffersits long 's you live so the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort and before long the duke tackled his bottle and so in about a half an hour they was as thick as thieves again and the tighter they got the lovinger they got and went off asnoring in each other's arms
they both got powerful mellow but i noticed the king didn't get mellow enough to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the moneybag again
that made me feel easy and satisfied
of course when they got to snoring we had a long gabble and i told jim everything
we dasn't stop again at any town for days and days kept right along down the river
we was down south in the warm weather now and a mighty long ways from home
we begun to come to trees with spanish moss on them hanging down from the limbs like long gray beards
it was the first i ever see it growing and it made the woods look solemn and dismal
so now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger and they begun to work the villages again
first they done a lecture on temperance but they didn't make enough for them both to get drunk on
then in another village they started a dancingschool but they didn't know no more how to dance than a kangaroo does so the first prance they made the general public jumped in and pranced them out of town
another time they tried to go at yellocution but they didn't yellocute long till the audience got up and give them a solid good cussing and made them skip out
they tackled missionarying and mesmerizing and doctoring and telling fortunes and a little of everything but they couldn't seem to have no luck
so at last they got just about dead broke and laid around the raft as she floated along thinking and thinking and never saying nothing by the half a day at a time and dreadful blue and desperate
and at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads together in the wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a time
jim and me got uneasy
we didn't like the look of it
we judged they was studying up some kind of worse deviltry than ever
we turned it over and over and at last we made up our minds they was going to break into somebody's house or store or was going into the counterfeitmoney business or something
so then we was pretty scared and made up an agreement that we wouldn't have nothing in the world to do with such actions and if we ever got the least show we would give them the cold shake and clear out and leave them behind
well early one morning we hid the raft in a good safe place about two mile below a little bit of a shabby village named pikesville and the king he went ashore and told us all to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt around to see if anybody had got any wind of the royal nonesuch there yet
house to rob you mean says i to myself and when you get through robbing it you'll come back here and wonder what has become of me and jim and the raftand you'll have to take it out in wondering and he said if he warn't back by midday the duke and me would know it was all right and we was to come along
so we stayed where we was
the duke he fretted and sweated around and was in a mighty sour way
he scolded us for everything and we couldn't seem to do nothing right he found fault with every little thing
something was abrewing sure
i was good and glad when midday come and no king we could have a change anywayand maybe a chance for the change on top of it
so me and the duke went up to the village and hunted around there for the king and by and by we found him in the back room of a little low doggery very tight and a lot of loafers bullyragging him for sport and he acussing and athreatening with all his might and so tight he couldn't walk and couldn't do nothing to them
the duke he begun to abuse him for an old fool and the king begun to sass back and the minute they was fairly at it i lit out and shook the reefs out of my hind legs and spun down the river road like a deer for i see our chance and i made up my mind that it would be a long day before they ever see me and jim again
i got down there all out of breath but loaded up with joy and sung out set her loose jim
we're all right now but there warn't no answer and nobody come out of the wigwam
jim was gone
i set up a shoutand then anotherand then another one and run this way and that in the woods whooping and screeching but it warn't no useold jim was gone
then i set down and cried i couldn't help it
but i couldn't set still long
pretty soon i went out on the road trying to think what i better do and i run across a boy walking and asked him if he'd seen a strange nigger dressed so and so and he says yes whereabouts says i
down to silas phelps' place two mile below here
he's a runaway nigger and they've got him
was you looking for him you bet i ain't
i run across him in the woods about an hour or two ago and he said if i hollered he'd cut my livers outand told me to lay down and stay where i was and i done it
been there ever since afeard to come out well he says you needn't be afeard no more becuz they've got him
he run off f'm down south som'ers it's a good job they got him well i reckon
there's two hunderd dollars reward on him
it's like picking up money out'n the road yes it isand i could a had it if i'd been big enough i see him first
who nailed him it was an old fellowa strangerand he sold out his chance in him for forty dollars becuz he's got to go up the river and can't wait
think o' that now
you bet i'd wait if it was seven year that's me every time says i
but maybe his chance ain't worth no more than that if he'll sell it so cheap
maybe there's something ain't straight about it but it is thoughstraight as a string
i see the handbill myself
it tells all about him to a dotpaints him like a picture and tells the plantation he's frum below newrleans
nosirreebob they ain't no trouble 'bout that speculation you bet you
say gimme a chaw tobacker won't ye i didn't have none so he left
i went to the raft and set down in the wigwam to think
but i couldn't come to nothing
i thought till i wore my head sore but i couldn't see no way out of the trouble
after all this long journey and after all we'd done for them scoundrels here it was all come to nothing everything all busted up and ruined because they could have the heart to serve jim such a trick as that and make him a slave again all his life and amongst strangers too for forty dirty dollars
once i said to myself it would be a thousand times better for jim to be a slave at home where his family was as long as he'd got to be a slave and so i'd better write a letter to tom sawyer and tell him to tell miss watson where he was
but i soon give up that notion for two things she'd be mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulness for leaving her and so she'd sell him straight down the river again and if she didn't everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger and they'd make jim feel it all the time and so he'd feel ornery and disgraced
and then think of me
it would get all around that huck finn helped a nigger to get his freedom and if i was ever to see anybody from that town again i'd be ready to get down and lick his boots for shame
that's just the way a person does a lowdown thing and then he don't want to take no consequences of it
thinks as long as he can hide it it ain't no disgrace
that was my fix exactly
the more i studied about this the more my conscience went to grinding me and the more wicked and lowdown and ornery i got to feeling
and at last when it hit me all of a sudden that here was the plain hand of providence slapping me in the face and letting me know my wickedness was being watched all the time from up there in heaven whilst i was stealing a poor old woman's nigger that hadn't ever done me no harm and now was showing me there's one that's always on the lookout and ain't agoing to allow no such miserable doings to go only just so fur and no further i most dropped in my tracks i was so scared
well i tried the best i could to kinder soften it up somehow for myself by saying i was brung up wicked and so i warn't so much to blame but something inside of me kept saying there was the sundayschool you could a gone to it and if you'd a done it they'd a learnt you there that people that acts as i'd been acting about that nigger goes to everlasting fire it made me shiver
and i about made up my mind to pray and see if i couldn't try to quit being the kind of a boy i was and be better
so i kneeled down
but the words wouldn't come
why wouldn't they
it warn't no use to try and hide it from him
nor from me neither
i knowed very well why they wouldn't come
it was because my heart warn't right it was because i warn't square it was because i was playing double
i was letting on to give up sin but away inside of me i was holding on to the biggest one of all
i was trying to make my mouth say i would do the right thing and the clean thing and go and write to that nigger's owner and tell where he was but deep down in me i knowed it was a lie and he knowed it
you can't pray a liei found that out
so i was full of trouble full as i could be and didn't know what to do
at last i had an idea and i says i'll go and write the letterand then see if i can pray
why it was astonishing the way i felt as light as a feather right straight off and my troubles all gone
so i got a piece of paper and a pencil all glad and excited and set down and wrote miss watson your runaway nigger jim is down here two mile below pikesville and mr phelps has got him and he will give him up for the reward if you send
huck finn i felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time i had ever felt so in my life and i knowed i could pray now
but i didn't do it straight off but laid the paper down and set there thinkingthinking how good it was all this happened so and how near i come to being lost and going to hell
and went on thinking
and got to thinking over our trip down the river and i see jim before me all the time in the day and in the nighttime sometimes moonlight sometimes storms and we afloating along talking and singing and laughing
but somehow i couldn't seem to strike no places to harden me against him but only the other kind
i'd see him standing my watch on top of his'n 'stead of calling me so i could go on sleeping and see him how glad he was when i come back out of the fog and when i come to him again in the swamp up there where the feud was and suchlike times and would always call me honey and pet me and do everything he could think of for me and how good he always was and at last i struck the time i saved him by telling the men we had smallpox aboard and he was so grateful and said i was the best friend old jim ever had in the world and the only one he's got now and then i happened to look around and see that paper
it was a close place
i took it up and held it in my hand
i was atrembling because i'd got to decide forever betwixt two things and i knowed it
i studied a minute sort of holding my breath and then says to myself all right then i'll go to helland tore it up
it was awful thoughts and awful words but they was said
and i let them stay said and never thought no more about reforming
i shoved the whole thing out of my head and said i would take up wickedness again which was in my line being brung up to it and the other warn't
and for a starter i would go to work and steal jim out of slavery again and if i could think up anything worse i would do that too because as long as i was in and in for good i might as well go the whole hog
then i set to thinking over how to get at it and turned over some considerable many ways in my mind and at last fixed up a plan that suited me
so then i took the bearings of a woody island that was down the river a piece and as soon as it was fairly dark i crept out with my raft and went for it and hid it there and then turned in
i slept the night through and got up before it was light and had my breakfast and put on my store clothes and tied up some others and one thing or another in a bundle and took the canoe and cleared for shore
i landed below where i judged was phelps's place and hid my bundle in the woods and then filled up the canoe with water and loaded rocks into her and sunk her where i could find her again when i wanted her about a quarter of a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank
then i struck up the road and when i passed the mill i see a sign on it phelps's sawmill and when i come to the farmhouses two or three hundred yards further along i kept my eyes peeled but didn't see nobody around though it was good daylight now
but i didn't mind because i didn't want to see nobody just yeti only wanted to get the lay of the land
according to my plan i was going to turn up there from the village not from below
so i just took a look and shoved along straight for town
well the very first man i see when i got there was the duke
he was sticking up a bill for the royal nonesuchthreenight performancelike that other time
they had the cheek them frauds
i was right on him before i could shirk
he looked astonished and says hello
where'd you come from then he says kind of glad and eager where's the raftgot her in a good place i says why that's just what i was going to ask your grace then he didn't look so joyful and says what was your idea for asking me he says
well i says when i see the king in that doggery yesterday i says to myself we can't get him home for hours till he's soberer so i went aloafing around town to put in the time and wait
a man up and offered me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch a sheep and so i went along but when we was dragging him to the boat and the man left me aholt of the rope and went behind him to shove him along he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run and we after him
we didn't have no dog and so we had to chase him all over the country till we tired him out
we never got him till dark then we fetched him over and i started down for the raft
when i got there and see it was gone i says to myself 'they've got into trouble and had to leave and they've took my nigger which is the only nigger i've got in the world and now i'm in a strange country and ain't got no property no more nor nothing and no way to make my living' so i set down and cried
i slept in the woods all night
but what did become of the raft thenand jimpoor jim blamed if i knowthat is what's become of the raft
that old fool had made a trade and got forty dollars and when we found him in the doggery the loafers had matched halfdollars with him and got every cent but what he'd spent for whisky and when i got him home late last night and found the raft gone we said 'that little rascal has stole our raft and shook us and run off down the river
' i wouldn't shake my nigger would ithe only nigger i had in the world and the only property we never thought of that
fact is i reckon we'd come to consider him our nigger yes we did consider him sogoodness knows we had trouble enough for him
so when we see the raft was gone and we flat broke there warn't anything for it but to try the royal nonesuch another shake
and i've pegged along ever since dry as a powderhorn
where's that ten cents
give it here i had considerable money so i give him ten cents but begged him to spend it for something to eat and give me some because it was all the money i had and i hadn't had nothing to eat since yesterday
he never said nothing
the next minute he whirls on me and says do you reckon that nigger would blow on us
we'd skin him if he done that how can he blow
hain't he run off no
that old fool sold him and never divided with me and the money's gone sold him i says and begun to cry why he was my nigger and that was my money
where is hei want my nigger well you can't get your nigger that's allso dry up your blubbering
looky heredo you think you'd venture to blow on us
blamed if i think i'd trust you
why if you was to blow on us he stopped but i never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyes before
i went on awhimpering and says i don't want to blow on nobody and i ain't got no time to blow nohow
i got to turn out and find my nigger he looked kinder bothered and stood there with his bills fluttering on his arm thinking and wrinkling up his forehead
at last he says i'll tell you something
we got to be here three days
if you'll promise you won't blow and won't let the nigger blow i'll tell you where to find him so i promised and he says a farmer by the name of silas ph and then he stopped
you see he started to tell me the truth but when he stopped that way and begun to study and think again i reckoned he was changing his mind
and so he was
he wouldn't trust me he wanted to make sure of having me out of the way the whole three days
so pretty soon he says the man that bought him is named abram fosterabram g fosterand he lives forty mile back here in the country on the road to lafayette all right i says i can walk it in three days
and i'll start this very afternoon no you wont you'll start now and don't you lose any time about it neither nor do any gabbling by the way
just keep a tight tongue in your head and move right along and then you won't get into trouble with us d'ye hear that was the order i wanted and that was the one i played for
i wanted to be left free to work my plans
so clear out he says and you can tell mr foster whatever you want to
maybe you can get him to believe that jim is your niggersome idiots don't require documentsleastways i've heard there's such down south here
and when you tell him the handbill and the reward's bogus maybe he'll believe you when you explain to him what the idea was for getting 'em out
go 'long now and tell him anything you want to but mind you don't work your jaw any between here and there so i left and struck for the back country
i didn't look around but i kinder felt like he was watching me
but i knowed i could tire him out at that
i went straight out in the country as much as a mile before i stopped then i doubled back through the woods towards phelps'
i reckoned i better start in on my plan straight off without fooling around because i wanted to stop jim's mouth till these fellows could get away
i didn't want no trouble with their kind
i'd seen all i wanted to of them and wanted to get entirely shut of them
when i got there it was all still and sundaylike and hot and sunshiny the hands was gone to the fields and there was them kind of faint dronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem so lonesome and like everybody's dead and gone and if a breeze fans along and quivers the leaves it makes you feel mournful because you feel like it's spirits whisperingspirits that's been dead ever so many yearsand you always think they're talking about you
as a general thing it makes a body wish he was dead too and done with it all
phelps' was one of these little onehorse cotton plantations and they all look alike
a rail fence round a twoacre yard a stile made out of logs sawed off and upended in steps like barrels of a different length to climb over the fence with and for the women to stand on when they are going to jump on to a horse some sickly grasspatches in the big yard but mostly it was bare and smooth like an old hat with the nap rubbed off big double loghouse for the white folkshewed logs with the chinks stopped up with mud or mortar and these mudstripes been whitewashed some time or another roundlog kitchen with a big broad open but roofed passage joining it to the house log smokehouse back of the kitchen three little log niggercabins in a row t'other side the smokehouse one little hut all by itself away down against the back fence and some outbuildings down a piece the other side ashhopper and big kettle to bile soap in by the little hut bench by the kitchen door with bucket of water and a gourd hound asleep there in the sun more hounds asleep round about about three shade trees away off in a corner some currant bushes and gooseberry bushes in one place by the fence outside of the fence a garden and a watermelon patch then the cotton fields begins and after the fields the woods
i went around and clumb over the back stile by the ashhopper and started for the kitchen
when i got a little ways i heard the dim hum of a spinningwheel wailing along up and sinking along down again and then i knowed for certain i wished i was deadfor that is the lonesomest sound in the whole world
i went right along not fixing up any particular plan but just trusting to providence to put the right words in my mouth when the time come for i'd noticed that providence always did put the right words in my mouth if i left it alone
when i got halfway first one hound and then another got up and went for me and of course i stopped and faced them and kept still
and such another powwow as they made
in a quarter of a minute i was a kind of a hub of a wheel as you may sayspokes made out of dogscircle of fifteen of them packed together around me with their necks and noses stretched up towards me abarking and howling and more acoming you could see them sailing over fences and around corners from everywheres
a nigger woman come tearing out of the kitchen with a rollingpin in her hand singing out begone you tige
you spot
begone sah and she fetched first one and then another of them a clip and sent them howling and then the rest followed and the next second half of them come back wagging their tails around me and making friends with me
there ain't no harm in a hound nohow
and behind the woman comes a little nigger girl and two little nigger boys without anything on but towlinen shirts and they hung on to their mother's gown and peeped out from behind her at me bashful the way they always do
and here comes the white woman running from the house about fortyfive or fifty year old bareheaded and her spinningstick in her hand and behind her comes her little white children acting the same way the little niggers was doing
she was smiling all over so she could hardly standand says it's you at lastain't it i out with a yes'm before i thought
she grabbed me and hugged me tight and then gripped me by both hands and shook and shook and the tears come in her eyes and run down over and she couldn't seem to hug and shake enough and kept saying you don't look as much like your mother as i reckoned you would but law sakes i don't care for that i'm so glad to see you
dear dear it does seem like i could eat you up
children it's your cousin tomtell him howdy but they ducked their heads and put their fingers in their mouths and hid behind her
so she run on lize hurry up and get him a hot breakfast right awayor did you get your breakfast on the boat i said i had got it on the boat
so then she started for the house leading me by the hand and the children tagging after
when we got there she set me down in a splitbottomed chair and set herself down on a little low stool in front of me holding both of my hands and says now i can have a good look at you and lawsame i've been hungry for it a many and a many a time all these long years and it's come at last
we been expecting you a couple of days and more
what kep' youboat get aground yes'mshe don't say yes'msay aunt sally
where'd she get aground i didn't rightly know what to say because i didn't know whether the boat would be coming up the river or down
but i go a good deal on instinct and my instinct said she would be coming upfrom down towards orleans
that didn't help me much though for i didn't know the names of bars down that way
i see i'd got to invent a bar or forget the name of the one we got aground onornow i struck an idea and fetched it out it warn't the groundingthat didn't keep us back but a little
we blowed out a cylinderhead good gracious
anybody hurt no'm
killed a nigger well it's lucky because sometimes people do get hurt
two years ago last christmas your uncle silas was coming up from newrleans on the old lally rook and she blowed out a cylinderhead and crippled a man
and i think he died afterwards
he was a baptist
your uncle silas knowed a family in baton rouge that knowed his people very well
yes i remember now he did die
mortification set in and they had to amputate him
but it didn't save him
yes it was mortificationthat was it
he turned blue all over and died in the hope of a glorious resurrection
they say he was a sight to look at
your uncle's been up to the town every day to fetch you
and he's gone again not more'n an hour ago he'll be back any minute now
you must a met him on the road didn't youoldish man with a no i didn't see nobody aunt sally
the boat landed just at daylight and i left my baggage on the wharfboat and went looking around the town and out a piece in the country to put in the time and not get here too soon and so i come down the back way who'd you give the baggage to nobody why child it 'll be stole not where i hid it i reckon it won't i says
how'd you get your breakfast so early on the boat it was kinder thin ice but i says the captain see me standing around and told me i better have something to eat before i went ashore so he took me in the texas to the officers' lunch and give me all i wanted i was getting so uneasy i couldn't listen good
i had my mind on the children all the time i wanted to get them out to one side and pump them a little and find out who i was
but i couldn't get no show mrs phelps kept it up and run on so
pretty soon she made the cold chills streak all down my back because she says but here we're arunning on this way and you hain't told me a word about sis nor any of them
now i'll rest my works a little and you start up yourn just tell me everythingtell me all about 'm all every one of 'm and how they are and what they're doing and what they told you to tell me and every last thing you can think of well i see i was up a stumpand up it good
providence had stood by me this fur all right but i was hard and tight aground now
i see it warn't a bit of use to try to go aheadi'd got to throw up my hand
so i says to myself here's another place where i got to resk the truth
i opened my mouth to begin but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind the bed and says here he comes
stick your head down lowerthere that'll do you can't be seen now
don't you let on you're here
i'll play a joke on him
children don't you say a word i see i was in a fix now
but it warn't no use to worry there warn't nothing to do but just hold still and try and be ready to stand from under when the lightning struck
i had just one little glimpse of the old gentleman when he come in then the bed hid him
mrs phelps she jumps for him and says has he come no says her husband
goodness gracious she says what in the warld can have become of him i can't imagine says the old gentleman and i must say it makes me dreadful uneasy uneasy she says i'm ready to go distracted
he must a come and you've missed him along the road
i know it's sosomething tells me so why sally i couldn't miss him along the roadyou know that but oh dear dear what will sis say
he must a come
you must a missed him
he oh don't distress me any more'n i'm already distressed
i don't know what in the world to make of it
i'm at my wit's end and i don't mind acknowledging 't i'm right down scared
but there's no hope that he's come for he couldn't come and me miss him
sally it's terriblejust terriblesomething's happened to the boat sure why silas
look yonderup the roadain't that somebody coming he sprung to the window at the head of the bed and that give mrs phelps the chance she wanted
she stooped down quick at the foot of the bed and give me a pull and out i come and when he turned back from the window there she stood abeaming and asmiling like a house afire and i standing pretty meek and sweaty alongside
the old gentleman stared and says why who's that who do you reckon 't is i hain't no idea
who is it it's tom sawyer by jings i most slumped through the floor
but there warn't no time to swap knives the old man grabbed me by the hand and shook and kept on shaking and all the time how the woman did dance around and laugh and cry and then how they both did fire off questions about sid and mary and the rest of the tribe
but if they was joyful it warn't nothing to what i was for it was like being born again i was so glad to find out who i was
well they froze to me for two hours and at last when my chin was so tired it couldn't hardly go any more i had told them more about my familyi mean the sawyer familythan ever happened to any six sawyer families
and i explained all about how we blowed out a cylinderhead at the mouth of white river and it took us three days to fix it
which was all right and worked firstrate because they didn't know but what it would take three days to fix it
if i'd a called it a bolthead it would a done just as well
now i was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side and pretty uncomfortable all up the other
being tom sawyer was easy and comfortable and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by i hear a steamboat coughing along down the river
then i says to myself s'pose tom sawyer comes down on that boat
and s'pose he steps in here any minute and sings out my name before i can throw him a wink to keep quiet
well i couldn't have it that way it wouldn't do at all
i must go up the road and waylay him
so i told the folks i reckoned i would go up to the town and fetch down my baggage
the old gentleman was for going along with me but i said no i could drive the horse myself and i druther he wouldn't take no trouble about me
so i started for town in the wagon and when i was halfway i see a wagon coming and sure enough it was tom sawyer and i stopped and waited till he come along
i says hold on and it stopped alongside and his mouth opened up like a trunk and stayed so and he swallowed two or three times like a person that's got a dry throat and then says i hain't ever done you no harm
you know that
so then what you want to come back and ha'nt me for i says i hain't come backi hain't been gone when he heard my voice it righted him up some but he warn't quite satisfied yet
he says don't you play nothing on me because i wouldn't on you
honest injun now you ain't a ghost honest injun i ain't i says
welliiwell that ought to settle it of course but i can't somehow seem to understand it no way
looky here warn't you ever murdered at all no
i warn't ever murdered at alli played it on them
you come in here and feel of me if you don't believe me so he done it and it satisfied him and he was that glad to see me again he didn't know what to do
and he wanted to know all about it right off because it was a grand adventure and mysterious and so it hit him where he lived
but i said leave it alone till by and by and told his driver to wait and we drove off a little piece and i told him the kind of a fix i was in and what did he reckon we better do
he said let him alone a minute and don't disturb him
so he thought and thought and pretty soon he says it's all right i've got it
take my trunk in your wagon and let on it's your'n and you turn back and fool along slow so as to get to the house about the time you ought to and i'll go towards town a piece and take a fresh start and get there a quarter or a half an hour after you and you needn't let on to know me at first i says all right but wait a minute
there's one more thinga thing that nobody don't know but me
and that is there's a nigger here that i'm atrying to steal out of slavery and his name is jimold miss watson's jim he says what
why jim is he stopped and went to studying
i says i know what you'll say
you'll say it's dirty lowdown business but what if it is
i'm low down and i'm agoing to steal him and i want you keep mum and not let on
will you his eye lit up and he says i'll help you steal him well i let go all holts then like i was shot
it was the most astonishing speech i ever heardand i'm bound to say tom sawyer fell considerable in my estimation
only i couldn't believe it
tom sawyer a niggerstealer oh shucks i says you're joking i ain't joking either well then i says joking or no joking if you hear anything said about a runaway nigger don't forget to remember that you don't know nothing about him and i don't know nothing about him then we took the trunk and put it in my wagon and he drove off his way and i drove mine
but of course i forgot all about driving slow on accounts of being glad and full of thinking so i got home a heap too quick for that length of a trip
the old gentleman was at the door and he says why this is wonderful
whoever would a thought it was in that mare to do it
i wish we'd a timed her
and she hain't sweated a hairnot a hair
it's wonderful
why i wouldn't take a hundred dollars for that horse nowi wouldn't honest and yet i'd a sold her for fifteen before and thought 'twas all she was worth that's all he said
he was the innocentest best old soul i ever see
but it warn't surprising because he warn't only just a farmer he was a preacher too and had a little onehorse log church down back of the plantation which he built it himself at his own expense for a church and schoolhouse and never charged nothing for his preaching and it was worth it too
there was plenty other farmerpreachers like that and done the same way down south
in about half an hour tom's wagon drove up to the front stile and aunt sally she see it through the window because it was only about fifty yards and says why there's somebody come
i wonder who 'tis
why i do believe it's a stranger
jimmy that's one of the children run and tell lize to put on another plate for dinner everybody made a rush for the front door because of course a stranger don't come every year and so he lays over the yallerfever for interest when he does come
tom was over the stile and starting for the house the wagon was spinning up the road for the village and we was all bunched in the front door
tom had his store clothes on and an audienceand that was always nuts for tom sawyer
in them circumstances it warn't no trouble to him to throw in an amount of style that was suitable
he warn't a boy to meeky along up that yard like a sheep no he come ca'm and important like the ram
when he got afront of us he lifts his hat ever so gracious and dainty like it was the lid of a box that had butterflies asleep in it and he didn't want to disturb them and says mr
archibald nichols i presume no my boy says the old gentleman i'm sorry to say 't your driver has deceived you nichols's place is down a matter of three mile more
come in come in tom he took a look back over his shoulder and says too latehe's out of sight yes he's gone my son and you must come in and eat your dinner with us and then we'll hitch up and take you down to nichols's oh i can't make you so much trouble i couldn't think of it
i'll walki don't mind the distance but we won't let you walkit wouldn't be southern hospitality to do it
come right in oh do says aunt sally it ain't a bit of trouble to us not a bit in the world
you must stay
it's a long dusty three mile and we can't let you walk
and besides i've already told 'em to put on another plate when i see you coming so you mustn't disappoint us
come right in and make yourself at home so tom he thanked them very hearty and handsome and let himself be persuaded and come in and when he was in he said he was a stranger from hicksville ohio and his name was william thompsonand he made another bow
well he run on and on and on making up stuff about hicksville and everybody in it he could invent and i getting a little nervious and wondering how this was going to help me out of my scrape and at last still talking along he reached over and kissed aunt sally right on the mouth and then settled back again in his chair comfortable and was going on talking but she jumped up and wiped it off with the back of her hand and says you owdacious puppy he looked kind of hurt and says i'm surprised at you m'am you're s'rpwhy what do you reckon i am
i've a good notion to take andsay what do you mean by kissing me he looked kind of humble and says i didn't mean nothing m'am
i didn't mean no harm
iithought you'd like it why you born fool she took up the spinning stick and it looked like it was all she could do to keep from giving him a crack with it
what made you think i'd like it well i don't know
only theytheytold me you would they told you i would
whoever told you's another lunatic
i never heard the beat of it
who's they why everybody
they all said so m'am it was all she could do to hold in and her eyes snapped and her fingers worked like she wanted to scratch him and she says who's 'everybody'
out with their names or ther'll be an idiot short he got up and looked distressed and fumbled his hat and says i'm sorry and i warn't expecting it
they told me to
they all told me to
they all said kiss her and said she'd like it
they all said itevery one of them
but i'm sorry m'am and i won't do it no morei won't honest you won't won't you
well i sh'd reckon you won't no'm i'm honest about it i won't ever do it againtill you ask me till i ask you
well i never see the beat of it in my born days
i lay you'll be the methusalemnumskull of creation before ever i ask youor the likes of you well he says it does surprise me so
i can't make it out somehow
they said you would and i thought you would
but he stopped and looked around slow like he wished he could run across a friendly eye somewheres and fetched up on the old gentleman's and says didn't you think she'd like me to kiss her sir why no iiwell no i b'lieve i didn't then he looks on around the same way to me and says tom didn't you think aunt sally 'd open out her arms and say 'sid sawyer' my land she says breaking in and jumping for him you impudent young rascal to fool a body so and was going to hug him but he fended her off and says no not till you've asked me first so she didn't lose no time but asked him and hugged him and kissed him over and over again and then turned him over to the old man and he took what was left
and after they got a little quiet again she says why dear me i never see such a surprise
we warn't looking for you at all but only tom
sis never wrote to me about anybody coming but him it's because it warn't intended for any of us to come but tom he says but i begged and begged and at the last minute she let me come too so coming down the river me and tom thought it would be a firstrate surprise for him to come here to the house first and for me to by and by tag along and drop in and let on to be a stranger
but it was a mistake aunt sally
this ain't no healthy place for a stranger to come nonot impudent whelps sid
you ought to had your jaws boxed i hain't been so put out since i don't know when
but i don't care i don't mind the termsi'd be willing to stand a thousand such jokes to have you here
well to think of that performance
i don't deny it i was most putrified with astonishment when you give me that smack we had dinner out in that broad open passage betwixt the house and the kitchen and there was things enough on that table for seven familiesand all hot too none of your flabby tough meat that's laid in a cupboard in a damp cellar all night and tastes like a hunk of old cold cannibal in the morning
uncle silas he asked a pretty long blessing over it but it was worth it and it didn't cool it a bit neither the way i've seen them kind of interruptions do lots of times
there was a considerable good deal of talk all the afternoon and me and tom was on the lookout all the time but it warn't no use they didn't happen to say nothing about any runaway nigger and we was afraid to try to work up to it
but at supper at night one of the little boys says pa mayn't tom and sid and me go to the show no says the old man i reckon there ain't going to be any and you couldn't go if there was because the runaway nigger told burton and me all about that scandalous show and burton said he would tell the people so i reckon they've drove the owdacious loafers out of town before this time so there it wasbut i couldn't help it
tom and me was to sleep in the same room and bed so being tired we bid goodnight and went up to bed right after supper and clumb out of the window and down the lightningrod and shoved for the town for i didn't believe anybody was going to give the king and the duke a hint and so if i didn't hurry up and give them one they'd get into trouble sure
on the road tom he told me all about how it was reckoned i was murdered and how pap disappeared pretty soon and didn't come back no more and what a stir there was when jim run away and i told tom all about our royal nonesuch rapscallions and as much of the raft voyage as i had time to and as we struck into the town and up through the the middle of itit was as much as halfafter eight thenhere comes a raging rush of people with torches and an awful whooping and yelling and banging tin pans and blowing horns and we jumped to one side to let them go by and as they went by i see they had the king and the duke astraddle of a railthat is i knowed it was the king and the duke though they was all over tar and feathers and didn't look like nothing in the world that was humanjust looked like a couple of monstrous big soldierplumes
well it made me sick to see it and i was sorry for them poor pitiful rascals it seemed like i couldn't ever feel any hardness against them any more in the world
it was a dreadful thing to see
human beings can be awful cruel to one another
we see we was too latecouldn't do no good
we asked some stragglers about it and they said everybody went to the show looking very innocent and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in the middle of his cavortings on the stage then somebody give a signal and the house rose up and went for them
so we poked along back home and i warn't feeling so brash as i was before but kind of ornery and humble and to blame somehowthough i hadn't done nothing
but that's always the way it don't make no difference whether you do right or wrong a person's conscience ain't got no sense and just goes for him anyway
if i had a yaller dog that didn't know no more than a person's conscience does i would pison him
it takes up more room than all the rest of a person's insides and yet ain't no good nohow
tom sawyer he says the same
we stopped talking and got to thinking
by and by tom says looky here huck what fools we are to not think of it before
i bet i know where jim is no
where in that hut down by the ashhopper
why looky here
when we was at dinner didn't you see a nigger man go in there with some vittles yes what did you think the vittles was for for a dog so 'd i
well it wasn't for a dog why because part of it was watermelon so it wasi noticed it
well it does beat all that i never thought about a dog not eating watermelon
it shows how a body can see and don't see at the same time well the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in and he locked it again when he came out
he fetched uncle a key about the time we got up from tablesame key i bet
watermelon shows man lock shows prisoner and it ain't likely there's two prisoners on such a little plantation and where the people's all so kind and good
jim's the prisoner
all righti'm glad we found it out detective fashion i wouldn't give shucks for any other way
now you work your mind and study out a plan to steal jim and i will study out one too and we'll take the one we like the best what a head for just a boy to have
if i had tom sawyer's head i wouldn't trade it off to be a duke nor mate of a steamboat nor clown in a circus nor nothing i can think of
i went to thinking out a plan but only just to be doing something i knowed very well where the right plan was going to come from
pretty soon tom says ready yes i says
all rightbring it out my plan is this i says
we can easy find out if it's jim in there
then get up my canoe tomorrow night and fetch my raft over from the island
then the first dark night that comes steal the key out of the old man's britches after he goes to bed and shove off down the river on the raft with jim hiding daytimes and running nights the way me and jim used to do before
wouldn't that plan work work
why cert'nly it would work like rats afighting
but it's too blame' simple there ain't nothing to it
what's the good of a plan that ain't no more trouble than that
it's as mild as goosemilk
why huck it wouldn't make no more talk than breaking into a soap factory i never said nothing because i warn't expecting nothing different but i knowed mighty well that whenever he got his plan ready it wouldn't have none of them objections to it
and it didn't
he told me what it was and i see in a minute it was worth fifteen of mine for style and would make jim just as free a man as mine would and maybe get us all killed besides
so i was satisfied and said we would waltz in on it
i needn't tell what it was here because i knowed it wouldn't stay the way it was
i knowed he would be changing it around every which way as we went along and heaving in new bullinesses wherever he got a chance
and that is what he done
well one thing was dead sure and that was that tom sawyer was in earnest and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of slavery
that was the thing that was too many for me
here was a boy that was respectable and well brung up and had a character to lose and folks at home that had characters and he was bright and not leatherheaded and knowing and not ignorant and not mean but kind and yet here he was without any more pride or rightness or feeling than to stoop to this business and make himself a shame and his family a shame before everybody
i couldn't understand it no way at all
it was outrageous and i knowed i ought to just up and tell him so and so be his true friend and let him quit the thing right where he was and save himself
and i did start to tell him but he shut me up and says don't you reckon i know what i'm about
don't i generly know what i'm about yes didn't i say i was going to help steal the nigger yes well then that's all he said and that's all i said
it warn't no use to say any more because when he said he'd do a thing he always done it
but i couldn't make out how he was willing to go into this thing so i just let it go and never bothered no more about it
if he was bound to have it so i couldn't help it
when we got home the house was all dark and still so we went on down to the hut by the ashhopper for to examine it
we went through the yard so as to see what the hounds would do
they knowed us and didn't make no more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything comes by in the night
when we got to the cabin we took a look at the front and the two sides and on the side i warn't acquainted withwhich was the north sidewe found a square windowhole up tolerable high with just one stout board nailed across it
i says here's the ticket
this hole's big enough for jim to get through if we wrench off the board tom says it's as simple as tittattoe threeinarow and as easy as playing hooky
i should hope we can find a way that's a little more complicated than that huck finn well then i says how 'll it do to saw him out the way i done before i was murdered that time that's more like he says
it's real mysterious and troublesome and good he says but i bet we can find a way that's twice as long
there ain't no hurry le's keep on looking around betwixt the hut and the fence on the back side was a leanto that joined the hut at the eaves and was made out of plank
it was as long as the hut but narrowonly about six foot wide
the door to it was at the south end and was padlocked
tom he went to the soapkettle and searched around and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid with so he took it and prized out one of the staples
the chain fell down and we opened the door and went in and shut it and struck a match and see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadn't no connection with it and there warn't no floor to the shed nor nothing in it but some old rusty playedout hoes and spades and picks and a crippled plow
the match went out and so did we and shoved in the staple again and the door was locked as good as ever
tom was joyful
he says now we're all right
we'll dig him out
it 'll take about a week then we started for the house and i went in the back dooryou only have to pull a buckskin latchstring they don't fasten the doorsbut that warn't romantical enough for tom sawyer no way would do him but he must climb up the lightningrod
but after he got up half way about three times and missed fire and fell every time and the last time most busted his brains out he thought he'd got to give it up but after he was rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for luck and this time he made the trip
in the morning we was up at break of day and down to the nigger cabins to pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed jimif it was jim that was being fed
the niggers was just getting through breakfast and starting for the fields and jim's nigger was piling up a tin pan with bread and meat and things and whilst the others was leaving the key come from the house
this nigger had a goodnatured chuckleheaded face and his wool was all tied up in little bunches with thread
that was to keep witches off
he said the witches was pestering him awful these nights and making him see all kinds of strange things and hear all kinds of strange words and noises and he didn't believe he was ever witched so long before in his life
he got so worked up and got to running on so about his troubles he forgot all about what he'd been agoing to do
so tom says what's the vittles for
going to feed the dogs the nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face like when you heave a brickbat in a mudpuddle and he says yes mars sid a dog
cur'us dog too
does you want to go en look at 'im yes i hunched tom and whispers you going right here in the daybreak
that warn't the plan no it warn't but it's the plan now so drat him we went along but i didn't like it much
when we got in we couldn't hardly see anything it was so dark but jim was there sure enough and could see us and he sings out why huck
en good lan'
ain' dat misto tom i just knowed how it would be i just expected it
i didn't know nothing to do and if i had i couldn't a done it because that nigger busted in and says why de gracious sakes
do he know you genlmen we could see pretty well now
tom he looked at the nigger steady and kind of wondering and says does who know us why disyer runaway nigger i don't reckon he does but what put that into your head what put it dar
didn' he jis' dis minute sing out like he knowed you tom says in a puzzledup kind of way well that's mighty curious
who sung out
when did he sing out
what did he sing out and turns to me perfectly ca'm and says did you hear anybody sing out of course there warn't nothing to be said but the one thing so i says no i ain't heard nobody say nothing then he turns to jim and looks him over like he never see him before and says did you sing out no sah says jim i hain't said nothing sah not a word no sah i hain't said a word did you ever see us before no sah not as i knows on so tom turns to the nigger which was looking wild and distressed and says kind of severe what do you reckon's the matter with you anyway
what made you think somebody sung out oh it's de dadblame' witches sah en i wisht i was dead i do
dey's awluz at it sah en dey do mos' kill me dey sk'yers me so
please to don't tell nobody 'bout it sah er ole mars silas he'll scole me 'kase he say dey ain't no witches
i jis' wish to goodness he was heah nowden what would he say
i jis' bet he couldn' fine no way to git aroun' it dis time
but it's awluz jis' so people dat's sot stays sot dey won't look into noth'n'en fine it out f'r deyselves en when you fine it out en tell um 'bout it dey doan' b'lieve you tom give him a dime and said we wouldn't tell nobody and told him to buy some more thread to tie up his wool with and then looks at jim and says i wonder if uncle silas is going to hang this nigger
if i was to catch a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away i wouldn't give him up i'd hang him and whilst the nigger stepped to the door to look at the dime and bite it to see if it was good he whispers to jim and says don't ever let on to know us
and if you hear any digging going on nights it's us we're going to set you free jim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it then the nigger come back and we said we'd come again some time if the nigger wanted us to and he said he would more particular if it was dark because the witches went for him mostly in the dark and it was good to have folks around then
it would be most an hour yet till breakfast so we left and struck down into the woods because tom said we got to have some light to see how to dig by and a lantern makes too much and might get us into trouble what we must have was a lot of them rotten chunks that's called foxfire and just makes a soft kind of a glow when you lay them in a dark place
we fetched an armful and hid it in the weeds and set down to rest and tom says kind of dissatisfied blame it this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it can be
and so it makes it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan
there ain't no watchman to be druggednow there ought to be a watchman
there ain't even a dog to give a sleepingmixture to
and there's jim chained by one leg with a tenfoot chain to the leg of his bed why all you got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip off the chain
and uncle silas he trusts everybody sends the key to the punkinheaded nigger and don't send nobody to watch the nigger
jim could a got out of that windowhole before this only there wouldn't be no use trying to travel with a tenfoot chain on his leg
why drat it huck it's the stupidest arrangement i ever see
you got to invent all the difficulties
well we can't help it we got to do the best we can with the materials we've got
anyhow there's one thingthere's more honor in getting him out through a lot of difficulties and dangers where there warn't one of them furnished to you by the people who it was their duty to furnish them and you had to contrive them all out of your own head
now look at just that one thing of the lantern
when you come down to the cold facts we simply got to let on that a lantern's resky
why we could work with a torchlight procession if we wanted to i believe
now whilst i think of it we got to hunt up something to make a saw out of the first chance we get what do we want of a saw what do we want of it
hain't we got to saw the leg of jim's bed off so as to get the chain loose why you just said a body could lift up the bedstead and slip the chain off well if that ain't just like you huck finn
you can get up the infantschooliest ways of going at a thing
why hain't you ever read any books at allbaron trenck nor casanova nor benvenuto chelleeny nor henri iv nor none of them heroes
who ever heard of getting a prisoner loose in such an oldmaidy way as that
no the way all the best authorities does is to saw the bedleg in two and leave it just so and swallow the sawdust so it can't be found and put some dirt and grease around the sawed place so the very keenest seneskal can't see no sign of it's being sawed and thinks the bedleg is perfectly sound
then the night you're ready fetch the leg a kick down she goes slip off your chain and there you are
nothing to do but hitch your rope ladder to the battlements shin down it break your leg in the moatbecause a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short you knowand there's your horses and your trusty vassles and they scoop you up and fling you across a saddle and away you go to your native langudoc or navarre or wherever it is
it's gaudy huck
i wish there was a moat to this cabin
if we get time the night of the escape we'll dig one i says what do we want of a moat when we're going to snake him out from under the cabin but he never heard me
he had forgot me and everything else
he had his chin in his hand thinking
pretty soon he sighs and shakes his head then sighs again and says no it wouldn't dothere ain't necessity enough for it for what i says
why to saw jim's leg off he says
good land i says why there ain't no necessity for it
and what would you want to saw his leg off for anyway well some of the best authorities has done it
they couldn't get the chain off so they just cut their hand off and shoved
and a leg would be better still
but we got to let that go
there ain't necessity enough in this case and besides jim's a nigger and wouldn't understand the reasons for it and how it's the custom in europe so we'll let it go
but there's one thinghe can have a rope ladder we can tear up our sheets and make him a rope ladder easy enough
and we can send it to him in a pie it's mostly done that way
and i've et worse pies why tom sawyer how you talk i says jim ain't got no use for a rope ladder he has got use for it
how you talk you better say you don't know nothing about it
he's got to have a rope ladder they all do what in the nation can he do with it do with it
he can hide it in his bed can't he that's what they all do and he's got to too
huck you don't ever seem to want to do anything that's regular you want to be starting something fresh all the time
s'pose he don't do nothing with it
ain't it there in his bed for a clew after he's gone
and don't you reckon they'll want clews
of course they will
and you wouldn't leave them any
that would be a pretty howdydo wouldn't it
i never heard of such a thing well i says if it's in the regulations and he's got to have it all right let him have it because i don't wish to go back on no regulations but there's one thing tom sawyerif we go to tearing up our sheets to make jim a rope ladder we're going to get into trouble with aunt sally just as sure as you're born
now the way i look at it a hickrybark ladder don't cost nothing and don't waste nothing and is just as good to load up a pie with and hide in a straw tick as any rag ladder you can start and as for jim he ain't had no experience and so he don't care what kind of a oh shucks huck finn if i was as ignorant as you i'd keep stillthat's what i'd do
who ever heard of a state prisoner escaping by a hickrybark ladder
why it's perfectly ridiculous well all right tom fix it your own way but if you'll take my advice you'll let me borrow a sheet off of the clothesline he said that would do
and that gave him another idea and he says borrow a shirt too what do we want of a shirt tom want it for jim to keep a journal on journal your grannyjim can't write s'pose he can't writehe can make marks on the shirt can't he if we make him a pen out of an old pewter spoon or a piece of an old iron barrelhoop why tom we can pull a feather out of a goose and make him a better one and quicker too prisoners don't have geese running around the donjonkeep to pull pens out of you muggins
they always make their pens out of the hardest toughest troublesomest piece of old brass candlestick or something like that they can get their hands on and it takes them weeks and weeks and months and months to file it out too because they've got to do it by rubbing it on the wall
they wouldn't use a goosequill if they had it
it ain't regular well then what'll we make him the ink out of many makes it out of ironrust and tears but that's the common sort and women the best authorities uses their own blood
jim can do that and when he wants to send any little common ordinary mysterious message to let the world know where he's captivated he can write it on the bottom of a tin plate with a fork and throw it out of the window
the iron mask always done that and it's a blame' good way too jim ain't got no tin plates
they feed him in a pan that ain't nothing we can get him some can't nobody read his plates that ain't got anything to do with it huck finn
all he's got to do is to write on the plate and throw it out
you don't have to be able to read it
why half the time you can't read anything a prisoner writes on a tin plate or anywhere else well then what's the sense in wasting the plates why blame it all it ain't the prisoner's plates but it's somebody's plates ain't it well spos'n it is
what does the prisoner care whose he broke off there because we heard the breakfasthorn blowing
so we cleared out for the house
along during the morning i borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of the clothesline and i found an old sack and put them in it and we went down and got the foxfire and put that in too
i called it borrowing because that was what pap always called it but tom said it warn't borrowing it was stealing
he said we was representing prisoners and prisoners don't care how they get a thing so they get it and nobody don't blame them for it either
it ain't no crime in a prisoner to steal the thing he needs to get away with tom said it's his right and so as long as we was representing a prisoner we had a perfect right to steal anything on this place we had the least use for to get ourselves out of prison with
he said if we warn't prisoners it would be a very different thing and nobody but a mean ornery person would steal when he warn't a prisoner
so we allowed we would steal everything there was that come handy
and yet he made a mighty fuss one day after that when i stole a watermelon out of the niggerpatch and eat it and he made me go and give the niggers a dime without telling them what it was for
tom said that what he meant was we could steal anything we needed
well i says i needed the watermelon
but he said i didn't need it to get out of prison with there's where the difference was
he said if i'd a wanted it to hide a knife in and smuggle it to jim to kill the seneskal with it would a been all right
so i let it go at that though i couldn't see no advantage in my representing a prisoner if i got to set down and chaw over a lot of goldleaf distinctions like that every time i see a chance to hog a watermelon
well as i was saying we waited that morning till everybody was settled down to business and nobody in sight around the yard then tom he carried the sack into the leanto whilst i stood off a piece to keep watch
by and by he come out and we went and set down on the woodpile to talk
he says everything's all right now except tools and that's easy fixed tools i says
yes tools for what why to dig with
we ain't agoing to gnaw him out are we ain't them old crippled picks and things in there good enough to dig a nigger out with i says
he turns on me looking pitying enough to make a body cry and says huck finn did you ever hear of a prisoner having picks and shovels and all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig himself out with
now i want to ask youif you got any reasonableness in you at allwhat kind of a show would that give him to be a hero
why they might as well lend him the key and done with it
picks and shovelswhy they wouldn't furnish 'em to a king well then i says if we don't want the picks and shovels what do we want a couple of caseknives to dig the foundations out from under that cabin with yes confound it it's foolish tom it don't make no difference how foolish it is it's the right wayand it's the regular way
and there ain't no other way that ever i heard of and i've read all the books that gives any information about these things
they always dig out with a caseknifeand not through dirt mind you generly it's through solid rock
and it takes them weeks and weeks and weeks and for ever and ever
why look at one of them prisoners in the bottom dungeon of the castle deef in the harbor of marseilles that dug himself out that way how long was he at it you reckon i don't know well guess i don't know
a month and a half thirtyseven yearand he come out in china
that's the kind
i wish the bottom of this fortress was solid rock jim don't know nobody in china what's that got to do with it
neither did that other fellow
but you're always awandering off on a side issue
why can't you stick to the main point all righti don't care where he comes out so he comes out and jim don't either i reckon
but there's one thing anywayjim's too old to be dug out with a caseknife
he won't last yes he will last too
you don't reckon it's going to take thirtyseven years to dig out through a dirt foundation do you how long will it take tom well we can't resk being as long as we ought to because it mayn't take very long for uncle silas to hear from down there by new orleans
he'll hear jim ain't from there
then his next move will be to advertise jim or something like that
so we can't resk being as long digging him out as we ought to
by rights i reckon we ought to be a couple of years but we can't
things being so uncertain what i recommend is this that we really dig right in as quick as we can and after that we can let on to ourselves that we was at it thirtyseven years
then we can snatch him out and rush him away the first time there's an alarm
yes i reckon that 'll be the best way now there's sense in that i says
letting on don't cost nothing letting on ain't no trouble and if it's any object i don't mind letting on we was at it a hundred and fifty year
it wouldn't strain me none after i got my hand in
so i'll mosey along now and smouch a couple of caseknives smouch three he says we want one to make a saw out of tom if it ain't unregular and irreligious to sejest it i says there's an old rusty sawblade around yonder sticking under the weatherboarding behind the smokehouse he looked kind of weary and discouragedlike and says it ain't no use to try to learn you nothing huck
run along and smouch the knivesthree of them so i done it
as soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep that night we went down the lightningrod and shut ourselves up in the leanto and got out our pile of foxfire and went to work
we cleared everything out of the way about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log
tom said he was right behind jim's bed now and we'd dig in under it and when we got through there couldn't nobody in the cabin ever know there was any hole there because jim's counterpin hung down most to the ground and you'd have to raise it up and look under to see the hole
so we dug and dug with the caseknives till most midnight and then we was dogtired and our hands was blistered and yet you couldn't see we'd done anything hardly
at last i says this ain't no thirtyseven year job this is a thirtyeight year job tom sawyer he never said nothing
but he sighed and pretty soon he stopped digging and then for a good little while i knowed that he was thinking
then he says it ain't no use huck it ain't agoing to work
if we was prisoners it would because then we'd have as many years as we wanted and no hurry and we wouldn't get but a few minutes to dig every day while they was changing watches and so our hands wouldn't get blistered and we could keep it up right along year in and year out and do it right and the way it ought to be done
but we can't fool along we got to rush we ain't got no time to spare
if we was to put in another night this way we'd have to knock off for a week to let our hands get wellcouldn't touch a caseknife with them sooner well then what we going to do tom i'll tell you
it ain't right and it ain't moral and i wouldn't like it to get out but there ain't only just the one way we got to dig him out with the picks and let on it's caseknives now you're talking i says your head gets leveler and leveler all the time tom sawyer i says
picks is the thing moral or no moral and as for me i don't care shucks for the morality of it nohow
when i start in to steal a nigger or a watermelon or a sundayschool book i ain't no ways particular how it's done so it's done
what i want is my nigger or what i want is my watermelon or what i want is my sundayschool book and if a pick's the handiest thing that's the thing i'm agoing to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that sundayschool book out with and i don't give a dead rat what the authorities thinks about it nuther well he says there's excuse for picks and lettingon in a case like this if it warn't so i wouldn't approve of it nor i wouldn't stand by and see the rules brokebecause right is right and wrong is wrong and a body ain't got no business doing wrong when he ain't ignorant and knows better
it might answer for you to dig jim out with a pick without any letting on because you don't know no better but it wouldn't for me because i do know better
gimme a caseknife he had his own by him but i handed him mine
he flung it down and says gimme a caseknife i didn't know just what to dobut then i thought
i scratched around amongst the old tools and got a pickaxe and give it to him and he took it and went to work and never said a word
he was always just that particular
full of principle
so then i got a shovel and then we picked and shoveled turn about and made the fur fly
we stuck to it about a half an hour which was as long as we could stand up but we had a good deal of a hole to show for it
when i got up stairs i looked out at the window and see tom doing his level best with the lightningrod but he couldn't come it his hands was so sore
at last he says it ain't no use it can't be done
what you reckon i better do
can't you think of no way yes i says but i reckon it ain't regular
come up the stairs and let on it's a lightningrod so he done it
next day tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house for to make some pens for jim out of and six tallow candles and i hung around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance and stole three tin plates
tom says it wasn't enough but i said nobody wouldn't ever see the plates that jim throwed out because they'd fall in the dogfennel and jimpson weeds under the windowholethen we could tote them back and he could use them over again
so tom was satisfied
then he says now the thing to study out is how to get the things to jim take them in through the hole i says when we get it done he only just looked scornful and said something about nobody ever heard of such an idiotic idea and then he went to studying
by and by he said he had ciphered out two or three ways but there warn't no need to decide on any of them yet
said we'd got to post jim first
that night we went down the lightningrod a little after ten and took one of the candles along and listened under the windowhole and heard jim snoring so we pitched it in and it didn't wake him
then we whirled in with the pick and shovel and in about two hours and a half the job was done
we crept in under jim's bed and into the cabin and pawed around and found the candle and lit it and stood over jim awhile and found him looking hearty and healthy and then we woke him up gentle and gradual
he was so glad to see us he most cried and called us honey and all the pet names he could think of and was for having us hunt up a coldchisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right away and clearing out without losing any time
but tom he showed him how unregular it would be and set down and told him all about our plans and how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm and not to be the least afraid because we would see he got away sure
so jim he said it was all right and we set there and talked over old times awhile and then tom asked a lot of questions and when jim told him uncle silas come in every day or two to pray with him and aunt sally come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat and both of them was kind as they could be tom says now i know how to fix it
we'll send you some things by them i said don't do nothing of the kind it's one of the most jackass ideas i ever struck but he never paid no attention to me went right on
it was his way when he'd got his plans set
so he told jim how we'd have to smuggle in the ropeladder pie and other large things by nat the nigger that fed him and he must be on the lookout and not be surprised and not let nat see him open them and we would put small things in uncle's coatpockets and he must steal them out and we would tie things to aunt's apronstrings or put them in her apronpocket if we got a chance and told him what they would be and what they was for
and told him how to keep a journal on the shirt with his blood and all that
he told him everything
jim he couldn't see no sense in the most of it but he allowed we was white folks and knowed better than him so he was satisfied and said he would do it all just as tom said
jim had plenty corncob pipes and tobacco so we had a right down good sociable time then we crawled out through the hole and so home to bed with hands that looked like they'd been chawed
tom was in high spirits
he said it was the best fun he ever had in his life and the most intellectural and said if he only could see his way to it we would keep it up all the rest of our lives and leave jim to our children to get out for he believed jim would come to like it better and better the more he got used to it
he said that in that way it could be strung out to as much as eighty year and would be the best time on record
and he said it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it
in the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass candlestick into handy sizes and tom put them and the pewter spoon in his pocket
then we went to the nigger cabins and while i got nat's notice off tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a cornpone that was in jim's pan and we went along with nat to see how it would work and it just worked noble when jim bit into it it most mashed all his teeth out and there warn't ever anything could a worked better
tom said so himself
jim he never let on but what it was only just a piece of rock or something like that that's always getting into bread you know but after that he never bit into nothing but what he jabbed his fork into it in three or four places first
and whilst we was astanding there in the dimmish light here comes a couple of the hounds bulging in from under jim's bed and they kept on piling in till there was eleven of them and there warn't hardly room in there to get your breath
by jings we forgot to fasten that leanto door
the nigger nat he only just hollered witches once and keeled over on to the floor amongst the dogs and begun to groan like he was dying
tom jerked the door open and flung out a slab of jim's meat and the dogs went for it and in two seconds he was out himself and back again and shut the door and i knowed he'd fixed the other door too
then he went to work on the nigger coaxing him and petting him and asking him if he'd been imagining he saw something again
he raised up and blinked his eyes around and says mars sid you'll say i's a fool but if i didn't b'lieve i see most a million dogs er devils er some'n i wisht i may die right heah in dese tracks
i did mos' sholy
mars sid i felt umi felt um sah dey was all over me
dad fetch it i jis' wisht i could git my han's on one er dem witches jis' wunston'y jis' wunstit's all i'd ast
but mos'ly i wisht dey'd lemme 'lone i does tom says well i tell you what i think
what makes them come here just at this runaway nigger's breakfasttime
it's because they're hungry that's the reason
you make them a witch pie that's the thing for you to do but my lan' mars sid how's i gwyne to make 'm a witch pie
i doan' know how to make it
i hain't ever hearn er sich a thing b'fo' well then i'll have to make it myself will you do it honeywill you
i'll wusshup de groun' und' yo' foot i will all right i'll do it seeing it's you and you've been good to us and showed us the runaway nigger
but you got to be mighty careful
when we come around you turn your back and then whatever we've put in the pan don't you let on you see it at all
and don't you look when jim unloads the pansomething might happen i don't know what
and above all don't you handle the witchthings hannel 'm mars sid
what is you atalkin' 'bout
i wouldn' lay de weight er my finger on um not f'r ten hund'd thous'n billion dollars i wouldn't that was all fixed
so then we went away and went to the rubbagepile in the back yard where they keep the old boots and rags and pieces of bottles and woreout tin things and all such truck and scratched around and found an old tin washpan and stopped up the holes as well as we could to bake the pie in and took it down cellar and stole it full of flour and started for breakfast and found a couple of shinglenails that tom said would be handy for a prisoner to scrabble his name and sorrows on the dungeon walls with and dropped one of them in aunt sally's apronpocket which was hanging on a chair and t'other we stuck in the band of uncle silas's hat which was on the bureau because we heard the children say their pa and ma was going to the runaway nigger's house this morning and then went to breakfast and tom dropped the pewter spoon in uncle silas's coatpocket and aunt sally wasn't come yet so we had to wait a little while
and when she come she was hot and red and cross and couldn't hardly wait for the blessing and then she went to sluicing out coffee with one hand and cracking the handiest child's head with her thimble with the other and says i've hunted high and i've hunted low and it does beat all what has become of your other shirt my heart fell down amongst my lungs and livers and things and a hard piece of corncrust started down my throat after it and got met on the road with a cough and was shot across the table and took one of the children in the eye and curled him up like a fishingworm and let a cry out of him the size of a warwhoop and tom he turned kinder blue around the gills and it all amounted to a considerable state of things for about a quarter of a minute or as much as that and i would a sold out for half price if there was a bidder
but after that we was all right againit was the sudden surprise of it that knocked us so kind of cold
uncle silas he says it's most uncommon curious i can't understand it
i know perfectly well i took it off because because you hain't got but one on
just listen at the man
i know you took it off and know it by a better way than your woolgethering memory too because it was on the clo'sline yesterdayi see it there myself
but it's gone that's the long and the short of it and you'll just have to change to a red flann'l one till i can get time to make a new one
and it 'll be the third i've made in two years
it just keeps a body on the jump to keep you in shirts and whatever you do manage to do with 'm all is more'n i can make out
a body 'd think you would learn to take some sort of care of 'em at your time of life i know it sally and i do try all i can
but it oughtn't to be altogether my fault because you know i don't see them nor have nothing to do with them except when they're on me and i don't believe i've ever lost one of them off of me well it ain't your fault if you haven't silas you'd a done it if you could i reckon
and the shirt ain't all that's gone nuther
ther's a spoon gone and that ain't all
there was ten and now ther's only nine
the calf got the shirt i reckon but the calf never took the spoon that's certain why what else is gone sally ther's six candles gonethat's what
the rats could a got the candles and i reckon they did i wonder they don't walk off with the whole place the way you're always going to stop their holes and don't do it and if they warn't fools they'd sleep in your hair silasyou'd never find it out but you can't lay the spoon on the rats and that i know well sally i'm in fault and i acknowledge it i've been remiss but i won't let tomorrow go by without stopping up them holes oh i wouldn't hurry next year 'll do
matilda angelina araminta phelps whack comes the thimble and the child snatches her claws out of the sugarbowl without fooling around any
just then the nigger woman steps on to the passage and says missus dey's a sheet gone a sheet gone
well for the land's sake i'll stop up them holes today says uncle silas looking sorrowful
oh do shet ups'pose the rats took the sheet
where's it gone lize clah to goodness i hain't no notion miss' sally
she wuz on de clo'sline yistiddy but she done gone she ain' dah no mo' now i reckon the world is coming to an end
i never see the beat of it in all my born days
a shirt and a sheet and a spoon and six can missus comes a young yaller wench dey's a brass cannelstick miss'n cler out from here you hussy er i'll take a skillet to ye well she was just abiling
i begun to lay for a chance i reckoned i would sneak out and go for the woods till the weather moderated
she kept araging right along running her insurrection all by herself and everybody else mighty meek and quiet and at last uncle silas looking kind of foolish fishes up that spoon out of his pocket
she stopped with her mouth open and her hands up and as for me i wished i was in jeruslem or somewheres
but not long because she says it's just as i expected
so you had it in your pocket all the time and like as not you've got the other things there too
how'd it get there i reely don't know sally he says kind of apologizing or you know i would tell
i was astudying over my text in acts seventeen before breakfast and i reckon i put it in there not noticing meaning to put my testament in and it must be so because my testament ain't in but i'll go and see and if the testament is where i had it i'll know i didn't put it in and that will show that i laid the testament down and took up the spoon and oh for the land's sake
give a body a rest
go 'long now the whole kit and biling of ye and don't come nigh me again till i've got back my peace of mind i'd a heard her if she'd a said it to herself let alone speaking it out and i'd a got up and obeyed her if i'd a been dead
as we was passing through the settingroom the old man he took up his hat and the shinglenail fell out on the floor and he just merely picked it up and laid it on the mantelshelf and never said nothing and went out
tom see him do it and remembered about the spoon and says well it ain't no use to send things by him no more he ain't reliable then he says but he done us a good turn with the spoon anyway without knowing it and so we'll go and do him one without him knowing itstop up his ratholes there was a noble good lot of them down cellar and it took us a whole hour but we done the job tight and good and shipshape
then we heard steps on the stairs and blowed out our light and hid and here comes the old man with a candle in one hand and a bundle of stuff in t'other looking as absentminded as year before last
he went a mooning around first to one rathole and then another till he'd been to them all
then he stood about five minutes picking tallowdrip off of his candle and thinking
then he turns off slow and dreamy towards the stairs saying well for the life of me i can't remember when i done it
i could show her now that i warn't to blame on account of the rats
but never mindlet it go
i reckon it wouldn't do no good and so he went on amumbling up stairs and then we left
he was a mighty nice old man
and always is
tom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon but he said we'd got to have it so he took a think
when he had ciphered it out he told me how we was to do then we went and waited around the spoonbasket till we see aunt sally coming and then tom went to counting the spoons and laying them out to one side and i slid one of them up my sleeve and tom says why aunt sally there ain't but nine spoons yet she says go 'long to your play and don't bother me
i know better i counted 'm myself well i've counted them twice aunty and i can't make but nine she looked out of all patience but of course she come to countanybody would
i declare to gracious ther' ain't but nine she says
why what in the worldplague take the things i'll count 'm again so i slipped back the one i had and when she got done counting she says hang the troublesome rubbage ther's ten now and she looked huffy and bothered both
but tom says why aunty i don't think there's ten you numskull didn't you see me count 'm i know but well i'll count 'm again so i smouched one and they come out nine same as the other time
well she was in a tearing wayjust atrembling all over she was so mad
but she counted and counted till she got that addled she'd start to count in the basket for a spoon sometimes and so three times they come out right and three times they come out wrong
then she grabbed up the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the cat galleywest and she said cle'r out and let her have some peace and if we come bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner she'd skin us
so we had the odd spoon and dropped it in her apronpocket whilst she was agiving us our sailing orders and jim got it all right along with her shingle nail before noon
we was very well satisfied with this business and tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble it took because he said now she couldn't ever count them spoons twice alike again to save her life and wouldn't believe she'd counted them right if she did and said that after she'd about counted her head off for the next three days he judged she'd give it up and offer to kill anybody that wanted her to ever count them any more
so we put the sheet back on the line that night and stole one out of her closet and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for a couple of days till she didn't know how many sheets she had any more and she didn't care and warn't agoing to bullyrag the rest of her soul out about it and wouldn't count them again not to save her life she druther die first
so we was all right now as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon and the candles by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixedup counting and as to the candlestick it warn't no consequence it would blow over by and by
but that pie was a job we had no end of trouble with that pie
we fixed it up away down in the woods and cooked it there and we got it done at last and very satisfactory too but not all in one day and we had to use up three washpans full of flour before we got through and we got burnt pretty much all over in places and eyes put out with the smoke because you see we didn't want nothing but a crust and we couldn't prop it up right and she would always cave in
but of course we thought of the right way at lastwhich was to cook the ladder too in the pie
so then we laid in with jim the second night and tore up the sheet all in little strings and twisted them together and long before daylight we had a lovely rope that you could a hung a person with
we let on it took nine months to make it
and in the forenoon we took it down to the woods but it wouldn't go into the pie
being made of a whole sheet that way there was rope enough for forty pies if we'd a wanted them and plenty left over for soup or sausage or anything you choose
we could a had a whole dinner
but we didn't need it
all we needed was just enough for the pie and so we throwed the rest away
we didn't cook none of the pies in the washpanafraid the solder would melt but uncle silas he had a noble brass warmingpan which he thought considerable of because it belonged to one of his ancesters with a long wooden handle that come over from england with william the conqueror in the mayflower or one of them early ships and was hid away up garret with a lot of other old pots and things that was valuable not on account of being any account because they warn't but on account of them being relicts you know and we snaked her out private and took her down there but she failed on the first pies because we didn't know how but she come up smiling on the last one
we took and lined her with dough and set her in the coals and loaded her up with rag rope and put on a dough roof and shut down the lid and put hot embers on top and stood off five foot with the long handle cool and comfortable and in fifteen minutes she turned out a pie that was a satisfaction to look at
but the person that et it would want to fetch a couple of kags of toothpicks along for if that rope ladder wouldn't cramp him down to business i don't know nothing what i'm talking about and lay him in enough stomachache to last him till next time too
nat didn't look when we put the witch pie in jim's pan and we put the three tin plates in the bottom of the pan under the vittles and so jim got everything all right and as soon as he was by himself he busted into the pie and hid the rope ladder inside of his straw tick and scratched some marks on a tin plate and throwed it out of the windowhole
making them pens was a distressid tough job and so was the saw and jim allowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of all
that's the one which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall
but he had to have it tom said he'd got to there warn't no case of a state prisoner not scrabbling his inscription to leave behind and his coat of arms
look at lady jane grey he says look at gilford dudley look at old northumberland
why huck s'pose it is considerble troublewhat you going to dohow you going to get around it
jim's got to do his inscription and coat of arms
they all do jim says why mars tom i hain't got no coat o' arm i hain't got nuffn but dish yer ole shirt en you knows i got to keep de journal on dat oh you don't understand jim a coat of arms is very different well i says jim's right anyway when he says he ain't got no coat of arms because he hain't i reckon i knowed that tom says but you bet he'll have one before he goes out of thisbecause he's going out right and there ain't going to be no flaws in his record so whilst me and jim filed away at the pens on a brickbat apiece jim amaking his'n out of the brass and i making mine out of the spoon tom set to work to think out the coat of arms
by and by he said he'd struck so many good ones he didn't hardly know which to take but there was one which he reckoned he'd decide on
he says on the scutcheon we'll have a bend or in the dexter base a saltire murrey in the fess with a dog couchant for common charge and under his foot a chain embattled for slavery with a chevron vert in a chief engrailed and three invected lines on a field azure with the nombril points rampant on a dancette indented crest a runaway nigger sable with his bundle over his shoulder on a bar sinister and a couple of gules for supporters which is you and me motto maggiore fretta minore otto got it out of a bookmeans the more haste the less speed geewhillikins i says but what does the rest of it mean we ain't got no time to bother over that he says we got to dig in like all gitout well anyway i says what's some of it
what's a fess a fessa fess isyou don't need to know what a fess is
i'll show him how to make it when he gets to it shucks tom i says i think you might tell a person
what's a bar sinister oh i don't know
but he's got to have it
all the nobility does that was just his way
if it didn't suit him to explain a thing to you he wouldn't do it
you might pump at him a week it wouldn't make no difference
he'd got all that coat of arms business fixed so now he started in to finish up the rest of that part of the work which was to plan out a mournful inscriptionsaid jim got to have one like they all done
he made up a lot and wrote them out on a paper and read them off so
here a captive heart busted

here a poor prisoner forsook by the world and friends fretted his sorrowful life

here a lonely heart broke and a worn spirit went to its rest after thirtyseven years of solitary captivity

here homeless and friendless after thirtyseven years of bitter captivity perished a noble stranger natural son of louis xiv
tom's voice trembled whilst he was reading them and he most broke down
when he got done he couldn't no way make up his mind which one for jim to scrabble on to the wall they was all so good but at last he allowed he would let him scrabble them all on
jim said it would take him a year to scrabble such a lot of truck on to the logs with a nail and he didn't know how to make letters besides but tom said he would block them out for him and then he wouldn't have nothing to do but just follow the lines
then pretty soon he says come to think the logs ain't agoing to do they don't have log walls in a dungeon we got to dig the inscriptions into a rock
we'll fetch a rock jim said the rock was worse than the logs he said it would take him such a pison long time to dig them into a rock he wouldn't ever get out
but tom said he would let me help him do it
then he took a look to see how me and jim was getting along with the pens
it was most pesky tedious hard work and slow and didn't give my hands no show to get well of the sores and we didn't seem to make no headway hardly so tom says i know how to fix it
we got to have a rock for the coat of arms and mournful inscriptions and we can kill two birds with that same rock
there's a gaudy big grindstone down at the mill and we'll smouch it and carve the things on it and file out the pens and the saw on it too it warn't no slouch of an idea and it warn't no slouch of a grindstone nuther but we allowed we'd tackle it
it warn't quite midnight yet so we cleared out for the mill leaving jim at work
we smouched the grindstone and set out to roll her home but it was a most nation tough job
sometimes do what we could we couldn't keep her from falling over and she come mighty near mashing us every time
tom said she was going to get one of us sure before we got through
we got her half way and then we was plumb played out and most drownded with sweat
we see it warn't no use we got to go and fetch jim
so he raised up his bed and slid the chain off of the bedleg and wrapt it round and round his neck and we crawled out through our hole and down there and jim and me laid into that grindstone and walked her along like nothing and tom superintended
he could outsuperintend any boy i ever see
he knowed how to do everything
our hole was pretty big but it warn't big enough to get the grindstone through but jim he took the pick and soon made it big enough
then tom marked out them things on it with the nail and set jim to work on them with the nail for a chisel and an iron bolt from the rubbage in the leanto for a hammer and told him to work till the rest of his candle quit on him and then he could go to bed and hide the grindstone under his straw tick and sleep on it
then we helped him fix his chain back on the bedleg and was ready for bed ourselves
but tom thought of something and says you got any spiders in here jim no sah thanks to goodness i hain't mars tom all right we'll get you some but bless you honey i doan' want none
i's afeard un um
i jis' 's soon have rattlesnakes aroun' tom thought a minute or two and says it's a good idea

a prisoner's got to have some kind of a dumb pet and if a rattlesnake hain't ever been tried why there's more glory to be gained in your being the first to ever try it than any other way you could ever think of to save your life why mars tom i doan' want no sich glory

so don't make no more fuss about it
prisoners ain't ever without rats
there ain't no instance of it
and they train them and pet them and learn them tricks and they get to be as sociable as flies
but you got to play music to them
you got anything to play music on i ain' got nuffn but a coase comb en a piece o' paper en a juiceharp but i reck'n dey wouldn' take no stock in a juiceharp yes they wouldthey don't care what kind of music 'tis
a jewsharp's plenty good enough for a rat
all animals like musicin a prison they dote on it
specially painful music and you can't get no other kind out of a jewsharp
it always interests them they come out to see what's the matter with you
yes you're all right you're fixed very well
you want to set on your bed nights before you go to sleep and early in the mornings and play your jewsharp play 'the last link is broken'that's the thing that 'll scoop a rat quicker 'n anything else and when you've played about two minutes you'll see all the rats and the snakes and spiders and things begin to feel worried about you and come
and they'll just fairly swarm over you and have a noble good time yes dey will i reck'n mars tom but what kine er time is jim havin'
blest if i kin see de pint
but i'll do it ef i got to
i reck'n i better keep de animals satisfied en not have no trouble in de house tom waited to think it over and see if there wasn't nothing else and pretty soon he says oh there's one thing i forgot
could you raise a flower here do you reckon i doan know but maybe i could mars tom but it's tolable dark in heah en i ain' got no use f'r no flower nohow en she'd be a pow'ful sight o' trouble well you try it anyway
some other prisoners has done it one er dem big cattaillookin' mullenstalks would grow in heah mars tom i reck'n but she wouldn't be wuth half de trouble she'd coss don't you believe it
we'll fetch you a little one and you plant it in the corner over there and raise it
and don't call it mullen call it pitchiolathat's its right name when it's in a prison
and you want to water it with your tears why i got plenty spring water mars tom you don't want spring water you want to water it with your tears
it's the way they always do why mars tom i lay i kin raise one er dem mullenstalks twyste wid spring water whiles another man's a start'n one wid tears that ain't the idea
you got to do it with tears she'll die on my han's mars tom she sholy will kase i doan' skasely ever cry so tom was stumped
but he studied it over and then said jim would have to worry along the best he could with an onion
he promised he would go to the nigger cabins and drop one private in jim's coffeepot in the morning
jim said he would jis' 's soon have tobacker in his coffee and found so much fault with it and with the work and bother of raising the mullen and jewsharping the rats and petting and flattering up the snakes and spiders and things on top of all the other work he had to do on pens and inscriptions and journals and things which made it more trouble and worry and responsibility to be a prisoner than anything he ever undertook that tom most lost all patience with him and said he was just loadened down with more gaudier chances than a prisoner ever had in the world to make a name for himself and yet he didn't know enough to appreciate them and they was just about wasted on him
so jim he was sorry and said he wouldn't behave so no more and then me and tom shoved for bed
in the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire rattrap and fetched it down and unstopped the best rathole and in about an hour we had fifteen of the bulliest kind of ones and then we took it and put it in a safe place under aunt sally's bed
but while we was gone for spiders little thomas franklin benjamin jefferson elexander phelps found it there and opened the door of it to see if the rats would come out and they did and aunt sally she come in and when we got back she was astanding on top of the bed raising cain and the rats was doing what they could to keep off the dull times for her
so she took and dusted us both with the hickry and we was as much as two hours catching another fifteen or sixteen drat that meddlesome cub and they warn't the likeliest nuther because the first haul was the pick of the flock
i never see a likelier lot of rats than what that first haul was
we got a splendid stock of sorted spiders and bugs and frogs and caterpillars and one thing or another and we like to got a hornet's nest but we didn't
the family was at home
we didn't give it right up but stayed with them as long as we could because we allowed we'd tire them out or they'd got to tire us out and they done it
then we got allycumpain and rubbed on the places and was pretty near all right again but couldn't set down convenient
and so we went for the snakes and grabbed a couple of dozen garters and housesnakes and put them in a bag and put it in our room and by that time it was suppertime and a rattling good honest day's work and hungryoh no i reckon not
and there warn't a blessed snake up there when we went backwe didn't half tie the sack and they worked out somehow and left
but it didn't matter much because they was still on the premises somewheres
so we judged we could get some of them again
no there warn't no real scarcity of snakes about the house for a considerable spell
you'd see them dripping from the rafters and places every now and then and they generly landed in your plate or down the back of your neck and most of the time where you didn't want them
well they was handsome and striped and there warn't no harm in a million of them but that never made no difference to aunt sally she despised snakes be the breed what they might and she couldn't stand them no way you could fix it and every time one of them flopped down on her it didn't make no difference what she was doing she would just lay that work down and light out
i never see such a woman
and you could hear her whoop to jericho
you couldn't get her to take aholt of one of them with the tongs
and if she turned over and found one in bed she would scramble out and lift a howl that you would think the house was afire
she disturbed the old man so that he said he could most wish there hadn't ever been no snakes created
why after every last snake had been gone clear out of the house for as much as a week aunt sally warn't over it yet she warn't near over it when she was setting thinking about something you could touch her on the back of her neck with a feather and she would jump right out of her stockings
it was very curious
but tom said all women was just so
he said they was made that way for some reason or other
we got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way and she allowed these lickings warn't nothing to what she would do if we ever loaded up the place again with them
i didn't mind the lickings because they didn't amount to nothing but i minded the trouble we had to lay in another lot
but we got them laid in and all the other things and you never see a cabin as blithesome as jim's was when they'd all swarm out for music and go for him
jim didn't like the spiders and the spiders didn't like jim and so they'd lay for him and make it mighty warm for him
and he said that between the rats and the snakes and the grindstone there warn't no room in bed for him skasely and when there was a body couldn't sleep it was so lively and it was always lively he said because they never all slept at one time but took turn about so when the snakes was asleep the rats was on deck and when the rats turned in the snakes come on watch so he always had one gang under him in his way and t'other gang having a circus over him and if he got up to hunt a new place the spiders would take a chance at him as he crossed over
he said if he ever got out this time he wouldn't ever be a prisoner again not for a salary
well by the end of three weeks everything was in pretty good shape
the shirt was sent in early in a pie and every time a rat bit jim he would get up and write a little in his journal whilst the ink was fresh the pens was made the inscriptions and so on was all carved on the grindstone the bedleg was sawed in two and we had et up the sawdust and it give us a most amazing stomachache
we reckoned we was all going to die but didn't
it was the most undigestible sawdust i ever see and tom said the same
but as i was saying we'd got all the work done now at last and we was all pretty much fagged out too but mainly jim
the old man had wrote a couple of times to the plantation below orleans to come and get their runaway nigger but hadn't got no answer because there warn't no such plantation so he allowed he would advertise jim in the st louis and new orleans papers and when he mentioned the st louis ones it give me the cold shivers and i see we hadn't no time to lose
so tom said now for the nonnamous letters
what's them i says
warnings to the people that something is up
sometimes it's done one way sometimes another
but there's always somebody spying around that gives notice to the governor of the castle
when louis xvi
was going to light out of the tooleries a servantgirl done it
it's a very good way and so is the nonnamous letters
we'll use them both
and it's usual for the prisoner's mother to change clothes with him and she stays in and he slides out in her clothes
we'll do that too but looky here tom what do we want to warn anybody for that something's up
let them find it out for themselvesit's their lookout yes i know but you can't depend on them
it's the way they've acted from the very startleft us to do everything
they're so confiding and mulletheaded they don't take notice of nothing at all
so if we don't give them notice there won't be nobody nor nothing to interfere with us and so after all our hard work and trouble this escape 'll go off perfectly flat won't amount to nothingwon't be nothing to it well as for me tom that's the way i'd like shucks he says and looked disgusted
so i says but i ain't going to make no complaint
any way that suits you suits me
what you going to do about the servantgirl you'll be her
you slide in in the middle of the night and hook that yaller girl's frock why tom that 'll make trouble next morning because of course she prob'bly hain't got any but that one i know but you don't want it but fifteen minutes to carry the nonnamous letter and shove it under the front door all right then i'll do it but i could carry it just as handy in my own togs you wouldn't look like a servantgirl then would you no but there won't be nobody to see what i look like anyway that ain't got nothing to do with it
the thing for us to do is just to do our duty and not worry about whether anybody sees us do it or not
hain't you got no principle at all all right i ain't saying nothing i'm the servantgirl
who's jim's mother i'm his mother
i'll hook a gown from aunt sally well then you'll have to stay in the cabin when me and jim leaves not much
i'll stuff jim's clothes full of straw and lay it on his bed to represent his mother in disguise and jim 'll take the nigger woman's gown off of me and wear it and we'll all evade together
when a prisoner of style escapes it's called an evasion
it's always called so when a king escapes f'rinstance
and the same with a king's son it don't make no difference whether he's a natural one or an unnatural one so tom he wrote the nonnamous letter and i smouched the yaller wench's frock that night and put it on and shoved it under the front door the way tom told me to
it said beware
trouble is brewing
keep a sharp lookout
unknown friend
next night we stuck a picture which tom drawed in blood of a skull and crossbones on the front door and next night another one of a coffin on the back door
i never see a family in such a sweat
they couldn't a been worse scared if the place had a been full of ghosts laying for them behind everything and under the beds and shivering through the air
if a door banged aunt sally she jumped and said ouch if anything fell she jumped and said ouch if you happened to touch her when she warn't noticing she done the same she couldn't face noway and be satisfied because she allowed there was something behind her every timeso she was always awhirling around sudden and saying ouch and before she'd got twothirds around she'd whirl back again and say it again and she was afraid to go to bed but she dasn't set up
so the thing was working very well tom said he said he never see a thing work more satisfactory
he said it showed it was done right
so he said now for the grand bulge
so the very next morning at the streak of dawn we got another letter ready and was wondering what we better do with it because we heard them say at supper they was going to have a nigger on watch at both doors all night
tom he went down the lightningrod to spy around and the nigger at the back door was asleep and he stuck it in the back of his neck and come back
this letter said don't betray me i wish to be your friend
there is a desprate gang of cutthroats from over in the indian territory going to steal your runaway nigger tonight and they have been trying to scare you so as you will stay in the house and not bother them
i am one of the gang but have got religgion and wish to quit it and lead an honest life again and will betray the helish design
they will sneak down from northards along the fence at midnight exact with a false key and go in the nigger's cabin to get him
i am to be off a piece and blow a tin horn if i see any danger but stead of that i will baa like a sheep soon as they get in and not blow at all then whilst they are getting his chains loose you slip there and lock them in and can kill them at your leasure
don't do anything but just the way i am telling you if you do they will suspicion something and raise whoopjamboreehoo
i do not wish any reward but to know i have done the right thing
unknown friend we was feeling pretty good after breakfast and took my canoe and went over the river afishing with a lunch and had a good time and took a look at the raft and found her all right and got home late to supper and found them in such a sweat and worry they didn't know which end they was standing on and made us go right off to bed the minute we was done supper and wouldn't tell us what the trouble was and never let on a word about the new letter but didn't need to because we knowed as much about it as anybody did and as soon as we was half up stairs and her back was turned we slid for the cellar cupboard and loaded up a good lunch and took it up to our room and went to bed and got up about halfpast eleven and tom put on aunt sally's dress that he stole and was going to start with the lunch but says where's the butter i laid out a hunk of it i says on a piece of a cornpone well you left it laid out thenit ain't here we can get along without it i says
we can get along with it too he says just you slide down cellar and fetch it
and then mosey right down the lightningrod and come along
i'll go and stuff the straw into jim's clothes to represent his mother in disguise and be ready to baa like a sheep and shove soon as you get there so out he went and down cellar went i
the hunk of butter big as a person's fist was where i had left it so i took up the slab of cornpone with it on and blowed out my light and started up stairs very stealthy and got up to the main floor all right but here comes aunt sally with a candle and i clapped the truck in my hat and clapped my hat on my head and the next second she see me and she says you been down cellar yes'm what you been doing down there noth'n noth'n no'm well then what possessed you to go down there this time of night i don't know 'm you don't know
don't answer me that way
tom i want to know what you been doing down there i hain't been doing a single thing aunt sally i hope to gracious if i have i reckoned she'd let me go now and as a generl thing she would but i s'pose there was so many strange things going on she was just in a sweat about every little thing that warn't yardstick straight so she says very decided you just march into that settingroom and stay there till i come
you been up to something you no business to and i lay i'll find out what it is before i'm done with you so she went away as i opened the door and walked into the settingroom
my but there was a crowd there
fifteen farmers and every one of them had a gun
i was most powerful sick and slunk to a chair and set down
they was setting around some of them talking a little in a low voice and all of them fidgety and uneasy but trying to look like they warn't but i knowed they was because they was always taking off their hats and putting them on and scratching their heads and changing their seats and fumbling with their buttons
i warn't easy myself but i didn't take my hat off all the same
i did wish aunt sally would come and get done with me and lick me if she wanted to and let me get away and tell tom how we'd overdone this thing and what a thundering hornet'snest we'd got ourselves into so we could stop fooling around straight off and clear out with jim before these rips got out of patience and come for us
at last she come and begun to ask me questions but i couldn't answer them straight i didn't know which end of me was up because these men was in such a fidget now that some was wanting to start right now and lay for them desperadoes and saying it warn't but a few minutes to midnight and others was trying to get them to hold on and wait for the sheepsignal and here was aunty pegging away at the questions and me ashaking all over and ready to sink down in my tracks i was that scared and the place getting hotter and hotter and the butter beginning to melt and run down my neck and behind my ears and pretty soon when one of them says i'm for going and getting in the cabin first and right now and catching them when they come i most dropped and a streak of butter come atrickling down my forehead and aunt sally she see it and turns white as a sheet and says for the land's sake what is the matter with the child
he's got the brainfever as shore as you're born and they're oozing out and everybody runs to see and she snatches off my hat and out comes the bread and what was left of the butter and she grabbed me and hugged me and says oh what a turn you did give me
and how glad and grateful i am it ain't no worse for luck's against us and it never rains but it pours and when i see that truck i thought we'd lost you for i knowed by the color and all it was just like your brains would be ifdear dear whyd'nt you tell me that was what you'd been down there for i wouldn't a cared
now cler out to bed and don't lemme see no more of you till morning i was up stairs in a second and down the lightningrod in another one and shinning through the dark for the leanto
i couldn't hardly get my words out i was so anxious but i told tom as quick as i could we must jump for it now and not a minute to losethe house full of men yonder with guns
his eyes just blazed and he says nois that so
ain't it bully
why huck if it was to do over again i bet i could fetch two hundred
if we could put it off till hurry
hurry i says
where's jim right at your elbow if you reach out your arm you can touch him
he's dressed and everything's ready
now we'll slide out and give the sheepsignal but then we heard the tramp of men coming to the door and heard them begin to fumble with the padlock and heard a man say i told you we'd be too soon they haven't comethe door is locked
here i'll lock some of you into the cabin and you lay for 'em in the dark and kill 'em when they come and the rest scatter around a piece and listen if you can hear 'em coming so in they come but couldn't see us in the dark and most trod on us whilst we was hustling to get under the bed
but we got under all right and out through the hole swift but softjim first me next and tom last which was according to tom's orders
now we was in the leanto and heard trampings close by outside
so we crept to the door and tom stopped us there and put his eye to the crack but couldn't make out nothing it was so dark and whispered and said he would listen for the steps to get further and when he nudged us jim must glide out first and him last
so he set his ear to the crack and listened and listened and listened and the steps ascraping around out there all the time and at last he nudged us and we slid out and stooped down not breathing and not making the least noise and slipped stealthy towards the fence in injun file and got to it all right and me and jim over it but tom's britches catched fast on a splinter on the top rail and then he hear the steps coming so he had to pull loose which snapped the splinter and made a noise and as he dropped in our tracks and started somebody sings out who's that
answer or i'll shoot but we didn't answer we just unfurled our heels and shoved
then there was a rush and a bang bang bang and the bullets fairly whizzed around us
we heard them sing out here they are
they've broke for the river
after 'em boys and turn loose the dogs so here they come full tilt
we could hear them because they wore boots and yelled but we didn't wear no boots and didn't yell
we was in the path to the mill and when they got pretty close on to us we dodged into the bush and let them go by and then dropped in behind them
they'd had all the dogs shut up so they wouldn't scare off the robbers but by this time somebody had let them loose and here they come making powwow enough for a million but they was our dogs so we stopped in our tracks till they catched up and when they see it warn't nobody but us and no excitement to offer them they only just said howdy and tore right ahead towards the shouting and clattering and then we upsteam again and whizzed along after them till we was nearly to the mill and then struck up through the bush to where my canoe was tied and hopped in and pulled for dear life towards the middle of the river but didn't make no more noise than we was obleeged to
then we struck out easy and comfortable for the island where my raft was and we could hear them yelling and barking at each other all up and down the bank till we was so far away the sounds got dim and died out
and when we stepped on to the raft i says now old jim you're a free man again and i bet you won't ever be a slave no more en a mighty good job it wuz too huck
it 'uz planned beautiful en it 'uz done beautiful en dey ain't nobody kin git up a plan dat's mo' mixedup en splendid den what dat one wuz we was all glad as we could be but tom was the gladdest of all because he had a bullet in the calf of his leg
when me and jim heard that we didn't feel so brash as what we did before
it was hurting him considerable and bleeding so we laid him in the wigwam and tore up one of the duke's shirts for to bandage him but he says gimme the rags i can do it myself
don't stop now don't fool around here and the evasion booming along so handsome man the sweeps and set her loose
boys we done it elegant'deed we did
i wish we'd a had the handling of louis xvi there wouldn't a been no 'son of saint louis ascend to heaven'
wrote down in his biography no sir we'd a whooped him over the borderthat's what we'd a done with himand done it just as slick as nothing at all too
man the sweepsman the sweeps but me and jim was consultingand thinking
and after we'd thought a minute i says say it jim so he says well den dis is de way it look to me huck
ef it wuz him dat 'uz bein' sot free en one er de boys wuz to git shot would he say 'go on en save me nemmine 'bout a doctor f'r to save dis one'
is dat like mars tom sawyer
would he say dat
you bet he wouldn't
well den is jim gywne to say it
no sahi doan' budge a step out'n dis place 'dout a doctor not if it's forty year i knowed he was white inside and i reckoned he'd say what he did sayso it was all right now and i told tom i was agoing for a doctor
he raised considerable row about it but me and jim stuck to it and wouldn't budge so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loose himself but we wouldn't let him
then he give us a piece of his mind but it didn't do no good
so when he sees me getting the canoe ready he says well then if you're bound to go i'll tell you the way to do when you get to the village
shut the door and blindfold the doctor tight and fast and make him swear to be silent as the grave and put a purse full of gold in his hand and then take and lead him all around the back alleys and everywheres in the dark and then fetch him here in the canoe in a roundabout way amongst the islands and search him and take his chalk away from him and don't give it back to him till you get him back to the village or else he will chalk this raft so he can find it again
it's the way they all do so i said i would and left and jim was to hide in the woods when he see the doctor coming till he was gone again
the doctor was an old man a very nice kindlooking old man when i got him up
i told him me and my brother was over on spanish island hunting yesterday afternoon and camped on a piece of a raft we found and about midnight he must a kicked his gun in his dreams for it went off and shot him in the leg and we wanted him to go over there and fix it and not say nothing about it nor let anybody know because we wanted to come home this evening and surprise the folks
who is your folks he says
the phelpses down yonder oh he says
and after a minute he says how'd you say he got shot he had a dream i says and it shot him singular dream he says
so he lit up his lantern and got his saddlebags and we started
but when he sees the canoe he didn't like the look of hersaid she was big enough for one but didn't look pretty safe for two
i says oh you needn't be afeard sir she carried the three of us easy enough what three why me and sid andandand the guns that's what i mean oh he says
but he put his foot on the gunnel and rocked her and shook his head and said he reckoned he'd look around for a bigger one
but they was all locked and chained so he took my canoe and said for me to wait till he come back or i could hunt around further or maybe i better go down home and get them ready for the surprise if i wanted to
but i said i didn't so i told him just how to find the raft and then he started
i struck an idea pretty soon
i says to myself spos'n he can't fix that leg just in three shakes of a sheep's tail as the saying is
spos'n it takes him three or four days
what are we going to dolay around there till he lets the cat out of the bag
no sir i know what i'll do
i'll wait and when he comes back if he says he's got to go any more i'll get down there too if i swim and we'll take and tie him and keep him and shove out down the river and when tom's done with him we'll give him what it's worth or all we got and then let him get ashore
so then i crept into a lumberpile to get some sleep and next time i waked up the sun was away up over my head
i shot out and went for the doctor's house but they told me he'd gone away in the night some time or other and warn't back yet
well thinks i that looks powerful bad for tom and i'll dig out for the island right off
so away i shoved and turned the corner and nearly rammed my head into uncle silas's stomach
he says why tom where you been all this time you rascal i hain't been nowheres i says only just hunting for the runaway niggerme and sid why where ever did you go he says
your aunt's been mighty uneasy she needn't i says because we was all right
we followed the men and the dogs but they outrun us and we lost them but we thought we heard them on the water so we got a canoe and took out after them and crossed over but couldn't find nothing of them so we cruised along upshore till we got kind of tired and beat out and tied up the canoe and went to sleep and never waked up till about an hour ago then we paddled over here to hear the news and sid's at the postoffice to see what he can hear and i'm abranching out to get something to eat for us and then we're going home so then we went to the postoffice to get sid but just as i suspicioned he warn't there so the old man he got a letter out of the office and we waited awhile longer but sid didn't come so the old man said come along let sid foot it home or canoe it when he got done fooling aroundbut we would ride
i couldn't get him to let me stay and wait for sid and he said there warn't no use in it and i must come along and let aunt sally see we was all right
when we got home aunt sally was that glad to see me she laughed and cried both and hugged me and give me one of them lickings of hern that don't amount to shucks and said she'd serve sid the same when he come
and the place was plum full of farmers and farmers' wives to dinner and such another clack a body never heard
old mrs hotchkiss was the worst her tongue was agoing all the time
she says well sister phelps i've ransacked thatair cabin over an' i b'lieve the nigger was crazy

why i'd give two dollars to have it read to me 'n' as for the niggers that wrote it i 'low i'd take 'n' lash 'm t'll people to help him brother marples
well i reckon you'd think so if you'd a been in this house for a while back
why they've stole everything they could lay their hands onand we awatching all the time mind you
they stole that shirt right off o' the line
and as for that sheet they made the rag ladder out of ther' ain't no telling how many times they didn't steal that and flour and candles and candlesticks and spoons and the old warmingpan and most a thousand things that i disremember now and my new calico dress and me and silas and my sid and tom on the constant watch day and night as i was atelling you and not a one of us could catch hide nor hair nor sight nor sound of them and here at the last minute lo and behold you they slides right in under our noses and fools us and not only fools us but the injun territory robbers too and actuly gets away with that nigger safe and sound and that with sixteen men and twentytwo dogs right on their very heels at that very time
i tell you it just bangs anything i ever heard of
why sperits couldn't a done better and been no smarter
and i reckon they must a been speritsbecause you know our dogs and ther' ain't no better well them dogs never even got on the track of 'm once
you explain that to me if you canany of you well it does beat laws alive i never so help me i wouldn't a be housethieves as well as goodnessgracioussakes i'd a ben afeard to live in sich a 'fraid to livewhy i was that scared i dasn't hardly go to bed or get up or lay down or set down sister ridgeway
why they'd steal the verywhy goodness sakes you can guess what kind of a fluster i was in by the time midnight come last night
i hope to gracious if i warn't afraid they'd steal some o' the family
i was just to that pass i didn't have no reasoning faculties no more
it looks foolish enough now in the daytime but i says to myself there's my two poor boys asleep 'way up stairs in that lonesome room and i declare to goodness i was that uneasy 't i crep' up there and locked 'em in
i did
and anybody would
because you know when you get scared that way and it keeps running on and getting worse and worse all the time and your wits gets to addling and you get to doing all sorts o' wild things and by and by you think to yourself spos'n i was a boy and was away up there and the door ain't locked and you she stopped looking kind of wondering and then she turned her head around slow and when her eye lit on mei got up and took a walk
says i to myself i can explain better how we come to not be in that room this morning if i go out to one side and study over it a little
so i done it
but i dasn't go fur or she'd a sent for me
and when it was late in the day the people all went and then i come in and told her the noise and shooting waked up me and sid and the door was locked and we wanted to see the fun so we went down the lightningrod and both of us got hurt a little and we didn't never want to try that no more
and then i went on and told her all what i told uncle silas before and then she said she'd forgive us and maybe it was all right enough anyway and about what a body might expect of boys for all boys was a pretty harumscarum lot as fur as she could see and so as long as no harm hadn't come of it she judged she better put in her time being grateful we was alive and well and she had us still stead of fretting over what was past and done
so then she kissed me and patted me on the head and dropped into a kind of a brown study and pretty soon jumps up and says why lawsamercy it's most night and sid not come yet
what has become of that boy i see my chance so i skips up and says i'll run right up to town and get him i says
no you won't she says
you'll stay right wher' you are one's enough to be lost at a time
if he ain't here to supper your uncle 'll go well he warn't there to supper so right after supper uncle went
he come back about ten a little bit uneasy hadn't run across tom's track
aunt sally was a good deal uneasy but uncle silas he said there warn't no occasion to beboys will be boys he said and you'll see this one turn up in the morning all sound and right
so she had to be satisfied
but she said she'd set up for him a while anyway and keep a light burning so he could see it
and then when i went up to bed she come up with me and fetched her candle and tucked me in and mothered me so good i felt mean and like i couldn't look her in the face and she set down on the bed and talked with me a long time and said what a splendid boy sid was and didn't seem to want to ever stop talking about him and kept asking me every now and then if i reckoned he could a got lost or hurt or maybe drownded and might be laying at this minute somewheres suffering or dead and she not by him to help him and so the tears would drip down silent and i would tell her that sid was all right and would be home in the morning sure and she would squeeze my hand or maybe kiss me and tell me to say it again and keep on saying it because it done her good and she was in so much trouble
and when she was going away she looked down in my eyes so steady and gentle and says the door ain't going to be locked tom and there's the window and the rod but you'll be good won't you
and you won't go
for my sake laws knows i wanted to go bad enough to see about tom and was all intending to go but after that i wouldn't a went not for kingdoms
but she was on my mind and tom was on my mind so i slept very restless
and twice i went down the rod away in the night and slipped around front and see her setting there by her candle in the window with her eyes towards the road and the tears in them and i wished i could do something for her but i couldn't only to swear that i wouldn't never do nothing to grieve her any more
and the third time i waked up at dawn and slid down and she was there yet and her candle was most out and her old gray head was resting on her hand and she was asleep
the old man was uptown again before breakfast but couldn't get no track of tom and both of them set at the table thinking and not saying nothing and looking mournful and their coffee getting cold and not eating anything
and by and by the old man says did i give you the letter what letter the one i got yesterday out of the postoffice no you didn't give me no letter well i must a forgot it so he rummaged his pockets and then went off somewheres where he had laid it down and fetched it and give it to her
she says why it's from st petersburgit's from sis i allowed another walk would do me good but i couldn't stir
but before she could break it open she dropped it and runfor she see something
and so did i
it was tom sawyer on a mattress and that old doctor and jim in her calico dress with his hands tied behind him and a lot of people
i hid the letter behind the first thing that come handy and rushed
she flung herself at tom crying and says oh he's dead he's dead i know he's dead and tom he turned his head a little and muttered something or other which showed he warn't in his right mind then she flung up her hands and says he's alive thank god
and that's enough and she snatched a kiss of him and flew for the house to get the bed ready and scattering orders right and left at the niggers and everybody else as fast as her tongue could go every jump of the way
i followed the men to see what they was going to do with jim and the old doctor and uncle silas followed after tom into the house
the men was very huffy and some of them wanted to hang jim for an example to all the other niggers around there so they wouldn't be trying to run away like jim done and making such a raft of trouble and keeping a whole family scared most to death for days and nights
but the others said don't do it it wouldn't answer at all he ain't our nigger and his owner would turn up and make us pay for him sure
so that cooled them down a little because the people that's always the most anxious for to hang a nigger that hain't done just right is always the very ones that ain't the most anxious to pay for him when they've got their satisfaction out of him
they cussed jim considerble though and give him a cuff or two side the head once in a while but jim never said nothing and he never let on to know me and they took him to the same cabin and put his own clothes on him and chained him again and not to no bedleg this time but to a big staple drove into the bottom log and chained his hands too and both legs and said he warn't to have nothing but bread and water to eat after this till his owner come or he was sold at auction because he didn't come in a certain length of time and filled up our hole and said a couple of farmers with guns must stand watch around about the cabin every night and a bulldog tied to the door in the daytime and about this time they was through with the job and was tapering off with a kind of generl goodbye cussing and then the old doctor comes and takes a look and says don't be no rougher on him than you're obleeged to because he ain't a bad nigger
when i got to where i found the boy i see i couldn't cut the bullet out without some help and he warn't in no condition for me to leave to go and get help and he got a little worse and a little worse and after a long time he went out of his head and wouldn't let me come anigh him any more and said if i chalked his raft he'd kill me and no end of wild foolishness like that and i see i couldn't do anything at all with him so i says i got to have help somehow and the minute i says it out crawls this nigger from somewheres and says he'll help and he done it too and done it very well
of course i judged he must be a runaway nigger and there i was
and there i had to stick right straight along all the rest of the day and all night
it was a fix i tell you
i had a couple of patients with the chills and of course i'd of liked to run up to town and see them but i dasn't because the nigger might get away and then i'd be to blame and yet never a skiff come close enough for me to hail
so there i had to stick plumb until daylight this morning and i never see a nigger that was a better nuss or faithfuller and yet he was risking his freedom to do it and was all tired out too and i see plain enough he'd been worked main hard lately
i liked the nigger for that i tell you gentlemen a nigger like that is worth a thousand dollarsand kind treatment too
i had everything i needed and the boy was doing as well there as he would a done at homebetter maybe because it was so quiet but there i was with both of 'm on my hands and there i had to stick till about dawn this morning then some men in a skiff come by and as good luck would have it the nigger was setting by the pallet with his head propped on his knees sound asleep so i motioned them in quiet and they slipped up on him and grabbed him and tied him before he knowed what he was about and we never had no trouble
and the boy being in a kind of a flighty sleep too we muffled the oars and hitched the raft on and towed her over very nice and quiet and the nigger never made the least row nor said a word from the start
he ain't no bad nigger gentlemen that's what i think about him somebody says well it sounds very good doctor i'm obleeged to say then the others softened up a little too and i was mighty thankful to that old doctor for doing jim that good turn and i was glad it was according to my judgment of him too because i thought he had a good heart in him and was a good man the first time i see him
then they all agreed that jim had acted very well and was deserving to have some notice took of it and reward
so every one of them promised right out and hearty that they wouldn't cuss him no more
then they come out and locked him up
i hoped they was going to say he could have one or two of the chains took off because they was rotten heavy or could have meat and greens with his bread and water but they didn't think of it and i reckoned it warn't best for me to mix in but i judged i'd get the doctor's yarn to aunt sally somehow or other as soon as i'd got through the breakers that was laying just ahead of meexplanations i mean of how i forgot to mention about sid being shot when i was telling how him and me put in that dratted night paddling around hunting the runaway nigger
but i had plenty time
aunt sally she stuck to the sickroom all day and all night and every time i see uncle silas mooning around i dodged him
next morning i heard tom was a good deal better and they said aunt sally was gone to get a nap
so i slips to the sickroom and if i found him awake i reckoned we could put up a yarn for the family that would wash
but he was sleeping and sleeping very peaceful too and pale not firefaced the way he was when he come
so i set down and laid for him to wake
in about half an hour aunt sally comes gliding in and there i was up a stump again
she motioned me to be still and set down by me and begun to whisper and said we could all be joyful now because all the symptoms was firstrate and he'd been sleeping like that for ever so long and looking better and peacefuller all the time and ten to one he'd wake up in his right mind
so we set there watching and by and by he stirs a bit and opened his eyes very natural and takes a look and says hellowhy i'm at home
how's that
where's the raft it's all right i says
and jim the same i says but couldn't say it pretty brash
but he never noticed but says good
splendid
now we're all right and safe
did you tell aunty i was going to say yes but she chipped in and says about what sid why about the way the whole thing was done what whole thing why the whole thing
there ain't but one how we set the runaway nigger freeme and tom good land
set the runwhat is the child talking about
dear dear out of his head again no i ain't out of my head i know all what i'm talking about
we did set him freeme and tom
we laid out to do it and we done it
and we done it elegant too he'd got a start and she never checked him up just set and stared and stared and let him clip along and i see it warn't no use for me to put in
why aunty it cost us a power of workweeks of ithours and hours every night whilst you was all asleep
and we had to steal candles and the sheet and the shirt and your dress and spoons and tin plates and caseknives and the warmingpan and the grindstone and flour and just no end of things and you can't think what work it was to make the saws and pens and inscriptions and one thing or another and you can't think half the fun it was
and we had to make up the pictures of coffins and things and nonnamous letters from the robbers and get up and down the lightningrod and dig the hole into the cabin and made the rope ladder and send it in cooked up in a pie and send in spoons and things to work with in your apron pocket mercy sakes and load up the cabin with rats and snakes and so on for company for jim and then you kept tom here so long with the butter in his hat that you come near spiling the whole business because the men come before we was out of the cabin and we had to rush and they heard us and let drive at us and i got my share and we dodged out of the path and let them go by and when the dogs come they warn't interested in us but went for the most noise and we got our canoe and made for the raft and was all safe and jim was a free man and we done it all by ourselves and wasn't it bully aunty well i never heard the likes of it in all my born days
so it was you you little rapscallions that's been making all this trouble and turned everybody's wits clean inside out and scared us all most to death
i've as good a notion as ever i had in my life to take it out o' you this very minute
to think here i've been night after night ayou just get well once you young scamp and i lay i'll tan the old harry out o' both o' ye but tom he was so proud and joyful he just couldn't hold in and his tongue just went itshe achipping in and spitting fire all along and both of them going it at once like a cat convention and she says well you get all the enjoyment you can out of it now for mind i tell you if i catch you meddling with him again meddling with who tom says dropping his smile and looking surprised
with who
why the runaway nigger of course
who'd you reckon tom looks at me very grave and says tom didn't you just tell me he was all right
hasn't he got away him says aunt sally the runaway nigger
'deed he hasn't
they've got him back safe and sound and he's in that cabin again on bread and water and loaded down with chains till he's claimed or sold tom rose square up in bed with his eye hot and his nostrils opening and shutting like gills and sings out to me they hain't no right to shut him up
shoveand don't you lose a minute
turn him loose
he ain't no slave he's as free as any cretur that walks this earth what does the child mean i mean every word i say aunt sally and if somebody don't go i'll go
i've knowed him all his life and so has tom there
old miss watson died two months ago and she was ashamed she ever was going to sell him down the river and said so and she set him free in her will then what on earth did you want to set him free for seeing he was already free well that is a question i must say and just like women
why i wanted the adventure of it and i'd a waded neckdeep in blood togoodness alive aunt polly if she warn't standing right there just inside the door looking as sweet and contented as an angel half full of pie i wish i may never
aunt sally jumped for her and most hugged the head off of her and cried over her and i found a good enough place for me under the bed for it was getting pretty sultry for us seemed to me
and i peeped out and in a little while tom's aunt polly shook herself loose and stood there looking across at tom over her spectacleskind of grinding him into the earth you know
and then she says yes you better turn y'r head awayi would if i was you tom oh deary me says aunt sally is he changed so
why that ain't tom it's sid tom'stom'swhy where is tom
he was here a minute ago you mean where's huck finnthat's what you mean
i reckon i hain't raised such a scamp as my tom all these years not to know him when i see him
that would be a pretty howdydo
come out from under that bed huck finn so i done it
but not feeling brash
aunt sally she was one of the mixedupestlooking persons i ever seeexcept one and that was uncle silas when he come in and they told it all to him
it kind of made him drunk as you may say and he didn't know nothing at all the rest of the day and preached a prayermeeting sermon that night that gave him a rattling ruputation because the oldest man in the world couldn't a understood it
so tom's aunt polly she told all about who i was and what and i had to up and tell how i was in such a tight place that when mrs phelps took me for tom sawyershe chipped in and says oh go on and call me aunt sally i'm used to it now and 'tain't no need to changethat when aunt sally took me for tom sawyer i had to stand itthere warn't no other way and i knowed he wouldn't mind because it would be nuts for him being a mystery and he'd make an adventure out of it and be perfectly satisfied
and so it turned out and he let on to be sid and made things as soft as he could for me
and his aunt polly she said tom was right about old miss watson setting jim free in her will and so sure enough tom sawyer had gone and took all that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free
and i couldn't ever understand before until that minute and that talk how he could help a body set a nigger free with his bringingup
well aunt polly she said that when aunt sally wrote to her that tom and sid had come all right and safe she says to herself look at that now
i might have expected it letting him go off that way without anybody to watch him
so now i got to go and trapse all the way down the river eleven hundred mile and find out what that creetur's up to this time as long as i couldn't seem to get any answer out of you about it why i never heard nothing from you says aunt sally
well i wonder
why i wrote you twice to ask you what you could mean by sid being here well i never got 'em sis aunt polly she turns around slow and severe and says you tom wellwhat he says kind of pettish
don't you what me you impudent thinghand out them letters what letters them letters
i be bound if i have to take aholt of you i'll they're in the trunk
there now
and they're just the same as they was when i got them out of the office
i hain't looked into them i hain't touched them
but i knowed they'd make trouble and i thought if you warn't in no hurry i'd well you do need skinning there ain't no mistake about it
and i wrote another one to tell you i was coming and i s'pose he no it come yesterday i hain't read it yet but it's all right i've got that one i wanted to offer to bet two dollars she hadn't but i reckoned maybe it was just as safe to not to
so i never said nothing
the first time i catched tom private i asked him what was his idea time of the evasionwhat it was he'd planned to do if the evasion worked all right and he managed to set a nigger free that was already free before
and he said what he had planned in his head from the start if we got jim out all safe was for us to run him down the river on the raft and have adventures plumb to the mouth of the river and then tell him about his being free and take him back up home on a steamboat in style and pay him for his lost time and write word ahead and get out all the niggers around and have them waltz him into town with a torchlight procession and a brassband and then he would be a hero and so would we
but i reckoned it was about as well the way it was
we had jim out of the chains in no time and when aunt polly and uncle silas and aunt sally found out how good he helped the doctor nurse tom they made a heap of fuss over him and fixed him up prime and give him all he wanted to eat and a good time and nothing to do
and we had him up to the sickroom and had a high talk and tom give jim forty dollars for being prisoner for us so patient and doing it up so good and jim was pleased most to death and busted out and says dah now huck what i tell youwhat i tell you up dah on jackson islan'
i tole you i got a hairy breas' en what's de sign un it en i tole you i ben rich wunst en gwineter to be rich agin en it's come true en heah she is
dah now
doan' talk to mesigns is signs mine i tell you en i knowed jis' 's well 'at i 'uz gwineter be rich agin as i's astannin' heah dis minute and then tom he talked along and talked along and says le's all three slide out of here one of these nights and get an outfit and go for howling adventures amongst the injuns over in the territory for a couple of weeks or two and i says all right that suits me but i ain't got no money for to buy the outfit and i reckon i couldn't get none from home because it's likely pap's been back before now and got it all away from judge thatcher and drunk it up
no he hain't tom says it's all there yetsix thousand dollars and more and your pap hain't ever been back since
hadn't when i come away anyhow jim says kind of solemn he ain't acomin' back no mo' huck i says why jim nemmine why huckbut he ain't comin' back no mo but i kept at him so at last he says doan' you 'member de house dat was float'n down de river en dey wuz a man in dah kivered up en i went in en unkivered him and didn' let you come in
well den you kin git yo' money when you wants it kase dat wuz him tom's most well now and got his bullet around his neck on a watchguard for a watch and is always seeing what time it is and so there ain't nothing more to write about and i am rotten glad of it because if i'd a knowed what a trouble it was to make a book i wouldn't a tackled it and ain't agoing to no more
but i reckon i got to light out for the territory ahead of the rest because aunt sally she's going to adopt me and sivilize me and i can't stand it
i been there before

huck finn is drawn from life tom sawyer also but not from an individualhe is a combination of the characteristics of three boys whom i knew and therefore belongs to the composite order of architecture
the odd superstitions touched upon were all prevalent among children and slaves in the west at the period of this storythat is to say thirty or forty years ago
although my book is intended mainly for the entertainment of boys and girls i hope it will not be shunned by men and women on that account for part of my plan has been to try to pleasantly remind adults of what they once were themselves and of how they felt and thought and talked and what queer enterprises they sometimes engaged in

tom no answer
tom no answer
whats gone with that boy i wonder
you tom no answer
the old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the room then she put them up and looked out under them
she seldom or never looked through them for so small a thing as a boy they were her state pair the pride of her heart and were built for style not serviceshe could have seen through a pair of stovelids just as well
she looked perplexed for a moment and then said not fiercely but still loud enough for the furniture to hear well i lay if i get hold of you ill she did not finish for by this time she was bending down and punching under the bed with the broom and so she needed breath to punctuate the punches with
she resurrected nothing but the cat
i never did see the beat of that boy she went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among the tomato vines and jimpson weeds that constituted the garden
no tom
so she lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for distance and shouted youu tom there was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time to seize a small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight
there
i might a thought of that closet
what you been doing in there nothing nothing
look at your hands
and look at your mouth
what is that truck i dont know aunt well i know
its jamthats what it is
forty times ive said if you didnt let that jam alone id skin you
hand me that switch the switch hovered in the airthe peril was desperate my
look behind you aunt the old lady whirled round and snatched her skirts out of danger
the lad fled on the instant scrambled up the high boardfence and disappeared over it
his aunt polly stood surprised a moment and then broke into a gentle laugh
hang the boy cant i never learn anything
aint he played me tricks enough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time
but old fools is the biggest fools there is
cant learn an old dog new tricks as the saying is
but my goodness he never plays them alike two days and how is a body to know whats coming
he pears to know just how long he can torment me before i get my dander up and he knows if he can make out to put me off for a minute or make me laugh its all down again and i cant hit him a lick
i aint doing my duty by that boy and thats the lords truth goodness knows
spare the rod and spile the child as the good book says
im a laying up sin and suffering for us both i know
hes full of the old scratch but lawsame
hes my own dead sisters boy poor thing and i aint got the heart to lash him somehow
every time i let him off my conscience does hurt me so and every time i hit him my old heart most breaks
wellawell man that is born of woman is of few days and full of trouble as the scripture says and i reckon its so
hell play hookey this evening and southwestern for afternoon ill just be obleeged to make him work tomorrow to punish him
its mighty hard to make him work saturdays when all the boys is having holiday but he hates work more than he hates anything else and ive got to do some of my duty by him or ill be the ruination of the child tom did play hookey and he had a very good time
he got back home barely in season to help jim the small colored boy saw nextdays wood and split the kindlings before supperat least he was there in time to tell his adventures to jim while jim did threefourths of the work
toms younger brother or rather halfbrother sid was already through with his part of the work picking up chips for he was a quiet boy and had no adventurous troublesome ways
while tom was eating his supper and stealing sugar as opportunity offered aunt polly asked him questions that were full of guile and very deepfor she wanted to trap him into damaging revealments
like many other simplehearted souls it was her pet vanity to believe she was endowed with a talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy and she loved to contemplate her most transparent devices as marvels of low cunning
said she tom it was middling warm in school warnt it yesm powerful warm warnt it yesm didnt you want to go in aswimming tom a bit of a scare shot through toma touch of uncomfortable suspicion
he searched aunt pollys face but it told him nothing
so he said nomwell not very much the old lady reached out her hand and felt toms shirt and said but you aint too warm now though and it flattered her to reflect that she had discovered that the shirt was dry without anybody knowing that that was what she had in her mind
but in spite of her tom knew where the wind lay now
so he forestalled what might be the next move some of us pumped on our headsmines damp yet
see aunt polly was vexed to think she had overlooked that bit of circumstantial evidence and missed a trick
then she had a new inspiration tom you didnt have to undo your shirt collar where i sewed it to pump on your head did you
unbutton your jacket the trouble vanished out of toms face
he opened his jacket
his shirt collar was securely sewed
bother
well go long with you
id made sure youd played hookey and been aswimming
but i forgive ye tom
i reckon youre a kind of a singed cat as the saying isbettern you look
this time she was half sorry her sagacity had miscarried and half glad that tom had stumbled into obedient conduct for once
but sidney said well now if i didnt think you sewed his collar with white thread but its black why i did sew it with white
tom but tom did not wait for the rest
as he went out at the door he said siddy ill lick you for that in a safe place tom examined two large needles which were thrust into the lapels of his jacket and had thread bound about themone needle carried white thread and the other black
he said shed never noticed if it hadnt been for sid
confound it
sometimes she sews it with white and sometimes she sews it with black
i wish to geeminy shed stick to one or totheri cant keep the run of em
but i bet you ill lam sid for that
ill learn him he was not the model boy of the village
he knew the model boy very well thoughand loathed him
within two minutes or even less he had forgotten all his troubles
not because his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to him than a mans are to a man but because a new and powerful interest bore them down and drove them out of his mind for the timejust as mens misfortunes are forgotten in the excitement of new enterprises
this new interest was a valued novelty in whistling which he had just acquired from a negro and he was suffering to practise it undisturbed
it consisted in a peculiar birdlike turn a sort of liquid warble produced by touching the tongue to the roof of the mouth at short intervals in the midst of the musicthe reader probably remembers how to do it if he has ever been a boy
diligence and attention soon gave him the knack of it and he strode down the street with his mouth full of harmony and his soul full of gratitude
he felt much as an astronomer feels who has discovered a new planetno doubt as far as strong deep unalloyed pleasure is concerned the advantage was with the boy not the astronomer
the summer evenings were long
it was not dark yet
presently tom checked his whistle
a stranger was before hima boy a shade larger than himself
a newcomer of any age or either sex was an impressive curiosity in the poor little shabby village of st petersburg
this boy was well dressed toowell dressed on a weekday
this was simply astounding
his cap was a dainty thing his closebuttoned blue cloth roundabout was new and natty and so were his pantaloons
he had shoes onand it was only friday
he even wore a necktie a bright bit of ribbon
he had a citified air about him that ate into toms vitals
the more tom stared at the splendid marvel the higher he turned up his nose at his finery and the shabbier and shabbier his own outfit seemed to him to grow
neither boy spoke
if one moved the other movedbut only sidewise in a circle they kept face to face and eye to eye all the time
finally tom said i can lick you id like to see you try it well i can do it no you cant either yes i can no you cant i can you cant can cant an uncomfortable pause
then tom said whats your name tisnt any of your business maybe well i low ill make it my business well why dont you if you say much i will muchmuchmuch
there now oh you think youre mighty smart dont you
i could lick you with one hand tied behind me if i wanted to well why dont you do it
you say you can do it well i will if you fool with me oh yesive seen whole families in the same fix smarty
you think youre some now dont you
oh what a hat you can lump that hat if you dont like it
i dare you to knock it offand anybody thatll take a dare will suck eggs youre a liar youre another youre a fighting liar and dasnt take it up awtake a walk sayif you give me much more of your sass ill take and bounce a rock offn your head oh of course you will well i will well why dont you do it then
what do you keep saying you will for
why dont you do it
its because youre afraid i aint afraid you are i aint you are another pause and more eying and sidling around each other
presently they were shoulder to shoulder
tom said get away from here go away yourself i wont i wont either so they stood each with a foot placed at an angle as a brace and both shoving with might and main and glowering at each other with hate
but neither could get an advantage
after struggling till both were hot and flushed each relaxed his strain with watchful caution and tom said youre a coward and a pup
ill tell my big brother on you and he can thrash you with his little finger and ill make him do it too what do i care for your big brother
ive got a brother thats bigger than he isand whats more he can throw him over that fence too both brothers were imaginary
thats a lie your saying so dont make it so tom drew a line in the dust with his big toe and said i dare you to step over that and ill lick you till you cant stand up
anybody thatll take a dare will steal sheep the new boy stepped over promptly and said now you said youd do it now lets see you do it dont you crowd me now you better look out well you said youd do itwhy dont you do it by jingo
for two cents i will do it the new boy took two broad coppers out of his pocket and held them out with derision
tom struck them to the ground
in an instant both boys were rolling and tumbling in the dirt gripped together like cats and for the space of a minute they tugged and tore at each others hair and clothes punched and scratched each others nose and covered themselves with dust and glory
presently the confusion took form and through the fog of battle tom appeared seated astride the new boy and pounding him with his fists
holler nuff said he
the boy only struggled to free himself
he was cryingmainly from rage
holler nuffand the pounding went on
at last the stranger got out a smothered nuff and tom let him up and said now thatll learn you
better look out who youre fooling with next time the new boy went off brushing the dust from his clothes sobbing snuffling and occasionally looking back and shaking his head and threatening what he would do to tom the next time he caught him out to which tom responded with jeers and started off in high feather and as soon as his back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone threw it and hit him between the shoulders and then turned tail and ran like an antelope
tom chased the traitor home and thus found out where he lived
he then held a position at the gate for some time daring the enemy to come outside but the enemy only made faces at him through the window and declined
at last the enemys mother appeared and called tom a bad vicious vulgar child and ordered him away
so he went away but he said he lowed to lay for that boy
he got home pretty late that night and when he climbed cautiously in at the window he uncovered an ambuscade in the person of his aunt and when she saw the state his clothes were in her resolution to turn his saturday holiday into captivity at hard labor became adamantine in its firmness
saturday morning was come and all the summer world was bright and fresh and brimming with life
there was a song in every heart and if the heart was young the music issued at the lips
there was cheer in every face and a spring in every step
the locusttrees were in bloom and the fragrance of the blossoms filled the air
cardiff hill beyond the village and above it was green with vegetation and it lay just far enough away to seem a delectable land dreamy reposeful and inviting
tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a longhandled brush
he surveyed the fence and all gladness left him and a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit
thirty yards of board fence nine feet high
life to him seemed hollow and existence but a burden
sighing he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost plank repeated the operation did it again compared the insignificant whitewashed streak with the farreaching continent of unwhitewashed fence and sat down on a treebox discouraged
jim came skipping out at the gate with a tin pail and singing buffalo gals
bringing water from the town pump had always been hateful work in toms eyes before but now it did not strike him so
he remembered that there was company at the pump
white mulatto and negro boys and girls were always there waiting their turns resting trading playthings quarrelling fighting skylarking
and he remembered that although the pump was only a hundred and fifty yards off jim never got back with a bucket of water under an hourand even then somebody generally had to go after him
tom said say jim ill fetch the water if youll whitewash some jim shook his head and said cant mars tom
ole missis she tole me i got to go an git dis water an not stop foolin roun wid anybody
she say she spec mars tom gwine to ax me to whitewash an so she tole me go long an tend to my own businessshe lowed shed tend to de whitewashin oh never you mind what she said jim
thats the way she always talks
gimme the bucketi wont be gone only a a minute
she wont ever know oh i dasnt mars tom
ole missis shed take an tar de head offn me
deed she would she
she never licks anybodywhacks em over the head with her thimbleand who cares for that id like to know
she talks awful but talk dont hurtanyways it dont if she dont cry
jim ill give you a marvel
ill give you a white alley jim began to waver
white alley jim
and its a bully taw my
dats a mighty gay marvel i tell you
but mars tom is powerful fraid ole missis and besides if you will ill show you my sore toe jim was only humanthis attraction was too much for him
he put down his pail took the white alley and bent over the toe with absorbing interest while the bandage was being unwound
in another moment he was flying down the street with his pail and a tingling rear tom was whitewashing with vigor and aunt polly was retiring from the field with a slipper in her hand and triumph in her eye
but toms energy did not last
he began to think of the fun he had planned for this day and his sorrows multiplied
soon the free boys would come tripping along on all sorts of delicious expeditions and they would make a world of fun of him for having to workthe very thought of it burnt him like fire
he got out his worldly wealth and examined itbits of toys marbles and trash enough to buy an exchange of work maybe but not half enough to buy so much as half an hour of pure freedom
so he returned his straitened means to his pocket and gave up the idea of trying to buy the boys
at this dark and hopeless moment an inspiration burst upon him
nothing less than a great magnificent inspiration
he took up his brush and went tranquilly to work
ben rogers hove in sight presentlythe very boy of all boys whose ridicule he had been dreading
bens gait was the hopskipandjumpproof enough that his heart was light and his anticipations high
he was eating an apple and giving a long melodious whoop at intervals followed by a deeptoned dingdongdong dingdongdong for he was personating a steamboat
as he drew near he slackened speed took the middle of the street leaned far over to starboard and rounded to ponderously and with laborious pomp and circumstancefor he was personating the big missouri and considered himself to be drawing nine feet of water
he was boat and captain and enginebells combined so he had to imagine himself standing on his own hurricanedeck giving the orders and executing them stop her sir
tingalingling the headway ran almost out and he drew up slowly toward the sidewalk
ship up to back
tingalingling his arms straightened and stiffened down his sides
set her back on the stabboard

tom went on whitewashingpaid no attention to the steamboat
ben stared a moment and then said hiyi
youre up a stump aint you no answer
tom surveyed his last touch with the eye of an artist then he gave his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result as before
ben ranged up alongside of him
toms mouth watered for the apple but he stuck to his work
ben said hello old chap you got to work hey tom wheeled suddenly and said why its you ben
i warnt noticing sayim going in aswimming i am
dont you wish you could
but of course youd druther workwouldnt you
course you would tom contemplated the boy a bit and said what do you call work why aint that work tom resumed his whitewashing and answered carelessly well maybe it is and maybe it aint
all i know is it suits tom sawyer oh come now you dont mean to let on that you like it the brush continued to move
like it
well i dont see why i oughtnt to like it
does a boy get a chance to whitewash a fence every day that put the thing in a new light
ben stopped nibbling his apple
tom swept his brush daintily back and forthstepped back to note the effectadded a touch here and therecriticised the effect againben watching every move and getting more and more interested more and more absorbed
presently he said say tom let me whitewash a little tom considered was about to consent but he altered his mind nonoi reckon it wouldnt hardly do ben
you see aunt pollys awful particular about this fenceright here on the street you knowbut if it was the back fence i wouldnt mind and she wouldnt
yes shes awful particular about this fence its got to be done very careful i reckon there aint one boy in a thousand maybe two thousand that can do it the way its got to be done nois that so
oh come nowlemme just try
only just a littleid let you if you was me tom ben id like to honest injun but aunt pollywell jim wanted to do it but she wouldnt let him sid wanted to do it and she wouldnt let sid
now dont you see how im fixed
if you was to tackle this fence and anything was to happen to it oh shucks ill be just as careful
now lemme try
sayill give you the core of my apple well hereno ben now dont
im afeard ill give you all of it tom gave up the brush with reluctance in his face but alacrity in his heart
and while the late steamer big missouri worked and sweated in the sun the retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade close by dangled his legs munched his apple and planned the slaughter of more innocents
there was no lack of material boys happened along every little while they came to jeer but remained to whitewash
by the time ben was fagged out tom had traded the next chance to billy fisher for a kite in good repair and when he played out johnny miller bought in for a dead rat and a string to swing it withand so on and so on hour after hour
and when the middle of the afternoon came from being a poor povertystricken boy in the morning tom was literally rolling in wealth
he had besides the things before mentioned twelve marbles part of a jewsharp a piece of blue bottleglass to look through a spool cannon a key that wouldnt unlock anything a fragment of chalk a glass stopper of a decanter a tin soldier a couple of tadpoles six firecrackers a kitten with only one eye a brass doorknob a dogcollarbut no dogthe handle of a knife four pieces of orangepeel and a dilapidated old window sash
he had had a nice good idle time all the whileplenty of companyand the fence had three coats of whitewash on it
if he hadnt run out of whitewash he would have bankrupted every boy in the village
tom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world after all
he had discovered a great law of human action without knowing itnamely that in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to attain
if he had been a great and wise philosopher like the writer of this book he would now have comprehended that work consists of whatever a body is obliged to do and that play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do
and this would help him to understand why constructing artificial flowers or performing on a treadmill is work while rolling tenpins or climbing mont blanc is only amusement
there are wealthy gentlemen in england who drive fourhorse passengercoaches twenty or thirty miles on a daily line in the summer because the privilege costs them considerable money but if they were offered wages for the service that would turn it into work and then they would resign
the boy mused awhile over the substantial change which had taken place in his worldly circumstances and then wended toward headquarters to report
tom presented himself before aunt polly who was sitting by an open window in a pleasant rearward apartment which was bedroom breakfastroom diningroom and library combined
the balmy summer air the restful quiet the odor of the flowers and the drowsing murmur of the bees had had their effect and she was nodding over her knittingfor she had no company but the cat and it was asleep in her lap
her spectacles were propped up on her gray head for safety
she had thought that of course tom had deserted long ago and she wondered at seeing him place himself in her power again in this intrepid way
he said maynt i go and play now aunt what aready
how much have you done its all done aunt tom dont lie to mei cant bear it i aint aunt it is all done aunt polly placed small trust in such evidence
she went out to see for herself and she would have been content to find twenty per cent
of toms statement true
when she found the entire fence whitewashed and not only whitewashed but elaborately coated and recoated and even a streak added to the ground her astonishment was almost unspeakable
she said well i never
theres no getting round it you can work when youre a mind to tom and then she diluted the compliment by adding but its powerful seldom youre a mind to im bound to say
well go long and play but mind you get back some time in a week or ill tan you she was so overcome by the splendor of his achievement that she took him into the closet and selected a choice apple and delivered it to him along with an improving lecture upon the added value and flavor a treat took to itself when it came without sin through virtuous effort
and while she closed with a happy scriptural flourish he hooked a doughnut
then he skipped out and saw sid just starting up the outside stairway that led to the back rooms on the second floor
clods were handy and the air was full of them in a twinkling
they raged around sid like a hailstorm and before aunt polly could collect her surprised faculties and sally to the rescue six or seven clods had taken personal effect and tom was over the fence and gone
there was a gate but as a general thing he was too crowded for time to make use of it
his soul was at peace now that he had settled with sid for calling attention to his black thread and getting him into trouble
tom skirted the block and came round into a muddy alley that led by the back of his aunts cowstable
he presently got safely beyond the reach of capture and punishment and hastened toward the public square of the village where two military companies of boys had met for conflict according to previous appointment
tom was general of one of these armies joe harper a bosom friend general of the other
these two great commanders did not condescend to fight in personthat being better suited to the still smaller frybut sat together on an eminence and conducted the field operations by orders delivered through aidesdecamp
toms army won a great victory after a long and hardfought battle
then the dead were counted prisoners exchanged the terms of the next disagreement agreed upon and the day for the necessary battle appointed after which the armies fell into line and marched away and tom turned homeward alone
as he was passing by the house where jeff thatcher lived he saw a new girl in the gardena lovely little blueeyed creature with yellow hair plaited into two longtails white summer frock and embroidered pantalettes
the freshcrowned hero fell without firing a shot
a certain amy lawrence vanished out of his heart and left not even a memory of herself behind
he had thought he loved her to distraction he had regarded his passion as adoration and behold it was only a poor little evanescent partiality
he had been months winning her she had confessed hardly a week ago he had been the happiest and the proudest boy in the world only seven short days and here in one instant of time she had gone out of his heart like a casual stranger whose visit is done
he worshipped this new angel with furtive eye till he saw that she had discovered him then he pretended he did not know she was present and began to show off in all sorts of absurd boyish ways in order to win her admiration
he kept up this grotesque foolishness for some time but byandby while he was in the midst of some dangerous gymnastic performances he glanced aside and saw that the little girl was wending her way toward the house
tom came up to the fence and leaned on it grieving and hoping she would tarry yet awhile longer
she halted a moment on the steps and then moved toward the door
tom heaved a great sigh as she put her foot on the threshold
but his face lit up right away for she tossed a pansy over the fence a moment before she disappeared
the boy ran around and stopped within a foot or two of the flower and then shaded his eyes with his hand and began to look down street as if he had discovered something of interest going on in that direction
presently he picked up a straw and began trying to balance it on his nose with his head tilted far back and as he moved from side to side in his efforts he edged nearer and nearer toward the pansy finally his bare foot rested upon it his pliant toes closed upon it and he hopped away with the treasure and disappeared round the corner
but only for a minuteonly while he could button the flower inside his jacket next his heartor next his stomach possibly for he was not much posted in anatomy and not hypercritical anyway
he returned now and hung about the fence till nightfall showing off as before but the girl never exhibited herself again though tom comforted himself a little with the hope that she had been near some window meantime and been aware of his attentions
finally he strode home reluctantly with his poor head full of visions
all through supper his spirits were so high that his aunt wondered what had got into the child he took a good scolding about clodding sid and did not seem to mind it in the least
he tried to steal sugar under his aunts very nose and got his knuckles rapped for it
he said aunt you dont whack sid when he takes it well sid dont torment a body the way you do
youd be always into that sugar if i warnt watching you presently she stepped into the kitchen and sid happy in his immunity reached for the sugarbowla sort of glorying over tom which was wellnigh unbearable
but sids fingers slipped and the bowl dropped and broke
tom was in ecstasies
in such ecstasies that he even controlled his tongue and was silent
he said to himself that he would not speak a word even when his aunt came in but would sit perfectly still till she asked who did the mischief and then he would tell and there would be nothing so good in the world as to see that pet model catch it he was so brimful of exultation that he could hardly hold himself when the old lady came back and stood above the wreck discharging lightnings of wrath from over her spectacles
he said to himself now its coming and the next instant he was sprawling on the floor
the potent palm was uplifted to strike again when tom cried out hold on now what er you belting me forsid broke it aunt polly paused perplexed and tom looked for healing pity
but when she got her tongue again she only said umf
well you didnt get a lick amiss i reckon
you been into some other audacious mischief when i wasnt around like enough then her conscience reproached her and she yearned to say something kind and loving but she judged that this would be construed into a confession that she had been in the wrong and discipline forbade that
so she kept silence and went about her affairs with a troubled heart
tom sulked in a corner and exalted his woes
he knew that in her heart his aunt was on her knees to him and he was morosely gratified by the consciousness of it
he would hang out no signals he would take notice of none
he knew that a yearning glance fell upon him now and then through a film of tears but he refused recognition of it
he pictured himself lying sick unto death and his aunt bending over him beseeching one little forgiving word but he would turn his face to the wall and die with that word unsaid
ah how would she feel then
and he pictured himself brought home from the river dead with his curls all wet and his sore heart at rest
how she would throw herself upon him and how her tears would fall like rain and her lips pray god to give her back her boy and she would never never abuse him any more
but he would lie there cold and white and make no signa poor little sufferer whose griefs were at an end
he so worked upon his feelings with the pathos of these dreams that he had to keep swallowing he was so like to choke and his eyes swam in a blur of water which overflowed when he winked and ran down and trickled from the end of his nose
and such a luxury to him was this petting of his sorrows that he could not bear to have any worldly cheeriness or any grating delight intrude upon it it was too sacred for such contact and so presently when his cousin mary danced in all alive with the joy of seeing home again after an agelong visit of one week to the country he got up and moved in clouds and darkness out at one door as she brought song and sunshine in at the other
he wandered far from the accustomed haunts of boys and sought desolate places that were in harmony with his spirit
a log raft in the river invited him and he seated himself on its outer edge and contemplated the dreary vastness of the stream wishing the while that he could only be drowned all at once and unconsciously without undergoing the uncomfortable routine devised by nature
then he thought of his flower
he got it out rumpled and wilted and it mightily increased his dismal felicity
he wondered if she would pity him if she knew
would she cry and wish that she had a right to put her arms around his neck and comfort him
or would she turn coldly away like all the hollow world
this picture brought such an agony of pleasurable suffering that he worked it over and over again in his mind and set it up in new and varied lights till he wore it threadbare
at last he rose up sighing and departed in the darkness
about halfpast nine or ten oclock he came along the deserted street to where the adored unknown lived he paused a moment no sound fell upon his listening ear a candle was casting a dull glow upon the curtain of a secondstory window
was the sacred presence there
he climbed the fence threaded his stealthy way through the plants till he stood under that window he looked up at it long and with emotion then he laid him down on the ground under it disposing himself upon his back with his hands clasped upon his breast and holding his poor wilted flower
and thus he would dieout in the cold world with no shelter over his homeless head no friendly hand to wipe the deathdamps from his brow no loving face to bend pityingly over him when the great agony came
and thus she would see him when she looked out upon the glad morning and oh
would she drop one little tear upon his poor lifeless form would she heave one little sigh to see a bright young life so rudely blighted so untimely cut down
the window went up a maidservants discordant voice profaned the holy calm and a deluge of water drenched the prone martyrs remains
the strangling hero sprang up with a relieving snort
there was a whiz as of a missile in the air mingled with the murmur of a curse a sound as of shivering glass followed and a small vague form went over the fence and shot away in the gloom
not long after as tom all undressed for bed was surveying his drenched garments by the light of a tallow dip sid woke up but if he had any dim idea of making any references to allusions he thought better of it and held his peace for there was danger in toms eye
tom turned in without the added vexation of prayers and sid made mental note of the omission
the sun rose upon a tranquil world and beamed down upon the peaceful village like a benediction
breakfast over aunt polly had family worship it began with a prayer built from the ground up of solid courses of scriptural quotations welded together with a thin mortar of originality and from the summit of this she delivered a grim chapter of the mosaic law as from sinai
then tom girded up his loins so to speak and went to work to get his verses sid had learned his lesson days before
tom bent all his energies to the memorizing of five verses and he chose part of the sermon on the mount because he could find no verses that were shorter
at the end of half an hour tom had a vague general idea of his lesson but no more for his mind was traversing the whole field of human thought and his hands were busy with distracting recreations
mary took his book to hear him recite and he tried to find his way through the fog blessed are theaa poor yespoor blessed are the pooraa in spirit in spirit blessed are the poor in spirit for theythey theirs for theirs
blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
blessed are they that mourn for theythey sh for theya s h a for they s hoh i dont know what it is shall oh shall
for they shallfor they shallaashall mournaablessed are they that shallthey thatathey that shall mourn for they shallashall what
why dont you tell me marywhat do you want to be so mean for oh tom you poor thickheaded thing im not teasing you
i wouldnt do that
you must go and learn it again
dont you be discouraged tom youll manage itand if you do ill give you something ever so nice
there now thats a good boy all right
what is it mary tell me what it is never you mind tom
you know if i say its nice it is nice you bet you thats so mary
all right ill tackle it again and he did tackle it againand under the double pressure of curiosity and prospective gain he did it with such spirit that he accomplished a shining success
mary gave him a brandnew barlow knife worth twelve and a half cents and the convulsion of delight that swept his system shook him to his foundations
true the knife would not cut anything but it was a sureenough barlow and there was inconceivable grandeur in thatthough where the western boys ever got the idea that such a weapon could possibly be counterfeited to its injury is an imposing mystery and will always remain so perhaps
tom contrived to scarify the cupboard with it and was arranging to begin on the bureau when he was called off to dress for sundayschool
mary gave him a tin basin of water and a piece of soap and he went outside the door and set the basin on a little bench there then he dipped the soap in the water and laid it down turned up his sleeves poured out the water on the ground gently and then entered the kitchen and began to wipe his face diligently on the towel behind the door
but mary removed the towel and said now aint you ashamed tom
you mustnt be so bad
water wont hurt you tom was a trifle disconcerted
the basin was refilled and this time he stood over it a little while gathering resolution took in a big breath and began
when he entered the kitchen presently with both eyes shut and groping for the towel with his hands an honorable testimony of suds and water was dripping from his face
but when he emerged from the towel he was not yet satisfactory for the clean territory stopped short at his chin and his jaws like a mask below and beyond this line there was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread downward in front and backward around his neck
mary took him in hand and when she was done with him he was a man and a brother without distinction of color and his saturated hair was neatly brushed and its short curls wrought into a dainty and symmetrical general effect
he privately smoothed out the curls with labor and difficulty and plastered his hair close down to his head for he held curls to be effeminate and his own filled his life with bitterness
then mary got out a suit of his clothing that had been used only on sundays during two yearsthey were simply called his other clothesand so by that we know the size of his wardrobe
the girl put him to rights after he had dressed himself she buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin turned his vast shirt collar down over his shoulders brushed him off and crowned him with his speckled straw hat
he now looked exceedingly improved and uncomfortable
he was fully as uncomfortable as he looked for there was a restraint about whole clothes and cleanliness that galled him
he hoped that mary would forget his shoes but the hope was blighted she coated them thoroughly with tallow as was the custom and brought them out
he lost his temper and said he was always being made to do everything he didnt want to do
but mary said persuasively please tomthats a good boy so he got into the shoes snarling
mary was soon ready and the three children set out for sundayschoola place that tom hated with his whole heart but sid and mary were fond of it
sabbathschool hours were from nine to halfpast ten and then church service
two of the children always remained for the sermon voluntarily and the other always remained toofor stronger reasons
the churchs highbacked uncushioned pews would seat about three hundred persons the edifice was but a small plain affair with a sort of pine board treebox on top of it for a steeple
at the door tom dropped back a step and accosted a sundaydressed comrade say billy got a yaller ticket yes whatll you take for her whatll you give piece of lickrish and a fishhook less see em tom exhibited
they were satisfactory and the property changed hands
then tom traded a couple of white alleys for three red tickets and some small trifle or other for a couple of blue ones
he waylaid other boys as they came and went on buying tickets of various colors ten or fifteen minutes longer
he entered the church now with a swarm of clean and noisy boys and girls proceeded to his seat and started a quarrel with the first boy that came handy
the teacher a grave elderly man interfered then turned his back a moment and tom pulled a boys hair in the next bench and was absorbed in his book when the boy turned around stuck a pin in another boy presently in order to hear him say ouch and got a new reprimand from his teacher
toms whole class were of a patternrestless noisy and troublesome
when they came to recite their lessons not one of them knew his verses perfectly but had to be prompted all along
however they worried through and each got his rewardin small blue tickets each with a passage of scripture on it each blue ticket was pay for two verses of the recitation
ten blue tickets equalled a red one and could be exchanged for it ten red tickets equalled a yellow one for ten yellow tickets the superintendent gave a very plainly bound bible worth forty cents in those easy times to the pupil
how many of my readers would have the industry and application to memorize two thousand verses even for a dore bible
and yet mary had acquired two bibles in this wayit was the patient work of two yearsand a boy of german parentage had won four or five
he once recited three thousand verses without stopping but the strain upon his mental faculties was too great and he was little better than an idiot from that day fortha grievous misfortune for the school for on great occasions before company the superintendent as tom expressed it had always made this boy come out and spread himself only the older pupils managed to keep their tickets and stick to their tedious work long enough to get a bible and so the delivery of one of these prizes was a rare and noteworthy circumstance the successful pupil was so great and conspicuous for that day that on the spot every scholars heart was fired with a fresh ambition that often lasted a couple of weeks
it is possible that toms mental stomach had never really hungered for one of those prizes but unquestionably his entire being had for many a day longed for the glory and the eclat that came with it
in due course the superintendent stood up in front of the pulpit with a closed hymnbook in his hand and his forefinger inserted between its leaves and commanded attention
when a sundayschool superintendent makes his customary little speech a hymnbook in the hand is as necessary as is the inevitable sheet of music in the hand of a singer who stands forward on the platform and sings a solo at a concertthough why is a mystery for neither the hymnbook nor the sheet of music is ever referred to by the sufferer
this superintendent was a slim creature of thirtyfive with a sandy goatee and short sandy hair he wore a stiff standingcollar whose upper edge almost reached his ears and whose sharp points curved forward abreast the corners of his moutha fence that compelled a straight lookout ahead and a turning of the whole body when a side view was required his chin was propped on a spreading cravat which was as broad and as long as a banknote and had fringed ends his boot toes were turned sharply up in the fashion of the day like sleighrunnersan effect patiently and laboriously produced by the young men by sitting with their toes pressed against a wall for hours together
mr walters was very earnest of mien and very sincere and honest at heart and he held sacred things and places in such reverence and so separated them from worldly matters that unconsciously to himself his sundayschool voice had acquired a peculiar intonation which was wholly absent on weekdays
he began after this fashion now children i want you all to sit up just as straight and pretty as you can and give me all your attention for a minute or two
therethat is it
that is the way good little boys and girls should do
i see one little girl who is looking out of the windowi am afraid she thinks i am out there somewhereperhaps up in one of the trees making a speech to the little birds
applausive titter
i want to tell you how good it makes me feel to see so many bright clean little faces assembled in a place like this learning to do right and be good and so forth and so on
it is not necessary to set down the rest of the oration
it was of a pattern which does not vary and so it is familiar to us all
the latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of fights and other recreations among certain of the bad boys and by fidgetings and whisperings that extended far and wide washing even to the bases of isolated and incorruptible rocks like sid and mary
but now every sound ceased suddenly with the subsidence of mr walters voice and the conclusion of the speech was received with a burst of silent gratitude
a good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event which was more or less rarethe entrance of visitors lawyer thatcher accompanied by a very feeble and aged man a fine portly middleaged gentleman with irongray hair and a dignified lady who was doubtless the latters wife
the lady was leading a child
tom had been restless and full of chafings and repinings consciencesmitten toohe could not meet amy lawrences eye he could not brook her loving gaze
but when he saw this small newcomer his soul was all ablaze with bliss in a moment
the next moment he was showing off with all his mightcuffing boys pulling hair making facesin a word using every art that seemed likely to fascinate a girl and win her applause
his exaltation had but one alloythe memory of his humiliation in this angels gardenand that record in sand was fast washing out under the waves of happiness that were sweeping over it now
the visitors were given the highest seat of honor and as soon as mr walters speech was finished he introduced them to the school
the middleaged man turned out to be a prodigious personageno less a one than the county judgealtogether the most august creation these children had ever looked uponand they wondered what kind of material he was made ofand they half wanted to hear him roar and were half afraid he might too
he was from constantinople twelve miles awayso he had travelled and seen the worldthese very eyes had looked upon the county courthousewhich was said to have a tin roof
the awe which these reflections inspired was attested by the impressive silence and the ranks of staring eyes
this was the great judge thatcher brother of their own lawyer
jeff thatcher immediately went forward to be familiar with the great man and be envied by the school
it would have been music to his soul to hear the whisperings look at him jim
hes a going up there
saylook
hes a going to shake hands with himhe is shaking hands with him
by jings dont you wish you was jeff mr walters fell to showing off with all sorts of official bustlings and activities giving orders delivering judgments discharging directions here there everywhere that he could find a target
the librarian showed offrunning hither and thither with his arms full of books and making a deal of the splutter and fuss that insect authority delights in
the young lady teachers showed offbending sweetly over pupils that were lately being boxed lifting pretty warning fingers at bad little boys and patting good ones lovingly
the young gentlemen teachers showed off with small scoldings and other little displays of authority and fine attention to disciplineand most of the teachers of both sexes found business up at the library by the pulpit and it was business that frequently had to be done over again two or three times with much seeming vexation
the little girls showed off in various ways and the little boys showed off with such diligence that the air was thick with paper wads and the murmur of scufflings
and above it all the great man sat and beamed a majestic judicial smile upon all the house and warmed himself in the sun of his own grandeurfor he was showing off too
there was only one thing wanting to make mr walters ecstasy complete and that was a chance to deliver a bibleprize and exhibit a prodigy
several pupils had a few yellow tickets but none had enoughhe had been around among the star pupils inquiring
he would have given worlds now to have that german lad back again with a sound mind
and now at this moment when hope was dead tom sawyer came forward with nine yellow tickets nine red tickets and ten blue ones and demanded a bible
this was a thunderbolt out of a clear sky
walters was not expecting an application from this source for the next ten years
but there was no getting around ithere were the certified checks and they were good for their face
tom was therefore elevated to a place with the judge and the other elect and the great news was announced from headquarters
it was the most stunning surprise of the decade and so profound was the sensation that it lifted the new hero up to the judicial ones altitude and the school had two marvels to gaze upon in place of one
the boys were all eaten up with envybut those that suffered the bitterest pangs were those who perceived too late that they themselves had contributed to this hated splendor by trading tickets to tom for the wealth he had amassed in selling whitewashing privileges
these despised themselves as being the dupes of a wily fraud a guileful snake in the grass
the prize was delivered to tom with as much effusion as the superintendent could pump up under the circumstances but it lacked somewhat of the true gush for the poor fellows instinct taught him that there was a mystery here that could not well bear the light perhaps it was simply preposterous that this boy had warehoused two thousand sheaves of scriptural wisdom on his premisesa dozen would strain his capacity without a doubt
amy lawrence was proud and glad and she tried to make tom see it in her facebut he wouldnt look
she wondered then she was just a grain troubled next a dim suspicion came and wentcame again she watched a furtive glance told her worldsand then her heart broke and she was jealous and angry and the tears came and she hated everybody
tom most of all she thought
tom was introduced to the judge but his tongue was tied his breath would hardly come his heart quakedpartly because of the awful greatness of the man but mainly because he was her parent
he would have liked to fall down and worship him if it were in the dark
the judge put his hand on toms head and called him a fine little man and asked him what his name was
the boy stammered gasped and got it out tom oh no not tomit is thomas ah thats it
i thought there was more to it maybe
thats very well
but youve another one i daresay and youll tell it to me wont you tell the gentleman your other name thomas said walters and say sir
you mustnt forget your manners thomas sawyersir thats it
thats a good boy
fine boy
fine manly little fellow
two thousand verses is a great manyvery very great many
and you never can be sorry for the trouble you took to learn them for knowledge is worth more than anything there is in the world its what makes great men and good men youll be a great man and a good man yourself some day thomas and then youll look back and say its all owing to the precious sundayschool privileges of my boyhoodits all owing to my dear teachers that taught me to learnits all owing to the good superintendent who encouraged me and watched over me and gave me a beautiful biblea splendid elegant bibleto keep and have it all for my own alwaysits all owing to right bringing up
that is what you will say thomasand you wouldnt take any money for those two thousand versesno indeed you wouldnt
and now you wouldnt mind telling me and this lady some of the things youve learnedno i know you wouldntfor we are proud of little boys that learn
now no doubt you know the names of all the twelve disciples
wont you tell us the names of the first two that were appointed tom was tugging at a buttonhole and looking sheepish
he blushed now and his eyes fell
mr walters heart sank within him
he said to himself it is not possible that the boy can answer the simplest questionwhy did the judge ask him
yet he felt obliged to speak up and say answer the gentleman thomasdont be afraid tom still hung fire
now i know youll tell me said the lady
the names of the first two disciples were david and goliah let us draw the curtain of charity over the rest of the scene
about halfpast ten the cracked bell of the small church began to ring and presently the people began to gather for the morning sermon
the sundayschool children distributed themselves about the house and occupied pews with their parents so as to be under supervision
aunt polly came and tom and sid and mary sat with hertom being placed next the aisle in order that he might be as far away from the open window and the seductive outside summer scenes as possible
the crowd filed up the aisles the aged and needy postmaster who had seen better days the mayor and his wifefor they had a mayor there among other unnecessaries the justice of the peace the widow douglas fair smart and forty a generous goodhearted soul and welltodo her hill mansion the only palace in the town and the most hospitable and much the most lavish in the matter of festivities that st petersburg could boast the bent and venerable major and mrs ward lawyer riverson the new notable from a distance next the belle of the village followed by a troop of lawnclad and ribbondecked young heartbreakers then all the young clerks in town in a bodyfor they had stood in the vestibule sucking their caneheads a circling wall of oiled and simpering admirers till the last girl had run their gantlet and last of all came the model boy willie mufferson taking as heedful care of his mother as if she were cut glass
he always brought his mother to church and was the pride of all the matrons
the boys all hated him he was so good
and besides he had been thrown up to them so much
his white handkerchief was hanging out of his pocket behind as usual on sundaysaccidentally
tom had no handkerchief and he looked upon boys who had as snobs
the congregation being fully assembled now the bell rang once more to warn laggards and stragglers and then a solemn hush fell upon the church which was only broken by the tittering and whispering of the choir in the gallery
the choir always tittered and whispered all through service
there was once a church choir that was not illbred but i have forgotten where it was now
it was a great many years ago and i can scarcely remember anything about it but i think it was in some foreign country
the minister gave out the hymn and read it through with a relish in a peculiar style which was much admired in that part of the country
his voice began on a medium key and climbed steadily up till it reached a certain point where it bore with strong emphasis upon the topmost word and then plunged down as if from a springboard shall i be carried toe the skies on flowry beds of ease whilst others fight to win the prize and sail thro bloody seas
he was regarded as a wonderful reader
at church sociables he was always called upon to read poetry and when he was through the ladies would lift up their hands and let them fall helplessly in their laps and wall their eyes and shake their heads as much as to say words cannot express it it is too beautiful too beautiful for this mortal earth after the hymn had been sung the rev
mr sprague turned himself into a bulletinboard and read off notices of meetings and societies and things till it seemed that the list would stretch out to the crack of dooma queer custom which is still kept up in america even in cities away here in this age of abundant newspapers
often the less there is to justify a traditional custom the harder it is to get rid of it
and now the minister prayed
a good generous prayer it was and went into details it pleaded for the church and the little children of the church for the other churches of the village for the village itself for the county for the state for the state officers for the united states for the churches of the united states for congress for the president for the officers of the government for poor sailors tossed by stormy seas for the oppressed millions groaning under the heel of european monarchies and oriental despotisms for such as have the light and the good tidings and yet have not eyes to see nor ears to hear withal for the heathen in the far islands of the sea and closed with a supplication that the words he was about to speak might find grace and favor and be as seed sown in fertile ground yielding in time a grateful harvest of good
amen
there was a rustling of dresses and the standing congregation sat down
the boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer he only endured itif he even did that much
he was restive all through it he kept tally of the details of the prayer unconsciouslyfor he was not listening but he knew the ground of old and the clergymans regular route over itand when a little trifle of new matter was interlarded his ear detected it and his whole nature resented it he considered additions unfair and scoundrelly
in the midst of the prayer a fly had lit on the back of the pew in front of him and tortured his spirit by calmly rubbing its hands together embracing its head with its arms and polishing it so vigorously that it seemed to almost part company with the body and the slender thread of a neck was exposed to view scraping its wings with its hind legs and smoothing them to its body as if they had been coattails going through its whole toilet as tranquilly as if it knew it was perfectly safe
as indeed it was for as sorely as toms hands itched to grab for it they did not darehe believed his soul would be instantly destroyed if he did such a thing while the prayer was going on
but with the closing sentence his hand began to curve and steal forward and the instant the amen was out the fly was a prisoner of war
his aunt detected the act and made him let it go
the minister gave out his text and droned along monotonously through an argument that was so prosy that many a head by and by began to nodand yet it was an argument that dealt in limitless fire and brimstone and thinned the predestined elect down to a company so small as to be hardly worth the saving
tom counted the pages of the sermon after church he always knew how many pages there had been but he seldom knew anything else about the discourse
however this time he was really interested for a little while
the minister made a grand and moving picture of the assembling together of the worlds hosts at the millennium when the lion and the lamb should lie down together and a little child should lead them
but the pathos the lesson the moral of the great spectacle were lost upon the boy he only thought of the conspicuousness of the principal character before the onlooking nations his face lit with the thought and he said to himself that he wished he could be that child if it was a tame lion
now he lapsed into suffering again as the dry argument was resumed
presently he bethought him of a treasure he had and got it out
it was a large black beetle with formidable jawsa pinchbug he called it
it was in a percussioncap box
the first thing the beetle did was to take him by the finger
a natural fillip followed the beetle went floundering into the aisle and lit on its back and the hurt finger went into the boys mouth
the beetle lay there working its helpless legs unable to turn over
tom eyed it and longed for it but it was safe out of his reach
other people uninterested in the sermon found relief in the beetle and they eyed it too
presently a vagrant poodle dog came idling along sad at heart lazy with the summer softness and the quiet weary of captivity sighing for change
he spied the beetle the drooping tail lifted and wagged
he surveyed the prize walked around it smelt at it from a safe distance walked around it again grew bolder and took a closer smell then lifted his lip and made a gingerly snatch at it just missing it made another and another began to enjoy the diversion subsided to his stomach with the beetle between his paws and continued his experiments grew weary at last and then indifferent and absentminded
his head nodded and little by little his chin descended and touched the enemy who seized it
there was a sharp yelp a flirt of the poodles head and the beetle fell a couple of yards away and lit on its back once more
the neighboring spectators shook with a gentle inward joy several faces went behind fans and handkerchiefs and tom was entirely happy
the dog looked foolish and probably felt so but there was resentment in his heart too and a craving for revenge
so he went to the beetle and began a wary attack on it again jumping at it from every point of a circle lighting with his forepaws within an inch of the creature making even closer snatches at it with his teeth and jerking his head till his ears flapped again
but he grew tired once more after a while tried to amuse himself with a fly but found no relief followed an ant around with his nose close to the floor and quickly wearied of that yawned sighed forgot the beetle entirely and sat down on it
then there was a wild yelp of agony and the poodle went sailing up the aisle the yelps continued and so did the dog he crossed the house in front of the altar he flew down the other aisle he crossed before the doors he clamored up the homestretch his anguish grew with his progress till presently he was but a woolly comet moving in its orbit with the gleam and the speed of light
at last the frantic sufferer sheered from its course and sprang into its masters lap he flung it out of the window and the voice of distress quickly thinned away and died in the distance
by this time the whole church was redfaced and suffocating with suppressed laughter and the sermon had come to a dead standstill
the discourse was resumed presently but it went lame and halting all possibility of impressiveness being at an end for even the gravest sentiments were constantly being received with a smothered burst of unholy mirth under cover of some remote pewback as if the poor parson had said a rarely facetious thing
it was a genuine relief to the whole congregation when the ordeal was over and the benediction pronounced
tom sawyer went home quite cheerful thinking to himself that there was some satisfaction about divine service when there was a bit of variety in it
he had but one marring thought he was willing that the dog should play with his pinchbug but he did not think it was upright in him to carry it off
monday morning found tom sawyer miserable
monday morning always found him sobecause it began another weeks slow suffering in school
he generally began that day with wishing he had had no intervening holiday it made the going into captivity and fetters again so much more odious
tom lay thinking
presently it occurred to him that he wished he was sick then he could stay home from school
here was a vague possibility
he canvassed his system
no ailment was found and he investigated again
this time he thought he could detect colicky symptoms and he began to encourage them with considerable hope
but they soon grew feeble and presently died wholly away
he reflected further
suddenly he discovered something
one of his upper front teeth was loose
this was lucky he was about to begin to groan as a starter as he called it when it occurred to him that if he came into court with that argument his aunt would pull it out and that would hurt
so he thought he would hold the tooth in reserve for the present and seek further
nothing offered for some little time and then he remembered hearing the doctor tell about a certain thing that laid up a patient for two or three weeks and threatened to make him lose a finger
so the boy eagerly drew his sore toe from under the sheet and held it up for inspection
but now he did not know the necessary symptoms
however it seemed well worth while to chance it so he fell to groaning with considerable spirit
but sid slept on unconscious
tom groaned louder and fancied that he began to feel pain in the toe
no result from sid
tom was panting with his exertions by this time
he took a rest and then swelled himself up and fetched a succession of admirable groans
sid snored on
tom was aggravated
he said sid sid and shook him
this course worked well and tom began to groan again
sid yawned stretched then brought himself up on his elbow with a snort and began to stare at tom
tom went on groaning
sid said tom
say tom no response
here tom
tom
what is the matter tom and he shook him and looked in his face anxiously
tom moaned out oh dont sid
dont joggle me why whats the matter tom
i must call auntie nonever mind
itll be over by and by maybe
dont call anybody but i must
dont groan so tom its awful
how long you been this way hours
ouch
oh dont stir so sid youll kill me tom why didnt you wake me sooner
oh tom dont it makes my flesh crawl to hear you
tom what is the matter i forgive you everything sid
groan
everything youve ever done to me
when im gone oh tom you aint dying are you
dont tomoh dont
maybe i forgive everybody sid
groan
tell em so sid
and sid you give my windowsash and my cat with one eye to that new girl thats come to town and tell her but sid had snatched his clothes and gone
tom was suffering in reality now so handsomely was his imagination working and so his groans had gathered quite a genuine tone
sid flew downstairs and said oh aunt polly come
toms dying dying yesm
dont waitcome quick rubbage
i dont believe it but she fled upstairs nevertheless with sid and mary at her heels
and her face grew white too and her lip trembled
when she reached the bedside she gasped out you tom
tom whats the matter with you oh auntie im whats the matter with youwhat is the matter with you child oh auntie my sore toes mortified the old lady sank down into a chair and laughed a little then cried a little then did both together
this restored her and she said tom what a turn you did give me
now you shut up that nonsense and climb out of this the groans ceased and the pain vanished from the toe
the boy felt a little foolish and he said aunt polly it seemed mortified and it hurt so i never minded my tooth at all your tooth indeed
whats the matter with your tooth one of thems loose and it aches perfectly awful there there now dont begin that groaning again
open your mouth
wellyour tooth is loose but youre not going to die about that
mary get me a silk thread and a chunk of fire out of the kitchen tom said oh please auntie dont pull it out
it dont hurt any more
i wish i may never stir if it does
please dont auntie
i dont want to stay home from school oh you dont dont you
so all this row was because you thought youd get to stay home from school and go afishing
tom tom i love you so and you seem to try every way you can to break my old heart with your outrageousness by this time the dental instruments were ready
the old lady made one end of the silk thread fast to toms tooth with a loop and tied the other to the bedpost
then she seized the chunk of fire and suddenly thrust it almost into the boys face
the tooth hung dangling by the bedpost now
but all trials bring their compensations
as tom wended to school after breakfast he was the envy of every boy he met because the gap in his upper row of teeth enabled him to expectorate in a new and admirable way
he gathered quite a following of lads interested in the exhibition and one that had cut his finger and had been a centre of fascination and homage up to this time now found himself suddenly without an adherent and shorn of his glory
his heart was heavy and he said with a disdain which he did not feel that it wasnt anything to spit like tom sawyer but another boy said sour grapes and he wandered away a dismantled hero
shortly tom came upon the juvenile pariah of the village huckleberry finn son of the town drunkard
huckleberry was cordially hated and dreaded by all the mothers of the town because he was idle and lawless and vulgar and badand because all their children admired him so and delighted in his forbidden society and wished they dared to be like him
tom was like the rest of the respectable boys in that he envied huckleberry his gaudy outcast condition and was under strict orders not to play with him
so he played with him every time he got a chance
huckleberry was always dressed in the castoff clothes of fullgrown men and they were in perennial bloom and fluttering with rags
his hat was a vast ruin with a wide crescent lopped out of its brim his coat when he wore one hung nearly to his heels and had the rearward buttons far down the back but one suspender supported his trousers the seat of the trousers bagged low and contained nothing the fringed legs dragged in the dirt when not rolled up
huckleberry came and went at his own free will
he slept on doorsteps in fine weather and in empty hogsheads in wet he did not have to go to school or to church or call any being master or obey anybody he could go fishing or swimming when and where he chose and stay as long as it suited him nobody forbade him to fight he could sit up as late as he pleased he was always the first boy that went barefoot in the spring and the last to resume leather in the fall he never had to wash nor put on clean clothes he could swear wonderfully
in a word everything that goes to make life precious that boy had
so thought every harassed hampered respectable boy in st petersburg
tom hailed the romantic outcast hello huckleberry hello yourself and see how you like it whats that you got dead cat lemme see him huck
my hes pretty stiff
whered you get him bought him offn a boy what did you give i give a blue ticket and a bladder that i got at the slaughterhouse whered you get the blue ticket bought it offn ben rogers two weeks ago for a hoopstick saywhat is dead cats good for huck good for
cure warts with no
is that so
i know something thats better i bet you dont
what is it why spunkwater spunkwater
i wouldnt give a dern for spunkwater you wouldnt wouldnt you
dyou ever try it no i haint
but bob tanner did who told you so why he told jeff thatcher and jeff told johnny baker and johnny told jim hollis and jim told ben rogers and ben told a nigger and the nigger told me
there now well what of it
theyll all lie
leastways all but the nigger
i dont know him
but i never see a nigger that wouldnt lie
shucks
now you tell me how bob tanner done it huck why he took and dipped his hand in a rotten stump where the rainwater was in the daytime certainly with his face to the stump yes
least i reckon so did he say anything i dont reckon he did
i dont know aha
talk about trying to cure warts with spunkwater such a blame fool way as that
why that aint agoing to do any good
you got to go all by yourself to the middle of the woods where you know theres a spunkwater stump and just as its midnight you back up against the stump and jam your hand in and say barleycorn barleycorn injunmeal shorts spunkwater spunkwater swaller these warts and then walk away quick eleven steps with your eyes shut and then turn around three times and walk home without speaking to anybody
because if you speak the charms busted well that sounds like a good way but that aint the way bob tanner done no sir you can bet he didnt becuz hes the wartiest boy in this town and he wouldnt have a wart on him if hed knowed how to work spunkwater
ive took off thousands of warts off of my hands that way huck
i play with frogs so much that ive always got considerable many warts
sometimes i take em off with a bean yes beans good
ive done that have you
whats your way you take and split the bean and cut the wart so as to get some blood and then you put the blood on one piece of the bean and take and dig a hole and bury it bout midnight at the crossroads in the dark of the moon and then you burn up the rest of the bean
you see that piece thats got the blood on it will keep drawing and drawing trying to fetch the other piece to it and so that helps the blood to draw the wart and pretty soon off she comes yes thats it huckthats it though when youre burying it if you say down bean off wart come no more to bother me its better
thats the way joe harper does and hes been nearly to coonville and most everywheres
but sayhow do you cure em with dead cats why you take your cat and go and get in the graveyard long about midnight when somebody that was wicked has been buried and when its midnight a devil will come or maybe two or three but you cant see em you can only hear something like the wind or maybe hear em talk and when theyre taking that feller away you heave your cat after em and say devil follow corpse cat follow devil warts follow cat im done with ye thatll fetch any wart sounds right
dyou ever try it huck no but old mother hopkins told me well i reckon its so then
becuz they say shes a witch say
why tom i know she is
she witched pap
pap says so his own self
he come along one day and he see she was awitching him so he took up a rock and if she hadnt dodged hed a got her
well that very night he rolled offn a shed wher he was a layin drunk and broke his arm why thats awful
how did he know she was awitching him lord pap can tell easy
pap says when they keep looking at you right stiddy theyre awitching you
specially if they mumble
becuz when they mumble theyre saying the lords prayer backards say hucky when you going to try the cat tonight
i reckon theyll come after old hoss williams tonight but they buried him saturday
didnt they get him saturday night why how you talk
how could their charms work till midnightand then its sunday

last time you kep me ameowing around till old hays went to throwing rocks at me and says dern that cat and so i hove a brick through his windowbut dont you tell i wont
i couldnt meow that night becuz auntie was watching me but ill meow this time
saywhats that nothing but a tick whered you get him out in the woods whatll you take for him i dont know
i dont want to sell him all right
its a mighty small tick anyway oh anybody can run a tick down that dont belong to them
im satisfied with it
its a good enough tick for me sho theres ticks a plenty
i could have a thousand of em if i wanted to well why dont you
becuz you know mighty well you cant
this is a pretty early tick i reckon
its the first one ive seen this year say huckill give you my tooth for him less see it tom got out a bit of paper and carefully unrolled it
huckleberry viewed it wistfully
the temptation was very strong
at last he said is it genuwyne tom lifted his lip and showed the vacancy
well all right said huckleberry its a trade tom enclosed the tick in the percussioncap box that had lately been the pinchbugs prison and the boys separated each feeling wealthier than before
when tom reached the little isolated frame schoolhouse he strode in briskly with the manner of one who had come with all honest speed
he hung his hat on a peg and flung himself into his seat with businesslike alacrity
the master throned on high in his great splintbottom armchair was dozing lulled by the drowsy hum of study
the interruption roused him
thomas sawyer tom knew that when his name was pronounced in full it meant trouble
sir come up here
now sir why are you late again as usual tom was about to take refuge in a lie when he saw two long tails of yellow hair hanging down a back that he recognized by the electric sympathy of love and by that form was the only vacant place on the girls side of the schoolhouse
he instantly said i stopped to talk with huckleberry finn the masters pulse stood still and he stared helplessly
the buzz of study ceased
the pupils wondered if this foolhardy boy had lost his mind
the master said youyou did what stopped to talk with huckleberry finn there was no mistaking the words
thomas sawyer this is the most astounding confession i have ever listened to
no mere ferule will answer for this offence
take off your jacket the masters arm performed until it was tired and the stock of switches notably diminished
then the order followed now sir go and sit with the girls
and let this be a warning to you the titter that rippled around the room appeared to abash the boy but in reality that result was caused rather more by his worshipful awe of his unknown idol and the dread pleasure that lay in his high good fortune
he sat down upon the end of the pine bench and the girl hitched herself away from him with a toss of her head
nudges and winks and whispers traversed the room but tom sat still with his arms upon the long low desk before him and seemed to study his book
by and by attention ceased from him and the accustomed school murmur rose upon the dull air once more
presently the boy began to steal furtive glances at the girl
she observed it made a mouth at him and gave him the back of her head for the space of a minute
when she cautiously faced around again a peach lay before her
she thrust it away
tom gently put it back
she thrust it away again but with less animosity
tom patiently returned it to its place
then she let it remain
tom scrawled on his slate please take iti got more the girl glanced at the words but made no sign
now the boy began to draw something on the slate hiding his work with his left hand
for a time the girl refused to notice but her human curiosity presently began to manifest itself by hardly perceptible signs
the boy worked on apparently unconscious
the girl made a sort of noncommittal attempt to see but the boy did not betray that he was aware of it
at last she gave in and hesitatingly whispered let me see it tom partly uncovered a dismal caricature of a house with two gable ends to it and a corkscrew of smoke issuing from the chimney
then the girls interest began to fasten itself upon the work and she forgot everything else
when it was finished she gazed a moment then whispered its nicemake a man the artist erected a man in the front yard that resembled a derrick
he could have stepped over the house but the girl was not hypercritical she was satisfied with the monster and whispered its a beautiful mannow make me coming along tom drew an hourglass with a full moon and straw limbs to it and armed the spreading fingers with a portentous fan
the girl said its ever so nicei wish i could draw its easy whispered tom ill learn you oh will you
when at noon
do you go home to dinner ill stay if you will goodthats a whack
whats your name becky thatcher
whats yours
oh i know
its thomas sawyer thats the name they lick me by
im tom when im good
you call me tom will you yes now tom began to scrawl something on the slate hiding the words from the girl
but she was not backward this time
she begged to see
tom said oh it aint anything yes it is no it aint
you dont want to see yes i do indeed i do
please let me youll tell no i wontdeed and deed and double deed wont you wont tell anybody at all
ever as long as you live no i wont ever tell anybody
now let me oh you dont want to see now that you treat me so i will see and she put her small hand upon his and a little scuffle ensued tom pretending to resist in earnest but letting his hand slip by degrees till these words were revealed i love you oh you bad thing and she hit his hand a smart rap but reddened and looked pleased nevertheless
just at this juncture the boy felt a slow fateful grip closing on his ear and a steady lifting impulse
in that wise he was borne across the house and deposited in his own seat under a peppering fire of giggles from the whole school
then the master stood over him during a few awful moments and finally moved away to his throne without saying a word
but although toms ear tingled his heart was jubilant
as the school quieted down tom made an honest effort to study but the turmoil within him was too great
in turn he took his place in the reading class and made a botch of it then in the geography class and turned lakes into mountains mountains into rivers and rivers into continents till chaos was come again then in the spelling class and got turned down by a succession of mere baby words till he brought up at the foot and yielded up the pewter medal which he had worn with ostentation for months
the harder tom tried to fasten his mind on his book the more his ideas wandered
so at last with a sigh and a yawn he gave it up
it seemed to him that the noon recess would never come
the air was utterly dead
there was not a breath stirring
it was the sleepiest of sleepy days
the drowsing murmur of the five and twenty studying scholars soothed the soul like the spell that is in the murmur of bees
away off in the flaming sunshine cardiff hill lifted its soft green sides through a shimmering veil of heat tinted with the purple of distance a few birds floated on lazy wing high in the air no other living thing was visible but some cows and they were asleep
toms heart ached to be free or else to have something of interest to do to pass the dreary time
his hand wandered into his pocket and his face lit up with a glow of gratitude that was prayer though he did not know it
then furtively the percussioncap box came out
he released the tick and put him on the long flat desk
the creature probably glowed with a gratitude that amounted to prayer too at this moment but it was premature for when he started thankfully to travel off tom turned him aside with a pin and made him take a new direction
toms bosom friend sat next him suffering just as tom had been and now he was deeply and gratefully interested in this entertainment in an instant
this bosom friend was joe harper
the two boys were sworn friends all the week and embattled enemies on saturdays
joe took a pin out of his lapel and began to assist in exercising the prisoner
the sport grew in interest momently
soon tom said that they were interfering with each other and neither getting the fullest benefit of the tick
so he put joes slate on the desk and drew a line down the middle of it from top to bottom
now said he as long as he is on your side you can stir him up and ill let him alone but if you let him get away and get on my side youre to leave him alone as long as i can keep him from crossing over all right go ahead start him up the tick escaped from tom presently and crossed the equator
joe harassed him awhile and then he got away and crossed back again
this change of base occurred often
while one boy was worrying the tick with absorbing interest the other would look on with interest as strong the two heads bowed together over the slate and the two souls dead to all things else
at last luck seemed to settle and abide with joe
the tick tried this that and the other course and got as excited and as anxious as the boys themselves but time and again just as he would have victory in his very grasp so to speak and toms fingers would be twitching to begin joes pin would deftly head him off and keep possession
at last tom could stand it no longer
the temptation was too strong
so he reached out and lent a hand with his pin
joe was angry in a moment
said he tom you let him alone i only just want to stir him up a little joe no sir it aint fair you just let him alone blame it i aint going to stir him much let him alone i tell you i wont you shallhes on my side of the line look here joe harper whose is that tick i dont care whose tick he ishes on my side of the line and you shant touch him well ill just bet i will though
hes my tick and ill do what i blame please with him or die a tremendous whack came down on toms shoulders and its duplicate on joes and for the space of two minutes the dust continued to fly from the two jackets and the whole school to enjoy it
the boys had been too absorbed to notice the hush that had stolen upon the school awhile before when the master came tiptoeing down the room and stood over them
he had contemplated a good part of the performance before he contributed his bit of variety to it
when school broke up at noon tom flew to becky thatcher and whispered in her ear put on your bonnet and let on youre going home and when you get to the corner give the rest of em the slip and turn down through the lane and come back
ill go the other way and come it over em the same way so the one went off with one group of scholars and the other with another
in a little while the two met at the bottom of the lane and when they reached the school they had it all to themselves
then they sat together with a slate before them and tom gave becky the pencil and held her hand in his guiding it and so created another surprising house
when the interest in art began to wane the two fell to talking
tom was swimming in bliss
he said do you love rats no
i hate them well i do toolive ones
but i mean dead ones to swing round your head with a string no i dont care for rats much anyway
what i like is chewinggum oh i should say so
i wish i had some now do you
ive got some
ill let you chew it awhile but you must give it back to me that was agreeable so they chewed it turn about and dangled their legs against the bench in excess of contentment
was you ever at a circus said tom
yes and my pas going to take me again some time if im good i been to the circus three or four timeslots of times
church aint shucks to a circus
theres things going on at a circus all the time
im going to be a clown in a circus when i grow up oh are you

and they get slathers of moneymost a dollar a day ben rogers says

you only just tell a boy you wont ever have anybody but him ever ever ever and then you kiss and thats all
anybody can do it kiss
what do you kiss for why that you know is towell they always do that everybody why yes everybody thats in love with each other
do you remember what i wrote on the slate yeyes what was it i shant tell you shall i tell you yeyesbut some other time no now no not nowtomorrow oh no now
please beckyill whisper it ill whisper it ever so easy becky hesitating tom took silence for consent and passed his arm about her waist and whispered the tale ever so softly with his mouth close to her ear
and then he added now you whisper it to mejust the same she resisted for a while and then said you turn your face away so you cant see and then i will
but you mustnt ever tell anybodywill you tom
now you wont will you no indeed indeed i wont
now becky he turned his face away
she bent timidly around till her breath stirred his curls and whispered iloveyou then she sprang away and ran around and around the desks and benches with tom after her and took refuge in a corner at last with her little white apron to her face
tom clasped her about her neck and pleaded now becky its all doneall over but the kiss
dont you be afraid of thatit aint anything at all
please becky and he tugged at her apron and the hands
by and by she gave up and let her hands drop her face all glowing with the struggle came up and submitted
tom kissed the red lips and said now its all done becky
and always after this you know you aint ever to love anybody but me and you aint ever to marry anybody but me ever never and forever
will you no ill never love anybody but you tom and ill never marry anybody but youand you aint to ever marry anybody but me either certainly
of course
thats part of it
and always coming to school or when were going home youre to walk with me when there aint anybody lookingand you choose me and i choose you at parties because thats the way you do when youre engaged its so nice
i never heard of it before oh its ever so gay
why me and amy lawrence the big eyes told tom his blunder and he stopped confused
oh tom
then i aint the first youve ever been engaged to the child began to cry
tom said oh dont cry becky i dont care for her any more yes you do tomyou know you do tom tried to put his arm about her neck but she pushed him away and turned her face to the wall and went on crying
tom tried again with soothing words in his mouth and was repulsed again
then his pride was up and he strode away and went outside
he stood about restless and uneasy for a while glancing at the door every now and then hoping she would repent and come to find him
but she did not
then he began to feel badly and fear that he was in the wrong
it was a hard struggle with him to make new advances now but he nerved himself to it and entered
she was still standing back there in the corner sobbing with her face to the wall
toms heart smote him
he went to her and stood a moment not knowing exactly how to proceed
then he said hesitatingly becky ii dont care for anybody but you no replybut sobs
beckypleadingly
becky wont you say something more sobs
tom got out his chiefest jewel a brass knob from the top of an andiron and passed it around her so that she could see it and said please becky wont you take it she struck it to the floor
then tom marched out of the house and over the hills and far away to return to school no more that day
presently becky began to suspect
she ran to the door he was not in sight she flew around to the playyard he was not there
then she called tom
come back tom she listened intently but there was no answer
she had no companions but silence and loneliness
so she sat down to cry again and upbraid herself and by this time the scholars began to gather again and she had to hide her griefs and still her broken heart and take up the cross of a long dreary aching afternoon with none among the strangers about her to exchange sorrows with
tom dodged hither and thither through lanes until he was well out of the track of returning scholars and then fell into a moody jog
he crossed a small branch two or three times because of a prevailing juvenile superstition that to cross water baffled pursuit
half an hour later he was disappearing behind the douglas mansion on the summit of cardiff hill and the schoolhouse was hardly distinguishable away off in the valley behind him
he entered a dense wood picked his pathless way to the centre of it and sat down on a mossy spot under a spreading oak
there was not even a zephyr stirring the dead noonday heat had even stilled the songs of the birds nature lay in a trance that was broken by no sound but the occasional faroff hammering of a woodpecker and this seemed to render the pervading silence and sense of loneliness the more profound
the boys soul was steeped in melancholy his feelings were in happy accord with his surroundings
he sat long with his elbows on his knees and his chin in his hands meditating
it seemed to him that life was but a trouble at best and he more than half envied jimmy hodges so lately released it must be very peaceful he thought to lie and slumber and dream forever and ever with the wind whispering through the trees and caressing the grass and the flowers over the grave and nothing to bother and grieve about ever any more
if he only had a clean sundayschool record he could be willing to go and be done with it all
now as to this girl
what had he done
nothing
he had meant the best in the world and been treated like a doglike a very dog
she would be sorry some daymaybe when it was too late
ah if he could only die temporarily
but the elastic heart of youth cannot be compressed into one constrained shape long at a time
tom presently began to drift insensibly back into the concerns of this life again
what if he turned his back now and disappeared mysteriously
what if he went awayever so far away into unknown countries beyond the seasand never came back any more
how would she feel then
the idea of being a clown recurred to him now only to fill him with disgust
for frivolity and jokes and spotted tights were an offense when they intruded themselves upon a spirit that was exalted into the vague august realm of the romantic
no he would be a soldier and return after long years all warworn and illustrious
nobetter still he would join the indians and hunt buffaloes and go on the warpath in the mountain ranges and the trackless great plains of the far west and away in the future come back a great chief bristling with feathers hideous with paint and prance into sundayschool some drowsy summer morning with a bloodcurdling warwhoop and sear the eyeballs of all his companions with unappeasable envy
but no there was something gaudier even than this
he would be a pirate
that was it
now his future lay plain before him and glowing with unimaginable splendor
how his name would fill the world and make people shudder
how gloriously he would go plowing the dancing seas in his long low blackhulled racer the spirit of the storm with his grisly flag flying at the fore
and at the zenith of his fame how he would suddenly appear at the old village and stalk into church brown and weatherbeaten in his black velvet doublet and trunks his great jackboots his crimson sash his belt bristling with horsepistols his crimerusted cutlass at his side his slouch hat with waving plumes his black flag unfurled with the skull and crossbones on it and hear with swelling ecstasy the whisperings its tom sawyer the piratethe black avenger of the spanish main yes it was settled his career was determined
he would run away from home and enter upon it
he would start the very next morning
therefore he must now begin to get ready
he would collect his resources together
he went to a rotten log near at hand and began to dig under one end of it with his barlow knife
he soon struck wood that sounded hollow
he put his hand there and uttered this incantation impressively what hasnt come here come
whats here stay here then he scraped away the dirt and exposed a pine shingle
he took it up and disclosed a shapely little treasurehouse whose bottom and sides were of shingles
in it lay a marble
toms astonishment was boundless
he scratched his head with a perplexed air and said well that beats anything then he tossed the marble away pettishly and stood cogitating
the truth was that a superstition of his had failed here which he and all his comrades had always looked upon as infallible
if you buried a marble with certain necessary incantations and left it alone a fortnight and then opened the place with the incantation he had just used you would find that all the marbles you had ever lost had gathered themselves together there meantime no matter how widely they had been separated
but now this thing had actually and unquestionably failed
toms whole structure of faith was shaken to its foundations
he had many a time heard of this thing succeeding but never of its failing before
it did not occur to him that he had tried it several times before himself but could never find the hidingplaces afterward
he puzzled over the matter some time and finally decided that some witch had interfered and broken the charm
he thought he would satisfy himself on that point so he searched around till he found a small sandy spot with a little funnelshaped depression in it
he laid himself down and put his mouth close to this depression and called doodlebug doodlebug tell me what i want to know
doodlebug doodlebug tell me what i want to know the sand began to work and presently a small black bug appeared for a second and then darted under again in a fright
he dasnt tell
so it was a witch that done it
i just knowed it he well knew the futility of trying to contend against witches so he gave up discouraged
but it occurred to him that he might as well have the marble he had just thrown away and therefore he went and made a patient search for it
but he could not find it
now he went back to his treasurehouse and carefully placed himself just as he had been standing when he tossed the marble away then he took another marble from his pocket and tossed it in the same way saying brother go find your brother he watched where it stopped and went there and looked
but it must have fallen short or gone too far so he tried twice more
the last repetition was successful
the two marbles lay within a foot of each other
just here the blast of a toy tin trumpet came faintly down the green aisles of the forest
tom flung off his jacket and trousers turned a suspender into a belt raked away some brush behind the rotten log disclosing a rude bow and arrow a lath sword and a tin trumpet and in a moment had seized these things and bounded away barelegged with fluttering shirt
he presently halted under a great elm blew an answering blast and then began to tiptoe and look warily out this way and that
he said cautiouslyto an imaginary company hold my merry men
keep hid till i blow now appeared joe harper as airily clad and elaborately armed as tom
tom called hold
who comes here into sherwood forest without my pass guy of guisborne wants no mans pass
who art thou thatthat dares to hold such language said tom promptingfor they talked by the book from memory
who art thou that dares to hold such language i indeed
i am robin hood as thy caitiff carcase soon shall know then art thou indeed that famous outlaw
right gladly will i dispute with thee the passes of the merry wood
have at thee they took their lath swords dumped their other traps on the ground struck a fencing attitude foot to foot and began a grave careful combat two up and two down presently tom said now if youve got the hang go it lively so they went it lively panting and perspiring with the work
by and by tom shouted fall
fall
why dont you fall i shant
why dont you fall yourself
youre getting the worst of it why that aint anything
i cant fall that aint the way it is in the book
the book says then with one backhanded stroke he slew poor guy of guisborne youre to turn around and let me hit you in the back there was no getting around the authorities so joe turned received the whack and fell
now said joe getting up you got to let me kill you
thats fair why i cant do that it aint in the book well its blamed meanthats all well say joe you can be friar tuck or much the millers son and lam me with a quarterstaff or ill be the sheriff of nottingham and you be robin hood a little while and kill me this was satisfactory and so these adventures were carried out
then tom became robin hood again and was allowed by the treacherous nun to bleed his strength away through his neglected wound
and at last joe representing a whole tribe of weeping outlaws dragged him sadly forth gave his bow into his feeble hands and tom said where this arrow falls there bury poor robin hood under the greenwood tree then he shot the arrow and fell back and would have died but he lit on a nettle and sprang up too gaily for a corpse
the boys dressed themselves hid their accoutrements and went off grieving that there were no outlaws any more and wondering what modern civilization could claim to have done to compensate for their loss
they said they would rather be outlaws a year in sherwood forest than president of the united states forever
at halfpast nine that night tom and sid were sent to bed as usual
they said their prayers and sid was soon asleep
tom lay awake and waited in restless impatience
when it seemed to him that it must be nearly daylight he heard the clock strike ten
this was despair
he would have tossed and fidgeted as his nerves demanded but he was afraid he might wake sid
so he lay still and stared up into the dark
everything was dismally still
by and by out of the stillness little scarcely perceptible noises began to emphasize themselves
the ticking of the clock began to bring itself into notice
old beams began to crack mysteriously
the stairs creaked faintly
evidently spirits were abroad
a measured muffled snore issued from aunt pollys chamber
and now the tiresome chirping of a cricket that no human ingenuity could locate began
next the ghastly ticking of a deathwatch in the wall at the beds head made tom shudderit meant that somebodys days were numbered
then the howl of a faroff dog rose on the night air and was answered by a fainter howl from a remoter distance
tom was in an agony
at last he was satisfied that time had ceased and eternity begun he began to doze in spite of himself the clock chimed eleven but he did not hear it
and then there came mingling with his halfformed dreams a most melancholy caterwauling
the raising of a neighboring window disturbed him
a cry of scat
you devil and the crash of an empty bottle against the back of his aunts woodshed brought him wide awake and a single minute later he was dressed and out of the window and creeping along the roof of the ell on all fours
he meowd with caution once or twice as he went then jumped to the roof of the woodshed and thence to the ground
huckleberry finn was there with his dead cat
the boys moved off and disappeared in the gloom
at the end of half an hour they were wading through the tall grass of the graveyard
it was a graveyard of the oldfashioned western kind
it was on a hill about a mile and a half from the village
it had a crazy board fence around it which leaned inward in places and outward the rest of the time but stood upright nowhere
grass and weeds grew rank over the whole cemetery
all the old graves were sunken in there was not a tombstone on the place roundtopped wormeaten boards staggered over the graves leaning for support and finding none
sacred to the memory of soandso had been painted on them once but it could no longer have been read on the most of them now even if there had been light
a faint wind moaned through the trees and tom feared it might be the spirits of the dead complaining at being disturbed
the boys talked little and only under their breath for the time and the place and the pervading solemnity and silence oppressed their spirits
they found the sharp new heap they were seeking and ensconced themselves within the protection of three great elms that grew in a bunch within a few feet of the grave
then they waited in silence for what seemed a long time
the hooting of a distant owl was all the sound that troubled the dead stillness
toms reflections grew oppressive
he must force some talk
so he said in a whisper hucky do you believe the dead people like it for us to be here huckleberry whispered i wisht i knowed
its awful solemn like aint it i bet it is there was a considerable pause while the boys canvassed this matter inwardly
then tom whispered say huckydo you reckon hoss williams hears us talking o course he does
least his sperrit does tom after a pause i wish id said mister williams
but i never meant any harm
everybody calls him hoss a body cant be too particlar how they talk bout theseyer dead people tom this was a damper and conversation died again
presently tom seized his comrades arm and said sh what is it tom and the two clung together with beating hearts
sh
there tis again
didnt you hear it i there
now you hear it lord tom theyre coming
theyre coming sure
whatll we do i dono
think theyll see us oh tom they can see in the dark same as cats
i wisht i hadnt come oh dont be afeard
i dont believe theyll bother us
we aint doing any harm
if we keep perfectly still maybe they wont notice us at all ill try to tom but lord im all of a shiver listen the boys bent their heads together and scarcely breathed
a muffled sound of voices floated up from the far end of the graveyard
look
see there whispered tom
what is it its devilfire
oh tom this is awful some vague figures approached through the gloom swinging an oldfashioned tin lantern that freckled the ground with innumerable little spangles of light
presently huckleberry whispered with a shudder its the devils sure enough
three of em
lordy tom were goners
can you pray ill try but dont you be afeard
they aint going to hurt us
now i lay me down to sleep i sh what is it huck theyre humans
one of em is anyway

here they come again
now theyre hot

hot again
red hot
theyre pinted right this time
say huck i know another o them voices its injun joe thats sothat murderin halfbreed
id druther they was devils a dern sight
what kin they be up to the whisper died wholly out now for the three men had reached the grave and stood within a few feet of the boys hidingplace
here it is said the third voice and the owner of it held the lantern up and revealed the face of young doctor robinson
potter and injun joe were carrying a handbarrow with a rope and a couple of shovels on it
they cast down their load and began to open the grave
the doctor put the lantern at the head of the grave and came and sat down with his back against one of the elm trees
he was so close the boys could have touched him
hurry men he said in a low voice the moon might come out at any moment they growled a response and went on digging
for some time there was no noise but the grating sound of the spades discharging their freight of mould and gravel
it was very monotonous
finally a spade struck upon the coffin with a dull woody accent and within another minute or two the men had hoisted it out on the ground
they pried off the lid with their shovels got out the body and dumped it rudely on the ground
the moon drifted from behind the clouds and exposed the pallid face
the barrow was got ready and the corpse placed on it covered with a blanket and bound to its place with the rope
potter took out a large springknife and cut off the dangling end of the rope and then said now the cussed things ready sawbones and youll just out with another five or here she stays thats the talk said injun joe
look here what does this mean said the doctor
you required your pay in advance and ive paid you yes and you done more than that said injun joe approaching the doctor who was now standing
five years ago you drove me away from your fathers kitchen one night when i come to ask for something to eat and you said i warnt there for any good and when i swore id get even with you if it took a hundred years your father had me jailed for a vagrant
did you think id forget
the injun blood aint in me for nothing
and now ive got you and you got to settle you know he was threatening the doctor with his fist in his face by this time
the doctor struck out suddenly and stretched the ruffian on the ground
potter dropped his knife and exclaimed here now dont you hit my pard and the next moment he had grappled with the doctor and the two were struggling with might and main trampling the grass and tearing the ground with their heels
injun joe sprang to his feet his eyes flaming with passion snatched up potters knife and went creeping catlike and stooping round and round about the combatants seeking an opportunity
all at once the doctor flung himself free seized the heavy headboard of williams grave and felled potter to the earth with itand in the same instant the halfbreed saw his chance and drove the knife to the hilt in the young mans breast
he reeled and fell partly upon potter flooding him with his blood and in the same moment the clouds blotted out the dreadful spectacle and the two frightened boys went speeding away in the dark
presently when the moon emerged again injun joe was standing over the two forms contemplating them
the doctor murmured inarticulately gave a long gasp or two and was still
the halfbreed muttered that score is settleddamn you then he robbed the body
after which he put the fatal knife in potters open right hand and sat down on the dismantled coffin
threefourfive minutes passed and then potter began to stir and moan
his hand closed upon the knife he raised it glanced at it and let it fall with a shudder
then he sat up pushing the body from him and gazed at it and then around him confusedly
his eyes met joes
lord how is this joe he said
its a dirty business said joe without moving
what did you do it for i
i never done it look here
that kind of talk wont wash potter trembled and grew white
i thought id got sober
id no business to drink tonight
but its in my head yetworsen when we started here
im all in a muddle cant recollect anything of it hardly
tell me joehonest now old fellerdid i do it
joe i never meant topon my soul and honor i never meant to joe
tell me how it was joe
oh its awfuland him so young and promising why you two was scuffling and he fetched you one with the headboard and you fell flat and then up you come all reeling and staggering like and snatched the knife and jammed it into him just as he fetched you another awful clipand here youve laid as dead as a wedge til now oh i didnt know what i was adoing
i wish i may die this minute if i did
it was all on account of the whiskey and the excitement i reckon
i never used a weepon in my life before joe
ive fought but never with weepons
theyll all say that
joe dont tell
say you wont tell joethats a good feller
i always liked you joe and stood up for you too
dont you remember
you wont tell will you joe and the poor creature dropped on his knees before the stolid murderer and clasped his appealing hands
no youve always been fair and square with me muff potter and i wont go back on you
there now thats as fair as a man can say oh joe youre an angel
ill bless you for this the longest day i live and potter began to cry
come now thats enough of that
this aint any time for blubbering
you be off yonder way and ill go this
move now and dont leave any tracks behind you potter started on a trot that quickly increased to a run
the halfbreed stood looking after him
he muttered if hes as much stunned with the lick and fuddled with the rum as he had the look of being he wont think of the knife till hes gone so far hell be afraid to come back after it to such a place by himselfchickenheart two or three minutes later the murdered man the blanketed corpse the lidless coffin and the open grave were under no inspection but the moons
the stillness was complete again too
the two boys flew on and on toward the village speechless with horror
they glanced backward over their shoulders from time to time apprehensively as if they feared they might be followed
every stump that started up in their path seemed a man and an enemy and made them catch their breath and as they sped by some outlying cottages that lay near the village the barking of the aroused watchdogs seemed to give wings to their feet
if we can only get to the old tannery before we break down whispered tom in short catches between breaths
i cant stand it much longer huckleberrys hard pantings were his only reply and the boys fixed their eyes on the goal of their hopes and bent to their work to win it
they gained steadily on it and at last breast to breast they burst through the open door and fell grateful and exhausted in the sheltering shadows beyond
by and by their pulses slowed down and tom whispered huckleberry what do you reckonll come of this if doctor robinson dies i reckon hangingll come of it do you though why i know it tom tom thought a while then he said wholl tell
we what are you talking about
spose something happened and injun joe didnt hang
why hed kill us some time or other just as dead sure as were a laying here thats just what i was thinking to myself huck if anybody tells let muff potter do it if hes fool enough
hes generally drunk enough tom said nothingwent on thinking
presently he whispered huck muff potter dont know it
how can he tell whats the reason he dont know it because hed just got that whack when injun joe done it
dyou reckon he could see anything
dyou reckon he knowed anything by hokey thats so tom and besides lookaheremaybe that whack done for him no taint likely tom
he had liquor in him i could see that and besides he always has
well when paps full you might take and belt him over the head with a church and you couldnt phase him
he says so his own self
so its the same with muff potter of course
but if a man was dead sober i reckon maybe that whack might fetch him i dono after another reflective silence tom said hucky you sure you can keep mum tom we got to keep mum
you know that
that injun devil wouldnt make any more of drownding us than a couple of cats if we was to squeak bout this and they didnt hang him
now lookahere tom less take and swear to one anotherthats what we got to doswear to keep mum im agreed
its the best thing
would you just hold hands and swear that we oh no that wouldnt do for this
thats good enough for little rubbishy common thingsspecially with gals cuz they go back on you anyway and blab if they get in a huffbut there orter be writing bout a big thing like this
and blood toms whole being applauded this idea
it was deep and dark and awful the hour the circumstances the surroundings were in keeping with it
he picked up a clean pine shingle that lay in the moonlight took a little fragment of red keel out of his pocket got the moon on his work and painfully scrawled these lines emphasizing each slow downstroke by clamping his tongue between his teeth and letting up the pressure on the upstrokes
see next page
huck finn and tom sawyer swears they will keep mum about this and they wish they may drop down dead in their tracks if they ever tell and rot huckleberry was filled with admiration of toms facility in writing and the sublimity of his language
he at once took a pin from his lapel and was going to prick his flesh but tom said hold on
dont do that
a pins brass
it might have verdigrease on it whats verdigrease its pison
thats what it is
you just swaller some of it onceyoull see so tom unwound the thread from one of his needles and each boy pricked the ball of his thumb and squeezed out a drop of blood
in time after many squeezes tom managed to sign his initials using the ball of his little finger for a pen
then he showed huckleberry how to make an h and an f and the oath was complete
they buried the shingle close to the wall with some dismal ceremonies and incantations and the fetters that bound their tongues were considered to be locked and the key thrown away
a figure crept stealthily through a break in the other end of the ruined building now but they did not notice it
tom whispered huckleberry does this keep us from ever tellingalways of course it does
it dont make any difference what happens we got to keep mum
wed drop down deaddont you know that yes i reckon thats so they continued to whisper for some little time
presently a dog set up a long lugubrious howl just outsidewithin ten feet of them
the boys clasped each other suddenly in an agony of fright
which of us does he mean gasped huckleberry
i donopeep through the crack

the boys hearts sank once more

his whisper was hardly audible when he said oh huck its a stray dog quick tom quick

tom pricked up his ears
sh
whats that he whispered
sounds likelike hogs grunting

pap used to sleep there sometimes long with the hogs but laws bless you he just lifts things when he snores
besides i reckon he aint ever coming back to this town any more the spirit of adventure rose in the boys souls once more
hucky do you dast to go if i lead i dont like to much
tom spose its injun joe tom quailed
but presently the temptation rose up strong again and the boys agreed to try with the understanding that they would take to their heels if the snoring stopped
so they went tiptoeing stealthily down the one behind the other
when they had got to within five steps of the snorer tom stepped on a stick and it broke with a sharp snap
the man moaned writhed a little and his face came into the moonlight
it was muff potter
the boys hearts had stood still and their hopes too when the man moved but their fears passed away now
they tiptoed out through the broken weatherboarding and stopped at a little distance to exchange a parting word
that long lugubrious howl rose on the night air again
they turned and saw the strange dog standing within a few feet of where potter was lying and facing potter with his nose pointing heavenward
oh geeminy its him exclaimed both boys in a breath
say tomthey say a stray dog come howling around johnny millers house bout midnight as much as two weeks ago and a whippoorwill come in and lit on the banisters and sung the very same evening and there aint anybody dead there yet well i know that
and suppose there aint
didnt gracie miller fall in the kitchen fire and burn herself terrible the very next saturday yes but she aint dead
and whats more shes getting better too all right you wait and see
shes a goner just as dead sure as muff potters a goner
thats what the niggers say and they know all about these kind of things huck then they separated cogitating
when tom crept in at his bedroom window the night was almost spent
he undressed with excessive caution and fell asleep congratulating himself that nobody knew of his escapade
he was not aware that the gentlysnoring sid was awake and had been so for an hour
when tom awoke sid was dressed and gone
there was a late look in the light a late sense in the atmosphere
he was startled
why had he not been calledpersecuted till he was up as usual
the thought filled him with bodings
within five minutes he was dressed and downstairs feeling sore and drowsy
the family were still at table but they had finished breakfast
there was no voice of rebuke but there were averted eyes there was a silence and an air of solemnity that struck a chill to the culprits heart
he sat down and tried to seem gay but it was uphill work it roused no smile no response and he lapsed into silence and let his heart sink down to the depths
after breakfast his aunt took him aside and tom almost brightened in the hope that he was going to be flogged but it was not so
his aunt wept over him and asked him how he could go and break her old heart so and finally told him to go on and ruin himself and bring her gray hairs with sorrow to the grave for it was no use for her to try any more
this was worse than a thousand whippings and toms heart was sorer now than his body
he cried he pleaded for forgiveness promised to reform over and over again and then received his dismissal feeling that he had won but an imperfect forgiveness and established but a feeble confidence
he left the presence too miserable to even feel revengeful toward sid and so the latters prompt retreat through the back gate was unnecessary
he moped to school gloomy and sad and took his flogging along with joe harper for playing hookey the day before with the air of one whose heart was busy with heavier woes and wholly dead to trifles
then he betook himself to his seat rested his elbows on his desk and his jaws in his hands and stared at the wall with the stony stare of suffering that has reached the limit and can no further go
his elbow was pressing against some hard substance
after a long time he slowly and sadly changed his position and took up this object with a sigh
it was in a paper
he unrolled it
a long lingering colossal sigh followed and his heart broke
it was his brass andiron knob
this final feather broke the camels back
close upon the hour of noon the whole village was suddenly electrified with the ghastly news
no need of the as yet undreamedof telegraph the tale flew from man to man from group to group from house to house with little less than telegraphic speed
of course the schoolmaster gave holiday for that afternoon the town would have thought strangely of him if he had not
a gory knife had been found close to the murdered man and it had been recognized by somebody as belonging to muff potterso the story ran
and it was said that a belated citizen had come upon potter washing himself in the branch about one or two oclock in the morning and that potter had at once sneaked offsuspicious circumstances especially the washing which was not a habit with potter
it was also said that the town had been ransacked for this murderer the public are not slow in the matter of sifting evidence and arriving at a verdict but that he could not be found
horsemen had departed down all the roads in every direction and the sheriff was confident that he would be captured before night
all the town was drifting toward the graveyard
toms heartbreak vanished and he joined the procession not because he would not a thousand times rather go anywhere else but because an awful unaccountable fascination drew him on
arrived at the dreadful place he wormed his small body through the crowd and saw the dismal spectacle
it seemed to him an age since he was there before
somebody pinched his arm
he turned and his eyes met huckleberrys
then both looked elsewhere at once and wondered if anybody had noticed anything in their mutual glance
but everybody was talking and intent upon the grisly spectacle before them
poor fellow poor young fellow this ought to be a lesson to grave robbers muff potterll hang for this if they catch him this was the drift of remark and the minister said it was a judgment his hand is here now tom shivered from head to heel for his eye fell upon the stolid face of injun joe
at this moment the crowd began to sway and struggle and voices shouted its him
its him
hes coming himself who
who from twenty voices
muff potter hallo hes stoppedlook out hes turning
dont let him get away people in the branches of the trees over toms head said he wasnt trying to get awayhe only looked doubtful and perplexed
infernal impudence said a bystander wanted to come and take a quiet look at his work i reckondidnt expect any company the crowd fell apart now and the sheriff came through ostentatiously leading potter by the arm
the poor fellows face was haggard and his eyes showed the fear that was upon him
when he stood before the murdered man he shook as with a palsy and he put his face in his hands and burst into tears
i didnt do it friends he sobbed pon my word and honor i never done it whos accused you shouted a voice
this shot seemed to carry home
potter lifted his face and looked around him with a pathetic hopelessness in his eyes
he saw injun joe and exclaimed oh injun joe you promised me youd never is that your knife and it was thrust before him by the sheriff
potter would have fallen if they had not caught him and eased him to the ground
then he said something told me t if i didnt come back and get he shuddered then waved his nerveless hand with a vanquished gesture and said tell em joe tell emit aint any use any more then huckleberry and tom stood dumb and staring and heard the stonyhearted liar reel off his serene statement they expecting every moment that the clear sky would deliver gods lightnings upon his head and wondering to see how long the stroke was delayed
and when he had finished and still stood alive and whole their wavering impulse to break their oath and save the poor betrayed prisoners life faded and vanished away for plainly this miscreant had sold himself to satan and it would be fatal to meddle with the property of such a power as that
why didnt you leave
what did you want to come here for somebody said
i couldnt help iti couldnt help it potter moaned
i wanted to run away but i couldnt seem to come anywhere but here and he fell to sobbing again
injun joe repeated his statement just as calmly a few minutes afterward on the inquest under oath and the boys seeing that the lightnings were still withheld were confirmed in their belief that joe had sold himself to the devil
he was now become to them the most balefully interesting object they had ever looked upon and they could not take their fascinated eyes from his face
they inwardly resolved to watch him nights when opportunity should offer in the hope of getting a glimpse of his dread master
injun joe helped to raise the body of the murdered man and put it in a wagon for removal and it was whispered through the shuddering crowd that the wound bled a little
the boys thought that this happy circumstance would turn suspicion in the right direction but they were disappointed for more than one villager remarked it was within three feet of muff potter when it done it toms fearful secret and gnawing conscience disturbed his sleep for as much as a week after this and at breakfast one morning sid said tom you pitch around and talk in your sleep so much that you keep me awake half the time tom blanched and dropped his eyes
its a bad sign said aunt polly gravely
what you got on your mind tom nothing
nothing t i know of but the boys hand shook so that he spilled his coffee
and you do talk such stuff sid said
last night you said its blood its blood thats what it is you said that over and over
and you said dont torment me soill tell tell what
what is it youll tell everything was swimming before tom
there is no telling what might have happened now but luckily the concern passed out of aunt pollys face and she came to toms relief without knowing it
she said sho
its that dreadful murder
i dream about it most every night myself
sometimes i dream its me that done it mary said she had been affected much the same way
sid seemed satisfied
tom got out of the presence as quick as he plausibly could and after that he complained of toothache for a week and tied up his jaws every night
he never knew that sid lay nightly watching and frequently slipped the bandage free and then leaned on his elbow listening a good while at a time and afterward slipped the bandage back to its place again
toms distress of mind wore off gradually and the toothache grew irksome and was discarded
if sid really managed to make anything out of toms disjointed mutterings he kept it to himself
it seemed to tom that his schoolmates never would get done holding inquests on dead cats and thus keeping his trouble present to his mind
sid noticed that tom never was coroner at one of these inquiries though it had been his habit to take the lead in all new enterprises he noticed too that tom never acted as a witnessand that was strange and sid did not overlook the fact that tom even showed a marked aversion to these inquests and always avoided them when he could
sid marvelled but said nothing
however even inquests went out of vogue at last and ceased to torture toms conscience
every day or two during this time of sorrow tom watched his opportunity and went to the little grated jailwindow and smuggled such small comforts through to the murderer as he could get hold of
the jail was a trifling little brick den that stood in a marsh at the edge of the village and no guards were afforded for it indeed it was seldom occupied
these offerings greatly helped to ease toms conscience
the villagers had a strong desire to tarandfeather injun joe and ride him on a rail for bodysnatching but so formidable was his character that nobody could be found who was willing to take the lead in the matter so it was dropped
he had been careful to begin both of his inqueststatements with the fight without confessing the graverobbery that preceded it therefore it was deemed wisest not to try the case in the courts at present
one of the reasons why toms mind had drifted away from its secret troubles was that it had found a new and weighty matter to interest itself about
becky thatcher had stopped coming to school
tom had struggled with his pride a few days and tried to whistle her down the wind but failed
he began to find himself hanging around her fathers house nights and feeling very miserable
she was ill what if she should die
there was distraction in the thought
he no longer took an interest in war nor even in piracy
the charm of life was gone there was nothing but dreariness left
he put his hoop away and his bat there was no joy in them any more
his aunt was concerned
she began to try all manner of remedies on him
she was one of those people who are infatuated with patent medicines and all newfangled methods of producing health or mending it
she was an inveterate experimenter in these things
when something fresh in this line came out she was in a fever right away to try it not on herself for she was never ailing but on anybody else that came handy
she was a subscriber for all the health periodicals and phrenological frauds and the solemn ignorance they were inflated with was breath to her nostrils
all the rot they contained about ventilation and how to go to bed and how to get up and what to eat and what to drink and how much exercise to take and what frame of mind to keep ones self in and what sort of clothing to wear was all gospel to her and she never observed that her healthjournals of the current month customarily upset everything they had recommended the month before
she was as simplehearted and honest as the day was long and so she was an easy victim
she gathered together her quack periodicals and her quack medicines and thus armed with death went about on her pale horse metaphorically speaking with hell following after but she never suspected that she was not an angel of healing and the balm of gilead in disguise to the suffering neighbors
the water treatment was new now and toms low condition was a windfall to her
she had him out at daylight every morning stood him up in the woodshed and drowned him with a deluge of cold water then she scrubbed him down with a towel like a file and so brought him to then she rolled him up in a wet sheet and put him away under blankets till she sweated his soul clean and the yellow stains of it came through his poresas tom said
yet notwithstanding all this the boy grew more and more melancholy and pale and dejected
she added hot baths sitz baths shower baths and plunges
the boy remained as dismal as a hearse
she began to assist the water with a slim oatmeal diet and blisterplasters
she calculated his capacity as she would a jugs and filled him up every day with quack curealls
tom had become indifferent to persecution by this time
this phase filled the old ladys heart with consternation
this indifference must be broken up at any cost
now she heard of painkiller for the first time
she ordered a lot at once
she tasted it and was filled with gratitude
it was simply fire in a liquid form
she dropped the water treatment and everything else and pinned her faith to painkiller
she gave tom a teaspoonful and watched with the deepest anxiety for the result
her troubles were instantly at rest her soul at peace again for the indifference was broken up
the boy could not have shown a wilder heartier interest if she had built a fire under him
tom felt that it was time to wake up this sort of life might be romantic enough in his blighted condition but it was getting to have too little sentiment and too much distracting variety about it
so he thought over various plans for relief and finally hit upon that of professing to be fond of painkiller
he asked for it so often that he became a nuisance and his aunt ended by telling him to help himself and quit bothering her
if it had been sid she would have had no misgivings to alloy her delight but since it was tom she watched the bottle clandestinely
she found that the medicine did really diminish but it did not occur to her that the boy was mending the health of a crack in the sittingroom floor with it
one day tom was in the act of dosing the crack when his aunts yellow cat came along purring eyeing the teaspoon avariciously and begging for a taste
tom said dont ask for it unless you want it peter but peter signified that he did want it
you better make sure peter was sure
now youve asked for it and ill give it to you because there aint anything mean about me but if you find you dont like it you mustnt blame anybody but your own self peter was agreeable
so tom pried his mouth open and poured down the painkiller
peter sprang a couple of yards in the air and then delivered a warwhoop and set off round and round the room banging against furniture upsetting flowerpots and making general havoc
next he rose on his hind feet and pranced around in a frenzy of enjoyment with his head over his shoulder and his voice proclaiming his unappeasable happiness
then he went tearing around the house again spreading chaos and destruction in his path
aunt polly entered in time to see him throw a few double summersets deliver a final mighty hurrah and sail through the open window carrying the rest of the flowerpots with him
the old lady stood petrified with astonishment peering over her glasses tom lay on the floor expiring with laughter
tom what on earth ails that cat i dont know aunt gasped the boy
why i never see anything like it
what did make him act so deed i dont know aunt polly cats always act so when theyre having a good time they do do they there was something in the tone that made tom apprehensive
yesm
that is i believe they do you do yesm the old lady was bending down tom watching with interest emphasized by anxiety
too late he divined her drift the handle of the telltale teaspoon was visible under the bedvalance
aunt polly took it held it up
tom winced and dropped his eyes
aunt polly raised him by the usual handlehis earand cracked his head soundly with her thimble
now sir what did you want to treat that poor dumb beast so for i done it out of pity for himbecause he hadnt any aunt hadnt any auntyou numskull
what has that got to do with it heaps
because if hed had one shed a burnt him out herself
shed a roasted his bowels out of him thout any more feeling than if he was a human aunt polly felt a sudden pang of remorse
this was putting the thing in a new light what was cruelty to a cat might be cruelty to a boy too
she began to soften she felt sorry
her eyes watered a little and she put her hand on toms head and said gently i was meaning for the best tom
and tom it did do you good tom looked up in her face with just a perceptible twinkle peeping through his gravity
i know you was meaning for the best aunty and so was i with peter
it done him good too
i never see him get around so since oh go long with you tom before you aggravate me again
and you try and see if you cant be a good boy for once and you neednt take any more medicine tom reached school ahead of time
it was noticed that this strange thing had been occurring every day latterly
and now as usual of late he hung about the gate of the schoolyard instead of playing with his comrades
he was sick he said and he looked it
he tried to seem to be looking everywhere but whither he really was lookingdown the road
presently jeff thatcher hove in sight and toms face lighted he gazed a moment and then turned sorrowfully away
when jeff arrived tom accosted him and led up warily to opportunities for remark about becky but the giddy lad never could see the bait
tom watched and watched hoping whenever a frisking frock came in sight and hating the owner of it as soon as he saw she was not the right one
at last frocks ceased to appear and he dropped hopelessly into the dumps he entered the empty schoolhouse and sat down to suffer
then one more frock passed in at the gate and toms heart gave a great bound
the next instant he was out and going on like an indian yelling laughing chasing boys jumping over the fence at risk of life and limb throwing handsprings standing on his headdoing all the heroic things he could conceive of and keeping a furtive eye out all the while to see if becky thatcher was noticing
but she seemed to be unconscious of it all she never looked
could it be possible that she was not aware that he was there
he carried his exploits to her immediate vicinity came warwhooping around snatched a boys cap hurled it to the roof of the schoolhouse broke through a group of boys tumbling them in every direction and fell sprawling himself under beckys nose almost upsetting herand she turned with her nose in the air and he heard her say mf
some people think theyre mighty smartalways showing off toms cheeks burned
he gathered himself up and sneaked off crushed and crestfallen
toms mind was made up now
he was gloomy and desperate
he was a forsaken friendless boy he said nobody loved him when they found out what they had driven him to perhaps they would be sorry he had tried to do right and get along but they would not let him since nothing would do them but to be rid of him let it be so and let them blame him for the consequenceswhy shouldnt they
what right had the friendless to complain
yes they had forced him to it at last he would lead a life of crime
there was no choice
by this time he was far down meadow lane and the bell for school to take up tinkled faintly upon his ear
he sobbed now to think he should never never hear that old familiar sound any moreit was very hard but it was forced on him since he was driven out into the cold world he must submitbut he forgave them
then the sobs came thick and fast
just at this point he met his souls sworn comrade joe harperhardeyed and with evidently a great and dismal purpose in his heart
plainly here were two souls with but a single thought tom wiping his eyes with his sleeve began to blubber out something about a resolution to escape from hard usage and lack of sympathy at home by roaming abroad into the great world never to return and ended by hoping that joe would not forget him
but it transpired that this was a request which joe had just been going to make of tom and had come to hunt him up for that purpose
his mother had whipped him for drinking some cream which he had never tasted and knew nothing about it was plain that she was tired of him and wished him to go if she felt that way there was nothing for him to do but succumb he hoped she would be happy and never regret having driven her poor boy out into the unfeeling world to suffer and die
as the two boys walked sorrowing along they made a new compact to stand by each other and be brothers and never separate till death relieved them of their troubles
then they began to lay their plans
joe was for being a hermit and living on crusts in a remote cave and dying some time of cold and want and grief but after listening to tom he conceded that there were some conspicuous advantages about a life of crime and so he consented to be a pirate
three miles below st petersburg at a point where the mississippi river was a trifle over a mile wide there was a long narrow wooded island with a shallow bar at the head of it and this offered well as a rendezvous
it was not inhabited it lay far over toward the further shore abreast a dense and almost wholly unpeopled forest
so jacksons island was chosen
who were to be the subjects of their piracies was a matter that did not occur to them
then they hunted up huckleberry finn and he joined them promptly for all careers were one to him he was indifferent
they presently separated to meet at a lonely spot on the riverbank two miles above the village at the favorite hourwhich was midnight
there was a small log raft there which they meant to capture
each would bring hooks and lines and such provision as he could steal in the most dark and mysterious wayas became outlaws
and before the afternoon was done they had all managed to enjoy the sweet glory of spreading the fact that pretty soon the town would hear something all who got this vague hint were cautioned to be mum and wait about midnight tom arrived with a boiled ham and a few trifles and stopped in a dense undergrowth on a small bluff overlooking the meetingplace
it was starlight and very still
the mighty river lay like an ocean at rest
tom listened a moment but no sound disturbed the quiet
then he gave a low distinct whistle
it was answered from under the bluff
tom whistled twice more these signals were answered in the same way
then a guarded voice said who goes there tom sawyer the black avenger of the spanish main
name your names huck finn the redhanded and joe harper the terror of the seas tom had furnished these titles from his favorite literature
tis well
give the countersign two hoarse whispers delivered the same awful word simultaneously to the brooding night blood then tom tumbled his ham over the bluff and let himself down after it tearing both skin and clothes to some extent in the effort
there was an easy comfortable path along the shore under the bluff but it lacked the advantages of difficulty and danger so valued by a pirate
the terror of the seas had brought a side of bacon and had about worn himself out with getting it there
finn the redhanded had stolen a skillet and a quantity of halfcured leaf tobacco and had also brought a few corncobs to make pipes with
but none of the pirates smoked or chewed but himself
the black avenger of the spanish main said it would never do to start without some fire
that was a wise thought matches were hardly known there in that day
they saw a fire smouldering upon a great raft a hundred yards above and they went stealthily thither and helped themselves to a chunk
they made an imposing adventure of it saying hist every now and then and suddenly halting with finger on lip moving with hands on imaginary daggerhilts and giving orders in dismal whispers that if the foe stirred to let him have it to the hilt because dead men tell no tales they knew well enough that the raftsmen were all down at the village laying in stores or having a spree but still that was no excuse for their conducting this thing in an unpiratical way
they shoved off presently tom in command huck at the after oar and joe at the forward
tom stood amidships gloomybrowed and with folded arms and gave his orders in a low stern whisper luff and bring her to the wind ayeaye sir steady steadyyyy steady it is sir let her go off a point point it is sir as the boys steadily and monotonously drove the raft toward midstream it was no doubt understood that these orders were given only for style and were not intended to mean anything in particular
what sails she carrying courses topsls and flyingjib sir send the ryals up
lay out aloft there half a dozen of yeforetopmaststunsl
lively now ayeaye sir shake out that maintogalansl
sheets and braces
now my hearties ayeaye sir hellumaleehard a port
stand by to meet her when she comes
port port
now men
with a will
steadyyy steady it is sir the raft drew beyond the middle of the river the boys pointed her head right and then lay on their oars
the river was not high so there was not more than a two or three mile current
hardly a word was said during the next threequarters of an hour
now the raft was passing before the distant town
two or three glimmering lights showed where it lay peacefully sleeping beyond the vague vast sweep of stargemmed water unconscious of the tremendous event that was happening
the black avenger stood still with folded arms looking his last upon the scene of his former joys and his later sufferings and wishing she could see him now abroad on the wild sea facing peril and death with dauntless heart going to his doom with a grim smile on his lips
it was but a small strain on his imagination to remove jacksons island beyond eyeshot of the village and so he looked his last with a broken and satisfied heart
the other pirates were looking their last too and they all looked so long that they came near letting the current drift them out of the range of the island
but they discovered the danger in time and made shift to avert it
about two oclock in the morning the raft grounded on the bar two hundred yards above the head of the island and they waded back and forth until they had landed their freight
part of the little rafts belongings consisted of an old sail and this they spread over a nook in the bushes for a tent to shelter their provisions but they themselves would sleep in the open air in good weather as became outlaws
they built a fire against the side of a great log twenty or thirty steps within the sombre depths of the forest and then cooked some bacon in the fryingpan for supper and used up half of the corn pone stock they had brought
it seemed glorious sport to be feasting in that wild free way in the virgin forest of an unexplored and uninhabited island far from the haunts of men and they said they never would return to civilization
the climbing fire lit up their faces and threw its ruddy glare upon the pillared treetrunks of their forest temple and upon the varnished foliage and festooning vines
when the last crisp slice of bacon was gone and the last allowance of corn pone devoured the boys stretched themselves out on the grass filled with contentment
they could have found a cooler place but they would not deny themselves such a romantic feature as the roasting campfire
aint it gay said joe
its nuts said tom
what would the boys say if they could see us say
well theyd just die to be herehey hucky i reckon so said huckleberry anyways im suited
i dont want nothing bettern this
i dont ever get enough to eat genallyand here they cant come and pick at a feller and bullyrag him so its just the life for me said tom
you dont have to get up mornings and you dont have to go to school and wash and all that blame foolishness
you see a pirate dont have to do anything joe when hes ashore but a hermit he has to be praying considerable and then he dont have any fun anyway all by himself that way oh yes thats so said joe but i hadnt thought much about it you know
id a good deal rather be a pirate now that ive tried it you see said tom people dont go much on hermits nowadays like they used to in old times but a pirates always respected
and a hermits got to sleep on the hardest place he can find and put sackcloth and ashes on his head and stand out in the rain and what does he put sackcloth and ashes on his head for inquired huck
i dono
but theyve got to do it
hermits always do
youd have to do that if you was a hermit dernd if i would said huck
well what would you do i dono
but i wouldnt do that why huck youd have to
howd you get around it why i just wouldnt stand it
id run away run away
well you would be a nice old slouch of a hermit
youd be a disgrace the redhanded made no response being better employed
he had finished gouging out a cob and now he fitted a weed stem to it loaded it with tobacco and was pressing a coal to the charge and blowing a cloud of fragrant smokehe was in the full bloom of luxurious contentment
the other pirates envied him this majestic vice and secretly resolved to acquire it shortly
presently huck said what does pirates have to do tom said oh they have just a bully timetake ships and burn them and get the money and bury it in awful places in their island where theres ghosts and things to watch it and kill everybody in the shipsmake em walk a plank and they carry the women to the island said joe they dont kill the women no assented tom they dont kill the womentheyre too noble
and the womens always beautiful too
and dont they wear the bulliest clothes
oh no
all gold and silver and dimonds said joe with enthusiasm
who said huck
why the pirates huck scanned his own clothing forlornly
i reckon i aint dressed fitten for a pirate said he with a regretful pathos in his voice but i aint got none but these but the other boys told him the fine clothes would come fast enough after they should have begun their adventures
they made him understand that his poor rags would do to begin with though it was customary for wealthy pirates to start with a proper wardrobe
gradually their talk died out and drowsiness began to steal upon the eyelids of the little waifs
the pipe dropped from the fingers of the redhanded and he slept the sleep of the consciencefree and the weary
the terror of the seas and the black avenger of the spanish main had more difficulty in getting to sleep
they said their prayers inwardly and lying down since there was nobody there with authority to make them kneel and recite aloud in truth they had a mind not to say them at all but they were afraid to proceed to such lengths as that lest they might call down a sudden and special thunderbolt from heaven
then at once they reached and hovered upon the imminent verge of sleepbut an intruder came now that would not down it was conscience
they began to feel a vague fear that they had been doing wrong to run away and next they thought of the stolen meat and then the real torture came
they tried to argue it away by reminding conscience that they had purloined sweetmeats and apples scores of times but conscience was not to be appeased by such thin plausibilities it seemed to them in the end that there was no getting around the stubborn fact that taking sweetmeats was only hooking while taking bacon and hams and such valuables was plain simple stealingand there was a command against that in the bible
so they inwardly resolved that so long as they remained in the business their piracies should not again be sullied with the crime of stealing
then conscience granted a truce and these curiously inconsistent pirates fell peacefully to sleep
when tom awoke in the morning he wondered where he was
he sat up and rubbed his eyes and looked around
then he comprehended
it was the cool gray dawn and there was a delicious sense of repose and peace in the deep pervading calm and silence of the woods
not a leaf stirred not a sound obtruded upon great natures meditation
beaded dewdrops stood upon the leaves and grasses
a white layer of ashes covered the fire and a thin blue breath of smoke rose straight into the air
joe and huck still slept
now far away in the woods a bird called another answered presently the hammering of a woodpecker was heard
gradually the cool dim gray of the morning whitened and as gradually sounds multiplied and life manifested itself
the marvel of nature shaking off sleep and going to work unfolded itself to the musing boy
a little green worm came crawling over a dewy leaf lifting twothirds of his body into the air from time to time and sniffing around then proceeding againfor he was measuring tom said and when the worm approached him of its own accord he sat as still as a stone with his hopes rising and falling by turns as the creature still came toward him or seemed inclined to go elsewhere and when at last it considered a painful moment with its curved body in the air and then came decisively down upon toms leg and began a journey over him his whole heart was gladfor that meant that he was going to have a new suit of clotheswithout the shadow of a doubt a gaudy piratical uniform
now a procession of ants appeared from nowhere in particular and went about their labors one struggled manfully by with a dead spider five times as big as itself in its arms and lugged it straight up a treetrunk
a brown spotted ladybug climbed the dizzy height of a grass blade and tom bent down close to it and said ladybug ladybug fly away home your house is on fire your childrens alone and she took wing and went off to see about itwhich did not surprise the boy for he knew of old that this insect was credulous about conflagrations and he had practised upon its simplicity more than once
a tumblebug came next heaving sturdily at its ball and tom touched the creature to see it shut its legs against its body and pretend to be dead
the birds were fairly rioting by this time
a catbird the northern mocker lit in a tree over toms head and trilled out her imitations of her neighbors in a rapture of enjoyment then a shrill jay swept down a flash of blue flame and stopped on a twig almost within the boys reach cocked his head to one side and eyed the strangers with a consuming curiosity a gray squirrel and a big fellow of the fox kind came skurrying along sitting up at intervals to inspect and chatter at the boys for the wild things had probably never seen a human being before and scarcely knew whether to be afraid or not
all nature was wide awake and stirring now long lances of sunlight pierced down through the dense foliage far and near and a few butterflies came fluttering upon the scene
tom stirred up the other pirates and they all clattered away with a shout and in a minute or two were stripped and chasing after and tumbling over each other in the shallow limpid water of the white sandbar
they felt no longing for the little village sleeping in the distance beyond the majestic waste of water
a vagrant current or a slight rise in the river had carried off their raft but this only gratified them since its going was something like burning the bridge between them and civilization
they came back to camp wonderfully refreshed gladhearted and ravenous and they soon had the campfire blazing up again
huck found a spring of clear cold water close by and the boys made cups of broad oak or hickory leaves and felt that water sweetened with such a wildwood charm as that would be a good enough substitute for coffee
while joe was slicing bacon for breakfast tom and huck asked him to hold on a minute they stepped to a promising nook in the riverbank and threw in their lines almost immediately they had reward
joe had not had time to get impatient before they were back again with some handsome bass a couple of sunperch and a small catfishprovisions enough for quite a family
they fried the fish with the bacon and were astonished for no fish had ever seemed so delicious before
they did not know that the quicker a freshwater fish is on the fire after he is caught the better he is and they reflected little upon what a sauce openair sleeping openair exercise bathing and a large ingredient of hunger make too
they lay around in the shade after breakfast while huck had a smoke and then went off through the woods on an exploring expedition
they tramped gayly along over decaying logs through tangled underbrush among solemn monarchs of the forest hung from their crowns to the ground with a drooping regalia of grapevines
now and then they came upon snug nooks carpeted with grass and jeweled with flowers
they found plenty of things to be delighted with but nothing to be astonished at
they discovered that the island was about three miles long and a quarter of a mile wide and that the shore it lay closest to was only separated from it by a narrow channel hardly two hundred yards wide
they took a swim about every hour so it was close upon the middle of the afternoon when they got back to camp
they were too hungry to stop to fish but they fared sumptuously upon cold ham and then threw themselves down in the shade to talk
but the talk soon began to drag and then died
the stillness the solemnity that brooded in the woods and the sense of loneliness began to tell upon the spirits of the boys
they fell to thinking
a sort of undefined longing crept upon them
this took dim shape presentlyit was budding homesickness
even finn the redhanded was dreaming of his doorsteps and empty hogsheads
but they were all ashamed of their weakness and none was brave enough to speak his thought
for some time now the boys had been dully conscious of a peculiar sound in the distance just as one sometimes is of the ticking of a clock which he takes no distinct note of
but now this mysterious sound became more pronounced and forced a recognition
the boys started glanced at each other and then each assumed a listening attitude
there was a long silence profound and unbroken then a deep sullen boom came floating down out of the distance
what is it exclaimed joe under his breath
i wonder said tom in a whisper
taint thunder said huckleberry in an awed tone becuz thunder hark said tom
listendont talk they waited a time that seemed an age and then the same muffled boom troubled the solemn hush
lets go and see they sprang to their feet and hurried to the shore toward the town
they parted the bushes on the bank and peered out over the water
the little steam ferryboat was about a mile below the village drifting with the current
her broad deck seemed crowded with people
there were a great many skiffs rowing about or floating with the stream in the neighborhood of the ferryboat but the boys could not determine what the men in them were doing
presently a great jet of white smoke burst from the ferryboats side and as it expanded and rose in a lazy cloud that same dull throb of sound was borne to the listeners again
i know now exclaimed tom somebodys drownded thats it said huck they done that last summer when bill turner got drownded they shoot a cannon over the water and that makes him come up to the top
yes and they take loaves of bread and put quicksilver in em and set em afloat and wherever theres anybody thats drownded theyll float right there and stop yes ive heard about that said joe
i wonder what makes the bread do that oh it aint the bread so much said tom i reckon its mostly what they say over it before they start it out but they dont say anything over it said huck
ive seen em and they dont well thats funny said tom
but maybe they say it to themselves
of course they do
anybody might know that the other boys agreed that there was reason in what tom said because an ignorant lump of bread uninstructed by an incantation could not be expected to act very intelligently when set upon an errand of such gravity
by jings i wish i was over there now said joe
i do too said huck id give heaps to know who it is the boys still listened and watched
presently a revealing thought flashed through toms mind and he exclaimed boys i know whos drowndedits us they felt like heroes in an instant
here was a gorgeous triumph they were missed they were mourned hearts were breaking on their account tears were being shed accusing memories of unkindness to these poor lost lads were rising up and unavailing regrets and remorse were being indulged and best of all the departed were the talk of the whole town and the envy of all the boys as far as this dazzling notoriety was concerned
this was fine
it was worth while to be a pirate after all
as twilight drew on the ferryboat went back to her accustomed business and the skiffs disappeared
the pirates returned to camp
they were jubilant with vanity over their new grandeur and the illustrious trouble they were making
they caught fish cooked supper and ate it and then fell to guessing at what the village was thinking and saying about them and the pictures they drew of the public distress on their account were gratifying to look uponfrom their point of view
but when the shadows of night closed them in they gradually ceased to talk and sat gazing into the fire with their minds evidently wandering elsewhere
the excitement was gone now and tom and joe could not keep back thoughts of certain persons at home who were not enjoying this fine frolic as much as they were
misgivings came they grew troubled and unhappy a sigh or two escaped unawares
by and by joe timidly ventured upon a roundabout feeler as to how the others might look upon a return to civilizationnot right now but tom withered him with derision
huck being uncommitted as yet joined in with tom and the waverer quickly explained and was glad to get out of the scrape with as little taint of chickenhearted homesickness clinging to his garments as he could
mutiny was effectually laid to rest for the moment
as the night deepened huck began to nod and presently to snore
joe followed next
tom lay upon his elbow motionless for some time watching the two intently
at last he got up cautiously on his knees and went searching among the grass and the flickering reflections flung by the campfire
he picked up and inspected several large semicylinders of the thin white bark of a sycamore and finally chose two which seemed to suit him
then he knelt by the fire and painfully wrote something upon each of these with his red keel one he rolled up and put in his jacket pocket and the other he put in joes hat and removed it to a little distance from the owner
and he also put into the hat certain schoolboy treasures of almost inestimable valueamong them a lump of chalk an indiarubber ball three fishhooks and one of that kind of marbles known as a sure nough crystal then he tiptoed his way cautiously among the trees till he felt that he was out of hearing and straightway broke into a keen run in the direction of the sandbar
a few minutes later tom was in the shoal water of the bar wading toward the illinois shore
before the depth reached his middle he was halfway over the current would permit no more wading now so he struck out confidently to swim the remaining hundred yards
he swam quartering upstream but still was swept downward rather faster than he had expected
however he reached the shore finally and drifted along till he found a low place and drew himself out
he put his hand on his jacket pocket found his piece of bark safe and then struck through the woods following the shore with streaming garments
shortly before ten oclock he came out into an open place opposite the village and saw the ferryboat lying in the shadow of the trees and the high bank
everything was quiet under the blinking stars
he crept down the bank watching with all his eyes slipped into the water swam three or four strokes and climbed into the skiff that did yawl duty at the boats stern
he laid himself down under the thwarts and waited panting
presently the cracked bell tapped and a voice gave the order to cast off a minute or two later the skiffs head was standing high up against the boats swell and the voyage was begun
tom felt happy in his success for he knew it was the boats last trip for the night
at the end of a long twelve or fifteen minutes the wheels stopped and tom slipped overboard and swam ashore in the dusk landing fifty yards downstream out of danger of possible stragglers
he flew along unfrequented alleys and shortly found himself at his aunts back fence
he climbed over approached the ell and looked in at the sittingroom window for a light was burning there
there sat aunt polly sid mary and joe harpers mother grouped together talking
they were by the bed and the bed was between them and the door
tom went to the door and began to softly lift the latch then he pressed gently and the door yielded a crack he continued pushing cautiously and quaking every time it creaked till he judged he might squeeze through on his knees so he put his head through and began warily
what makes the candle blow so said aunt polly
tom hurried up
why that doors open i believe
why of course it is
no end of strange things now
go long and shut it sid tom disappeared under the bed just in time
he lay and breathed himself for a time and then crept to where he could almost touch his aunts foot
but as i was saying said aunt polly he warnt bad so to sayonly mischeevous
only just giddy and harumscarum you know
he warnt any more responsible than a colt
he never meant any harm and he was the besthearted boy that ever wasand she began to cry
it was just so with my joealways full of his devilment and up to every kind of mischief but he was just as unselfish and kind as he could beand laws bless me to think i went and whipped him for taking that cream never once recollecting that i throwed it out myself because it was sour and i never to see him again in this world never never never poor abused boy and mrs harper sobbed as if her heart would break
i hope toms better off where he is said sid but if hed been better in some ways sid tom felt the glare of the old ladys eye though he could not see it
not a word against my tom now that hes gone
godll take care of himnever you trouble yourself sir
oh mrs harper i dont know how to give him up
i dont know how to give him up
he was such a comfort to me although he tormented my old heart out of me most the lord giveth and the lord hath taken awayblessed be the name of the lord
but its so hardoh its so hard
only last saturday my joe busted a firecracker right under my nose and i knocked him sprawling
little did i know then how soonoh if it was to do over again id hug him and bless him for it yes yes yes i know just how you feel mrs harper i know just exactly how you feel
no longer ago than yesterday noon my tom took and filled the cat full of painkiller and i did think the cretur would tear the house down
and god forgive me i cracked toms head with my thimble poor boy poor dead boy
but hes out of all his troubles now
and the last words i ever heard him say was to reproach but this memory was too much for the old lady and she broke entirely down
tom was snuffling now himselfand more in pity of himself than anybody else
he could hear mary crying and putting in a kindly word for him from time to time
he began to have a nobler opinion of himself than ever before
still he was sufficiently touched by his aunts grief to long to rush out from under the bed and overwhelm her with joyand the theatrical gorgeousness of the thing appealed strongly to his nature too but he resisted and lay still
he went on listening and gathered by odds and ends that it was conjectured at first that the boys had got drowned while taking a swim then the small raft had been missed next certain boys said the missing lads had promised that the village should hear something soon the wiseheads had put this and that together and decided that the lads had gone off on that raft and would turn up at the next town below presently but toward noon the raft had been found lodged against the missouri shore some five or six miles below the villageand then hope perished they must be drowned else hunger would have driven them home by nightfall if not sooner
it was believed that the search for the bodies had been a fruitless effort merely because the drowning must have occurred in midchannel since the boys being good swimmers would otherwise have escaped to shore
this was wednesday night
if the bodies continued missing until sunday all hope would be given over and the funerals would be preached on that morning
tom shuddered
mrs harper gave a sobbing goodnight and turned to go
then with a mutual impulse the two bereaved women flung themselves into each others arms and had a good consoling cry and then parted
aunt polly was tender far beyond her wont in her goodnight to sid and mary
sid snuffled a bit and mary went off crying with all her heart
aunt polly knelt down and prayed for tom so touchingly so appealingly and with such measureless love in her words and her old trembling voice that he was weltering in tears again long before she was through
he had to keep still long after she went to bed for she kept making brokenhearted ejaculations from time to time tossing unrestfully and turning over
but at last she was still only moaning a little in her sleep
now the boy stole out rose gradually by the bedside shaded the candlelight with his hand and stood regarding her
his heart was full of pity for her
he took out his sycamore scroll and placed it by the candle
but something occurred to him and he lingered considering
his face lighted with a happy solution of his thought he put the bark hastily in his pocket
then he bent over and kissed the faded lips and straightway made his stealthy exit latching the door behind him
he threaded his way back to the ferry landing found nobody at large there and walked boldly on board the boat for he knew she was tenantless except that there was a watchman who always turned in and slept like a graven image
he untied the skiff at the stern slipped into it and was soon rowing cautiously upstream
when he had pulled a mile above the village he started quartering across and bent himself stoutly to his work
he hit the landing on the other side neatly for this was a familiar bit of work to him
he was moved to capture the skiff arguing that it might be considered a ship and therefore legitimate prey for a pirate but he knew a thorough search would be made for it and that might end in revelations
so he stepped ashore and entered the woods
he sat down and took a long rest torturing himself meanwhile to keep awake and then started warily down the homestretch
the night was far spent
it was broad daylight before he found himself fairly abreast the island bar
he rested again until the sun was well up and gilding the great river with its splendor and then he plunged into the stream
a little later he paused dripping upon the threshold of the camp and heard joe say no toms trueblue huck and hell come back
he wont desert
he knows that would be a disgrace to a pirate and toms too proud for that sort of thing
hes up to something or other
now i wonder what well the things is ours anyway aint they pretty near but not yet huck
the writing says they are if he aint back here to breakfast which he is exclaimed tom with fine dramatic effect stepping grandly into camp
a sumptuous breakfast of bacon and fish was shortly provided and as the boys set to work upon it tom recounted and adorned his adventures
they were a vain and boastful company of heroes when the tale was done
then tom hid himself away in a shady nook to sleep till noon and the other pirates got ready to fish and explore
after dinner all the gang turned out to hunt for turtle eggs on the bar
they went about poking sticks into the sand and when they found a soft place they went down on their knees and dug with their hands
sometimes they would take fifty or sixty eggs out of one hole
they were perfectly round white things a trifle smaller than an english walnut
they had a famous friedegg feast that night and another on friday morning
after breakfast they went whooping and prancing out on the bar and chased each other round and round shedding clothes as they went until they were naked and then continued the frolic far away up the shoal water of the bar against the stiff current which latter tripped their legs from under them from time to time and greatly increased the fun
and now and then they stooped in a group and splashed water in each others faces with their palms gradually approaching each other with averted faces to avoid the strangling sprays and finally gripping and struggling till the best man ducked his neighbor and then they all went under in a tangle of white legs and arms and came up blowing sputtering laughing and gasping for breath at one and the same time
when they were well exhausted they would run out and sprawl on the dry hot sand and lie there and cover themselves up with it and by and by break for the water again and go through the original performance once more
finally it occurred to them that their naked skin represented fleshcolored tights very fairly so they drew a ring in the sand and had a circuswith three clowns in it for none would yield this proudest post to his neighbor
next they got their marbles and played knucks and ringtaw and keeps till that amusement grew stale
then joe and huck had another swim but tom would not venture because he found that in kicking off his trousers he had kicked his string of rattlesnake rattles off his ankle and he wondered how he had escaped cramp so long without the protection of this mysterious charm
he did not venture again until he had found it and by that time the other boys were tired and ready to rest
they gradually wandered apart dropped into the dumps and fell to gazing longingly across the wide river to where the village lay drowsing in the sun
tom found himself writing becky in the sand with his big toe he scratched it out and was angry with himself for his weakness
but he wrote it again nevertheless he could not help it
he erased it once more and then took himself out of temptation by driving the other boys together and joining them
but joes spirits had gone down almost beyond resurrection
he was so homesick that he could hardly endure the misery of it
the tears lay very near the surface
huck was melancholy too
tom was downhearted but tried hard not to show it
he had a secret which he was not ready to tell yet but if this mutinous depression was not broken up soon he would have to bring it out
he said with a great show of cheerfulness i bet theres been pirates on this island before boys
well explore it again
theyve hid treasures here somewhere
howd you feel to light on a rotten chest full of gold and silverhey but it roused only faint enthusiasm which faded out with no reply
tom tried one or two other seductions but they failed too
it was discouraging work
joe sat poking up the sand with a stick and looking very gloomy
finally he said oh boys lets give it up
i want to go home
its so lonesome oh no joe youll feel better by and by said tom
just think of the fishing thats here i dont care for fishing
i want to go home but joe there aint such another swimmingplace anywhere swimmings no good
i dont seem to care for it somehow when there aint anybody to say i shant go in
i mean to go home oh shucks
baby
you want to see your mother i reckon yes i do want to see my motherand you would too if you had one
i aint any more baby than you are and joe snuffled a little
well well let the crybaby go home to his mother wont we huck
poor thingdoes it want to see its mother
and so it shall
you like it here dont you huck
well stay wont we huck said yeswithout any heart in it
ill never speak to you again as long as i live said joe rising
there now and he moved moodily away and began to dress himself
who cares said tom
nobody wants you to
go long home and get laughed at
oh youre a nice pirate
huck and me aint crybabies
well stay wont we huck
let him go if he wants to
i reckon we can get along without him peraps but tom was uneasy nevertheless and was alarmed to see joe go sullenly on with his dressing
and then it was discomforting to see huck eying joes preparations so wistfully and keeping up such an ominous silence
presently without a parting word joe began to wade off toward the illinois shore
toms heart began to sink
he glanced at huck
huck could not bear the look and dropped his eyes
then he said i want to go too tom
it was getting so lonesome anyway and now itll be worse
lets us go too tom i wont
you can all go if you want to
i mean to stay tom i better go well go longwhos hendering you huck began to pick up his scattered clothes
he said tom i wisht youd come too
now you think it over
well wait for you when we get to shore well youll wait a blame long time thats all huck started sorrowfully away and tom stood looking after him with a strong desire tugging at his heart to yield his pride and go along too
he hoped the boys would stop but they still waded slowly on
it suddenly dawned on tom that it was become very lonely and still
he made one final struggle with his pride and then darted after his comrades yelling wait
wait
i want to tell you something they presently stopped and turned around
when he got to where they were he began unfolding his secret and they listened moodily till at last they saw the point he was driving at and then they set up a warwhoop of applause and said it was splendid and said if he had told them at first they wouldnt have started away
he made a plausible excuse but his real reason had been the fear that not even the secret would keep them with him any very great length of time and so he had meant to hold it in reserve as a last seduction
the lads came gayly back and went at their sports again with a will chattering all the time about toms stupendous plan and admiring the genius of it
after a dainty egg and fish dinner tom said he wanted to learn to smoke now
joe caught at the idea and said he would like to try too
so huck made pipes and filled them
these novices had never smoked anything before but cigars made of grapevine and they bit the tongue and were not considered manly anyway
now they stretched themselves out on their elbows and began to puff charily and with slender confidence
the smoke had an unpleasant taste and they gagged a little but tom said why its just as easy
if id a knowed this was all id a learnt long ago so would i said joe
its just nothing why many a time ive looked at people smoking and thought well i wish i could do that but i never thought i could said tom
thats just the way with me haint it huck
youve heard me talk just that wayhavent you huck
ill leave it to huck if i havent yesheaps of times said huck
well i have too said tom oh hundreds of times
once down by the slaughterhouse
dont you remember huck
bob tanner was there and johnny miller and jeff thatcher when i said it
dont you remember huck bout me saying that yes thats so said huck
that was the day after i lost a white alley
no twas the day before therei told you so said tom
huck recollects it i bleeve i could smoke this pipe all day said joe
i dont feel sick neither do i said tom
i could smoke it all day
but i bet you jeff thatcher couldnt jeff thatcher
why hed keel over just with two draws
just let him try it once
hed see i bet he would
and johnny milleri wish could see johnny miller tackle it once oh dont i said joe
why i bet you johnny miller couldnt any more do this than nothing
just one little snifter would fetch him deed it would joe
sayi wish the boys could see us now so do i sayboys dont say anything about it and some time when theyre around ill come up to you and say joe got a pipe
i want a smoke and youll say kind of careless like as if it warnt anything youll say yes i got my old pipe and another one but my tobacker aint very good and ill say oh thats all right if its strong enough and then youll out with the pipes and well light up just as cam and then just see em look by jings thatll be gay tom
i wish it was now so do i
and when we tell em we learned when we was off pirating wont they wish theyd been along oh i reckon not
ill just bet they will so the talk ran on
but presently it began to flag a trifle and grow disjointed
the silences widened the expectoration marvellously increased
every pore inside the boys cheeks became a spouting fountain they could scarcely bail out the cellars under their tongues fast enough to prevent an inundation little overflowings down their throats occurred in spite of all they could do and sudden retchings followed every time
both boys were looking very pale and miserable now
joes pipe dropped from his nerveless fingers
toms followed
both fountains were going furiously and both pumps bailing with might and main
joe said feebly ive lost my knife
i reckon i better go and find it tom said with quivering lips and halting utterance ill help you
you go over that way and ill hunt around by the spring
no you neednt come huckwe can find it so huck sat down again and waited an hour
then he found it lonesome and went to find his comrades
they were wide apart in the woods both very pale both fast asleep
but something informed him that if they had had any trouble they had got rid of it
they were not talkative at supper that night
they had a humble look and when huck prepared his pipe after the meal and was going to prepare theirs they said no they were not feeling very wellsomething they ate at dinner had disagreed with them
about midnight joe awoke and called the boys
there was a brooding oppressiveness in the air that seemed to bode something
the boys huddled themselves together and sought the friendly companionship of the fire though the dull dead heat of the breathless atmosphere was stifling
they sat still intent and waiting
the solemn hush continued
beyond the light of the fire everything was swallowed up in the blackness of darkness
presently there came a quivering glow that vaguely revealed the foliage for a moment and then vanished
by and by another came a little stronger
then another
then a faint moan came sighing through the branches of the forest and the boys felt a fleeting breath upon their cheeks and shuddered with the fancy that the spirit of the night had gone by
there was a pause
now a weird flash turned night into day and showed every little grassblade separate and distinct that grew about their feet
and it showed three white startled faces too
a deep peal of thunder went rolling and tumbling down the heavens and lost itself in sullen rumblings in the distance
a sweep of chilly air passed by rustling all the leaves and snowing the flaky ashes broadcast about the fire
another fierce glare lit up the forest and an instant crash followed that seemed to rend the treetops right over the boys heads
they clung together in terror in the thick gloom that followed
a few big raindrops fell pattering upon the leaves
quick
boys go for the tent exclaimed tom
they sprang away stumbling over roots and among vines in the dark no two plunging in the same direction
a furious blast roared through the trees making everything sing as it went
one blinding flash after another came and peal on peal of deafening thunder
and now a drenching rain poured down and the rising hurricane drove it in sheets along the ground
the boys cried out to each other but the roaring wind and the booming thunderblasts drowned their voices utterly
however one by one they straggled in at last and took shelter under the tent cold scared and streaming with water but to have company in misery seemed something to be grateful for
they could not talk the old sail flapped so furiously even if the other noises would have allowed them
the tempest rose higher and higher and presently the sail tore loose from its fastenings and went winging away on the blast
the boys seized each others hands and fled with many tumblings and bruises to the shelter of a great oak that stood upon the riverbank
now the battle was at its highest
under the ceaseless conflagration of lightning that flamed in the skies everything below stood out in cleancut and shadowless distinctness the bending trees the billowy river white with foam the driving spray of spumeflakes the dim outlines of the high bluffs on the other side glimpsed through the drifting cloudrack and the slanting veil of rain
every little while some giant tree yielded the fight and fell crashing through the younger growth and the unflagging thunderpeals came now in earsplitting explosive bursts keen and sharp and unspeakably appalling
the storm culminated in one matchless effort that seemed likely to tear the island to pieces burn it up drown it to the treetops blow it away and deafen every creature in it all at one and the same moment
it was a wild night for homeless young heads to be out in
but at last the battle was done and the forces retired with weaker and weaker threatenings and grumblings and peace resumed her sway
the boys went back to camp a good deal awed but they found there was still something to be thankful for because the great sycamore the shelter of their beds was a ruin now blasted by the lightnings and they were not under it when the catastrophe happened
everything in camp was drenched the campfire as well for they were but heedless lads like their generation and had made no provision against rain
here was matter for dismay for they were soaked through and chilled
they were eloquent in their distress but they presently discovered that the fire had eaten so far up under the great log it had been built against where it curved upward and separated itself from the ground that a handbreadth or so of it had escaped wetting so they patiently wrought until with shreds and bark gathered from the under sides of sheltered logs they coaxed the fire to burn again
then they piled on great dead boughs till they had a roaring furnace and were gladhearted once more
they dried their boiled ham and had a feast and after that they sat by the fire and expanded and glorified their midnight adventure until morning for there was not a dry spot to sleep on anywhere around
as the sun began to steal in upon the boys drowsiness came over them and they went out on the sandbar and lay down to sleep
they got scorched out by and by and drearily set about getting breakfast
after the meal they felt rusty and stiffjointed and a little homesick once more
tom saw the signs and fell to cheering up the pirates as well as he could
but they cared nothing for marbles or circus or swimming or anything
he reminded them of the imposing secret and raised a ray of cheer
while it lasted he got them interested in a new device
this was to knock off being pirates for a while and be indians for a change
they were attracted by this idea so it was not long before they were stripped and striped from head to heel with black mud like so many zebrasall of them chiefs of courseand then they went tearing through the woods to attack an english settlement
by and by they separated into three hostile tribes and darted upon each other from ambush with dreadful warwhoops and killed and scalped each other by thousands
it was a gory day
consequently it was an extremely satisfactory one
they assembled in camp toward suppertime hungry and happy but now a difficulty arosehostile indians could not break the bread of hospitality together without first making peace and this was a simple impossibility without smoking a pipe of peace
there was no other process that ever they had heard of
two of the savages almost wished they had remained pirates
however there was no other way so with such show of cheerfulness as they could muster they called for the pipe and took their whiff as it passed in due form
and behold they were glad they had gone into savagery for they had gained something they found that they could now smoke a little without having to go and hunt for a lost knife they did not get sick enough to be seriously uncomfortable
they were not likely to fool away this high promise for lack of effort
no they practised cautiously after supper with right fair success and so they spent a jubilant evening
they were prouder and happier in their new acquirement than they would have been in the scalping and skinning of the six nations
we will leave them to smoke and chatter and brag since we have no further use for them at present
but there was no hilarity in the little town that same tranquil saturday afternoon
the harpers and aunt pollys family were being put into mourning with great grief and many tears
an unusual quiet possessed the village although it was ordinarily quiet enough in all conscience
the villagers conducted their concerns with an absent air and talked little but they sighed often
the saturday holiday seemed a burden to the children
they had no heart in their sports and gradually gave them up
in the afternoon becky thatcher found herself moping about the deserted schoolhouse yard and feeling very melancholy
but she found nothing there to comfort her
she soliloquized oh if i only had a brass andironknob again
but i havent got anything now to remember him by and she choked back a little sob
presently she stopped and said to herself it was right here
oh if it was to do over again i wouldnt say thati wouldnt say it for the whole world
but hes gone now ill never never never see him any more this thought broke her down and she wandered away with tears rolling down her cheeks
then quite a group of boys and girlsplaymates of toms and joescame by and stood looking over the paling fence and talking in reverent tones of how tom did soandso the last time they saw him and how joe said this and that small trifle pregnant with awful prophecy as they could easily see now
and each speaker pointed out the exact spot where the lost lads stood at the time and then added something like and i was astanding just sojust as i am now and as if you was himi was as close as thatand he smiled just this wayand then something seemed to go all over me likeawful you knowand i never thought what it meant of course but i can see now then there was a dispute about who saw the dead boys last in life and many claimed that dismal distinction and offered evidences more or less tampered with by the witness and when it was ultimately decided who did see the departed last and exchanged the last words with them the lucky parties took upon themselves a sort of sacred importance and were gaped at and envied by all the rest
one poor chap who had no other grandeur to offer said with tolerably manifest pride in the remembrance well tom sawyer he licked me once but that bid for glory was a failure
most of the boys could say that and so that cheapened the distinction too much
the group loitered away still recalling memories of the lost heroes in awed voices
when the sundayschool hour was finished the next morning the bell began to toll instead of ringing in the usual way
it was a very still sabbath and the mournful sound seemed in keeping with the musing hush that lay upon nature
the villagers began to gather loitering a moment in the vestibule to converse in whispers about the sad event
but there was no whispering in the house only the funereal rustling of dresses as the women gathered to their seats disturbed the silence there
none could remember when the little church had been so full before
there was finally a waiting pause an expectant dumbness and then aunt polly entered followed by sid and mary and they by the harper family all in deep black and the whole congregation the old minister as well rose reverently and stood until the mourners were seated in the front pew
there was another communing silence broken at intervals by muffled sobs and then the minister spread his hands abroad and prayed
a moving hymn was sung and the text followed i am the resurrection and the life as the service proceeded the clergyman drew such pictures of the graces the winning ways and the rare promise of the lost lads that every soul there thinking he recognized these pictures felt a pang in remembering that he had persistently blinded himself to them always before and had as persistently seen only faults and flaws in the poor boys
the minister related many a touching incident in the lives of the departed too which illustrated their sweet generous natures and the people could easily see now how noble and beautiful those episodes were and remembered with grief that at the time they occurred they had seemed rank rascalities well deserving of the cowhide
the congregation became more and more moved as the pathetic tale went on till at last the whole company broke down and joined the weeping mourners in a chorus of anguished sobs the preacher himself giving way to his feelings and crying in the pulpit
there was a rustle in the gallery which nobody noticed a moment later the church door creaked the minister raised his streaming eyes above his handkerchief and stood transfixed
first one and then another pair of eyes followed the ministers and then almost with one impulse the congregation rose and stared while the three dead boys came marching up the aisle tom in the lead joe next and huck a ruin of drooping rags sneaking sheepishly in the rear
they had been hid in the unused gallery listening to their own funeral sermon
aunt polly mary and the harpers threw themselves upon their restored ones smothered them with kisses and poured out thanksgivings while poor huck stood abashed and uncomfortable not knowing exactly what to do or where to hide from so many unwelcoming eyes
he wavered and started to slink away but tom seized him and said aunt polly it aint fair
somebodys got to be glad to see huck and so they shall
im glad to see him poor motherless thing and the loving attentions aunt polly lavished upon him were the one thing capable of making him more uncomfortable than he was before
suddenly the minister shouted at the top of his voice praise god from whom all blessings flowsingand put your hearts in it and they did
old hundred swelled up with a triumphant burst and while it shook the rafters tom sawyer the pirate looked around upon the envying juveniles about him and confessed in his heart that this was the proudest moment of his life
as the sold congregation trooped out they said they would almost be willing to be made ridiculous again to hear old hundred sung like that once more
tom got more cuffs and kisses that dayaccording to aunt pollys varying moodsthan he had earned before in a year and he hardly knew which expressed the most gratefulness to god and affection for himself
that was toms great secretthe scheme to return home with his brother pirates and attend their own funerals
they had paddled over to the missouri shore on a log at dusk on saturday landing five or six miles below the village they had slept in the woods at the edge of the town till nearly daylight and had then crept through back lanes and alleys and finished their sleep in the gallery of the church among a chaos of invalided benches
at breakfast monday morning aunt polly and mary were very loving to tom and very attentive to his wants
there was an unusual amount of talk
in the course of it aunt polly said well i dont say it wasnt a fine joke tom to keep everybody suffering most a week so you boys had a good time but it is a pity you could be so hardhearted as to let me suffer so
if you could come over on a log to go to your funeral you could have come over and give me a hint some way that you warnt dead but only run off yes you could have done that tom said mary and i believe you would if you had thought of it would you tom said aunt polly her face lighting wistfully
say now would you if youd thought of it iwell i dont know
twould a spoiled everything tom i hoped you loved me that much said aunt polly with a grieved tone that discomforted the boy
it would have been something if youd cared enough to think of it even if you didnt do it now auntie that aint any harm pleaded mary its only toms giddy wayhe is always in such a rush that he never thinks of anything mores the pity
sid would have thought
and sid would have come and done it too
tom youll look back some day when its too late and wish youd cared a little more for me when it would have cost you so little now auntie you know i do care for you said tom
id know it better if you acted more like it i wish now id thought said tom with a repentant tone but i dreamt about you anyway
thats something aint it it aint mucha cat does that muchbut its better than nothing
what did you dream why wednesday night i dreamt that you was sitting over there by the bed and sid was sitting by the woodbox and mary next to him well so we did
so we always do
im glad your dreams could take even that much trouble about us and i dreamt that joe harpers mother was here why she was here
did you dream any more oh lots
but its so dim now well try to recollectcant you somehow it seems to me that the windthe wind blowed thethe try harder tom
the wind did blow something
come tom pressed his fingers on his forehead an anxious minute and then said ive got it now
ive got it now
it blowed the candle mercy on us

oh yesyou said you believed the door was open as im sitting here i did

what did i make him do tom
what did i make him do you made himyouoh you made him shut it well for the lands sake
i never heard the beat of that in all my days
dont tell me there aint anything in dreams any more
sereny harper shall know of this before im an hour older
id like to see her get around this with her rubbage bout superstition
go on tom oh its all getting just as bright as day now
next you said i warnt bad only mischeevous and harumscarum and not any more responsible thanthani think it was a colt or something and so it was
well goodness gracious
go on tom and then you began to cry so i did
so i did
not the first time neither
and then then mrs harper she began to cry and said joe was just the same and she wished she hadnt whipped him for taking cream when shed throwed it out her own self tom
the sperrit was upon you
you was a prophesyingthats what you was doing
land alive go on tom then sid he saidhe said i dont think i said anything said sid
yes you did sid said mary
shut your heads and let tom go on
what did he say tom he saidi think he said he hoped i was better off where i was gone to but if id been better sometimes there dyou hear that
it was his very words and you shut him up sharp i lay i did
there must a been an angel there
there was an angel there somewheres and mrs harper told about joe scaring her with a firecracker and you told about peter and the painkiller just as true as i live and then there was a whole lot of talk bout dragging the river for us and bout having the funeral sunday and then you and old miss harper hugged and cried and she went it happened just so
it happened just so as sure as im asitting in these very tracks
tom you couldnt told it more like if youd a seen it
and then what
go on tom then i thought you prayed for meand i could see you and hear every word you said
and you went to bed and i was so sorry that i took and wrote on a piece of sycamore bark we aint deadwe are only off being pirates and put it on the table by the candle and then you looked so good laying there asleep that i thought i went and leaned over and kissed you on the lips did you tom did you
i just forgive you everything for that and she seized the boy in a crushing embrace that made him feel like the guiltiest of villains
it was very kind even though it was only adream sid soliloquized just audibly
shut up sid
a body does just the same in a dream as hed do if he was awake
heres a big milum apple ive been saving for you tom if you was ever found againnow go long to school
im thankful to the good god and father of us all ive got you back thats longsuffering and merciful to them that believe on him and keep his word though goodness knows im unworthy of it but if only the worthy ones got his blessings and had his hand to help them over the rough places theres few enough would smile here or ever enter into his rest when the long night comes
go long sid mary tomtake yourselves offyouve hendered me long enough the children left for school and the old lady to call on mrs harper and vanquish her realism with toms marvellous dream
sid had better judgment than to utter the thought that was in his mind as he left the house
it was this pretty thinas long a dream as that without any mistakes in it what a hero tom was become now
he did not go skipping and prancing but moved with a dignified swagger as became a pirate who felt that the public eye was on him
and indeed it was he tried not to seem to see the looks or hear the remarks as he passed along but they were food and drink to him
smaller boys than himself flocked at his heels as proud to be seen with him and tolerated by him as if he had been the drummer at the head of a procession or the elephant leading a menagerie into town
boys of his own size pretended not to know he had been away at all but they were consuming with envy nevertheless
they would have given anything to have that swarthy suntanned skin of his and his glittering notoriety and tom would not have parted with either for a circus
at school the children made so much of him and of joe and delivered such eloquent admiration from their eyes that the two heroes were not long in becoming insufferably stuckup they began to tell their adventures to hungry listenersbut they only began it was not a thing likely to have an end with imaginations like theirs to furnish material
and finally when they got out their pipes and went serenely puffing around the very summit of glory was reached
tom decided that he could be independent of becky thatcher now
glory was sufficient
he would live for glory
now that he was distinguished maybe she would be wanting to make up well let hershe should see that he could be as indifferent as some other people
presently she arrived
tom pretended not to see her
he moved away and joined a group of boys and girls and began to talk
soon he observed that she was tripping gayly back and forth with flushed face and dancing eyes pretending to be busy chasing schoolmates and screaming with laughter when she made a capture but he noticed that she always made her captures in his vicinity and that she seemed to cast a conscious eye in his direction at such times too
it gratified all the vicious vanity that was in him and so instead of winning him it only set him up the more and made him the more diligent to avoid betraying that he knew she was about
presently she gave over skylarking and moved irresolutely about sighing once or twice and glancing furtively and wistfully toward tom
then she observed that now tom was talking more particularly to amy lawrence than to any one else
she felt a sharp pang and grew disturbed and uneasy at once
she tried to go away but her feet were treacherous and carried her to the group instead
she said to a girl almost at toms elbowwith sham vivacity why mary austin
you bad girl why didnt you come to sundayschool i did comedidnt you see me why no
did you
where did you sit i was in miss peters class where i always go
i saw you did you
why its funny i didnt see you
i wanted to tell you about the picnic oh thats jolly
whos going to give it my mas going to let me have one oh goody i hope shell let me come well she will
the picnics for me
shell let anybody come that i want and i want you thats ever so nice
when is it going to be by and by
maybe about vacation oh wont it be fun
you going to have all the girls and boys yes every one thats friends to meor wants to be and she glanced ever so furtively at tom but he talked right along to amy lawrence about the terrible storm on the island and how the lightning tore the great sycamore tree all to flinders while he was standing within three feet of it oh may i come said grace miller
yes and me said sally rogers
yes and me too said susy harper
and joe yes and so on with clapping of joyful hands till all the group had begged for invitations but tom and amy
then tom turned coolly away still talking and took amy with him
beckys lips trembled and the tears came to her eyes she hid these signs with a forced gayety and went on chattering but the life had gone out of the picnic now and out of everything else she got away as soon as she could and hid herself and had what her sex call a good cry then she sat moody with wounded pride till the bell rang
she roused up now with a vindictive cast in her eye and gave her plaited tails a shake and said she knew what shed do
at recess tom continued his flirtation with amy with jubilant selfsatisfaction
and he kept drifting about to find becky and lacerate her with the performance
at last he spied her but there was a sudden falling of his mercury
she was sitting cosily on a little bench behind the schoolhouse looking at a picturebook with alfred templeand so absorbed were they and their heads so close together over the book that they did not seem to be conscious of anything in the world besides
jealousy ran redhot through toms veins
he began to hate himself for throwing away the chance becky had offered for a reconciliation
he called himself a fool and all the hard names he could think of
he wanted to cry with vexation
amy chatted happily along as they walked for her heart was singing but toms tongue had lost its function
he did not hear what amy was saying and whenever she paused expectantly he could only stammer an awkward assent which was as often misplaced as otherwise
he kept drifting to the rear of the schoolhouse again and again to sear his eyeballs with the hateful spectacle there
he could not help it
and it maddened him to see as he thought he saw that becky thatcher never once suspected that he was even in the land of the living
but she did see nevertheless and she knew she was winning her fight too and was glad to see him suffer as she had suffered
amys happy prattle became intolerable
tom hinted at things he had to attend to things that must be done and time was fleeting
but in vainthe girl chirped on
tom thought oh hang her aint i ever going to get rid of her at last he must be attending to those thingsand she said artlessly that she would be around when school let out
and he hastened away hating her for it
any other boy tom thought grating his teeth
any boy in the whole town but that saint louis smarty that thinks he dresses so fine and is aristocracy
oh all right i licked you the first day you ever saw this town mister and ill lick you again
you just wait till i catch you out
ill just take and and he went through the motions of thrashing an imaginary boypummelling the air and kicking and gouging
oh you do do you
you holler nough do you
now then let that learn you and so the imaginary flogging was finished to his satisfaction
tom fled home at noon
his conscience could not endure any more of amys grateful happiness and his jealousy could bear no more of the other distress
becky resumed her picture inspections with alfred but as the minutes dragged along and no tom came to suffer her triumph began to cloud and she lost interest gravity and absentmindedness followed and then melancholy two or three times she pricked up her ear at a footstep but it was a false hope no tom came
at last she grew entirely miserable and wished she hadnt carried it so far
when poor alfred seeing that he was losing her he did not know how kept exclaiming oh heres a jolly one
look at this she lost patience at last and said oh dont bother me
i dont care for them and burst into tears and got up and walked away
alfred dropped alongside and was going to try to comfort her but she said go away and leave me alone cant you
i hate you so the boy halted wondering what he could have donefor she had said she would look at pictures all through the nooningand she walked on crying
then alfred went musing into the deserted schoolhouse
he was humiliated and angry
he easily guessed his way to the truththe girl had simply made a convenience of him to vent her spite upon tom sawyer
he was far from hating tom the less when this thought occurred to him
he wished there was some way to get that boy into trouble without much risk to himself
toms spellingbook fell under his eye
here was his opportunity
he gratefully opened to the lesson for the afternoon and poured ink upon the page
becky glancing in at a window behind him at the moment saw the act and moved on without discovering herself
she started homeward now intending to find tom and tell him tom would be thankful and their troubles would be healed
before she was half way home however she had changed her mind
the thought of toms treatment of her when she was talking about her picnic came scorching back and filled her with shame
she resolved to let him get whipped on the damaged spellingbooks account and to hate him forever into the bargain
tom arrived at home in a dreary mood and the first thing his aunt said to him showed him that he had brought his sorrows to an unpromising market tom ive a notion to skin you alive auntie what have i done well youve done enough
here i go over to sereny harper like an old softy expecting im going to make her believe all that rubbage about that dream when lo and behold you shed found out from joe that you was over here and heard all the talk we had that night
tom i dont know what is to become of a boy that will act like that
it makes me feel so bad to think you could let me go to sereny harper and make such a fool of myself and never say a word this was a new aspect of the thing
his smartness of the morning had seemed to tom a good joke before and very ingenious
it merely looked mean and shabby now
he hung his head and could not think of anything to say for a moment
then he said auntie i wish i hadnt done itbut i didnt think oh child you never think
you never think of anything but your own selfishness
you could think to come all the way over here from jacksons island in the night to laugh at our troubles and you could think to fool me with a lie about a dream but you couldnt ever think to pity us and save us from sorrow auntie i know now it was mean but i didnt mean to be mean
i didnt honest
and besides i didnt come over here to laugh at you that night what did you come for then it was to tell you not to be uneasy about us because we hadnt got drownded tom tom i would be the thankfullest soul in this world if i could believe you ever had as good a thought as that but you know you never didand i know it tom indeed and deed i did auntiei wish i may never stir if i didnt oh tom dont liedont do it
it only makes things a hundred times worse it aint a lie auntie its the truth
i wanted to keep you from grievingthat was all that made me come id give the whole world to believe thatit would cover up a power of sins tom
id most be glad youd run off and acted so bad
but it aint reasonable because why didnt you tell me child why you see when you got to talking about the funeral i just got all full of the idea of our coming and hiding in the church and i couldnt somehow bear to spoil it
so i just put the bark back in my pocket and kept mum what bark the bark i had wrote on to tell you wed gone pirating
i wish now youd waked up when i kissed youi do honest the hard lines in his aunts face relaxed and a sudden tenderness dawned in her eyes
did you kiss me tom why yes i did are you sure you did tom why yes i did auntiecertain sure what did you kiss me for tom because i loved you so and you laid there moaning and i was so sorry the words sounded like truth
the old lady could not hide a tremor in her voice when she said kiss me again tomand be off with you to school now and dont bother me any more the moment he was gone she ran to a closet and got out the ruin of a jacket which tom had gone pirating in
then she stopped with it in her hand and said to herself no i dont dare
poor boy i reckon hes lied about itbut its a blessed blessed lie theres such a comfort come from it
i hope the lordi know the lord will forgive him because it was such goodheartedness in him to tell it
but i dont want to find out its a lie
i wont look she put the jacket away and stood by musing a minute
twice she put out her hand to take the garment again and twice she refrained
once more she ventured and this time she fortified herself with the thought its a good lieits a good liei wont let it grieve me so she sought the jacket pocket
a moment later she was reading toms piece of bark through flowing tears and saying i could forgive the boy now if hed committed a million sins there was something about aunt pollys manner when she kissed tom that swept away his low spirits and made him lighthearted and happy again
he started to school and had the luck of coming upon becky thatcher at the head of meadow lane
his mood always determined his manner
without a moments hesitation he ran to her and said i acted mighty mean today becky and im so sorry
i wont ever ever do that way again as long as ever i liveplease make up wont you the girl stopped and looked him scornfully in the face ill thank you to keep yourself to yourself mr thomas sawyer
ill never speak to you again she tossed her head and passed on
tom was so stunned that he had not even presence of mind enough to say who cares miss smarty until the right time to say it had gone by
so he said nothing
but he was in a fine rage nevertheless
he moped into the schoolyard wishing she were a boy and imagining how he would trounce her if she were
he presently encountered her and delivered a stinging remark as he passed
she hurled one in return and the angry breach was complete
it seemed to becky in her hot resentment that she could hardly wait for school to take in she was so impatient to see tom flogged for the injured spellingbook
if she had had any lingering notion of exposing alfred temple toms offensive fling had driven it entirely away
poor girl she did not know how fast she was nearing trouble herself
the master mr dobbins had reached middle age with an unsatisfied ambition
the darling of his desires was to be a doctor but poverty had decreed that he should be nothing higher than a village schoolmaster
every day he took a mysterious book out of his desk and absorbed himself in it at times when no classes were reciting
he kept that book under lock and key
there was not an urchin in school but was perishing to have a glimpse of it but the chance never came
every boy and girl had a theory about the nature of that book but no two theories were alike and there was no way of getting at the facts in the case
now as becky was passing by the desk which stood near the door she noticed that the key was in the lock
it was a precious moment
she glanced around found herself alone and the next instant she had the book in her hands
the titlepageprofessor somebodys anatomycarried no information to her mind so she began to turn the leaves
she came at once upon a handsomely engraved and colored frontispiecea human figure stark naked
at that moment a shadow fell on the page and tom sawyer stepped in at the door and caught a glimpse of the picture
becky snatched at the book to close it and had the hard luck to tear the pictured page half down the middle
she thrust the volume into the desk turned the key and burst out crying with shame and vexation
tom sawyer you are just as mean as you can be to sneak up on a person and look at what theyre looking at how could i know you was looking at anything you ought to be ashamed of yourself tom sawyer you know youre going to tell on me and oh what shall i do what shall i do
ill be whipped and i never was whipped in school then she stamped her little foot and said be so mean if you want to
i know something thats going to happen
you just wait and youll see
hateful hateful hatefuland she flung out of the house with a new explosion of crying
tom stood still rather flustered by this onslaught
presently he said to himself what a curious kind of a fool a girl is
never been licked in school
shucks
whats a licking
thats just like a girltheyre so thinskinned and chickenhearted
well of course i aint going to tell old dobbins on this little fool because theres other ways of getting even on her that aint so mean but what of it
old dobbins will ask who it was tore his book
nobodyll answer
then hell do just the way he always doesask first one and then tother and when he comes to the right girl hell know it without any telling
girls faces always tell on them
they aint got any backbone
shell get licked
well its a kind of a tight place for becky thatcher because there aint any way out of it tom conned the thing a moment longer and then added all right though shed like to see me in just such a fixlet her sweat it out tom joined the mob of skylarking scholars outside
in a few moments the master arrived and school took in tom did not feel a strong interest in his studies
every time he stole a glance at the girls side of the room beckys face troubled him
considering all things he did not want to pity her and yet it was all he could do to help it
he could get up no exultation that was really worthy the name
presently the spellingbook discovery was made and toms mind was entirely full of his own matters for a while after that
becky roused up from her lethargy of distress and showed good interest in the proceedings
she did not expect that tom could get out of his trouble by denying that he spilt the ink on the book himself and she was right
the denial only seemed to make the thing worse for tom
becky supposed she would be glad of that and she tried to believe she was glad of it but she found she was not certain
when the worst came to the worst she had an impulse to get up and tell on alfred temple but she made an effort and forced herself to keep stillbecause said she to herself hell tell about me tearing the picture sure
i wouldnt say a word not to save his life tom took his whipping and went back to his seat not at all brokenhearted for he thought it was possible that he had unknowingly upset the ink on the spellingbook himself in some skylarking bouthe had denied it for forms sake and because it was custom and had stuck to the denial from principle
a whole hour drifted by the master sat nodding in his throne the air was drowsy with the hum of study
by and by mr dobbins straightened himself up yawned then unlocked his desk and reached for his book but seemed undecided whether to take it out or leave it
most of the pupils glanced up languidly but there were two among them that watched his movements with intent eyes
mr dobbins fingered his book absently for a while then took it out and settled himself in his chair to read
tom shot a glance at becky
he had seen a hunted and helpless rabbit look as she did with a gun levelled at its head
instantly he forgot his quarrel with her
quicksomething must be done
done in a flash too
but the very imminence of the emergency paralyzed his invention
goodhe had an inspiration
he would run and snatch the book spring through the door and fly
but his resolution shook for one little instant and the chance was lostthe master opened the volume
if tom only had the wasted opportunity back again
too late
there was no help for becky now he said
the next moment the master faced the school
every eye sank under his gaze
there was that in it which smote even the innocent with fear
there was silence while one might count tenthe master was gathering his wrath
then he spoke who tore this book there was not a sound
one could have heard a pin drop
the stillness continued the master searched face after face for signs of guilt
benjamin rogers did you tear this book a denial
another pause
joseph harper did you another denial
toms uneasiness grew more and more intense under the slow torture of these proceedings
the master scanned the ranks of boysconsidered a while then turned to the girls amy lawrence a shake of the head
gracie miller the same sign
susan harper did you do this another negative
the next girl was becky thatcher
tom was trembling from head to foot with excitement and a sense of the hopelessness of the situation
rebecca thatcher tom glanced at her faceit was white with terrordid you tearno look me in the face her hands rose in appealdid you tear this book a thought shot like lightning through toms brain
he sprang to his feet and shoutedi done it the school stared in perplexity at this incredible folly
tom stood a moment to gather his dismembered faculties and when he stepped forward to go to his punishment the surprise the gratitude the adoration that shone upon him out of poor beckys eyes seemed pay enough for a hundred floggings
inspired by the splendor of his own act he took without an outcry the most merciless flaying that even mr dobbins had ever administered and also received with indifference the added cruelty of a command to remain two hours after school should be dismissedfor he knew who would wait for him outside till his captivity was done and not count the tedious time as loss either
tom went to bed that night planning vengeance against alfred temple for with shame and repentance becky had told him all not forgetting her own treachery but even the longing for vengeance had to give way soon to pleasanter musings and he fell asleep at last with beckys latest words lingering dreamily in his ear tom how could you be so noble vacation was approaching
the schoolmaster always severe grew severer and more exacting than ever for he wanted the school to make a good showing on examination day
his rod and his ferule were seldom idle nowat least among the smaller pupils
only the biggest boys and young ladies of eighteen and twenty escaped lashing
mr dobbins lashings were very vigorous ones too for although he carried under his wig a perfectly bald and shiny head he had only reached middle age and there was no sign of feebleness in his muscle
as the great day approached all the tyranny that was in him came to the surface he seemed to take a vindictive pleasure in punishing the least shortcomings
the consequence was that the smaller boys spent their days in terror and suffering and their nights in plotting revenge
they threw away no opportunity to do the master a mischief
but he kept ahead all the time
the retribution that followed every vengeful success was so sweeping and majestic that the boys always retired from the field badly worsted
at last they conspired together and hit upon a plan that promised a dazzling victory
they swore in the signpainters boy told him the scheme and asked his help
he had his own reasons for being delighted for the master boarded in his fathers family and had given the boy ample cause to hate him
the masters wife would go on a visit to the country in a few days and there would be nothing to interfere with the plan the master always prepared himself for great occasions by getting pretty well fuddled and the signpainters boy said that when the dominie had reached the proper condition on examination evening he would manage the thing while he napped in his chair then he would have him awakened at the right time and hurried away to school
in the fulness of time the interesting occasion arrived
at eight in the evening the schoolhouse was brilliantly lighted and adorned with wreaths and festoons of foliage and flowers
the master sat throned in his great chair upon a raised platform with his blackboard behind him
he was looking tolerably mellow
three rows of benches on each side and six rows in front of him were occupied by the dignitaries of the town and by the parents of the pupils
to his left back of the rows of citizens was a spacious temporary platform upon which were seated the scholars who were to take part in the exercises of the evening rows of small boys washed and dressed to an intolerable state of discomfort rows of gawky big boys snowbanks of girls and young ladies clad in lawn and muslin and conspicuously conscious of their bare arms their grandmothers ancient trinkets their bits of pink and blue ribbon and the flowers in their hair
all the rest of the house was filled with nonparticipating scholars
the exercises began
a very little boy stood up and sheepishly recited youd scarce expect one of my age to speak in public on the stage etcaccompanying himself with the painfully exact and spasmodic gestures which a machine might have usedsupposing the machine to be a trifle out of order
but he got through safely though cruelly scared and got a fine round of applause when he made his manufactured bow and retired
a little shamefaced girl lisped mary had a little lamb etc performed a compassioninspiring curtsy got her meed of applause and sat down flushed and happy
tom sawyer stepped forward with conceited confidence and soared into the unquenchable and indestructible give me liberty or give me death speech with fine fury and frantic gesticulation and broke down in the middle of it
a ghastly stagefright seized him his legs quaked under him and he was like to choke
true he had the manifest sympathy of the house but he had the houses silence too which was even worse than its sympathy
the master frowned and this completed the disaster
tom struggled awhile and then retired utterly defeated
there was a weak attempt at applause but it died early
the boy stood on the burning deck followed also the assyrian came down and other declamatory gems
then there were reading exercises and a spelling fight
the meagre latin class recited with honor
the prime feature of the evening was in order noworiginal compositions by the young ladies
each in her turn stepped forward to the edge of the platform cleared her throat held up her manuscript tied with dainty ribbon and proceeded to read with labored attention to expression and punctuation
the themes were the same that had been illuminated upon similar occasions by their mothers before them their grandmothers and doubtless all their ancestors in the female line clear back to the crusades
friendship was one memories of other days religion in history dream land the advantages of culture forms of political government compared and contrasted melancholy filial love heart longings etc etc
a prevalent feature in these compositions was a nursed and petted melancholy another was a wasteful and opulent gush of fine language another was a tendency to lug in by the ears particularly prized words and phrases until they were worn entirely out and a peculiarity that conspicuously marked and marred them was the inveterate and intolerable sermon that wagged its crippled tail at the end of each and every one of them
no matter what the subject might be a brainracking effort was made to squirm it into some aspect or other that the moral and religious mind could contemplate with edification
the glaring insincerity of these sermons was not sufficient to compass the banishment of the fashion from the schools and it is not sufficient today it never will be sufficient while the world stands perhaps
there is no school in all our land where the young ladies do not feel obliged to close their compositions with a sermon and you will find that the sermon of the most frivolous and the least religious girl in the school is always the longest and the most relentlessly pious
but enough of this
homely truth is unpalatable
let us return to the examination the first composition that was read was one entitled is this then life perhaps the reader can endure an extract from it in the common walks of life with what delightful emotions does the youthful mind look forward to some anticipated scene of festivity
imagination is busy sketching rosetinted pictures of joy
in fancy the voluptuous votary of fashion sees herself amid the festive throng the observed of all observers her graceful form arrayed in snowy robes is whirling through the mazes of the joyous dance her eye is brightest her step is lightest in the gay assembly
in such delicious fancies time quickly glides by and the welcome hour arrives for her entrance into the elysian world of which she has had such bright dreams
how fairylike does everything appear to her enchanted vision
each new scene is more charming than the last
but after a while she finds that beneath this goodly exterior all is vanity the flattery which once charmed her soul now grates harshly upon her ear the ballroom has lost its charms and with wasted health and imbittered heart she turns away with the conviction that earthly pleasures cannot satisfy the longings of the soul and so forth and so on
there was a buzz of gratification from time to time during the reading accompanied by whispered ejaculations of how sweet how eloquent so true etc and after the thing had closed with a peculiarly afflicting sermon the applause was enthusiastic
then arose a slim melancholy girl whose face had the interesting paleness that comes of pills and indigestion and read a poem two stanzas of it will do a missouri maidens farewell to alabama alabama goodbye
i love thee well
but yet for a while do i leave thee now
sad yes sad thoughts of thee my heart doth swell and burning recollections throng my brow
for i have wandered through thy flowery woods have roamed and read near tallapoosas stream have listened to tallassees warring floods and wooed on coosas side auroras beam
yet shame i not to bear an oerfull heart nor blush to turn behind my tearful eyes tis from no stranger land i now must part tis to no strangers left i yield these sighs
welcome and home were mine within this state whose vales i leavewhose spires fade fast from me and cold must be mine eyes and heart and tete when dear alabama
they turn cold on thee there were very few there who knew what tete meant but the poem was very satisfactory nevertheless
next appeared a darkcomplexioned blackeyed blackhaired young lady who paused an impressive moment assumed a tragic expression and began to read in a measured solemn tone a vision dark and tempestuous was night
around the throne on high not a single star quivered but the deep intonations of the heavy thunder constantly vibrated upon the ear whilst the terrific lightning revelled in angry mood through the cloudy chambers of heaven seeming to scorn the power exerted over its terror by the illustrious franklin
even the boisterous winds unanimously came forth from their mystic homes and blustered about as if to enhance by their aid the wildness of the scene
at such a time so dark so dreary for human sympathy my very spirit sighed but instead thereof my dearest friend my counsellor my comforter and guidemy joy in grief my second bliss in joy came to my side
she moved like one of those bright beings pictured in the sunny walks of fancys eden by the romantic and young a queen of beauty unadorned save by her own transcendent loveliness
so soft was her step it failed to make even a sound and but for the magical thrill imparted by her genial touch as other unobtrusive beauties she would have glided away unperceivedunsought
a strange sadness rested upon her features like icy tears upon the robe of december as she pointed to the contending elements without and bade me contemplate the two beings presented this nightmare occupied some ten pages of manuscript and wound up with a sermon so destructive of all hope to nonpresbyterians that it took the first prize
this composition was considered to be the very finest effort of the evening
the mayor of the village in delivering the prize to the author of it made a warm speech in which he said that it was by far the most eloquent thing he had ever listened to and that daniel webster himself might well be proud of it
it may be remarked in passing that the number of compositions in which the word beauteous was overfondled and human experience referred to as lifes page was up to the usual average
now the master mellow almost to the verge of geniality put his chair aside turned his back to the audience and began to draw a map of america on the blackboard to exercise the geography class upon
but he made a sad business of it with his unsteady hand and a smothered titter rippled over the house
he knew what the matter was and set himself to right it
he sponged out lines and remade them but he only distorted them more than ever and the tittering was more pronounced
he threw his entire attention upon his work now as if determined not to be put down by the mirth
he felt that all eyes were fastened upon him he imagined he was succeeding and yet the tittering continued it even manifestly increased
and well it might
there was a garret above pierced with a scuttle over his head and down through this scuttle came a cat suspended around the haunches by a string she had a rag tied about her head and jaws to keep her from mewing as she slowly descended she curved upward and clawed at the string she swung downward and clawed at the intangible air
the tittering rose higher and higherthe cat was within six inches of the absorbed teachers headdown down a little lower and she grabbed his wig with her desperate claws clung to it and was snatched up into the garret in an instant with her trophy still in her possession
and how the light did blaze abroad from the masters bald patefor the signpainters boy had gilded it
that broke up the meeting
the boys were avenged
vacation had come
notethe pretended compositions quoted in this chapter are taken without alteration from a volume entitled prose and poetry by a western ladybut they are exactly and precisely after the schoolgirl pattern and hence are much happier than any mere imitations could be
tom joined the new order of cadets of temperance being attracted by the showy character of their regalia he promised to abstain from smoking chewing and profanity as long as he remained a member
now he found out a new thingnamely that to promise not to do a thing is the surest way in the world to make a body want to go and do that very thing
tom soon found himself tormented with a desire to drink and swear the desire grew to be so intense that nothing but the hope of a chance to display himself in his red sash kept him from withdrawing from the order
fourth of july was coming but he soon gave that upgave it up before he had worn his shackles over fortyeight hoursand fixed his hopes upon old judge frazer justice of the peace who was apparently on his deathbed and would have a big public funeral since he was so high an official
during three days tom was deeply concerned about the judges condition and hungry for news of it
sometimes his hopes ran highso high that he would venture to get out his regalia and practise before the lookingglass
but the judge had a most discouraging way of fluctuating
at last he was pronounced upon the mendand then convalescent
tom was disgusted and felt a sense of injury too
he handed in his resignation at onceand that night the judge suffered a relapse and died
tom resolved that he would never trust a man like that again
the funeral was a fine thing
the cadets paraded in a style calculated to kill the late member with envy
tom was a free boy again howeverthere was something in that
he could drink and swear nowbut found to his surprise that he did not want to
the simple fact that he could took the desire away and the charm of it
tom presently wondered to find that his coveted vacation was beginning to hang a little heavily on his hands
he attempted a diarybut nothing happened during three days and so he abandoned it
the first of all the negro minstrel shows came to town and made a sensation
tom and joe harper got up a band of performers and were happy for two days
even the glorious fourth was in some sense a failure for it rained hard there was no procession in consequence and the greatest man in the world as tom supposed mr benton an actual united states senator proved an overwhelming disappointmentfor he was not twentyfive feet high nor even anywhere in the neighborhood of it
a circus came
the boys played circus for three days afterward in tents made of rag carpetingadmission three pins for boys two for girlsand then circusing was abandoned
a phrenologist and a mesmerizer cameand went again and left the village duller and drearier than ever
there were some boysandgirls parties but they were so few and so delightful that they only made the aching voids between ache the harder
becky thatcher was gone to her constantinople home to stay with her parents during vacationso there was no bright side to life anywhere
the dreadful secret of the murder was a chronic misery
it was a very cancer for permanency and pain
then came the measles
during two long weeks tom lay a prisoner dead to the world and its happenings
he was very ill he was interested in nothing
when he got upon his feet at last and moved feebly downtown a melancholy change had come over everything and every creature
there had been a revival and everybody had got religion not only the adults but even the boys and girls
tom went about hoping against hope for the sight of one blessed sinful face but disappointment crossed him everywhere
he found joe harper studying a testament and turned sadly away from the depressing spectacle
he sought ben rogers and found him visiting the poor with a basket of tracts
he hunted up jim hollis who called his attention to the precious blessing of his late measles as a warning
every boy he encountered added another ton to his depression and when in desperation he flew for refuge at last to the bosom of huckleberry finn and was received with a scriptural quotation his heart broke and he crept home and to bed realizing that he alone of all the town was lost forever and forever
and that night there came on a terrific storm with driving rain awful claps of thunder and blinding sheets of lightning
he covered his head with the bedclothes and waited in a horror of suspense for his doom for he had not the shadow of a doubt that all this hubbub was about him
he believed he had taxed the forbearance of the powers above to the extremity of endurance and that this was the result
it might have seemed to him a waste of pomp and ammunition to kill a bug with a battery of artillery but there seemed nothing incongruous about the getting up such an expensive thunderstorm as this to knock the turf from under an insect like himself
by and by the tempest spent itself and died without accomplishing its object
the boys first impulse was to be grateful and reform
his second was to waitfor there might not be any more storms
the next day the doctors were back tom had relapsed
the three weeks he spent on his back this time seemed an entire age
when he got abroad at last he was hardly grateful that he had been spared remembering how lonely was his estate how companionless and forlorn he was
he drifted listlessly down the street and found jim hollis acting as judge in a juvenile court that was trying a cat for murder in the presence of her victim a bird
he found joe harper and huck finn up an alley eating a stolen melon
poor lads
theylike tomhad suffered a relapse
at last the sleepy atmosphere was stirredand vigorously the murder trial came on in the court
it became the absorbing topic of village talk immediately
tom could not get away from it
every reference to the murder sent a shudder to his heart for his troubled conscience and fears almost persuaded him that these remarks were put forth in his hearing as feelers he did not see how he could be suspected of knowing anything about the murder but still he could not be comfortable in the midst of this gossip
it kept him in a cold shiver all the time
he took huck to a lonely place to have a talk with him
it would be some relief to unseal his tongue for a little while to divide his burden of distress with another sufferer
moreover he wanted to assure himself that huck had remained discreet
huck have you ever told anybody aboutthat bout what you know what ohcourse i havent never a word never a solitary word so help me
what makes you ask well i was afeard why tom sawyer we wouldnt be alive two days if that got found out
you know that tom felt more comfortable
after a pause huck they couldnt anybody get you to tell could they get me to tell
why if i wanted that halfbreed devil to drownd me they could get me to tell
they aint no different way well thats all right then
i reckon were safe as long as we keep mum
but lets swear again anyway
its more surer im agreed so they swore again with dread solemnities
what is the talk around huck
ive heard a power of it talk
well its just muff potter muff potter muff potter all the time
it keeps me in a sweat constant sos i want to hide somers thats just the same way they go on round me
i reckon hes a goner
dont you feel sorry for him sometimes most alwaysmost always
he aint no account but then he haint ever done anything to hurt anybody
just fishes a little to get money to get drunk onand loafs around considerable but lord we all do thatleastways most of uspreachers and such like
but hes kind of goodhe give me half a fish once when there warnt enough for two and lots of times hes kind of stood by me when i was out of luck well hes mended kites for me huck and knitted hooks on to my line
i wish we could get him out of there my
we couldnt get him out tom
and besides twouldnt do any good theyd ketch him again yesso they would
but i hate to hear em abuse him so like the dickens when he never donethat i do too tom
lord i hear em say hes the bloodiest looking villain in this country and they wonder he wasnt ever hung before yes they talk like that all the time
ive heard em say that if he was to get free theyd lynch him and theyd do it too the boys had a long talk but it brought them little comfort
as the twilight drew on they found themselves hanging about the neighborhood of the little isolated jail perhaps with an undefined hope that something would happen that might clear away their difficulties
but nothing happened there seemed to be no angels or fairies interested in this luckless captive
the boys did as they had often done beforewent to the cell grating and gave potter some tobacco and matches
he was on the ground floor and there were no guards
his gratitude for their gifts had always smote their consciences beforeit cut deeper than ever this time
they felt cowardly and treacherous to the last degree when potter said youve been mighty good to me boysbettern anybody else in this town
and i dont forget it i dont
often i says to myself says i i used to mend all the boys kites and things and show em where the good fishin places was and befriend em what i could and now theyve all forgot old muff when hes in trouble but tom dont and huck dontthey dont forget him says i and i dont forget them well boys i done an awful thingdrunk and crazy at the timethats the only way i account for itand now i got to swing for it and its right
right and best too i reckonhope so anyway
well we wont talk about that
i dont want to make you feel bad youve befriended me
but what i want to say is dont you ever get drunkthen you wont ever get here
stand a litter furder westsothats it its a prime comfort to see faces thats friendly when a bodys in such a muck of trouble and there dont none come here but yourn
good friendly facesgood friendly faces
git up on one anothers backs and let me touch em
thats it
shake handsyournll come through the bars but mines too big
little hands and weakbut theyve helped muff potter a power and theyd help him more if they could tom went home miserable and his dreams that night were full of horrors
the next day and the day after he hung about the courtroom drawn by an almost irresistible impulse to go in but forcing himself to stay out
huck was having the same experience
they studiously avoided each other
each wandered away from time to time but the same dismal fascination always brought them back presently
tom kept his ears open when idlers sauntered out of the courtroom but invariably heard distressing newsthe toils were closing more and more relentlessly around poor potter
at the end of the second day the village talk was to the effect that injun joes evidence stood firm and unshaken and that there was not the slightest question as to what the jurys verdict would be
tom was out late that night and came to bed through the window
he was in a tremendous state of excitement
it was hours before he got to sleep
all the village flocked to the courthouse the next morning for this was to be the great day
both sexes were about equally represented in the packed audience
after a long wait the jury filed in and took their places shortly afterward potter pale and haggard timid and hopeless was brought in with chains upon him and seated where all the curious eyes could stare at him no less conspicuous was injun joe stolid as ever
there was another pause and then the judge arrived and the sheriff proclaimed the opening of the court
the usual whisperings among the lawyers and gathering together of papers followed
these details and accompanying delays worked up an atmosphere of preparation that was as impressive as it was fascinating
now a witness was called who testified that he found muff potter washing in the brook at an early hour of the morning that the murder was discovered and that he immediately sneaked away
after some further questioning counsel for the prosecution said take the witness the prisoner raised his eyes for a moment but dropped them again when his own counsel said i have no questions to ask him the next witness proved the finding of the knife near the corpse
counsel for the prosecution said take the witness i have no questions to ask him potters lawyer replied
a third witness swore he had often seen the knife in potters possession
take the witness counsel for potter declined to question him
the faces of the audience began to betray annoyance
did this attorney mean to throw away his clients life without an effort
several witnesses deposed concerning potters guilty behavior when brought to the scene of the murder
they were allowed to leave the stand without being crossquestioned
every detail of the damaging circumstances that occurred in the graveyard upon that morning which all present remembered so well was brought out by credible witnesses but none of them were crossexamined by potters lawyer
the perplexity and dissatisfaction of the house expressed itself in murmurs and provoked a reproof from the bench
counsel for the prosecution now said by the oaths of citizens whose simple word is above suspicion we have fastened this awful crime beyond all possibility of question upon the unhappy prisoner at the bar
we rest our case here a groan escaped from poor potter and he put his face in his hands and rocked his body softly to and fro while a painful silence reigned in the courtroom
many men were moved and many womens compassion testified itself in tears
counsel for the defence rose and said your honor in our remarks at the opening of this trial we foreshadowed our purpose to prove that our client did this fearful deed while under the influence of a blind and irresponsible delirium produced by drink
we have changed our mind
we shall not offer that plea then to the clerk call thomas sawyer a puzzled amazement awoke in every face in the house not even excepting potters
every eye fastened itself with wondering interest upon tom as he rose and took his place upon the stand
the boy looked wild enough for he was badly scared
the oath was administered
thomas sawyer where were you on the seventeenth of june about the hour of midnight tom glanced at injun joes iron face and his tongue failed him
the audience listened breathless but the words refused to come
after a few moments however the boy got a little of his strength back and managed to put enough of it into his voice to make part of the house hear in the graveyard a little bit louder please
dont be afraid
you were in the graveyard a contemptuous smile flitted across injun joes face
were you anywhere near horse williams grave yes sir speak upjust a trifle louder
how near were you near as i am to you were you hidden or not i was hid where behind the elms thats on the edge of the grave injun joe gave a barely perceptible start
any one with you yes sir
i went there with waitwait a moment
never mind mentioning your companions name
we will produce him at the proper time
did you carry anything there with you tom hesitated and looked confused
speak out my boydont be diffident
the truth is always respectable
what did you take there only aadead cat there was a ripple of mirth which the court checked
we will produce the skeleton of that cat
now my boy tell us everything that occurredtell it in your own waydont skip anything and dont be afraid tom beganhesitatingly at first but as he warmed to his subject his words flowed more and more easily in a little while every sound ceased but his own voice every eye fixed itself upon him with parted lips and bated breath the audience hung upon his words taking no note of time rapt in the ghastly fascinations of the tale
the strain upon pent emotion reached its climax when the boy said and as the doctor fetched the board around and muff potter fell injun joe jumped with the knife and crash
quick as lightning the halfbreed sprang for a window tore his way through all opposers and was gone
tom was a glittering hero once morethe pet of the old the envy of the young
his name even went into immortal print for the village paper magnified him
there were some that believed he would be president yet if he escaped hanging
as usual the fickle unreasoning world took muff potter to its bosom and fondled him as lavishly as it had abused him before
but that sort of conduct is to the worlds credit therefore it is not well to find fault with it
toms days were days of splendor and exultation to him but his nights were seasons of horror
injun joe infested all his dreams and always with doom in his eye
hardly any temptation could persuade the boy to stir abroad after nightfall
poor huck was in the same state of wretchedness and terror for tom had told the whole story to the lawyer the night before the great day of the trial and huck was sore afraid that his share in the business might leak out yet notwithstanding injun joes flight had saved him the suffering of testifying in court
the poor fellow had got the attorney to promise secrecy but what of that
since toms harassed conscience had managed to drive him to the lawyers house by night and wring a dread tale from lips that had been sealed with the dismalest and most formidable of oaths hucks confidence in the human race was wellnigh obliterated
daily muff potters gratitude made tom glad he had spoken but nightly he wished he had sealed up his tongue
half the time tom was afraid injun joe would never be captured the other half he was afraid he would be
he felt sure he never could draw a safe breath again until that man was dead and he had seen the corpse
rewards had been offered the country had been scoured but no injun joe was found
one of those omniscient and aweinspiring marvels a detective came up from st louis moused around shook his head looked wise and made that sort of astounding success which members of that craft usually achieve
that is to say he found a clew but you cant hang a clew for murder and so after that detective had got through and gone home tom felt just as insecure as he was before
the slow days drifted on and each left behind it a slightly lightened weight of apprehension
there comes a time in every rightlyconstructed boys life when he has a raging desire to go somewhere and dig for hidden treasure
this desire suddenly came upon tom one day
he sallied out to find joe harper but failed of success
next he sought ben rogers he had gone fishing
presently he stumbled upon huck finn the redhanded
huck would answer
tom took him to a private place and opened the matter to him confidentially
huck was willing
huck was always willing to take a hand in any enterprise that offered entertainment and required no capital for he had a troublesome superabundance of that sort of time which is not money
wherell we dig said huck
oh most anywhere why is it hid all around no indeed it aint
its hid in mighty particular places hucksometimes on islands sometimes in rotten chests under the end of a limb of an old dead tree just where the shadow falls at midnight but mostly under the floor in hanted houses who hides it why robbers of coursewhod you reckon
sundayschool suprintendents i dont know
if twas mine i wouldnt hide it id spend it and have a good time so would i
but robbers dont do that way
they always hide it and leave it there dont they come after it any more no they think they will but they generally forget the marks or else they die
anyway it lays there a long time and gets rusty and by and by somebody finds an old yellow paper that tells how to find the marksa paper thats got to be ciphered over about a week because its mostly signs and hyroglyphics hyrowhich hyroglyphicspictures and things you know that dont seem to mean anything have you got one of them papers tom no well then how you going to find the marks i dont want any marks
they always bury it under a hanted house or on an island or under a dead tree thats got one limb sticking out
well weve tried jacksons island a little and we can try it again some time and theres the old hanted house up the stillhouse branch and theres lots of deadlimb treesdead loads of em is it under all of them how you talk
no then how you going to know which one to go for go for all of em why tom itll take all summer well what of that
suppose you find a brass pot with a hundred dollars in it all rusty and gray or rotten chest full of dimonds
hows that hucks eyes glowed
thats bully
plenty bully enough for me
just you gimme the hundred dollars and i dont want no dimonds all right
but i bet you i aint going to throw off on dimonds
some of ems worth twenty dollars apiecethere aint any hardly buts worth six bits or a dollar no
is that so certnlyanybodyll tell you so
haint you ever seen one huck not as i remember oh kings have slathers of them well i don know no kings tom i reckon you dont
but if you was to go to europe youd see a raft of em hopping around do they hop hopyour granny
no well what did you say they did for shucks i only meant youd see emnot hopping of coursewhat do they want to hop forbut i mean youd just see emscattered around you know in a kind of a general way
like that old humpbacked richard richard
whats his other name he didnt have any other name
kings dont have any but a given name no but they dont well if they like it tom all right but i dont want to be a king and have only just a given name like a nigger
but saywhere you going to dig first well i dont know
spose we tackle that old deadlimb tree on the hill tother side of stillhouse branch im agreed so they got a crippled pick and a shovel and set out on their threemile tramp
they arrived hot and panting and threw themselves down in the shade of a neighboring elm to rest and have a smoke
i like this said tom
so do i say huck if we find a treasure here what you going to do with your share well ill have pie and a glass of soda every day and ill go to every circus that comes along
i bet ill have a gay time well aint you going to save any of it save it
what for why so as to have something to live on by and by oh that aint any use
pap would come back to thishyer town some day and get his claws on it if i didnt hurry up and i tell you hed clean it out pretty quick
what you going to do with yourn tom im going to buy a new drum and a surenough sword and a red necktie and a bull pup and get married married thats it tom youwhy you aint in your right mind waityoull see well thats the foolishest thing you could do
look at pap and my mother
fight
why they used to fight all the time
i remember mighty well that aint anything
the girl im going to marry wont fight tom i reckon theyre all alike
theyll all comb a body
now you better think bout this awhile
i tell you you better
whats the name of the gal it aint a gal at allits a girl its all the same i reckon some says gal some says girlboths right like enough
anyway whats her name tom ill tell you some timenot now all rightthatll do
only if you get married ill be more lonesomer than ever no you wont
youll come and live with me
now stir out of this and well go to digging they worked and sweated for half an hour
no result
they toiled another halfhour
still no result
huck said do they always bury it as deep as this sometimesnot always
not generally
i reckon we havent got the right place so they chose a new spot and began again
the labor dragged a little but still they made progress
they pegged away in silence for some time
finally huck leaned on his shovel swabbed the beaded drops from his brow with his sleeve and said where you going to dig next after we get this one i reckon maybe well tackle the old tree thats over yonder on cardiff hill back of the widows i reckon thatll be a good one
but wont the widow take it away from us tom
its on her land she take it away
maybe shed like to try it once
whoever finds one of these hid treasures it belongs to him
it dont make any difference whose land its on that was satisfactory
the work went on
by and by huck said blame it we must be in the wrong place again
what do you think it is mighty curious huck
i dont understand it
sometimes witches interfere
i reckon maybe thats whats the trouble now shucks
witches aint got no power in the daytime well thats so
i didnt think of that
oh i know what the matter is
what a blamed lot of fools we are
you got to find out where the shadow of the limb falls at midnight and thats where you dig then consound it weve fooled away all this work for nothing
now hang it all we got to come back in the night
its an awful long way
can you get out i bet i will
weve got to do it tonight too because if somebody sees these holes theyll know in a minute whats here and theyll go for it well ill come around and maow tonight all right
lets hide the tools in the bushes the boys were there that night about the appointed time
they sat in the shadow waiting
it was a lonely place and an hour made solemn by old traditions
spirits whispered in the rustling leaves ghosts lurked in the murky nooks the deep baying of a hound floated up out of the distance an owl answered with his sepulchral note
the boys were subdued by these solemnities and talked little
by and by they judged that twelve had come they marked where the shadow fell and began to dig
their hopes commenced to rise
their interest grew stronger and their industry kept pace with it
the hole deepened and still deepened but every time their hearts jumped to hear the pick strike upon something they only suffered a new disappointment
it was only a stone or a chunk
at last tom said it aint any use huck were wrong again well but we cant be wrong
we spotted the shadder to a dot i know it but then theres another thing whats that
why we only guessed at the time
like enough it was too late or too early huck dropped his shovel
thats it said he
thats the very trouble
we got to give this one up
we cant ever tell the right time and besides this kind of things too awful here this time of night with witches and ghosts afluttering around so
i feel as if somethings behind me all the time and im afeard to turn around becuz maybe theres others in front awaiting for a chance
i been creeping all over ever since i got here well ive been pretty much so too huck
they most always put in a dead man when they bury a treasure under a tree to look out for it lordy yes they do
ive always heard that tom i dont like to fool around much where theres dead people
a bodys bound to get into trouble with em sure i dont like to stir em up either
spose this one here was to stick his skull out and say something dont tom
its awful well it just is
huck i dont feel comfortable a bit say tom lets give this place up and try somewheres else all right i reckon we better whatll it be tom considered awhile and then said the hanted house
thats it blame it i dont like hanted houses tom
why theyre a dern sight worsen dead people
dead people might talk maybe but they dont come sliding around in a shroud when you aint noticing and peep over your shoulder all of a sudden and grit their teeth the way a ghost does
i couldnt stand such a thing as that tomnobody could yes but huck ghosts dont travel around only at night
they wont hender us from digging there in the daytime well thats so
but you know mighty well people dont go about that hanted house in the day nor the night well thats mostly because they dont like to go where a mans been murdered anywaybut nothings ever been seen around that house except in the nightjust some blue lights slipping by the windowsno regular ghosts well where you see one of them blue lights flickering around tom you can bet theres a ghost mighty close behind it
it stands to reason
becuz you know that they dont anybody but ghosts use em yes thats so
but anyway they dont come around in the daytime so whats the use of our being afeard well all right
well tackle the hanted house if you say sobut i reckon its taking chances they had started down the hill by this time
there in the middle of the moonlit valley below them stood the hanted house utterly isolated its fences gone long ago rank weeds smothering the very doorsteps the chimney crumbled to ruin the windowsashes vacant a corner of the roof caved in
the boys gazed awhile half expecting to see a blue light flit past a window then talking in a low tone as befitted the time and the circumstances they struck far off to the right to give the haunted house a wide berth and took their way homeward through the woods that adorned the rearward side of cardiff hill
about noon the next day the boys arrived at the dead tree they had come for their tools
tom was impatient to go to the haunted house huck was measurably so alsobut suddenly said lookyhere tom do you know what day it is tom mentally ran over the days of the week and then quickly lifted his eyes with a startled look in them my
i never once thought of it huck well i didnt neither but all at once it popped onto me that it was friday blame it a body cant be too careful huck
we might a got into an awful scrape tackling such a thing on a friday might
better say we would
theres some lucky days maybe but friday aint any fool knows that
i dont reckon you was the first that found it out huck well i never said i was did i
and friday aint all neither
i had a rotten bad dream last nightdreampt about rats no
sure sign of trouble

when they dont fight its only a sign that theres trouble around you know
all we got to do is to look mighty sharp and keep out of it
well drop this thing for today and play
do you know robin hood huck no
whos robin hood why he was one of the greatest men that was ever in englandand the best
he was a robber cracky i wisht i was
who did he rob only sheriffs and bishops and rich people and kings and such like
but he never bothered the poor
he loved em
he always divided up with em perfectly square well he must a been a brick i bet you he was huck
oh he was the noblest man that ever was
they aint any such men now i can tell you
he could lick any man in england with one hand tied behind him and he could take his yew bow and plug a tencent piece every time a mile and a half whats a yew bow i dont know
its some kind of a bow of course
and if he hit that dime only on the edge he would set down and cryand curse
but well play robin hoodits nobby fun
ill learn you im agreed so they played robin hood all the afternoon now and then casting a yearning eye down upon the haunted house and passing a remark about the morrows prospects and possibilities there
as the sun began to sink into the west they took their way homeward athwart the long shadows of the trees and soon were buried from sight in the forests of cardiff hill
on saturday shortly after noon the boys were at the dead tree again
they had a smoke and a chat in the shade and then dug a little in their last hole not with great hope but merely because tom said there were so many cases where people had given up a treasure after getting down within six inches of it and then somebody else had come along and turned it up with a single thrust of a shovel
the thing failed this time however so the boys shouldered their tools and went away feeling that they had not trifled with fortune but had fulfilled all the requirements that belong to the business of treasurehunting
when they reached the haunted house there was something so weird and grisly about the dead silence that reigned there under the baking sun and something so depressing about the loneliness and desolation of the place that they were afraid for a moment to venture in
then they crept to the door and took a trembling peep
they saw a weedgrown floorless room unplastered an ancient fireplace vacant windows a ruinous staircase and here there and everywhere hung ragged and abandoned cobwebs
they presently entered softly with quickened pulses talking in whispers ears alert to catch the slightest sound and muscles tense and ready for instant retreat
in a little while familiarity modified their fears and they gave the place a critical and interested examination rather admiring their own boldness and wondering at it too
next they wanted to look upstairs
this was something like cutting off retreat but they got to daring each other and of course there could be but one resultthey threw their tools into a corner and made the ascent
up there were the same signs of decay
in one corner they found a closet that promised mystery but the promise was a fraudthere was nothing in it
their courage was up now and well in hand
they were about to go down and begin work when sh said tom
what is it whispered huck blanching with fright
sh
there
hear it yes
oh my
lets run keep still
dont you budge
theyre coming right toward the door the boys stretched themselves upon the floor with their eyes to knotholes in the planking and lay waiting in a misery of fear
theyve stopped nocoming
here they are
dont whisper another word huck
my goodness i wish i was out of this two men entered
each boy said to himself theres the old deaf and dumb spaniard thats been about town once or twice latelynever saw tother man before tother was a ragged unkempt creature with nothing very pleasant in his face
the spaniard was wrapped in a serape he had bushy white whiskers long white hair flowed from under his sombrero and he wore green goggles
when they came in tother was talking in a low voice they sat down on the ground facing the door with their backs to the wall and the speaker continued his remarks
his manner became less guarded and his words more distinct as he proceeded no said he ive thought it all over and i dont like it
its dangerous dangerous grunted the deaf and dumb spaniardto the vast surprise of the boys
milksop this voice made the boys gasp and quake
it was injun joes
there was silence for some time
then joe said whats any more dangerous than that job up yonderbut nothings come of it thats different
away up the river so and not another house about
twont ever be known that we tried anyway long as we didnt succeed well whats more dangerous than coming here in the daytimeanybody would suspicion us that saw us i know that
but there warnt any other place as handy after that fool of a job
i want to quit this shanty
i wanted to yesterday only it warnt any use trying to stir out of here with those infernal boys playing over there on the hill right in full view those infernal boys quaked again under the inspiration of this remark and thought how lucky it was that they had remembered it was friday and concluded to wait a day
they wished in their hearts they had waited a year
the two men got out some food and made a luncheon
after a long and thoughtful silence injun joe said look here ladyou go back up the river where you belong
wait there till you hear from me
ill take the chances on dropping into this town just once more for a look
well do that dangerous job after ive spied around a little and think things look well for it
then for texas
well leg it together this was satisfactory
both men presently fell to yawning and injun joe said im dead for sleep
its your turn to watch he curled down in the weeds and soon began to snore
his comrade stirred him once or twice and he became quiet
presently the watcher began to nod his head drooped lower and lower both men began to snore now
the boys drew a long grateful breath
tom whispered nows our chancecome huck said i cantid die if they was to wake tom urgedhuck held back
at last tom rose slowly and softly and started alone
but the first step he made wrung such a hideous creak from the crazy floor that he sank down almost dead with fright
he never made a second attempt
the boys lay there counting the dragging moments till it seemed to them that time must be done and eternity growing gray and then they were grateful to note that at last the sun was setting
now one snore ceased
injun joe sat up stared aroundsmiled grimly upon his comrade whose head was drooping upon his kneesstirred him up with his foot and said here
youre a watchman aint you
all right thoughnothings happened my
have i been asleep oh partly partly
nearly time for us to be moving pard
whatll we do with what little swag weve got left i dont knowleave it here as weve always done i reckon
no use to take it away till we start south
six hundred and fifty in silvers something to carry wellall rightit wont matter to come here once more nobut id say come in the night as we used to doits better yes but look here it may be a good while before i get the right chance at that job accidents might happen taint in such a very good place well just regularly bury itand bury it deep good idea said the comrade who walked across the room knelt down raised one of the rearward hearthstones and took out a bag that jingled pleasantly
he subtracted from it twenty or thirty dollars for himself and as much for injun joe and passed the bag to the latter who was on his knees in the corner now digging with his bowieknife
the boys forgot all their fears all their miseries in an instant
with gloating eyes they watched every movement
luckthe splendor of it was beyond all imagination
six hundred dollars was money enough to make half a dozen boys rich
here was treasurehunting under the happiest auspicesthere would not be any bothersome uncertainty as to where to dig
they nudged each other every momenteloquent nudges and easily understood for they simply meantoh but aint you glad now were here joes knife struck upon something
hello said he
what is it said his comrade
halfrotten plankno its a box i believe
herebear a hand and well see what its here for
never mind ive broke a hole he reached his hand in and drew it out man its money the two men examined the handful of coins
they were gold
the boys above were as excited as themselves and as delighted
joes comrade said well make quick work of this
theres an old rusty pick over amongst the weeds in the corner the other side of the fireplacei saw it a minute ago he ran and brought the boys pick and shovel
injun joe took the pick looked it over critically shook his head muttered something to himself and then began to use it
the box was soon unearthed
it was not very large it was iron bound and had been very strong before the slow years had injured it
the men contemplated the treasure awhile in blissful silence
pard theres thousands of dollars here said injun joe
twas always said that murrels gang used to be around here one summer the stranger observed
i know it said injun joe and this looks like it i should say now you wont need to do that job the halfbreed frowned
said he you dont know me
least you dont know all about that thing
taint robbery altogetherits revenge and a wicked light flamed in his eyes
ill need your help in it
when its finishedthen texas
go home to your nance and your kids and stand by till you hear from me wellif you say so whatll we do with thisbury it again yes
ravishing delight overhead
no
by the great sachem no
profound distress overhead
id nearly forgot
that pick had fresh earth on it
the boys were sick with terror in a moment
what business has a pick and a shovel here
what business with fresh earth on them
who brought them hereand where are they gone
have you heard anybodyseen anybody
what
bury it again and leave them to come and see the ground disturbed
not exactlynot exactly
well take it to my den why of course
might have thought of that before
you mean number one nonumber twounder the cross
the other place is badtoo common all right
its nearly dark enough to start injun joe got up and went about from window to window cautiously peeping out
presently he said who could have brought those tools here
do you reckon they can be upstairs the boys breath forsook them
injun joe put his hand on his knife halted a moment undecided and then turned toward the stairway
the boys thought of the closet but their strength was gone
the steps came creaking up the stairsthe intolerable distress of the situation woke the stricken resolution of the ladsthey were about to spring for the closet when there was a crash of rotten timbers and injun joe landed on the ground amid the debris of the ruined stairway
he gathered himself up cursing and his comrade said now whats the use of all that
if its anybody and theyre up there let them stay therewho cares
if they want to jump down now and get into trouble who objects
it will be dark in fifteen minutesand then let them follow us if they want to
im willing
in my opinion whoever hove those things in here caught a sight of us and took us for ghosts or devils or something
ill bet theyre running yet joe grumbled awhile then he agreed with his friend that what daylight was left ought to be economized in getting things ready for leaving
shortly afterward they slipped out of the house in the deepening twilight and moved toward the river with their precious box
tom and huck rose up weak but vastly relieved and stared after them through the chinks between the logs of the house
follow
not they
they were content to reach ground again without broken necks and take the townward track over the hill
they did not talk much
they were too much absorbed in hating themselveshating the ill luck that made them take the spade and the pick there
but for that injun joe never would have suspected
he would have hidden the silver with the gold to wait there till his revenge was satisfied and then he would have had the misfortune to find that money turn up missing
bitter bitter luck that the tools were ever brought there
they resolved to keep a lookout for that spaniard when he should come to town spying out for chances to do his revengeful job and follow him to number two wherever that might be
then a ghastly thought occurred to tom
revenge
what if he means us huck oh dont said huck nearly fainting
they talked it all over and as they entered town they agreed to believe that he might possibly mean somebody elseat least that he might at least mean nobody but tom since only tom had testified
very very small comfort it was to tom to be alone in danger
company would be a palpable improvement he thought
the adventure of the day mightily tormented toms dreams that night
four times he had his hands on that rich treasure and four times it wasted to nothingness in his fingers as sleep forsook him and wakefulness brought back the hard reality of his misfortune
as he lay in the early morning recalling the incidents of his great adventure he noticed that they seemed curiously subdued and far awaysomewhat as if they had happened in another world or in a time long gone by
then it occurred to him that the great adventure itself must be a dream
there was one very strong argument in favor of this ideanamely that the quantity of coin he had seen was too vast to be real
he had never seen as much as fifty dollars in one mass before and he was like all boys of his age and station in life in that he imagined that all references to hundreds and thousands were mere fanciful forms of speech and that no such sums really existed in the world
he never had supposed for a moment that so large a sum as a hundred dollars was to be found in actual money in any ones possession
if his notions of hidden treasure had been analyzed they would have been found to consist of a handful of real dimes and a bushel of vague splendid ungraspable dollars
but the incidents of his adventure grew sensibly sharper and clearer under the attrition of thinking them over and so he presently found himself leaning to the impression that the thing might not have been a dream after all
this uncertainty must be swept away
he would snatch a hurried breakfast and go and find huck
huck was sitting on the gunwale of a flatboat listlessly dangling his feet in the water and looking very melancholy
tom concluded to let huck lead up to the subject
if he did not do it then the adventure would be proved to have been only a dream
hello huck hello yourself silence for a minute
tom if wed a left the blame tools at the dead tree wed a got the money
oh aint it awful taint a dream then taint a dream
somehow i most wish it was
dogd if i dont huck what aint a dream oh that thing yesterday
i been half thinking it was dream
if them stairs hadnt broke down youd a seen how much dream it was
ive had dreams enough all nightwith that patcheyed spanish devil going for me all through emrot him no not rot him
find him
track the money tom well never find him
a feller dont have only one chance for such a pileand that ones lost
id feel mighty shaky if i was to see him anyway well sod i but id like to see him anywayand track him outto his number two number twoyes thats it
i been thinking bout that
but i cant make nothing out of it
what do you reckon it is i dono
its too deep
say huckmaybe its the number of a house goody
no tom that aint it
if it is it aint in this onehorse town
they aint no numbers here well thats so
lemme think a minute
hereits the number of a roomin a tavern you know oh thats the trick
they aint only two taverns
we can find out quick you stay here huck till i come tom was off at once
he did not care to have hucks company in public places
he was gone half an hour
he found that in the best tavern no
had long been occupied by a young lawyer and was still so occupied
in the less ostentatious house no
was a mystery
the tavernkeepers young son said it was kept locked all the time and he never saw anybody go into it or come out of it except at night he did not know any particular reason for this state of things had had some little curiosity but it was rather feeble had made the most of the mystery by entertaining himself with the idea that that room was hanted had noticed that there was a light in there the night before
thats what ive found out huck
i reckon thats the very no
were after i reckon it is tom
now what you going to do lemme think tom thought a long time
then he said ill tell you
the back door of that no
is the door that comes out into that little close alley between the tavern and the old rattle trap of a brick store
now you get hold of all the doorkeys you can find and ill nip all of aunties and the first dark night well go there and try em
and mind you keep a lookout for injun joe because he said he was going to drop into town and spy around once more for a chance to get his revenge
if you see him you just follow him and if he dont go to that no
that aint the place lordy i dont want to foller him by myself why itll be night sure
he mightnt ever see youand if he did maybe hed never think anything well if its pretty dark i reckon ill track him
i donoi dono
ill try you bet ill follow him if its dark huck
why he might a found out he couldnt get his revenge and be going right after that money its so tom its so
ill foller him i will by jingoes now youre talking
dont you ever weaken huck and i wont that night tom and huck were ready for their adventure
they hung about the neighborhood of the tavern until after nine one watching the alley at a distance and the other the tavern door
nobody entered the alley or left it nobody resembling the spaniard entered or left the tavern door
the night promised to be a fair one so tom went home with the understanding that if a considerable degree of darkness came on huck was to come and maow whereupon he would slip out and try the keys
but the night remained clear and huck closed his watch and retired to bed in an empty sugar hogshead about twelve
tuesday the boys had the same ill luck
also wednesday
but thursday night promised better
tom slipped out in good season with his aunts old tin lantern and a large towel to blindfold it with
he hid the lantern in hucks sugar hogshead and the watch began
an hour before midnight the tavern closed up and its lights the only ones thereabouts were put out
no spaniard had been seen
nobody had entered or left the alley
everything was auspicious
the blackness of darkness reigned the perfect stillness was interrupted only by occasional mutterings of distant thunder
tom got his lantern lit it in the hogshead wrapped it closely in the towel and the two adventurers crept in the gloom toward the tavern
huck stood sentry and tom felt his way into the alley
then there was a season of waiting anxiety that weighed upon hucks spirits like a mountain
he began to wish he could see a flash from the lanternit would frighten him but it would at least tell him that tom was alive yet
it seemed hours since tom had disappeared
surely he must have fainted maybe he was dead maybe his heart had burst under terror and excitement
in his uneasiness huck found himself drawing closer and closer to the alley fearing all sorts of dreadful things and momentarily expecting some catastrophe to happen that would take away his breath
there was not much to take away for he seemed only able to inhale it by thimblefuls and his heart would soon wear itself out the way it was beating
suddenly there was a flash of light and tom came tearing by him run said he run for your life he neednt have repeated it once was enough huck was making thirty or forty miles an hour before the repetition was uttered
the boys never stopped till they reached the shed of a deserted slaughterhouse at the lower end of the village
just as they got within its shelter the storm burst and the rain poured down
as soon as tom got his breath he said huck it was awful
i tried two of the keys just as soft as i could but they seemed to make such a power of racket that i couldnt hardly get my breath i was so scared
they wouldnt turn in the lock either
well without noticing what i was doing i took hold of the knob and open comes the door
it warnt locked
i hopped in and shook off the towel and great caesars ghost whatwhatd you see tom huck i most stepped onto injun joes hand no yes
he was lying there sound asleep on the floor with his old patch on his eye and his arms spread out lordy what did you do
did he wake up no never budged
drunk i reckon
i just grabbed that towel and started id never a thought of the towel i bet well i would
my aunt would make me mighty sick if i lost it say tom did you see that box huck i didnt wait to look around
i didnt see the box i didnt see the cross
i didnt see anything but a bottle and a tin cup on the floor by injun joe yes i saw two barrels and lots more bottles in the room
dont you see now whats the matter with that hanted room how why its hanted with whiskey
maybe all the temperance taverns have got a hanted room hey huck well i reckon maybe thats so
whod a thought such a thing
but say tom nows a mighty good time to get that box if injun joes drunk it is that
you try it huck shuddered
well noi reckon not and i reckon not huck
only one bottle alongside of injun joe aint enough
if thered been three hed be drunk enough and id do it there was a long pause for reflection and then tom said lookyhere huck less not try that thing any more till we know injun joes not in there
its too scary
now if we watch every night well be dead sure to see him go out some time or other and then well snatch that box quickern lightning well im agreed
ill watch the whole night long and ill do it every night too if youll do the other part of the job all right i will
all you got to do is to trot up hooper street a block and maowand if im asleep you throw some gravel at the window and thatll fetch me agreed and good as wheat now huck the storms over and ill go home
itll begin to be daylight in a couple of hours
you go back and watch that long will you i said i would tom and i will
ill hant that tavern every night for a year
ill sleep all day and ill stand watch all night thats all right
now where you going to sleep in ben rogers hayloft
he lets me and so does his paps nigger man uncle jake
i tote water for uncle jake whenever he wants me to and any time i ask him he gives me a little something to eat if he can spare it
thats a mighty good nigger tom
he likes me becuz i dont ever act as if i was above him
sometime ive set right down and eat with him
but you neednt tell that
a bodys got to do things when hes awful hungry he wouldnt want to do as a steady thing well if i dont want you in the daytime ill let you sleep
i wont come bothering around
any time you see somethings up in the night just skip right around and maow the first thing tom heard on friday morning was a glad piece of newsjudge thatchers family had come back to town the night before
both injun joe and the treasure sunk into secondary importance for a moment and becky took the chief place in the boys interest
he saw her and they had an exhausting good time playing hispy and gullykeeper with a crowd of their schoolmates
the day was completed and crowned in a peculiarly satisfactory way becky teased her mother to appoint the next day for the longpromised and longdelayed picnic and she consented
the childs delight was boundless and toms not more moderate
the invitations were sent out before sunset and straightway the young folks of the village were thrown into a fever of preparation and pleasurable anticipation
toms excitement enabled him to keep awake until a pretty late hour and he had good hopes of hearing hucks maow and of having his treasure to astonish becky and the picnickers with next day but he was disappointed
no signal came that night
morning came eventually and by ten or eleven oclock a giddy and rollicking company were gathered at judge thatchers and everything was ready for a start
it was not the custom for elderly people to mar the picnics with their presence
the children were considered safe enough under the wings of a few young ladies of eighteen and a few young gentlemen of twentythree or thereabouts
the old steam ferryboat was chartered for the occasion presently the gay throng filed up the main street laden with provisionbaskets
sid was sick and had to miss the fun mary remained at home to entertain him
the last thing mrs thatcher said to becky was youll not get back till late
perhaps youd better stay all night with some of the girls that live near the ferrylanding child then ill stay with susy harper mamma very well
and mind and behave yourself and dont be any trouble presently as they tripped along tom said to becky sayill tell you what well do
stead of going to joe harpers well climb right up the hill and stop at the widow douglas
shell have icecream
she has it most every daydead loads of it
and shell be awful glad to have us oh that will be fun then becky reflected a moment and said but what will mamma say howll she ever know the girl turned the idea over in her mind and said reluctantly i reckon its wrongbut but shucks
your mother wont know and so whats the harm
all she wants is that youll be safe and i bet you shed a said go there if shed a thought of it
i know she would the widow douglas splendid hospitality was a tempting bait
it and toms persuasions presently carried the day
so it was decided to say nothing to anybody about the nights programme
presently it occurred to tom that maybe huck might come this very night and give the signal
the thought took a deal of the spirit out of his anticipations
still he could not bear to give up the fun at widow douglas
and why should he give it up he reasonedthe signal did not come the night before so why should it be any more likely to come tonight
the sure fun of the evening outweighed the uncertain treasure and boylike he determined to yield to the stronger inclination and not allow himself to think of the box of money another time that day
three miles below town the ferryboat stopped at the mouth of a woody hollow and tied up
the crowd swarmed ashore and soon the forest distances and craggy heights echoed far and near with shoutings and laughter
all the different ways of getting hot and tired were gone through with and byandby the rovers straggled back to camp fortified with responsible appetites and then the destruction of the good things began
after the feast there was a refreshing season of rest and chat in the shade of spreading oaks
byandby somebody shouted whos ready for the cave everybody was
bundles of candles were procured and straightway there was a general scamper up the hill
the mouth of the cave was up the hillsidean opening shaped like a letter a
its massive oaken door stood unbarred
within was a small chamber chilly as an icehouse and walled by nature with solid limestone that was dewy with a cold sweat
it was romantic and mysterious to stand here in the deep gloom and look out upon the green valley shining in the sun
but the impressiveness of the situation quickly wore off and the romping began again
the moment a candle was lighted there was a general rush upon the owner of it a struggle and a gallant defence followed but the candle was soon knocked down or blown out and then there was a glad clamor of laughter and a new chase
but all things have an end
byandby the procession went filing down the steep descent of the main avenue the flickering rank of lights dimly revealing the lofty walls of rock almost to their point of junction sixty feet overhead
this main avenue was not more than eight or ten feet wide
every few steps other lofty and still narrower crevices branched from it on either handfor mcdougals cave was but a vast labyrinth of crooked aisles that ran into each other and out again and led nowhere
it was said that one might wander days and nights together through its intricate tangle of rifts and chasms and never find the end of the cave and that he might go down and down and still down into the earth and it was just the samelabyrinth under labyrinth and no end to any of them
no man knew the cave
that was an impossible thing
most of the young men knew a portion of it and it was not customary to venture much beyond this known portion
tom sawyer knew as much of the cave as any one
the procession moved along the main avenue some threequarters of a mile and then groups and couples began to slip aside into branch avenues fly along the dismal corridors and take each other by surprise at points where the corridors joined again
parties were able to elude each other for the space of half an hour without going beyond the known ground
byandby one group after another came straggling back to the mouth of the cave panting hilarious smeared from head to foot with tallow drippings daubed with clay and entirely delighted with the success of the day
then they were astonished to find that they had been taking no note of time and that night was about at hand
the clanging bell had been calling for half an hour
however this sort of close to the days adventures was romantic and therefore satisfactory
when the ferryboat with her wild freight pushed into the stream nobody cared sixpence for the wasted time but the captain of the craft
huck was already upon his watch when the ferryboats lights went glinting past the wharf
he heard no noise on board for the young people were as subdued and still as people usually are who are nearly tired to death
he wondered what boat it was and why she did not stop at the wharfand then he dropped her out of his mind and put his attention upon his business
the night was growing cloudy and dark
ten oclock came and the noise of vehicles ceased scattered lights began to wink out all straggling footpassengers disappeared the village betook itself to its slumbers and left the small watcher alone with the silence and the ghosts
eleven oclock came and the tavern lights were put out darkness everywhere now
huck waited what seemed a weary long time but nothing happened
his faith was weakening
was there any use
was there really any use
why not give it up and turn in
a noise fell upon his ear
he was all attention in an instant
the alley door closed softly
he sprang to the corner of the brick store
the next moment two men brushed by him and one seemed to have something under his arm
it must be that box
so they were going to remove the treasure
why call tom now
it would be absurdthe men would get away with the box and never be found again
no he would stick to their wake and follow them he would trust to the darkness for security from discovery
so communing with himself huck stepped out and glided along behind the men catlike with bare feet allowing them to keep just far enough ahead not to be invisible
they moved up the river street three blocks then turned to the left up a crossstreet
they went straight ahead then until they came to the path that led up cardiff hill this they took
they passed by the old welshmans house halfway up the hill without hesitating and still climbed upward
good thought huck they will bury it in the old quarry
but they never stopped at the quarry
they passed on up the summit
they plunged into the narrow path between the tall sumach bushes and were at once hidden in the gloom
huck closed up and shortened his distance now for they would never be able to see him
he trotted along awhile then slackened his pace fearing he was gaining too fast moved on a piece then stopped altogether listened no sound none save that he seemed to hear the beating of his own heart
the hooting of an owl came over the hillominous sound
but no footsteps
heavens was everything lost
he was about to spring with winged feet when a man cleared his throat not four feet from him
hucks heart shot into his throat but he swallowed it again and then he stood there shaking as if a dozen agues had taken charge of him at once and so weak that he thought he must surely fall to the ground
he knew where he was
he knew he was within five steps of the stile leading into widow douglas grounds
very well he thought let them bury it there it wont be hard to find
now there was a voicea very low voiceinjun joes damn her maybe shes got companytheres lights late as it is i cant see any this was that strangers voicethe stranger of the haunted house
a deadly chill went to hucks heartthis then was the revenge job
his thought was to fly
then he remembered that the widow douglas had been kind to him more than once and maybe these men were going to murder her
he wished he dared venture to warn her but he knew he didnt darethey might come and catch him
he thought all this and more in the moment that elapsed between the strangers remark and injun joes nextwhich was because the bush is in your way
nowthis waynow you see dont you yes
well there is company there i reckon
better give it up give it up and i just leaving this country forever
give it up and maybe never have another chance
i tell you again as ive told you before i dont care for her swagyou may have it
but her husband was rough on memany times he was rough on meand mainly he was the justice of the peace that jugged me for a vagrant
and that aint all
it aint a millionth part of it
he had me horsewhippedhorsewhipped in front of the jail like a niggerwith all the town looking on
horsewhippeddo you understand
he took advantage of me and died
but ill take it out of her oh dont kill her
dont do that kill
who said anything about killing
i would kill him if he was here but not her
when you want to get revenge on a woman you dont kill herbosh
you go for her looks
you slit her nostrilsyou notch her ears like a sow by god thats keep your opinion to yourself
it will be safest for you
ill tie her to the bed
if she bleeds to death is that my fault
ill not cry if she does
my friend youll help me in this thingfor my sakethats why youre herei mightnt be able alone
if you flinch ill kill you
do you understand that
and if i have to kill you ill kill herand then i reckon nobodyll ever know much about who done this business well if its got to be done lets get at it
the quicker the betterim all in a shiver do it now
and company there
look hereill get suspicious of you first thing you know
nowell wait till the lights are outtheres no hurry huck felt that a silence was going to ensuea thing still more awful than any amount of murderous talk so he held his breath and stepped gingerly back planted his foot carefully and firmly after balancing onelegged in a precarious way and almost toppling over first on one side and then on the other
he took another step back with the same elaboration and the same risks then another and another anda twig snapped under his foot
his breath stopped and he listened
there was no soundthe stillness was perfect
his gratitude was measureless
now he turned in his tracks between the walls of sumach bushesturned himself as carefully as if he were a shipand then stepped quickly but cautiously along
when he emerged at the quarry he felt secure and so he picked up his nimble heels and flew
down down he sped till he reached the welshmans
he banged at the door and presently the heads of the old man and his two stalwart sons were thrust from windows
whats the row there
whos banging
what do you want let me inquick
ill tell everything why who are you huckleberry finnquick let me in huckleberry finn indeed
it aint a name to open many doors i judge
but let him in lads and lets see whats the trouble please dont ever tell i told you were hucks first words when he got in
please dontid be killed surebut the widows been good friends to me sometimes and i want to telli will tell if youll promise you wont ever say it was me by george he has got something to tell or he wouldnt act so exclaimed the old man out with it and nobody herell ever tell lad three minutes later the old man and his sons well armed were up the hill and just entering the sumach path on tiptoe their weapons in their hands
huck accompanied them no further
he hid behind a great bowlder and fell to listening
there was a lagging anxious silence and then all of a sudden there was an explosion of firearms and a cry
huck waited for no particulars
he sprang away and sped down the hill as fast as his legs could carry him
as the earliest suspicion of dawn appeared on sunday morning huck came groping up the hill and rapped gently at the old welshmans door
the inmates were asleep but it was a sleep that was set on a hairtrigger on account of the exciting episode of the night
a call came from a window whos there hucks scared voice answered in a low tone please let me in
its only huck finn its a name that can open this door night or day ladand welcome these were strange words to the vagabond boys ears and the pleasantest he had ever heard
he could not recollect that the closing word had ever been applied in his case before
the door was quickly unlocked and he entered
huck was given a seat and the old man and his brace of tall sons speedily dressed themselves
now my boy i hope youre good and hungry because breakfast will be ready as soon as the suns up and well have a piping hot one toomake yourself easy about that
i and the boys hoped youd turn up and stop here last night i was awful scared said huck and i run
i took out when the pistols went off and i didnt stop for three mile
ive come now becuz i wanted to know about it you know and i come before daylight becuz i didnt want to run across them devils even if they was dead well poor chap you do look as if youd had a hard night of itbut theres a bed here for you when youve had your breakfast
no they aint dead ladwe are sorry enough for that
you see we knew right where to put our hands on them by your description so we crept along on tiptoe till we got within fifteen feet of themdark as a cellar that sumach path wasand just then i found i was going to sneeze
it was the meanest kind of luck
i tried to keep it back but no usetwas bound to come and it did come
i was in the lead with my pistol raised and when the sneeze started those scoundrels arustling to get out of the path i sung out fire boys and blazed away at the place where the rustling was
so did the boys
but they were off in a jiffy those villains and we after them down through the woods
i judge we never touched them
they fired a shot apiece as they started but their bullets whizzed by and didnt do us any harm
as soon as we lost the sound of their feet we quit chasing and went down and stirred up the constables
they got a posse together and went off to guard the river bank and as soon as it is light the sheriff and a gang are going to beat up the woods
my boys will be with them presently
i wish we had some sort of description of those rascalstwould help a good deal
but you couldnt see what they were like in the dark lad i suppose oh yes i saw them downtown and follered them splendid
describe themdescribe them my boy ones the old deaf and dumb spaniard thats ben around here once or twice and tothers a meanlooking ragged thats enough lad we know the men
happened on them in the woods back of the widows one day and they slunk away
off with you boys and tell the sheriffget your breakfast tomorrow morning the welshmans sons departed at once
as they were leaving the room huck sprang up and exclaimed oh please dont tell anybody it was me that blowed on them
oh please all right if you say it huck but you ought to have the credit of what you did oh no no
please dont tell when the young men were gone the old welshman said they wont telland i wont
but why dont you want it known huck would not explain further than to say that he already knew too much about one of those men and would not have the man know that he knew anything against him for the whole worldhe would be killed for knowing it sure
the old man promised secrecy once more and said how did you come to follow these fellows lad
were they looking suspicious huck was silent while he framed a duly cautious reply
then he said well you see im a kind of a hard lotleast everybody says so and i dont see nothing agin itand sometimes i cant sleep much on account of thinking about it and sort of trying to strike out a new way of doing
that was the way of it last night
i couldnt sleep and so i come along upstreet bout midnight aturning it all over and when i got to that old shackly brick store by the temperance tavern i backed up agin the wall to have another think
well just then along comes these two chaps slipping along close by me with something under their arm and i reckoned theyd stole it
one was asmoking and tother one wanted a light so they stopped right before me and the cigars lit up their faces and i see that the big one was the deaf and dumb spaniard by his white whiskers and the patch on his eye and tother one was a rusty raggedlooking devil could you see the rags by the light of the cigars this staggered huck for a moment
then he said well i dont knowbut somehow it seems as if i did then they went on and you follered emyes
that was it
i wanted to see what was upthey sneaked along so
i dogged em to the widders stile and stood in the dark and heard the ragged one beg for the widder and the spaniard swear hed spile her looks just as i told you and your two what
the deaf and dumb man said all that huck had made another terrible mistake
he was trying his best to keep the old man from getting the faintest hint of who the spaniard might be and yet his tongue seemed determined to get him into trouble in spite of all he could do
he made several efforts to creep out of his scrape but the old mans eye was upon him and he made blunder after blunder
presently the welshman said my boy dont be afraid of me
i wouldnt hurt a hair of your head for all the world
noid protect youid protect you
this spaniard is not deaf and dumb youve let that slip without intending it you cant cover that up now
you know something about that spaniard that you want to keep dark
now trust metell me what it is and trust mei wont betray you huck looked into the old mans honest eyes a moment then bent over and whispered in his ear taint a spaniardits injun joe the welshman almost jumped out of his chair
in a moment he said its all plain enough now
when you talked about notching ears and slitting noses i judged that that was your own embellishment because white men dont take that sort of revenge
but an injun
thats a different matter altogether during breakfast the talk went on and in the course of it the old man said that the last thing which he and his sons had done before going to bed was to get a lantern and examine the stile and its vicinity for marks of blood
they found none but captured a bulky bundle of of what if the words had been lightning they could not have leaped with a more stunning suddenness from hucks blanched lips
his eyes were staring wide now and his breath suspendedwaiting for the answer
the welshman startedstared in returnthree secondsfive secondstenthen replied of burglars tools
why whats the matter with you huck sank back panting gently but deeply unutterably grateful
the welshman eyed him gravely curiouslyand presently said yes burglars tools
that appears to relieve you a good deal
but what did give you that turn
what were you expecting wed found huck was in a close placethe inquiring eye was upon himhe would have given anything for material for a plausible answernothing suggested itselfthe inquiring eye was boring deeper and deepera senseless reply offeredthere was no time to weigh it so at a venture he uttered itfeebly sundayschool books maybe poor huck was too distressed to smile but the old man laughed loud and joyously shook up the details of his anatomy from head to foot and ended by saying that such a laugh was money in amans pocket because it cut down the doctors bill like everything
then he added poor old chap youre white and jadedyou aint well a bitno wonder youre a little flighty and off your balance
but youll come out of it
rest and sleep will fetch you out all right i hope huck was irritated to think he had been such a goose and betrayed such a suspicious excitement for he had dropped the idea that the parcel brought from the tavern was the treasure as soon as he had heard the talk at the widows stile
he had only thought it was not the treasure howeverhe had not known that it wasntand so the suggestion of a captured bundle was too much for his selfpossession
but on the whole he felt glad the little episode had happened for now he knew beyond all question that that bundle was not the bundle and so his mind was at rest and exceedingly comfortable
in fact everything seemed to be drifting just in the right direction now the treasure must be still in no
the men would be captured and jailed that day and he and tom could seize the gold that night without any trouble or any fear of interruption
just as breakfast was completed there was a knock at the door
huck jumped for a hidingplace for he had no mind to be connected even remotely with the late event
the welshman admitted several ladies and gentlemen among them the widow douglas and noticed that groups of citizens were climbing up the hillto stare at the stile
so the news had spread
the welshman had to tell the story of the night to the visitors
the widows gratitude for her preservation was outspoken
dont say a word about it madam
theres another that youre more beholden to than you are to me and my boys maybe but he dont allow me to tell his name
we wouldnt have been there but for him of course this excited a curiosity so vast that it almost belittled the main matterbut the welshman allowed it to eat into the vitals of his visitors and through them be transmitted to the whole town for he refused to part with his secret
when all else had been learned the widow said i went to sleep reading in bed and slept straight through all that noise
why didnt you come and wake me we judged it warnt worth while
those fellows warnt likely to come againthey hadnt any tools left to work with and what was the use of waking you up and scaring you to death
my three negro men stood guard at your house all the rest of the night
theyve just come back more visitors came and the story had to be told and retold for a couple of hours more
there was no sabbathschool during dayschool vacation but everybody was early at church
the stirring event was well canvassed
news came that not a sign of the two villains had been yet discovered
when the sermon was finished judge thatchers wife dropped alongside of mrs harper as she moved down the aisle with the crowd and said is my becky going to sleep all day
i just expected she would be tired to death your becky yes with a startled lookdidnt she stay with you last night why no mrs thatcher turned pale and sank into a pew just as aunt polly talking briskly with a friend passed by
aunt polly said goodmorning mrs thatcher
goodmorning mrs harper
ive got a boy thats turned up missing
i reckon my tom stayed at your house last nightone of you
and now hes afraid to come to church
ive got to settle with him mrs thatcher shook her head feebly and turned paler than ever
he didnt stay with us said mrs harper beginning to look uneasy
a marked anxiety came into aunt pollys face
joe harper have you seen my tom this morning nom when did you see him last joe tried to remember but was not sure he could say
the people had stopped moving out of church
whispers passed along and a boding uneasiness took possession of every countenance
children were anxiously questioned and young teachers
they all said they had not noticed whether tom and becky were on board the ferryboat on the homeward trip it was dark no one thought of inquiring if any one was missing
one young man finally blurted out his fear that they were still in the cave
mrs thatcher swooned away
aunt polly fell to crying and wringing her hands
the alarm swept from lip to lip from group to group from street to street and within five minutes the bells were wildly clanging and the whole town was up
the cardiff hill episode sank into instant insignificance the burglars were forgotten horses were saddled skiffs were manned the ferryboat ordered out and before the horror was half an hour old two hundred men were pouring down highroad and river toward the cave
all the long afternoon the village seemed empty and dead
many women visited aunt polly and mrs thatcher and tried to comfort them
they cried with them too and that was still better than words
all the tedious night the town waited for news but when the morning dawned at last all the word that came was send more candlesand send food mrs thatcher was almost crazed and aunt polly also
judge thatcher sent messages of hope and encouragement from the cave but they conveyed no real cheer
the old welshman came home toward daylight spattered with candlegrease smeared with clay and almost worn out
he found huck still in the bed that had been provided for him and delirious with fever
the physicians were all at the cave so the widow douglas came and took charge of the patient
she said she would do her best by him because whether he was good bad or indifferent he was the lords and nothing that was the lords was a thing to be neglected
the welshman said huck had good spots in him and the widow said you can depend on it
thats the lords mark
he dont leave it off
he never does
puts it somewhere on every creature that comes from his hands early in the forenoon parties of jaded men began to straggle into the village but the strongest of the citizens continued searching
all the news that could be gained was that remotenesses of the cavern were being ransacked that had never been visited before that every corner and crevice was going to be thoroughly searched that wherever one wandered through the maze of passages lights were to be seen flitting hither and thither in the distance and shoutings and pistolshots sent their hollow reverberations to the ear down the sombre aisles
in one place far from the section usually traversed by tourists the names becky tom had been found traced upon the rocky wall with candlesmoke and near at hand a greasesoiled bit of ribbon
mrs thatcher recognized the ribbon and cried over it
she said it was the last relic she should ever have of her child and that no other memorial of her could ever be so precious because this one parted latest from the living body before the awful death came
some said that now and then in the cave a faraway speck of light would glimmer and then a glorious shout would burst forth and a score of men go trooping down the echoing aisleand then a sickening disappointment always followed the children were not there it was only a searchers light
three dreadful days and nights dragged their tedious hours along and the village sank into a hopeless stupor
no one had heart for anything
the accidental discovery just made that the proprietor of the temperance tavern kept liquor on his premises scarcely fluttered the public pulse tremendous as the fact was
in a lucid interval huck feebly led up to the subject of taverns and finally askeddimly dreading the worstif anything had been discovered at the temperance tavern since he had been ill yes said the widow
huck started up in bed wildeyed what
what was it liquorand the place has been shut up
lie down childwhat a turn you did give me only tell me just one thingonly just oneplease
was it tom sawyer that found it the widow burst into tears
hush hush child hush
ive told you before you must not talk
you are very very sick then nothing but liquor had been found there would have been a great powwow if it had been the gold
so the treasure was gone forevergone forever
but what could she be crying about
curious that she should cry
these thoughts worked their dim way through hucks mind and under the weariness they gave him he fell asleep
the widow said to herself therehes asleep poor wreck
tom sawyer find it
pity but somebody could find tom sawyer
ah there aint many left now thats got hope enough or strength enough either to go on searching now to return to tom and beckys share in the picnic
they tripped along the murky aisles with the rest of the company visiting the familiar wonders of the cavewonders dubbed with rather overdescriptive names such as the drawingroom the cathedral aladdins palace and so on
presently the hideandseek frolicking began and tom and becky engaged in it with zeal until the exertion began to grow a trifle wearisome then they wandered down a sinuous avenue holding their candles aloft and reading the tangled webwork of names dates postoffice addresses and mottoes with which the rocky walls had been frescoed in candlesmoke
still drifting along and talking they scarcely noticed that they were now in a part of the cave whose walls were not frescoed
they smoked their own names under an overhanging shelf and moved on
presently they came to a place where a little stream of water trickling over a ledge and carrying a limestone sediment with it had in the slowdragging ages formed a laced and ruffled niagara in gleaming and imperishable stone
tom squeezed his small body behind it in order to illuminate it for beckys gratification
he found that it curtained a sort of steep natural stairway which was enclosed between narrow walls and at once the ambition to be a discoverer seized him
becky responded to his call and they made a smokemark for future guidance and started upon their quest
they wound this way and that far down into the secret depths of the cave made another mark and branched off in search of novelties to tell the upper world about
in one place they found a spacious cavern from whose ceiling depended a multitude of shining stalactites of the length and circumference of a mans leg they walked all about it wondering and admiring and presently left it by one of the numerous passages that opened into it
this shortly brought them to a bewitching spring whose basin was incrusted with a frostwork of glittering crystals it was in the midst of a cavern whose walls were supported by many fantastic pillars which had been formed by the joining of great stalactites and stalagmites together the result of the ceaseless waterdrip of centuries
under the roof vast knots of bats had packed themselves together thousands in a bunch the lights disturbed the creatures and they came flocking down by hundreds squeaking and darting furiously at the candles
tom knew their ways and the danger of this sort of conduct
he seized beckys hand and hurried her into the first corridor that offered and none too soon for a bat struck beckys light out with its wing while she was passing out of the cavern
the bats chased the children a good distance but the fugitives plunged into every new passage that offered and at last got rid of the perilous things
tom found a subterranean lake shortly which stretched its dim length away until its shape was lost in the shadows
he wanted to explore its borders but concluded that it would be best to sit down and rest awhile first
now for the first time the deep stillness of the place laid a clammy hand upon the spirits of the children
becky said why i didnt notice but it seems ever so long since i heard any of the others come to think becky we are away down below themand i dont know how far away north or south or east or whichever it is
we couldnt hear them here becky grew apprehensive
i wonder how long weve been down here tom
we better start back yes i reckon we better
praps we better can you find the way tom
its all a mixedup crookedness to me i reckon i could find itbut then the bats
if they put our candles out it will be an awful fix
lets try some other way so as not to go through there well
but i hope we wont get lost
it would be so awful and the girl shuddered at the thought of the dreadful possibilities
they started through a corridor and traversed it in silence a long way glancing at each new opening to see if there was anything familiar about the look of it but they were all strange
every time tom made an examination becky would watch his face for an encouraging sign and he would say cheerily oh its all right
this aint the one but well come to it right away but he felt less and less hopeful with each failure and presently began to turn off into diverging avenues at sheer random in desperate hope of finding the one that was wanted
he still said it was all right but there was such a leaden dread at his heart that the words had lost their ring and sounded just as if he had said all is lost becky clung to his side in an anguish of fear and tried hard to keep back the tears but they would come
at last she said oh tom never mind the bats lets go back that way
we seem to get worse and worse off all the time listen said he
profound silence silence so deep that even their breathings were conspicuous in the hush
tom shouted
the call went echoing down the empty aisles and died out in the distance in a faint sound that resembled a ripple of mocking laughter
oh dont do it again tom it is too horrid said becky
it is horrid but i better becky they might hear us you know and he shouted again
the might was even a chillier horror than the ghostly laughter it so confessed a perishing hope
the children stood still and listened but there was no result
tom turned upon the back track at once and hurried his steps
it was but a little while before a certain indecision in his manner revealed another fearful fact to beckyhe could not find his way back
oh tom you didnt make any marks becky i was such a fool
such a fool
i never thought we might want to come back
noi cant find the way
its all mixed up tom tom were lost
were lost
we never can get out of this awful place
oh why did we ever leave the others she sank to the ground and burst into such a frenzy of crying that tom was appalled with the idea that she might die or lose her reason
he sat down by her and put his arms around her she buried her face in his bosom she clung to him she poured out her terrors her unavailing regrets and the far echoes turned them all to jeering laughter
tom begged her to pluck up hope again and she said she could not
he fell to blaming and abusing himself for getting her into this miserable situation this had a better effect
she said she would try to hope again she would get up and follow wherever he might lead if only he would not talk like that any more
for he was no more to blame than she she said
so they moved on againaimlesslysimply at randomall they could do was to move keep moving
for a little while hope made a show of revivingnot with any reason to back it but only because it is its nature to revive when the spring has not been taken out of it by age and familiarity with failure
byandby tom took beckys candle and blew it out
this economy meant so much
words were not needed
becky understood and her hope died again
she knew that tom had a whole candle and three or four pieces in his pocketsyet he must economize
byandby fatigue began to assert its claims the children tried to pay attention for it was dreadful to think of sitting down when time was grown to be so precious moving in some direction in any direction was at least progress and might bear fruit but to sit down was to invite death and shorten its pursuit
at last beckys frail limbs refused to carry her farther
she sat down
tom rested with her and they talked of home and the friends there and the comfortable beds and above all the light
becky cried and tom tried to think of some way of comforting her but all his encouragements were grown threadbare with use and sounded like sarcasms
fatigue bore so heavily upon becky that she drowsed off to sleep
tom was grateful
he sat looking into her drawn face and saw it grow smooth and natural under the influence of pleasant dreams and byandby a smile dawned and rested there
the peaceful face reflected somewhat of peace and healing into his own spirit and his thoughts wandered away to bygone times and dreamy memories
while he was deep in his musings becky woke up with a breezy little laughbut it was stricken dead upon her lips and a groan followed it
oh how could i sleep
i wish i never never had waked
no
no i dont tom
dont look so
i wont say it again im glad youve slept becky youll feel rested now and well find the way out we can try tom but ive seen such a beautiful country in my dream
i reckon we are going there maybe not maybe not
cheer up becky and lets go on trying they rose up and wandered along hand in hand and hopeless
they tried to estimate how long they had been in the cave but all they knew was that it seemed days and weeks and yet it was plain that this could not be for their candles were not gone yet
a long time after thisthey could not tell how longtom said they must go softly and listen for dripping waterthey must find a spring
they found one presently and tom said it was time to rest again
both were cruelly tired yet becky said she thought she could go a little farther
she was surprised to hear tom dissent
she could not understand it
they sat down and tom fastened his candle to the wall in front of them with some clay
thought was soon busy nothing was said for some time
then becky broke the silence tom i am so hungry tom took something out of his pocket
do you remember this said he
becky almost smiled
its our weddingcake tom yesi wish it was as big as a barrel for its all weve got i saved it from the picnic for us to dream on tom the way grownup people do with weddingcakebut itll be our she dropped the sentence where it was
tom divided the cake and becky ate with good appetite while tom nibbled at his moiety
there was abundance of cold water to finish the feast with
byandby becky suggested that they move on again
tom was silent a moment
then he said becky can you bear it if i tell you something beckys face paled but she thought she could
well then becky we must stay here where theres water to drink
that little piece is our last candle becky gave loose to tears and wailings
tom did what he could to comfort her but with little effect
at length becky said tom well becky theyll miss us and hunt for us yes they will
certainly they will maybe theyre hunting for us now tom why i reckon maybe they are
i hope they are when would they miss us tom when they get back to the boat i reckon tom it might be dark thenwould they notice we hadnt come i dont know
but anyway your mother would miss you as soon as they got home a frightened look in beckys face brought tom to his senses and he saw that he had made a blunder
becky was not to have gone home that night
the children became silent and thoughtful
in a moment a new burst of grief from becky showed tom that the thing in his mind had struck hers alsothat the sabbath morning might be half spent before mrs thatcher discovered that becky was not at mrs harpers
the children fastened their eyes upon their bit of candle and watched it melt slowly and pitilessly away saw the half inch of wick stand alone at last saw the feeble flame rise and fall climb the thin column of smoke linger at its top a moment and thenthe horror of utter darkness reigned
how long afterward it was that becky came to a slow consciousness that she was crying in toms arms neither could tell
all that they knew was that after what seemed a mighty stretch of time both awoke out of a dead stupor of sleep and resumed their miseries once more
tom said it might be sunday nowmaybe monday
he tried to get becky to talk but her sorrows were too oppressive all her hopes were gone
tom said that they must have been missed long ago and no doubt the search was going on
he would shout and maybe some one would come
he tried it but in the darkness the distant echoes sounded so hideously that he tried it no more
the hours wasted away and hunger came to torment the captives again
a portion of toms half of the cake was left they divided and ate it
but they seemed hungrier than before
the poor morsel of food only whetted desire
byandby tom said sh
did you hear that both held their breath and listened
there was a sound like the faintest faroff shout
instantly tom answered it and leading becky by the hand started groping down the corridor in its direction
presently he listened again again the sound was heard and apparently a little nearer
its them said tom theyre coming
come along beckywere all right now the joy of the prisoners was almost overwhelming
their speed was slow however because pitfalls were somewhat common and had to be guarded against
they shortly came to one and had to stop
it might be three feet deep it might be a hundredthere was no passing it at any rate
tom got down on his breast and reached as far down as he could
no bottom
they must stay there and wait until the searchers came
they listened evidently the distant shoutings were growing more distant
a moment or two more and they had gone altogether
the heartsinking misery of it
tom whooped until he was hoarse but it was of no use
he talked hopefully to becky but an age of anxious waiting passed and no sounds came again
the children groped their way back to the spring
the weary time dragged on they slept again and awoke famished and woestricken
tom believed it must be tuesday by this time
now an idea struck him
there were some side passages near at hand
it would be better to explore some of these than bear the weight of the heavy time in idleness
he took a kiteline from his pocket tied it to a projection and he and becky started tom in the lead unwinding the line as he groped along
at the end of twenty steps the corridor ended in a jumpingoff place tom got down on his knees and felt below and then as far around the corner as he could reach with his hands conveniently he made an effort to stretch yet a little farther to the right and at that moment not twenty yards away a human hand holding a candle appeared from behind a rock
tom lifted up a glorious shout and instantly that hand was followed by the body it belonged toinjun joes
tom was paralyzed he could not move
he was vastly gratified the next moment to see the spaniard take to his heels and get himself out of sight
tom wondered that joe had not recognized his voice and come over and killed him for testifying in court
but the echoes must have disguised the voice
without doubt that was it he reasoned
toms fright weakened every muscle in his body
he said to himself that if he had strength enough to get back to the spring he would stay there and nothing should tempt him to run the risk of meeting injun joe again
he was careful to keep from becky what it was he had seen
he told her he had only shouted for luck but hunger and wretchedness rise superior to fears in the long run
another tedious wait at the spring and another long sleep brought changes
the children awoke tortured with a raging hunger
tom believed that it must be wednesday or thursday or even friday or saturday now and that the search had been given over
he proposed to explore another passage
he felt willing to risk injun joe and all other terrors
but becky was very weak
she had sunk into a dreary apathy and would not be roused
she said she would wait now where she was and dieit would not be long
she told tom to go with the kiteline and explore if he chose but she implored him to come back every little while and speak to her and she made him promise that when the awful time came he would stay by her and hold her hand until all was over
tom kissed her with a choking sensation in his throat and made a show of being confident of finding the searchers or an escape from the cave then he took the kiteline in his hand and went groping down one of the passages on his hands and knees distressed with hunger and sick with bodings of coming doom
tuesday afternoon came and waned to the twilight
the village of st petersburg still mourned
the lost children had not been found
public prayers had been offered up for them and many and many a private prayer that had the petitioners whole heart in it but still no good news came from the cave
the majority of the searchers had given up the quest and gone back to their daily avocations saying that it was plain the children could never be found
mrs thatcher was very ill and a great part of the time delirious
people said it was heartbreaking to hear her call her child and raise her head and listen a whole minute at a time then lay it wearily down again with a moan
aunt polly had drooped into a settled melancholy and her gray hair had grown almost white
the village went to its rest on tuesday night sad and forlorn
away in the middle of the night a wild peal burst from the village bells and in a moment the streets were swarming with frantic halfclad people who shouted turn out
turn out
theyre found
theyre found tin pans and horns were added to the din the population massed itself and moved toward the river met the children coming in an open carriage drawn by shouting citizens thronged around it joined its homeward march and swept magnificently up the main street roaring huzzah after huzzah
the village was illuminated nobody went to bed again it was the greatest night the little town had ever seen
during the first halfhour a procession of villagers filed through judge thatchers house seized the saved ones and kissed them squeezed mrs thatchers hand tried to speak but couldntand drifted out raining tears all over the place
aunt pollys happiness was complete and mrs thatchers nearly so
it would be complete however as soon as the messenger dispatched with the great news to the cave should get the word to her husband
tom lay upon a sofa with an eager auditory about him and told the history of the wonderful adventure putting in many striking additions to adorn it withal and closed with a description of how he left becky and went on an exploring expedition how he followed two avenues as far as his kiteline would reach how he followed a third to the fullest stretch of the kiteline and was about to turn back when he glimpsed a faroff speck that looked like daylight dropped the line and groped toward it pushed his head and shoulders through a small hole and saw the broad mississippi rolling by
and if it had only happened to be night he would not have seen that speck of daylight and would not have explored that passage any more
he told how he went back for becky and broke the good news and she told him not to fret her with such stuff for she was tired and knew she was going to die and wanted to
he described how he labored with her and convinced her and how she almost died for joy when she had groped to where she actually saw the blue speck of daylight how he pushed his way out at the hole and then helped her out how they sat there and cried for gladness how some men came along in a skiff and tom hailed them and told them their situation and their famished condition how the men didnt believe the wild tale at first because said they you are five miles down the river below the valley the cave is inthen took them aboard rowed to a house gave them supper made them rest till two or three hours after dark and then brought them home
before daydawn judge thatcher and the handful of searchers with him were tracked out in the cave by the twine clews they had strung behind them and informed of the great news
three days and nights of toil and hunger in the cave were not to be shaken off at once as tom and becky soon discovered
they were bedridden all of wednesday and thursday and seemed to grow more and more tired and worn all the time
tom got about a little on thursday was downtown friday and nearly as whole as ever saturday but becky did not leave her room until sunday and then she looked as if she had passed through a wasting illness
tom learned of hucks sickness and went to see him on friday but could not be admitted to the bedroom neither could he on saturday or sunday
he was admitted daily after that but was warned to keep still about his adventure and introduce no exciting topic
the widow douglas stayed by to see that he obeyed
at home tom learned of the cardiff hill event also that the ragged mans body had eventually been found in the river near the ferrylanding he had been drowned while trying to escape perhaps
about a fortnight after toms rescue from the cave he started off to visit huck who had grown plenty strong enough now to hear exciting talk and tom had some that would interest him he thought
judge thatchers house was on toms way and he stopped to see becky
the judge and some friends set tom to talking and some one asked him ironically if he wouldnt like to go to the cave again
tom said he thought he wouldnt mind it
the judge said well there are others just like you tom ive not the least doubt
but we have taken care of that
nobody will get lost in that cave any more why because i had its big door sheathed with boiler iron two weeks ago and triplelockedand ive got the keys tom turned as white as a sheet
whats the matter boy
here run somebody
fetch a glass of water the water was brought and thrown into toms face
ah now youre all right
what was the matter with you tom oh judge injun joes in the cave within a few minutes the news had spread and a dozen skiffloads of men were on their way to mcdougals cave and the ferryboat well filled with passengers soon followed
tom sawyer was in the skiff that bore judge thatcher
when the cave door was unlocked a sorrowful sight presented itself in the dim twilight of the place
injun joe lay stretched upon the ground dead with his face close to the crack of the door as if his longing eyes had been fixed to the latest moment upon the light and the cheer of the free world outside
tom was touched for he knew by his own experience how this wretch had suffered
his pity was moved but nevertheless he felt an abounding sense of relief and security now which revealed to him in a degree which he had not fully appreciated before how vast a weight of dread had been lying upon him since the day he lifted his voice against this bloodyminded outcast
injun joes bowieknife lay close by its blade broken in two
the great foundationbeam of the door had been chipped and hacked through with tedious labor useless labor too it was for the native rock formed a sill outside it and upon that stubborn material the knife had wrought no effect the only damage done was to the knife itself
but if there had been no stony obstruction there the labor would have been useless still for if the beam had been wholly cut away injun joe could not have squeezed his body under the door and he knew it
so he had only hacked that place in order to be doing somethingin order to pass the weary timein order to employ his tortured faculties
ordinarily one could find half a dozen bits of candle stuck around in the crevices of this vestibule left there by tourists but there were none now
the prisoner had searched them out and eaten them
he had also contrived to catch a few bats and these also he had eaten leaving only their claws
the poor unfortunate had starved to death
in one place near at hand a stalagmite had been slowly growing up from the ground for ages builded by the waterdrip from a stalactite overhead
the captive had broken off the stalagmite and upon the stump had placed a stone wherein he had scooped a shallow hollow to catch the precious drop that fell once in every three minutes with the dreary regularity of a clockticka dessertspoonful once in four and twenty hours
that drop was falling when the pyramids were new when troy fell when the foundations of rome were laid when christ was crucified when the conqueror created the british empire when columbus sailed when the massacre at lexington was news it is falling now it will still be falling when all these things shall have sunk down the afternoon of history and the twilight of tradition and been swallowed up in the thick night of oblivion
has everything a purpose and a mission
did this drop fall patiently during five thousand years to be ready for this flitting human insects need
and has it another important object to accomplish ten thousand years to come
no matter
it is many and many a year since the hapless halfbreed scooped out the stone to catch the priceless drops but to this day the tourist stares longest at that pathetic stone and that slowdropping water when he comes to see the wonders of mcdougals cave
injun joes cup stands first in the list of the caverns marvels even aladdins palace cannot rival it
injun joe was buried near the mouth of the cave and people flocked there in boats and wagons from the towns and from all the farms and hamlets for seven miles around they brought their children and all sorts of provisions and confessed that they had had almost as satisfactory a time at the funeral as they could have had at the hanging
this funeral stopped the further growth of one thingthe petition to the governor for injun joes pardon
the petition had been largely signed many tearful and eloquent meetings had been held and a committee of sappy women been appointed to go in deep mourning and wail around the governor and implore him to be a merciful ass and trample his duty under foot
injun joe was believed to have killed five citizens of the village but what of that
if he had been satan himself there would have been plenty of weaklings ready to scribble their names to a pardonpetition and drip a tear on it from their permanently impaired and leaky waterworks
the morning after the funeral tom took huck to a private place to have an important talk
huck had learned all about toms adventure from the welshman and the widow douglas by this time but tom said he reckoned there was one thing they had not told him that thing was what he wanted to talk about now
hucks face saddened
he said i know what it is
you got into no
and never found anything but whiskey
nobody told me it was you but i just knowed it must a ben you soon as i heard bout that whiskey business and i knowed you hadnt got the money becuz youd a got at me some way or other and told me even if you was mum to everybody else
tom somethings always told me wed never get holt of that swag why huck i never told on that tavernkeeper
you know his tavern was all right the saturday i went to the picnic
dont you remember you was to watch there that night oh yes
why it seems bout a year ago
it was that very night that i follered injun joe to the widders you followed him yesbut you keep mum
i reckon injun joes left friends behind him and i dont want em souring on me and doing me mean tricks
if it hadnt ben for me hed be down in texas now all right then huck told his entire adventure in confidence to tom who had only heard of the welshmans part of it before
well said huck presently coming back to the main question whoever nipped the whiskey in no
nipped the money too i reckonanyways its a goner for us tom huck that money wasnt ever in no
what huck searched his comrades face keenly
tom have you got on the track of that money again huck its in the cave hucks eyes blazed
say it again tom the moneys in the cave tomhonest injun nowis it fun or earnest earnest huckjust as earnest as ever i was in my life
will you go in there with me and help get it out i bet i will
i will if its where we can blaze our way to it and not get lost huck we can do that without the least little bit of trouble in the world good as wheat
what makes you think the moneys huck you just wait till we get in there
if we dont find it ill agree to give you my drum and every thing ive got in the world
i will by jings all rightits a whiz
when do you say right now if you say it
are you strong enough is it far in the cave
i ben on my pins a little three or four days now but i cant walk moren a mile tomleast i dont think i could its about five mile into there the way anybody but me would go huck but theres a mighty short cut that they dont anybody but me know about
huck ill take you right to it in a skiff
ill float the skiff down there and ill pull it back again all by myself
you neednt ever turn your hand over less start right off tom all right
we want some bread and meat and our pipes and a little bag or two and two or three kitestrings and some of these newfangled things they call lucifer matches
i tell you manys the time i wished i had some when i was in there before a trifle after noon the boys borrowed a small skiff from a citizen who was absent and got under way at once
when they were several miles below cave hollow tom said now you see this bluff here looks all alike all the way down from the cave hollowno houses no woodyards bushes all alike
but do you see that white place up yonder where theres been a landslide
well thats one of my marks
well get ashore now they landed
now huck where were astanding you could touch that hole i got out of with a fishingpole
see if you can find it huck searched all the place about and found nothing
tom proudly marched into a thick clump of sumach bushes and said here you are
look at it huck its the snuggest hole in this country
you just keep mum about it
all along ive been wanting to be a robber but i knew id got to have a thing like this and where to run across it was the bother
weve got it now and well keep it quiet only well let joe harper and ben rogers inbecause of course theres got to be a gang or else there wouldnt be any style about it
tom sawyers gangit sounds splendid dont it huck well it just does tom
and wholl we rob oh most anybody
waylay peoplethats mostly the way and kill them no not always
hive them in the cave till they raise a ransom whats a ransom money
you make them raise all they can offn their friends and after youve kept them a year if it aint raised then you kill them
thats the general way
only you dont kill the women
you shut up the women but you dont kill them
theyre always beautiful and rich and awfully scared
you take their watches and things but you always take your hat off and talk polite
they aint anybody as polite as robbersyoull see that in any book
well the women get to loving you and after theyve been in the cave a week or two weeks they stop crying and after that you couldnt get them to leave
if you drove them out theyd turn right around and come back
its so in all the books why its real bully tom
i believe its bettern to be a pirate yes its better in some ways because its close to home and circuses and all that by this time everything was ready and the boys entered the hole tom in the lead
they toiled their way to the farther end of the tunnel then made their spliced kitestrings fast and moved on
a few steps brought them to the spring and tom felt a shudder quiver all through him
he showed huck the fragment of candlewick perched on a lump of clay against the wall and described how he and becky had watched the flame struggle and expire
the boys began to quiet down to whispers now for the stillness and gloom of the place oppressed their spirits
they went on and presently entered and followed toms other corridor until they reached the jumpingoff place the candles revealed the fact that it was not really a precipice but only a steep clay hill twenty or thirty feet high
tom whispered now ill show you something huck he held his candle aloft and said look as far around the corner as you can
do you see that
thereon the big rock over yonderdone with candlesmoke tom its a cross now wheres your number two
under the cross hey
right yonders where i saw injun joe poke up his candle huck huck stared at the mystic sign awhile and then said with a shaky voice tom less git out of here what
and leave the treasure yesleave it
injun joes ghost is round about there certain no it aint huck no it aint
it would hant the place where he diedaway out at the mouth of the cavefive mile from here no tom it wouldnt
it would hang round the money
i know the ways of ghosts and so do you tom began to fear that huck was right
misgivings gathered in his mind
but presently an idea occurred to him lookyhere huck what fools were making of ourselves
injun joes ghost aint a going to come around where theres a cross the point was well taken
it had its effect
tom i didnt think of that
but thats so
its luck for us that cross is
i reckon well climb down there and have a hunt for that box tom went first cutting rude steps in the clay hill as he descended
huck followed
four avenues opened out of the small cavern which the great rock stood in
the boys examined three of them with no result
they found a small recess in the one nearest the base of the rock with a pallet of blankets spread down in it also an old suspender some bacon rind and the wellgnawed bones of two or three fowls
but there was no moneybox
the lads searched and researched this place but in vain
tom said he said under the cross
well this comes nearest to being under the cross
it cant be under the rock itself because that sets solid on the ground they searched everywhere once more and then sat down discouraged
huck could suggest nothing
byandby tom said lookyhere huck theres footprints and some candlegrease on the clay about one side of this rock but not on the other sides
now whats that for
i bet you the money is under the rock
im going to dig in the clay that aint no bad notion tom said huck with animation
toms real barlow was out at once and he had not dug four inches before he struck wood
hey huckyou hear that huck began to dig and scratch now
some boards were soon uncovered and removed
they had concealed a natural chasm which led under the rock
tom got into this and held his candle as far under the rock as he could but said he could not see to the end of the rift
he proposed to explore
he stooped and passed under the narrow way descended gradually
he followed its winding course first to the right then to the left huck at his heels
tom turned a short curve byandby and exclaimed my goodness huck lookyhere it was the treasurebox sure enough occupying a snug little cavern along with an empty powderkeg a couple of guns in leather cases two or three pairs of old moccasins a leather belt and some other rubbish well soaked with the waterdrip
got it at last said huck ploughing among the tarnished coins with his hand
my but were rich tom huck i always reckoned wed get it
its just too good to believe but we have got it sure
saylets not fool around here
lets snake it out
lemme see if i can lift the box it weighed about fifty pounds
tom could lift it after an awkward fashion but could not carry it conveniently
i thought so he said they carried it like it was heavy that day at the hanted house
i noticed that
i reckon i was right to think of fetching the little bags along the money was soon in the bags and the boys took it up to the cross rock
now less fetch the guns and things said huck
no huckleave them there
theyre just the tricks to have when we go to robbing
well keep them there all the time and well hold our orgies there too
its an awful snug place for orgies what orgies i dono
but robbers always have orgies and of course weve got to have them too
come along huck weve been in here a long time
its getting late i reckon
im hungry too
well eat and smoke when we get to the skiff they presently emerged into the clump of sumach bushes looked warily out found the coast clear and were soon lunching and smoking in the skiff
as the sun dipped toward the horizon they pushed out and got under way
tom skimmed up the shore through the long twilight chatting cheerily with huck and landed shortly after dark
now huck said tom well hide the money in the loft of the widows woodshed and ill come up in the morning and well count it and divide and then well hunt up a place out in the woods for it where it will be safe
just you lay quiet here and watch the stuff till i run and hook benny taylors little wagon i wont be gone a minute he disappeared and presently returned with the wagon put the two small sacks into it threw some old rags on top of them and started off dragging his cargo behind him
when the boys reached the welshmans house they stopped to rest
just as they were about to move on the welshman stepped out and said hallo whos that huck and tom sawyer good
come along with me boys you are keeping everybody waiting
herehurry up trot aheadill haul the wagon for you
why its not as light as it might be
got bricks in itor old metal old metal said tom
i judged so the boys in this town will take more trouble and fool away more time hunting up six bits worth of old iron to sell to the foundry than they would to make twice the money at regular work
but thats human naturehurry along hurry along the boys wanted to know what the hurry was about
never mind youll see when we get to the widow douglas huck said with some apprehensionfor he was long used to being falsely accused mr
jones we havent been doing nothing the welshman laughed
well i dont know huck my boy
i dont know about that
aint you and the widow good friends yes
well shes ben good friends to me anyway all right then
what do you want to be afraid for this question was not entirely answered in hucks slow mind before he found himself pushed along with tom into mrs douglas drawingroom
mr jones left the wagon near the door and followed
the place was grandly lighted and everybody that was of any consequence in the village was there
the thatchers were there the harpers the rogerses aunt polly sid mary the minister the editor and a great many more and all dressed in their best
the widow received the boys as heartily as any one could well receive two such looking beings
they were covered with clay and candlegrease
aunt polly blushed crimson with humiliation and frowned and shook her head at tom
nobody suffered half as much as the two boys did however
mr jones said tom wasnt at home yet so i gave him up but i stumbled on him and huck right at my door and so i just brought them along in a hurry and you did just right said the widow
come with me boys she took them to a bedchamber and said now wash and dress yourselves
here are two new suits of clothesshirts socks everything complete
theyre hucksno no thanks huckmr
jones bought one and i the other
but theyll fit both of you
get into them
well waitcome down when you are slicked up enough then she left
huck said tom we can slope if we can find a rope
the window aint high from the ground shucks
what do you want to slope for well i aint used to that kind of a crowd
i cant stand it
i aint going down there tom oh bother
it aint anything
i dont mind it a bit
ill take care of you sid appeared
tom said he auntie has been waiting for you all the afternoon
mary got your sunday clothes ready and everybodys been fretting about you
sayaint this grease and clay on your clothes now mr siddy you jist tend to your own business
whats all this blowout about anyway its one of the widows parties that shes always having
this time its for the welshman and his sons on account of that scrape they helped her out of the other night
and sayi can tell you something if you want to know well what why old mr jones is going to try to spring something on the people here tonight but i overheard him tell auntie today about it as a secret but i reckon its not much of a secret now
everybody knowsthe widow too for all she tries to let on she dont
mr jones was bound huck should be herecouldnt get along with his grand secret without huck you know secret about what sid about huck tracking the robbers to the widows
i reckon mr jones was going to make a grand time over his surprise but i bet you it will drop pretty flat sid chuckled in a very contented and satisfied way
sid was it you that told oh never mind who it was
somebody toldthats enough sid theres only one person in this town mean enough to do that and thats you
if you had been in hucks place youd a sneaked down the hill and never told anybody on the robbers
you cant do any but mean things and you cant bear to see anybody praised for doing good ones
thereno thanks as the widow saysand tom cuffed sids ears and helped him to the door with several kicks
now go and tell auntie if you dareand tomorrow youll catch it some minutes later the widows guests were at the suppertable and a dozen children were propped up at little sidetables in the same room after the fashion of that country and that day
at the proper time mr jones made his little speech in which he thanked the widow for the honor she was doing himself and his sons but said that there was another person whose modesty and so forth and so on
he sprung his secret about hucks share in the adventure in the finest dramatic manner he was master of but the surprise it occasioned was largely counterfeit and not as clamorous and effusive as it might have been under happier circumstances
however the widow made a pretty fair show of astonishment and heaped so many compliments and so much gratitude upon huck that he almost forgot the nearly intolerable discomfort of his new clothes in the entirely intolerable discomfort of being set up as a target for everybodys gaze and everybodys laudations
the widow said she meant to give huck a home under her roof and have him educated and that when she could spare the money she would start him in business in a modest way
toms chance was come
he said huck dont need it
hucks rich nothing but a heavy strain upon the good manners of the company kept back the due and proper complimentary laugh at this pleasant joke
but the silence was a little awkward
tom broke it hucks got money
maybe you dont believe it but hes got lots of it
oh you neednt smilei reckon i can show you
you just wait a minute tom ran out of doors
the company looked at each other with a perplexed interestand inquiringly at huck who was tonguetied
sid what ails tom said aunt polly
hewell there aint ever any making of that boy out
i never tom entered struggling with the weight of his sacks and aunt polly did not finish her sentence
tom poured the mass of yellow coin upon the table and said therewhat did i tell you
half of its hucks and half of its mine the spectacle took the general breath away
all gazed nobody spoke for a moment
then there was a unanimous call for an explanation
tom said he could furnish it and he did
the tale was long but brimful of interest
there was scarcely an interruption from any one to break the charm of its flow
when he had finished mr jones said i thought i had fixed up a little surprise for this occasion but it dont amount to anything now
this one makes it sing mighty small im willing to allow the money was counted
the sum amounted to a little over twelve thousand dollars
it was more than any one present had ever seen at one time before though several persons were there who were worth considerably more than that in property
the reader may rest satisfied that toms and hucks windfall made a mighty stir in the poor little village of st petersburg
so vast a sum all in actual cash seemed next to incredible
it was talked about gloated over glorified until the reason of many of the citizens tottered under the strain of the unhealthy excitement
every haunted house in st petersburg and the neighboring villages was dissected plank by plank and its foundations dug up and ransacked for hidden treasureand not by boys but menpretty grave unromantic men too some of them
wherever tom and huck appeared they were courted admired stared at
the boys were not able to remember that their remarks had possessed weight before but now their sayings were treasured and repeated everything they did seemed somehow to be regarded as remarkable they had evidently lost the power of doing and saying commonplace things moreover their past history was raked up and discovered to bear marks of conspicuous originality
the village paper published biographical sketches of the boys
the widow douglas put hucks money out at six per cent and judge thatcher did the same with toms at aunt pollys request
each lad had an income now that was simply prodigiousa dollar for every weekday in the year and half of the sundays
it was just what the minister gotno it was what he was promisedhe generally couldnt collect it
a dollar and a quarter a week would board lodge and school a boy in those old simple daysand clothe him and wash him too for that matter
judge thatcher had conceived a great opinion of tom
he said that no commonplace boy would ever have got his daughter out of the cave
when becky told her father in strict confidence how tom had taken her whipping at school the judge was visibly moved and when she pleaded grace for the mighty lie which tom had told in order to shift that whipping from her shoulders to his own the judge said with a fine outburst that it was a noble a generous a magnanimous liea lie that was worthy to hold up its head and march down through history breast to breast with george washingtons lauded truth about the hatchet
becky thought her father had never looked so tall and so superb as when he walked the floor and stamped his foot and said that
she went straight off and told tom about it
judge thatcher hoped to see tom a great lawyer or a great soldier some day
he said he meant to look to it that tom should be admitted to the national military academy and afterward trained in the best law school in the country in order that he might be ready for either career or both
huck finns wealth and the fact that he was now under the widow douglas protection introduced him into societyno dragged him into it hurled him into itand his sufferings were almost more than he could bear
the widows servants kept him clean and neat combed and brushed and they bedded him nightly in unsympathetic sheets that had not one little spot or stain which he could press to his heart and know for a friend
he had to eat with a knife and fork he had to use napkin cup and plate he had to learn his book he had to go to church he had to talk so properly that speech was become insipid in his mouth whithersoever he turned the bars and shackles of civilization shut him in and bound him hand and foot
he bravely bore his miseries three weeks and then one day turned up missing
for fortyeight hours the widow hunted for him everywhere in great distress
the public were profoundly concerned they searched high and low they dragged the river for his body
early the third morning tom sawyer wisely went poking among some old empty hogsheads down behind the abandoned slaughterhouse and in one of them he found the refugee
huck had slept there he had just breakfasted upon some stolen odds and ends of food and was lying off now in comfort with his pipe
he was unkempt uncombed and clad in the same old ruin of rags that had made him picturesque in the days when he was free and happy
tom routed him out told him the trouble he had been causing and urged him to go home
hucks face lost its tranquil content and took a melancholy cast
he said dont talk about it tom
ive tried it and it dont work it dont work tom
it aint for me i aint used to it
the widders good to me and friendly but i cant stand them ways
she makes me get up just at the same time every morning she makes me wash they comb me all to thunder she wont let me sleep in the woodshed i got to wear them blamed clothes that just smothers me tom they dont seem to any air git through em somehow and theyre so rotten nice that i cant set down nor lay down nor roll around anywhers i haint slid on a cellardoor forwell it pears to be years i got to go to church and sweat and sweati hate them ornery sermons

its just worry and worry and sweat and sweat and awishing you was dead all the time
now these clothes suits me and this barl suits me and i aint ever going to shake em any more
tom i wouldnt ever got into all this trouble if it hadnt a ben for that money now you just take my sheer of it along with yourn and gimme a tencenter sometimesnot many times becuz i dont give a dern for a thing thout its tollable hard to gitand you go and beg off for me with the widder oh huck you know i cant do that
taint fair and besides if youll try this thing just a while longer youll come to like it like it
yesthe way id like a hot stove if i was to set on it long enough
no tom i wont be rich and i wont live in them cussed smothery houses
i like the woods and the river and hogsheads and ill stick to em too
blame it all
just as wed got guns and a cave and all just fixed to rob here this dern foolishness has got to come up and spile it all tom saw his opportunity lookyhere huck being rich aint going to keep me back from turning robber no
oh goodlicks are you in real deadwood earnest tom just as dead earnest as im sitting here
but huck we cant let you into the gang if you aint respectable you know hucks joy was quenched
cant let me in tom
didnt you let me go for a pirate yes but thats different
a robber is more hightoned than what a pirate isas a general thing
in most countries theyre awful high up in the nobilitydukes and such now tom haint you always ben friendly to me
you wouldnt shet me out would you tom
you wouldnt do that now would you tom huck i wouldnt want to and i dont want tobut what would people say
why theyd say mph
tom sawyers gang
pretty low characters in it theyd mean you huck
you wouldnt like that and i wouldnt huck was silent for some time engaged in a mental struggle
finally he said well ill go back to the widder for a month and tackle it and see if i can come to stand it if youll let me blong to the gang tom all right huck its a whiz
come along old chap and ill ask the widow to let up on you a little huck will you tomnow will you
thats good
if shell let up on some of the roughest things ill smoke private and cuss private and crowd through or bust
when you going to start the gang and turn robbers oh right off
well get the boys together and have the initiation tonight maybe have the which have the initiation whats that its to swear to stand by one another and never tell the gangs secrets even if youre chopped all to flinders and kill anybody and all his family that hurts one of the gang thats gaythats mighty gay tom i tell you well i bet it is
and all that swearings got to be done at midnight in the lonesomest awfulest place you can finda hanted house is the best but theyre all ripped up now well midnights good anyway tom yes so it is
and youve got to swear on a coffin and sign it with blood now thats something like
why its a million times bullier than pirating
ill stick to the widder till i rot tom and if i git to be a reglar ripper of a robber and everybody talking bout it i reckon shell be proud she snaked me in out of the wet conclusion so endeth this chronicle
it being strictly a history of a boy it must stop here the story could not go much further without becoming the history of a man
when one writes a novel about grown people he knows exactly where to stopthat is with a marriage but when he writes of juveniles he must stop where he best can
most of the characters that perform in this book still live and are prosperous and happy
some day it may seem worth while to take up the story of the younger ones again and see what sort of men and women they turned out to be therefore it will be wisest not to reveal any of that part of their lives at present
