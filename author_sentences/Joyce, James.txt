    a portrait of the artist as a young man  by james joyce   contents   chapter i  chapter ii  chapter iii  chapter iv  chapter v   et ignotas animum dimittit in artes ovid metamorphoses viii 
chapter i   once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming down along the road and this moocow that was coming down along the road met a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo  his father told him that story his father looked at him through a glass he had a hairy face
he was baby tuckoo
the moocow came down the road where betty byrne lived she sold lemon platt
o the wild rose blossoms     on the little green place
he sang that song
that was his song
o the green wothe botheth
when you wet the bed first it is warm then it gets cold
his mother put on the oilsheet
that had the queer smell
his mother had a nicer smell than his father
she played on the piano the sailors hornpipe for him to dance
he danced      tralala lala     tralala tralaladdy     tralala lala     tralala lala
uncle charles and dante clapped
they were older than his father and mother but uncle charles was older than dante
dante had two brushes in her press
the brush with the maroon velvet back was for michael davitt and the brush with the green velvet back was for parnell
dante gave him a cachou every time he brought her a piece of tissue paper
the vances lived in number seven
they had a different father and mother
they were eileens father and mother
when they were grown up he was going to marry eileen
he hid under the table
his mother said  o stephen will apologise
dante said  o if not the eagles will come and pull out his eyes      pull out his eyes     apologise     apologise     pull out his eyes
apologise     pull out his eyes     pull out his eyes     apologise
the wide playgrounds were swarming with boys
all were shouting and the prefects urged them on with strong cries
the evening air was pale and chilly and after every charge and thud of the footballers the greasy leather orb flew like a heavy bird through the grey light
he kept on the fringe of his line out of sight of his prefect out of the reach of the rude feet feigning to run now and then
he felt his body small and weak amid the throng of the players and his eyes were weak and watery
rody kickham was not like that he would be captain of the third line all the fellows said
rody kickham was a decent fellow but nasty roche was a stink
rody kickham had greaves in his number and a hamper in the refectory
nasty roche had big hands
he called the friday pudding dogintheblanket
and one day he had asked  what is your name
stephen had answered stephen dedalus
then nasty roche had said  what kind of a name is that
and when stephen had not been able to answer nasty roche had asked  what is your father
stephen had answered  a gentleman
then nasty roche had asked  is he a magistrate
he crept about from point to point on the fringe of his line making little runs now and then
but his hands were bluish with cold
he kept his hands in the side pockets of his belted grey suit
that was a belt round his pocket
and belt was also to give a fellow a belt
one day a fellow said to cantwell  id give you such a belt in a second
cantwell had answered  go and fight your match
give cecil thunder a belt
id like to see you
hed give you a toe in the rump for yourself
that was not a nice expression
his mother had told him not to speak with the rough boys in the college
nice mother
the first day in the hall of the castle when she had said goodbye she had put up her veil double to her nose to kiss him and her nose and eyes were red
but he had pretended not to see that she was going to cry
she was a nice mother but she was not so nice when she cried
and his father had given him two fiveshilling pieces for pocket money
and his father had told him if he wanted anything to write home to him and whatever he did never to peach on a fellow
then at the door of the castle the rector had shaken hands with his father and mother his soutane fluttering in the breeze and the car had driven off with his father and mother on it
they had cried to him from the car waving their hands  goodbye stephen goodbye
goodbye stephen goodbye
he was caught in the whirl of a scrimmage and fearful of the flashing eyes and muddy boots bent down to look through the legs
the fellows were struggling and groaning and their legs were rubbing and kicking and stamping
then jack lawtons yellow boots dodged out the ball and all the other boots and legs ran after
he ran after them a little way and then stopped
it was useless to run on
soon they would be going home for the holidays
after supper in the study hall he would change the number pasted up inside his desk from seventyseven to seventysix
it would be better to be in the study hall than out there in the cold
the sky was pale and cold but there were lights in the castle
he wondered from which window hamilton rowan had thrown his hat on the haha and had there been flowerbeds at that time under the windows
one day when he had been called to the castle the butler had shown him the marks of the soldiers slugs in the wood of the door and had given him a piece of shortbread that the community ate
it was nice and warm to see the lights in the castle
it was like something in a book
perhaps leicester abbey was like that
and there were nice sentences in doctor cornwells spelling book
they were like poetry but they were only sentences to learn the spelling from
wolsey died in leicester abbey     where the abbots buried him
canker is a disease of plants     cancer one of animals
it would be nice to lie on the hearthrug before the fire leaning his head upon his hands and think on those sentences
he shivered as if he had cold slimy water next his skin
that was mean of wells to shoulder him into the square ditch because he would not swop his little snuffbox for wellss seasoned hacking chestnut the conqueror of forty
how cold and slimy the water had been
a fellow had once seen a big rat jump into the scum
mother was sitting at the fire with dante waiting for brigid to bring in the tea
she had her feet on the fender and her jewelly slippers were so hot and they had such a lovely warm smell
dante knew a lot of things
she had taught him where the mozambique channel was and what was the longest river in america and what was the name of the highest mountain in the moon
father arnall knew more than dante because he was a priest but both his father and uncle charles said that dante was a clever woman and a wellread woman
and when dante made that noise after dinner and then put up her hand to her mouth that was heartburn
a voice cried far out on the playground  all in
then other voices cried from the lower and third lines  all in
all in
the players closed around flushed and muddy and he went among them glad to go in
rody kickham held the ball by its greasy lace
a fellow asked him to give it one last but he walked on without even answering the fellow
simon moonan told him not to because the prefect was looking
the fellow turned to simon moonan and said  we all know why you speak
you are mcglades suck
suck was a queer word
the fellow called simon moonan that name because simon moonan used to tie the prefects false sleeves behind his back and the prefect used to let on to be angry
but the sound was ugly
once he had washed his hands in the lavatory of the wicklow hotel and his father pulled the stopper up by the chain after and the dirty water went down through the hole in the basin
and when it had all gone down slowly the hole in the basin had made a sound like that suck
only louder
to remember that and the white look of the lavatory made him feel cold and then hot
there were two cocks that you turned and water came out cold and hot
he felt cold and then a little hot and he could see the names printed on the cocks
that was a very queer thing
and the air in the corridor chilled him too
it was queer and wettish
but soon the gas would be lit and in burning it made a light noise like a little song
always the same and when the fellows stopped talking in the playroom you could hear it
it was the hour for sums
father arnall wrote a hard sum on the board and then said  now then who will win
go ahead york
go ahead lancaster
stephen tried his best but the sum was too hard and he felt confused
the little silk badge with the white rose on it that was pinned on the breast of his jacket began to flutter
he was no good at sums but he tried his best so that york might not lose
father arnalls face looked very black but he was not in a wax he was laughing
then jack lawton cracked his fingers and father arnall looked at his copybook and said  right
bravo lancaster
the red rose wins
come on now york
forge ahead
jack lawton looked over from his side
the little silk badge with the red rose on it looked very rich because he had a blue sailor top on
stephen felt his own face red too thinking of all the bets about who would get first place in elements jack lawton or he
some weeks jack lawton got the card for first and some weeks he got the card for first
his white silk badge fluttered and fluttered as he worked at the next sum and heard father arnalls voice
then all his eagerness passed away and he felt his face quite cool
he thought his face must be white because it felt so cool
he could not get out the answer for the sum but it did not matter
white roses and red roses those were beautiful colours to think of
and the cards for first place and second place and third place were beautiful colours too pink and cream and lavender
lavender and cream and pink roses were beautiful to think of
perhaps a wild rose might be like those colours and he remembered the song about the wild rose blossoms on the little green place
but you could not have a green rose
but perhaps somewhere in the world you could
the bell rang and then the classes began to file out of the rooms and along the corridors towards the refectory
he sat looking at the two prints of butter on his plate but could not eat the damp bread
the tablecloth was damp and limp
but he drank off the hot weak tea which the clumsy scullion girt with a white apron poured into his cup
he wondered whether the scullions apron was damp too or whether all white things were cold and damp
nasty roche and saurin drank cocoa that their people sent them in tins
they said they could not drink the tea that it was hogwash
their fathers were magistrates the fellows said
all the boys seemed to him very strange
they had all fathers and mothers and different clothes and voices
he longed to be at home and lay his head on his mothers lap
but he could not and so he longed for the play and study and prayers to be over and to be in bed
he drank another cup of hot tea and fleming said  whats up
have you a pain or whats up with you
i dont know stephen said
sick in your breadbasket fleming said because your face looks white
it will go away
o yes stephen said
but he was not sick there
he thought that he was sick in his heart if you could be sick in that place
fleming was very decent to ask him
he wanted to cry
he leaned his elbows on the table and shut and opened the flaps of his ears
then he heard the noise of the refectory every time he opened the flaps of his ears
it made a roar like a train at night
and when he closed the flaps the roar was shut off like a train going into a tunnel
that night at dalkey the train had roared like that and then when it went into the tunnel the roar stopped
he closed his eyes and the train went on roaring and then stopping roaring again stopping
it was nice to hear it roar and stop and then roar out of the tunnel again and then stop
then the higher line fellows began to come down along the matting in the middle of the refectory paddy rath and jimmy magee and the spaniard who was allowed to smoke cigars and the little portuguese who wore the woolly cap
and then the lower line tables and the tables of the third line
and every single fellow had a different way of walking
he sat in a corner of the playroom pretending to watch a game of dominos and once or twice he was able to hear for an instant the little song of the gas
the prefect was at the door with some boys and simon moonan was knotting his false sleeves
he was telling them something about tullabeg
then he went away from the door and wells came over to stephen and said  tell us dedalus do you kiss your mother before you go to bed
stephen answered  i do
wells turned to the other fellows and said  o i say heres a fellow says he kisses his mother every night before he goes to bed
the other fellows stopped their game and turned round laughing
stephen blushed under their eyes and said  i do not
wells said  o i say heres a fellow says he doesnt kiss his mother before he goes to bed
they all laughed again
stephen tried to laugh with them
he felt his whole body hot and confused in a moment
what was the right answer to the question
he had given two and still wells laughed
but wells must know the right answer for he was in third of grammar
he tried to think of wellss mother but he did not dare to raise his eyes to wellss face
he did not like wellss face
it was wells who had shouldered him into the square ditch the day before because he would not swop his little snuffbox for wellss seasoned hacking chestnut the conqueror of forty
it was a mean thing to do all the fellows said it was
and how cold and slimy the water had been
and a fellow had once seen a big rat jump plop into the scum
the cold slime of the ditch covered his whole body and when the bell rang for study and the lines filed out of the playrooms he felt the cold air of the corridor and staircase inside his clothes
he still tried to think what was the right answer
was it right to kiss his mother or wrong to kiss his mother
what did that mean to kiss
you put your face up like that to say goodnight and then his mother put her face down
that was to kiss
his mother put her lips on his cheek her lips were soft and they wetted his cheek and they made a tiny little noise kiss
why did people do that with their two faces
sitting in the study hall he opened the lid of his desk and changed the number pasted up inside from seventyseven to seventysix
but the christmas vacation was very far away but one time it would come because the earth moved round always
there was a picture of the earth on the first page of his geography a big ball in the middle of clouds
fleming had a box of crayons and one night during free study he had coloured the earth green and the clouds maroon
that was like the two brushes in dantes press the brush with the green velvet back for parnell and the brush with the maroon velvet back for michael davitt
but he had not told fleming to colour them those colours
fleming had done it himself
he opened the geography to study the lesson but he could not learn the names of places in america
still they were all different places that had different names
they were all in different countries and the countries were in continents and the continents were in the world and the world was in the universe
he turned to the flyleaf of the geography and read what he had written there himself his name and where he was
stephen dedalus     class of elements     clongowes wood college     sallins     county kildare     ireland     europe     the world     the universe   that was in his writing and fleming one night for a cod had written on the opposite page      stephen dedalus is my name     ireland is my nation
clongowes is my dwellingplace     and heaven my expectation
he read the verses backwards but then they were not poetry
then he read the flyleaf from the bottom to the top till he came to his own name
that was he and he read down the page again
what was after the universe
nothing
but was there anything round the universe to show where it stopped before the nothing place began
it could not be a wall but there could be a thin thin line there all round everything
it was very big to think about everything and everywhere
only god could do that
he tried to think what a big thought that must be but he could only think of god
god was gods name just as his name was stephen
dieu was the french for god and that was gods name too and when anyone prayed to god and said dieu then god knew at once that it was a french person that was praying
but though there were different names for god in all the different languages in the world and god understood what all the people who prayed said in their different languages still god remained always the same god and gods real name was god
it made him very tired to think that way
it made him feel his head very big
he turned over the flyleaf and looked wearily at the green round earth in the middle of the maroon clouds
he wondered which was right to be for the green or for the maroon because dante had ripped the green velvet back off the brush that was for parnell one day with her scissors and had told him that parnell was a bad man
he wondered if they were arguing at home about that
that was called politics
there were two sides in it dante was on one side and his father and mr casey were on the other side but his mother and uncle charles were on no side
every day there was something in the paper about it
it pained him that he did not know well what politics meant and that he did not know where the universe ended
he felt small and weak
when would he be like the fellows in poetry and rhetoric
they had big voices and big boots and they studied trigonometry
that was very far away
first came the vacation and then the next term and then vacation again and then again another term and then again the vacation
it was like a train going in and out of tunnels and that was like the noise of the boys eating in the refectory when you opened and closed the flaps of the ears
term vacation tunnel out noise stop
how far away it was
it was better to go to bed to sleep
only prayers in the chapel and then bed
he shivered and yawned
it would be lovely in bed after the sheets got a bit hot
first they were so cold to get into
he shivered to think how cold they were first
but then they got hot and then he could sleep
it was lovely to be tired
he yawned again
night prayers and then bed he shivered and wanted to yawn
it would be lovely in a few minutes
he felt a warm glow creeping up from the cold shivering sheets warmer and warmer till he felt warm all over ever so warm and yet he shivered a little and still wanted to yawn
the bell rang for night prayers and he filed out of the study hall after the others and down the staircase and along the corridors to the chapel
the corridors were darkly lit and the chapel was darkly lit
soon all would be dark and sleeping
there was cold night air in the chapel and the marbles were the colour the sea was at night
the sea was cold day and night but it was colder at night
it was cold and dark under the seawall beside his fathers house
but the kettle would be on the hob to make punch
the prefect of the chapel prayed above his head and his memory knew the responses      o lord open our lips     and our mouths shall announce thy praise
incline unto our aid o god
o lord make haste to help us
there was a cold night smell in the chapel
but it was a holy smell
it was not like the smell of the old peasants who knelt at the back of the chapel at sunday mass
that was a smell of air and rain and turf and corduroy
but they were very holy peasants
they breathed behind him on his neck and sighed as they prayed
they lived in clane a fellow said there were little cottages there and he had seen a woman standing at the halfdoor of a cottage with a child in her arms as the cars had come past from sallins
it would be lovely to sleep for one night in that cottage before the fire of smoking turf in the dark lit by the fire in the warm dark breathing the smell of the peasants air and rain and turf and corduroy
but o the road there between the trees was dark
you would be lost in the dark
it made him afraid to think of how it was
he heard the voice of the prefect of the chapel saying the last prayer
he prayed it too against the dark outside under the trees
visit we beseech thee o lord this habitation and   drive away from it all the snares of the enemy
may   thy holy angels dwell herein to preserve us in peace   and may thy blessing be always upon us through   christ our lord
amen
his fingers trembled as he undressed himself in the dormitory
he told his fingers to hurry up
he had to undress and then kneel and say his own prayers and be in bed before the gas was lowered so that he might not go to hell when he died
he rolled his stockings off and put on his nightshirt quickly and knelt trembling at his bedside and repeated his prayers quickly fearing that the gas would go down
he felt his shoulders shaking as he murmured      god bless my father and my mother and spare them to me
god bless my little brothers and sisters and spare them to me
god bless dante and uncle charles and spare them to me
he blessed himself and climbed quickly into bed and tucking the end of the nightshirt under his feet curled himself together under the cold white sheets shaking and trembling
but he would not go to hell when he died and the shaking would stop
a voice bade the boys in the dormitory goodnight
he peered out for an instant over the coverlet and saw the yellow curtains round and before his bed that shut him off on all sides
the light was lowered quietly
the prefects shoes went away
where
down the staircase and along the corridors or to his room at the end
he saw the dark
was it true about the black dog that walked there at night with eyes as big as carriagelamps
they said it was the ghost of a murderer
a long shiver of fear flowed over his body
he saw the dark entrance hall of the castle
old servants in old dress were in the ironingroom above the staircase
it was long ago
the old servants were quiet
there was a fire there but the hall was still dark
a figure came up the staircase from the hall
he wore the white cloak of a marshal his face was pale and strange he held his hand pressed to his side
he looked out of strange eyes at the old servants
they looked at him and saw their masters face and cloak and knew that he had received his deathwound
but only the dark was where they looked only dark silent air
their master had received his deathwound on the battlefield of prague far away over the sea
he was standing on the field his hand was pressed to his side his face was pale and strange and he wore the white cloak of a marshal
o how cold and strange it was to think of that
all the dark was cold and strange
there were pale strange faces there great eyes like carriagelamps
they were the ghosts of murderers the figures of marshals who had received their deathwound on battlefields far away over the sea
what did they wish to say that their faces were so strange
visit we beseech thee o lord this habitation and drive away from it all
going home for the holidays
that would be lovely the fellows had told him
getting up on the cars in the early wintry morning outside the door of the castle
the cars were rolling on the gravel
cheers for the rector
hurray
hurray
hurray
the cars drove past the chapel and all caps were raised
they drove merrily along the country roads
the drivers pointed with their whips to bodenstown
the fellows cheered
they passed the farmhouse of the jolly farmer
cheer after cheer after cheer
through clane they drove cheering and cheered
the peasant women stood at the halfdoors the men stood here and there
the lovely smell there was in the wintry air the smell of clane rain and wintry air and turf smouldering and corduroy
the train was full of fellows a long long chocolate train with cream facings
the guards went to and fro opening closing locking unlocking the doors
they were men in dark blue and silver they had silvery whistles and their keys made a quick music click click click click
and the train raced on over the flat lands and past the hill of allen
the telegraph poles were passing passing
the train went on and on
it knew
there were lanterns in the hall of his fathers house and ropes of green branches
there were holly and ivy round the pierglass and holly and ivy green and red twined round the chandeliers
there were red holly and green ivy round the old portraits on the walls
holly and ivy for him and for christmas
lovely  all the people
welcome home stephen
noises of welcome
his mother kissed him
was that right
his father was a marshal now higher than a magistrate
welcome home stephen
noises
there was a noise of curtainrings running back along the rods of water being splashed in the basins
there was a noise of rising and dressing and washing in the dormitory a noise of clapping of hands as the prefect went up and down telling the fellows to look sharp
a pale sunlight showed the yellow curtains drawn back the tossed beds
his bed was very hot and his face and body were very hot
he got up and sat on the side of his bed
he was weak
he tried to pull on his stocking
it had a horrid rough feel
the sunlight was queer and cold
fleming said  are you not well
he did not know and fleming said  get back into bed
ill tell mcglade youre not well
hes sick
who is
tell mcglade
get back into bed
is he sick
a fellow held his arms while he loosened the stocking clinging to his foot and climbed back into the hot bed
he crouched down between the sheets glad of their tepid glow
he heard the fellows talk among themselves about him as they dressed for mass
it was a mean thing to do to shoulder him into the square ditch they were saying
then their voices ceased they had gone
a voice at his bed said  dedalus dont spy on us sure you wont
wellss face was there
he looked at it and saw that wells was afraid
i didnt mean to
sure you wont
his father had told him whatever he did never to peach on a fellow
he shook his head and answered no and felt glad
wells said  i didnt mean to honour bright
it was only for cod
im sorry
the face and the voice went away
sorry because he was afraid
afraid that it was some disease
canker was a disease of plants and cancer one of animals or another different
that was a long time ago then out on the playgrounds in the evening light creeping from point to point on the fringe of his line a heavy bird flying low through the grey light
leicester abbey lit up
wolsey died there
the abbots buried him themselves
it was not wellss face it was the prefects
he was not foxing
no no he was sick really
he was not foxing
and he felt the prefects hand on his forehead and he felt his forehead warm and damp against the prefects cold damp hand
that was the way a rat felt slimy and damp and cold
every rat had two eyes to look out of
sleek slimy coats little little feet tucked up to jump black slimy eyes to look out of
they could understand how to jump
but the minds of rats could not understand trigonometry
when they were dead they lay on their sides
their coats dried then
they were only dead things
the prefect was there again and it was his voice that was saying that he was to get up that father minister had said he was to get up and dress and go to the infirmary
and while he was dressing himself as quickly as he could the prefect said  we must pack off to brother michael because we have the collywobbles
he was very decent to say that
that was all to make him laugh
but he could not laugh because his cheeks and lips were all shivery and then the prefect had to laugh by himself
the prefect cried  quick march
hayfoot
strawfoot
they went together down the staircase and along the corridor and past the bath
as he passed the door he remembered with a vague fear the warm turfcoloured bogwater the warm moist air the noise of plunges the smell of the towels like medicine
brother michael was standing at the door of the infirmary and from the door of the dark cabinet on his right came a smell like medicine
that came from the bottles on the shelves
the prefect spoke to brother michael and brother michael answered and called the prefect sir
he had reddish hair mixed with grey and a queer look
it was queer that he would always be a brother
it was queer too that you could not call him sir because he was a brother and had a different kind of look
was he not holy enough or why could he not catch up on the others
there were two beds in the room and in one bed there was a fellow and when they went in he called out  hello
its young dedalus
whats up
the sky is up brother michael said
he was a fellow out of the third of grammar and while stephen was undressing he asked brother michael to bring him a round of buttered toast
ah do
he said
butter you up
said brother michael
youll get your walking papers in the morning when the doctor comes
will i
the fellow said
im not well yet
brother michael repeated  youll get your walking papers
i tell you
he bent down to rake the fire
he had a long back like the long back of a tramhorse
he shook the poker gravely and nodded his head at the fellow out of third of grammar
then brother michael went away and after a while the fellow out of third of grammar turned in towards the wall and fell asleep
that was the infirmary
he was sick then
had they written home to tell his mother and father
but it would be quicker for one of the priests to go himself to tell them
or he would write a letter for the priest to bring
dear mother      i am sick
i want to go home
please come and take me home
i am in     the infirmary
your fond son     stephen   how far away they were
there was cold sunlight outside the window
he wondered if he would die
you could die just the same on a sunny day
he might die before his mother came
then he would have a dead mass in the chapel like the way the fellows had told him it was when little had died
all the fellows would be at the mass dressed in black all with sad faces
wells too would be there but no fellow would look at him
the rector would be there in a cope of black and gold and there would be tall yellow candles on the altar and round the catafalque
and they would carry the coffin out of the chapel slowly and he would be buried in the little graveyard of the community off the main avenue of limes
and wells would be sorry then for what he had done
and the bell would toll slowly
he could hear the tolling
he said over to himself the song that brigid had taught him
dingdong
the castle bell
farewell my mother
bury me in the old churchyard     beside my eldest brother
my coffin shall be black     six angels at my back     two to sing and two to pray     and two to carry my soul away
how beautiful and sad that was
how beautiful the words were where they said bury me in the old churchyard a tremor passed over his body
how sad and how beautiful
he wanted to cry quietly but not for himself for the words so beautiful and sad like music
the bell
the bell
farewell
o farewell
the cold sunlight was weaker and brother michael was standing at his bedside with a bowl of beeftea
he was glad for his mouth was hot and dry
he could hear them playing in the playgrounds
and the day was going on in the college just as if he were there
then brother michael was going away and the fellow out of the third of grammar told him to be sure and come back and tell him all the news in the paper
he told stephen that his name was athy and that his father kept a lot of racehorses that were spiffing jumpers and that his father would give a good tip to brother michael any time he wanted it because brother michael was very decent and always told him the news out of the paper they got every day up in the castle
there was every kind of news in the paper accidents shipwrecks sports and politics
now it is all about politics in the papers he said
do your people talk about that too
yes stephen said
mine too he said
then he thought for a moment and said  you have a queer name dedalus and i have a queer name too athy
my name is the name of a town
your name is like latin
then he asked  are you good at riddles
stephen answered  not very good
then he said  can you answer me this one
why is the county of kildare like the leg of a fellows breeches
stephen thought what could be the answer and then said  i give it up
because there is a thigh in it he said
do you see the joke
athy is the town in the county kildare and a thigh is the other thigh
oh i see stephen said
thats an old riddle he said
after a moment he said  i say
what
asked stephen
you know he said you can ask that riddle another way
can you
said stephen
the same riddle he said
do you know the other way to ask it
no said stephen
can you not think of the other way
he said
he looked at stephen over the bedclothes as he spoke
then he lay back on the pillow and said  there is another way but i wont tell you what it is
why did he not tell it
his father who kept the racehorses must be a magistrate too like saurins father and nasty roches father
he thought of his own father of how he sang songs while his mother played and of how he always gave him a shilling when he asked for sixpence and he felt sorry for him that he was not a magistrate like the other boys fathers
then why was he sent to that place with them
but his father had told him that he would be no stranger there because his granduncle had presented an address to the liberator there fifty years before
you could know the people of that time by their old dress
it seemed to him a solemn time and he wondered if that was the time when the fellows in clongowes wore blue coats with brass buttons and yellow waistcoats and caps of rabbitskin and drank beer like grownup people and kept greyhounds of their own to course the hares with
he looked at the window and saw that the daylight had grown weaker
there would be cloudy grey light over the playgrounds
there was no noise on the playgrounds
the class must be doing the themes or perhaps father arnall was reading out of the book
it was queer that they had not given him any medicine
perhaps brother michael would bring it back when he came
they said you got stinking stuff to drink when you were in the infirmary
but he felt better now than before
it would be nice getting better slowly
you could get a book then
there was a book in the library about holland
there were lovely foreign names in it and pictures of strangelooking cities and ships
it made you feel so happy
how pale the light was at the window
but that was nice
the fire rose and fell on the wall
it was like waves
someone had put coal on and he heard voices
they were talking
it was the noise of the waves
or the waves were talking among themselves as they rose and fell
he saw the sea of waves long dark waves rising and falling dark under the moonless night
a tiny light twinkled at the pierhead where the ship was entering and he saw a multitude of people gathered by the waters edge to see the ship that was entering their harbour
a tall man stood on the deck looking out towards the flat dark land and by the light at the pierhead he saw his face the sorrowful face of brother michael
he saw him lift his hand towards the people and heard him say in a loud voice of sorrow over the waters  he is dead
we saw him lying upon the catafalque
a wail of sorrow went up from the people
parnell
parnell
he is dead
they fell upon their knees moaning in sorrow
and he saw dante in a maroon velvet dress and with a green velvet mantle hanging from her shoulders walking proudly and silently past the people who knelt by the waters edge
a great fire banked high and red flamed in the grate and under the ivytwined branches of the chandelier the christmas table was spread
they had come home a little late and still dinner was not ready but it would be ready in a jiffy his mother had said
they were waiting for the door to open and for the servants to come in holding the big dishes covered with their heavy metal covers
all were waiting uncle charles who sat far away in the shadow of the window dante and mr casey who sat in the easychairs at either side of the hearth stephen seated on a chair between them his feet resting on the toasted boss
mr dedalus looked at himself in the pierglass above the mantelpiece waxed out his moustache ends and then parting his coat tails stood with his back to the glowing fire and still from time to time he withdrew a hand from his coat tail to wax out one of his moustache ends
mr casey leaned his head to one side and smiling tapped the gland of his neck with his fingers
and stephen smiled too for he knew now that it was not true that mr casey had a purse of silver in his throat
he smiled to think how the silvery noise which mr casey used to make had deceived him
and when he had tried to open mr caseys hand to see if the purse of silver was hidden there he had seen that the fingers could not be straightened out and mr casey had told him that he had got those three cramped fingers making a birthday present for queen victoria
mr casey tapped the gland of his neck and smiled at stephen with sleepy eyes and mr dedalus said to him  yes
well now thats all right
o we had a good walk hadnt we john
yes
i wonder if theres any likelihood of dinner this evening
yes o well now we got a good breath of ozone round the head today
ay bedad
he turned to dante and said  you didnt stir out at all mrs riordan
dante frowned and said shortly  no
mr dedalus dropped his coat tails and went over to the sideboard
he brought forth a great stone jar of whisky from the locker and filled the decanter slowly bending now and then to see how much he had poured in
then replacing the jar in the locker he poured a little of the whisky into two glasses added a little water and came back with them to the fireplace
a thimbleful john he said just to whet your appetite
mr casey took the glass drank and placed it near him on the mantelpiece
then he said  well i cant help thinking of our friend christopher manufacturing
he broke into a fit of laughter and coughing and added  manufacturing that champagne for those fellows
mr dedalus laughed loudly
is it christy
he said
theres more cunning in one of those warts on his bald head than in a pack of jack foxes
he inclined his head closed his eyes and licking his lips profusely began to speak with the voice of the hotel keeper
and he has such a soft mouth when hes speaking to you dont you know
hes very moist and watery about the dewlaps god bless him
mr casey was still struggling through his fit of coughing and laughter
stephen seeing and hearing the hotel keeper through his fathers face and voice laughed
mr dedalus put up his eyeglass and staring down at him said quietly and kindly  what are you laughing at you little puppy you
the servants entered and placed the dishes on the table
mrs dedalus followed and the places were arranged
sit over she said
mr dedalus went to the end of the table and said  now mrs riordan sit over
john sit you down my hearty
he looked round to where uncle charles sat and said  now then sir theres a bird here waiting for you
when all had taken their seats he laid his hand on the cover and then said quickly withdrawing it  now stephen
stephen stood up in his place to say the grace before meals  bless us o lord and these thy gifts which through thy bounty we are about to receive through christ our lord
amen  all blessed themselves and mr dedalus with a sigh of pleasure lifted from the dish the heavy cover pearled around the edge with glistening drops
stephen looked at the plump turkey which had lain trussed and skewered on the kitchen table
he knew that his father had paid a guinea for it in dunns of dolier street and that the man had prodded it often at the breastbone to show how good it was and he remembered the mans voice when he had said  take that one sir
thats the real ally daly
why did mr barrett in clongowes call his pandybat a turkey
but clongowes was far away and the warm heavy smell of turkey and ham and celery rose from the plates and dishes and the great fire was banked high and red in the grate and the green ivy and red holly made you feel so happy and when dinner was ended the big plum pudding would be carried in studded with peeled almonds and sprigs of holly with bluish fire running around it and a little green flag flying from the top
it was his first christmas dinner and he thought of his little brothers and sisters who were waiting in the nursery as he had often waited till the pudding came
the deep low collar and the eton jacket made him feel queer and oldish and that morning when his mother had brought him down to the parlour dressed for mass his father had cried
that was because he was thinking of his own father
and uncle charles had said so too
mr dedalus covered the dish and began to eat hungrily
then he said  poor old christy hes nearly lopsided now with roguery
simon said mrs dedalus you havent given mrs riordan any sauce
mr dedalus seized the sauceboat
havent i
he cried
mrs riordan pity the poor blind
dante covered her plate with her hands and said  no thanks
mr dedalus turned to uncle charles
how are you off sir
right as the mail simon
you john
im all right
go on yourself
mary
here stephen heres something to make your hair curl
he poured sauce freely over stephens plate and set the boat again on the table
then he asked uncle charles was it tender
uncle charles could not speak because his mouth was full but he nodded that it was
that was a good answer our friend made to the canon
what
said mr dedalus
i didnt think he had that much in him said mr casey
ill pay your dues father when you cease turning the house of god into a pollingbooth  a nice answer said dante for any man calling himself a catholic to give to his priest
they have only themselves to blame said mr dedalus suavely
if they took a fools advice they would confine their attention to religion
it is religion dante said
they are doing their duty in warning the people
we go to the house of god mr casey said in all humility to pray to our maker and not to hear election addresses
it is religion dante said again
they are right
they must direct their flocks
and preach politics from the altar is it
asked mr dedalus
certainly said dante
it is a question of public morality
a priest would not be a priest if he did not tell his flock what is right and what is wrong
mrs dedalus laid down her knife and fork saying  for pity sake and for pity sake let us have no political discussion on this day of all days in the year
quite right maam said uncle charles
now simon thats quite enough now
not another word now
yes yes said mr dedalus quickly
he uncovered the dish boldly and said  now then whos for more turkey
nobody answered
dante said  nice language for any catholic to use
mrs riordan i appeal to you said mrs dedalus to let the matter drop now
dante turned on her and said  and am i to sit here and listen to the pastors of my church being flouted
nobody is saying a word against them said mr dedalus so long as they dont meddle in politics
the bishops and priests of ireland have spoken said dante and they must be obeyed
let them leave politics alone said mr casey or the people may leave their church alone
you hear
said dante turning to mrs dedalus
mr casey
simon
said mrs dedalus let it end now
too bad
too bad
said uncle charles
what
cried mr dedalus
were we to desert him at the bidding of the english people
he was no longer worthy to lead said dante
he was a public sinner
we are all sinners and black sinners said mr casey coldly
woe be to the man by whom the scandal cometh
said mrs riordan
it would be better for him that a millstone were tied about his neck and that he were cast into the depths of the sea rather than that he should scandalise one of these my least little ones that is the language of the holy ghost
and very bad language if you ask me said mr dedalus coolly
simon
simon
said uncle charles
the boy
yes yes said mr dedalus
i meant about the
i was thinking about the bad language of the railway porter
well now thats all right
here stephen show me your plate old chap
eat away now
here
he heaped up the food on stephens plate and served uncle charles and mr casey to large pieces of turkey and splashes of sauce
mrs dedalus was eating little and dante sat with her hands in her lap
she was red in the face
mr dedalus rooted with the carvers at the end of the dish and said  theres a tasty bit here we call the popes nose
if any lady or gentleman
he held a piece of fowl up on the prong of the carvingfork
nobody spoke
he put it on his own plate saying  well you cant say but you were asked
i think i had better eat it myself because im not well in my health lately
he winked at stephen and replacing the dishcover began to eat again
there was a silence while he ate
then he said  well now the day kept up fine after all
there were plenty of strangers down too
nobody spoke
he said again  i think there were more strangers down than last christmas
he looked round at the others whose faces were bent towards their plates and receiving no reply waited for a moment and said bitterly  well my christmas dinner has been spoiled anyhow
there could be neither luck nor grace dante said in a house where there is no respect for the pastors of the church
mr dedalus threw his knife and fork noisily on his plate
respect
he said
is it for billy with the lip or for the tub of guts up in armagh
respect
princes of the church said mr casey with slow scorn
lord leitrims coachman yes said mr dedalus
they are the lords anointed dante said
they are an honour to their country
tub of guts said mr dedalus coarsely
he has a handsome face mind you in repose
you should see that fellow lapping up his bacon and cabbage of a cold winters day
o johnny
he twisted his features into a grimace of heavy bestiality and made a lapping noise with his lips
really simon you should not speak that way before stephen
its not right
o hell remember all this when he grows up said dante hotlythe language he heard against god and religion and priests in his own home
let him remember too cried mr casey to her from across the table the language with which the priests and the priests pawns broke parnells heart and hounded him into his grave
let him remember that too when he grows up
sons of bitches
cried mr dedalus
when he was down they turned on him to betray him and rend him like rats in a sewer
lowlived dogs
and they look it
by christ they look it
they behaved rightly cried dante
they obeyed their bishops and their priests
honour to them
well it is perfectly dreadful to say that not even for one day in the year said mrs dedalus can we be free from these dreadful disputes
uncle charles raised his hands mildly and said  come now come now come now
can we not have our opinions whatever they are without this bad temper and this bad language
it is too bad surely
mrs dedalus spoke to dante in a low voice but dante said loudly  i will not say nothing
i will defend my church and my religion when it is insulted and spit on by renegade catholics
mr casey pushed his plate rudely into the middle of the table and resting his elbows before him said in a hoarse voice to his host  tell me did i tell you that story about a very famous spit
you did not john said mr dedalus
why then said mr casey it is a most instructive story
it happened not long ago in the county wicklow where we are now
he broke off and turning towards dante said with quiet indignation  and i may tell you maam that i if you mean me am no renegade catholic
i am a catholic as my father was and his father before him and his father before him again when we gave up our lives rather than sell our faith
the more shame to you now dante said to speak as you do
the story john said mr dedalus smiling
let us have the story anyhow
catholic indeed
repeated dante ironically
the blackest protestant in the land would not speak the language i have heard this evening
mr dedalus began to sway his head to and fro crooning like a country singer
i am no protestant i tell you again said mr casey flushing
mr dedalus still crooning and swaying his head began to sing in a grunting nasal tone    o come all you roman catholics   that never went to mass
he took up his knife and fork again in good humour and set to eating saying to mr casey  let us have the story john
it will help us to digest
stephen looked with affection at mr caseys face which stared across the table over his joined hands
he liked to sit near him at the fire looking up at his dark fierce face
but his dark eyes were never fierce and his slow voice was good to listen to
but why was he then against the priests
because dante must be right then
but he had heard his father say that she was a spoiled nun and that she had come out of the convent in the alleghanies when her brother had got the money from the savages for the trinkets and the chainies
perhaps that made her severe against parnell
and she did not like him to play with eileen because eileen was a protestant and when she was young she knew children that used to play with protestants and the protestants used to make fun of the litany of the blessed virgin
tower of ivory they used to say house of gold how could a woman be a tower of ivory or a house of gold
who was right then
and he remembered the evening in the infirmary in clongowes the dark waters the light at the pierhead and the moan of sorrow from the people when they had heard
eileen had long white hands
one evening when playing tig she had put her hands over his eyes long and white and thin and cold and soft
that was ivory a cold white thing
that was the meaning of tower of ivory
the story is very short and sweet mr casey said
it was one day down in arklow a cold bitter day not long before the chief died
may god have mercy on him
he closed his eyes wearily and paused
mr dedalus took a bone from his plate and tore some meat from it with his teeth saying  before he was killed you mean
mr casey opened his eyes sighed and went on  it was down in arklow one day
we were down there at a meeting and after the meeting was over we had to make our way to the railway station through the crowd
such booing and baaing man you never heard
they called us all the names in the world
well there was one old lady and a drunken old harridan she was surely that paid all her attention to me
she kept dancing along beside me in the mud bawling and screaming into my face priesthunter
the paris funds
mr fox
kitty oshea  and what did you do john
asked mr dedalus
i let her bawl away said mr casey
it was a cold day and to keep up my heart i had saving your presence maam a quid of tullamore in my mouth and sure i couldnt say a word in any case because my mouth was full of tobacco juice
well john
well
i let her bawl away to her hearts content kitty oshea and the rest of it till at last she called that lady a name that i wont sully this christmas board nor your ears maam nor my own lips by repeating
he paused
mr dedalus lifting his head from the bone asked  and what did you do john
do
said mr casey
she stuck her ugly old face up at me when she said it and i had my mouth full of tobacco juice
i bent down to her and phth says i to her like that
he turned aside and made the act of spitting
phth says i to her like that right into her eye
he clapped his hand to his eye and gave a hoarse scream of pain
o jesus mary and joseph says she
im blinded
im blinded and drownded  he stopped in a fit of coughing and laughter repeating  im blinded entirely
mr dedalus laughed loudly and lay back in his chair while uncle charles swayed his head to and fro
dante looked terribly angry and repeated while they laughed  very nice
ha
very nice
it was not nice about the spit in the womans eye
but what was the name the woman had called kitty oshea that mr casey would not repeat
he thought of mr casey walking through the crowds of people and making speeches from a wagonette
that was what he had been in prison for and he remembered that one night sergeant oneill had come to the house and had stood in the hall talking in a low voice with his father and chewing nervously at the chinstrap of his cap
and that night mr casey had not gone to dublin by train but a car had come to the door and he had heard his father say something about the cabinteely road
he was for ireland and parnell and so was his father and so was dante too for one night at the band on the esplanade she had hit a gentleman on the head with her umbrella because he had taken off his hat when the band played god save the queen at the end
mr dedalus gave a snort of contempt
ah john he said
it is true for them
we are an unfortunate priestridden race and always were and always will be till the end of the chapter
uncle charles shook his head saying  a bad business
a bad business
mr dedalus repeated  a priestridden godforsaken race
he pointed to the portrait of his grandfather on the wall to his right
do you see that old chap up there john
he said
he was a good irishman when there was no money in the job
he was condemned to death as a whiteboy
but he had a saying about our clerical friends that he would never let one of them put his two feet under his mahogany
dante broke in angrily  if we are a priestridden race we ought to be proud of it
they are the apple of gods eye
touch them not says christ for they are the apple of my eye  and can we not love our country then
asked mr casey
are we not to follow the man that was born to lead us
a traitor to his country
replied dante
a traitor an adulterer
the priests were right to abandon him
the priests were always the true friends of ireland
were they faith
said mr casey
he threw his fist on the table and frowning angrily protruded one finger after another
didnt the bishops of ireland betray us in the time of the union when bishop lanigan presented an address of loyalty to the marquess cornwallis
didnt the bishops and priests sell the aspirations of their country in  in return for catholic emancipation
didnt they denounce the fenian movement from the pulpit and in the confession box
and didnt they dishonour the ashes of terence bellew macmanus
his face was glowing with anger and stephen felt the glow rise to his own cheek as the spoken words thrilled him
mr dedalus uttered a guffaw of coarse scorn
o by god he cried i forgot little old paul cullen
another apple of gods eye
dante bent across the table and cried to mr casey  right
right
they were always right
god and morality and religion come first
mrs dedalus seeing her excitement said to her  mrs riordan dont excite yourself answering them
god and religion before everything
dante cried
god and religion before the world
mr casey raised his clenched fist and brought it down on the table with a crash
very well then he shouted hoarsely if it comes to that no god for ireland
john
john
cried mr dedalus seizing his guest by the coat sleeve
dante stared across the table her cheeks shaking
mr casey struggled up from his chair and bent across the table towards her scraping the air from before his eyes with one hand as though he were tearing aside a cobweb
no god for ireland
he cried
we have had too much god in ireland
away with god
blasphemer
devil
screamed dante starting to her feet and almost spitting in his face
uncle charles and mr dedalus pulled mr casey back into his chair again talking to him from both sides reasonably
he stared before him out of his dark flaming eyes repeating  away with god i say
dante shoved her chair violently aside and left the table upsetting her napkinring which rolled slowly along the carpet and came to rest against the foot of an easychair
mrs dedalus rose quickly and followed her towards the door
at the door dante turned round violently and shouted down the room her cheeks flushed and quivering with rage  devil out of hell
we won
we crushed him to death
fiend
the door slammed behind her
mr casey freeing his arms from his holders suddenly bowed his head on his hands with a sob of pain
poor parnell
he cried loudly
my dead king
he sobbed loudly and bitterly
stephen raising his terrorstricken face saw that his fathers eyes were full of tears
the fellows talked together in little groups
one fellow said  they were caught near the hill of lyons
who caught them
mr gleeson and the minister
they were on a car
the same fellow added  a fellow in the higher line told me
fleming asked  but why did they run away tell us
i know why cecil thunder said
because they had fecked cash out of the rectors room
who fecked it
kickhams brother
and they all went shares in it
but that was stealing
how could they have done that
a fat lot you know about it thunder
wells said
i know why they scut
tell us why
i was told not to wells said
o go on wells all said
you might tell us
we wont let it out
stephen bent forward his head to hear
wells looked round to see if anyone was coming
then he said secretly  you know the altar wine they keep in the press in the sacristy
yes
well they drank that and it was found out who did it by the smell
and thats why they ran away if you want to know
and the fellow who had spoken first said  yes thats what i heard too from the fellow in the higher line
the fellows all were silent
stephen stood among them afraid to speak listening
a faint sickness of awe made him feel weak
how could they have done that
he thought of the dark silent sacristy
there were dark wooden presses there where the crimped surplices lay quietly folded
it was not the chapel but still you had to speak under your breath
it was a holy place
he remembered the summer evening he had been there to be dressed as boatbearer the evening of the procession to the little altar in the wood
a strange and holy place
the boy that held the censer had swung it gently to and fro near the door with the silvery cap lifted by the middle chain to keep the coals lighting
that was called charcoal and it had burned quietly as the fellow had swung it gently and had given off a weak sour smell
and then when all were vested he had stood holding out the boat to the rector and the rector had put a spoonful of incense in it and it had hissed on the red coals
the fellows were talking together in little groups here and there on the playground
the fellows seemed to him to have grown smaller that was because a sprinter had knocked him down the day before a fellow out of second of grammar
he had been thrown by the fellows machine lightly on the cinderpath and his spectacles had been broken in three pieces and some of the grit of the cinders had gone into his mouth
that was why the fellows seemed to him smaller and farther away and the goalposts so thin and far and the soft grey sky so high up
but there was no play on the football grounds for cricket was coming and some said that barnes would be prof and some said it would be flowers
and all over the playgrounds they were playing rounders and bowling twisters and lobs
and from here and from there came the sounds of the cricket bats through the soft grey air
they said pick pack pock puck little drops of water in a fountain slowly falling in the brimming bowl
athy who had been silent said quietly  you are all wrong
all turned towards him eagerly
why
do you know
who told you
tell us athy
athy pointed across the playground to where simon moonan was walking by himself kicking a stone before him
ask him he said
the fellows looked there and then said  why him
is he in it
athy lowered his voice and said  do you know why those fellows scut
i will tell you but you must not let on you know
tell us athy
go on
you might if you know
he paused for a moment and then said mysteriously  they were caught with simon moonan and tusker boyle in the square one night
the fellows looked at him and asked  caught
what doing
athy said  smugging
all the fellows were silent and athy said  and thats why
stephen looked at the faces of the fellows but they were all looking across the playground
he wanted to ask somebody about it
what did that mean about the smugging in the square
why did the five fellows out of the higher line run away for that
it was a joke he thought
simon moonan had nice clothes and one night he had shown him a ball of creamy sweets that the fellows of the football fifteen had rolled down to him along the carpet in the middle of the refectory when he was at the door
it was the night of the match against the bective rangers and the ball was made just like a red and green apple only it opened and it was full of the creamy sweets
and one day boyle had said that an elephant had two tuskers instead of two tusks and that was why he was called tusker boyle but some fellows called him lady boyle because he was always at his nails paring them
eileen had long thin cool white hands too because she was a girl
they were like ivory only soft
that was the meaning of tower of ivory but protestants could not understand it and made fun of it
one day he had stood beside her looking into the hotel grounds
a waiter was running up a trail of bunting on the flagstaff and a fox terrier was scampering to and fro on the sunny lawn
she had put her hand into his pocket where his hand was and he had felt how cool and thin and soft her hand was
she had said that pockets were funny things to have and then all of a sudden she had broken away and had run laughing down the sloping curve of the path
her fair hair had streamed out behind her like gold in the sun
tower of ivory
house of gold by thinking of things you could understand them
but why in the square
you went there when you wanted to do something
it was all thick slabs of slate and water trickled all day out of tiny pinholes and there was a queer smell of stale water there
and behind the door of one of the closets there was a drawing in red pencil of a bearded man in a roman dress with a brick in each hand and underneath was the name of the drawing  balbus was building a wall  some fellow had drawn it there for a cod
it had a funny face but it was very like a man with a beard
and on the wall of another closet there was written in backhand in beautiful writing  julius csar wrote the calico belly  perhaps that was why they were there because it was a place where some fellows wrote things for cod
but all the same it was queer what athy said and the way he said it
it was not a cod because they had run away
he looked with the others across the playground and began to feel afraid
at last fleming said  and we are all to be punished for what other fellows did
i wont come back see if i do cecil thunder said
three days silence in the refectory and sending us up for six and eight every minute
yes said wells
and old barrett has a new way of twisting the note so that you cant open it and fold it again to see how many ferul you are to get
i wont come back too
yes said cecil thunder and the prefect of studies was in second of grammar this morning
let us get up a rebellion fleming said
will we
all the fellows were silent
the air was very silent and you could hear the cricket bats but more slowly than before pick pock
wells asked  what is going to be done to them
simon moonan and tusker are going to be flogged athy said and the fellows in the higher line got their choice of flogging or being expelled
and which are they taking
asked the fellow who had spoken first
all are taking expulsion except corrigan athy answered
hes going to be flogged by mr gleeson
i know why cecil thunder said
he is right and the other fellows are wrong because a flogging wears off after a bit but a fellow that has been expelled from college is known all his life on account of it
besides gleeson wont flog him hard
its best of his play not to fleming said
i wouldnt like to be simon moonan and tusker cecil thunder said
but i dont believe they will be flogged
perhaps they will be sent up for twice nine
no no said athy
theyll both get it on the vital spot
wells rubbed himself and said in a crying voice  please sir let me off
athy grinned and turned up the sleeves of his jacket saying      it cant be helped     it must be done
so down with your breeches     and out with your bum
the fellows laughed but he felt that they were a little afraid
in the silence of the soft grey air he heard the cricket bats from here and from there pock
that was a sound to hear but if you were hit then you would feel a pain
the pandybat made a sound too but not like that
the fellows said it was made of whalebone and leather with lead inside and he wondered what was the pain like
there were different kinds of sounds
a long thin cane would have a high whistling sound and he wondered what was that pain like
it made him shivery to think of it and cold and what athy said too
but what was there to laugh at in it
it made him shivery but that was because you always felt like a shiver when you let down your trousers
it was the same in the bath when you undressed yourself
he wondered who had to let them down the master or the boy himself
o how could they laugh about it that way
he looked at athys rolledup sleeves and knuckly inky hands
he had rolled up his sleeves to show how mr gleeson would roll up his sleeves
but mr gleeson had round shiny cuffs and clean white wrists and fattish white hands and the nails of them were long and pointed
perhaps he pared them too like lady boyle
but they were terribly long and pointed nails
so long and cruel they were though the white fattish hands were not cruel but gentle
and though he trembled with cold and fright to think of the cruel long nails and of the high whistling sound of the cane and of the chill you felt at the end of your shirt when you undressed yourself yet he felt a feeling of queer quiet pleasure inside him to think of the white fattish hands clean and strong and gentle
and he thought of what cecil thunder had said that mr gleeson would not flog corrigan hard
and fleming had said he would not because it was best of his play not to
but that was not why
a voice from far out on the playground cried  all in
and other voices cried  all in
all in
during the writing lesson he sat with his arms folded listening to the slow scraping of the pens
mr harford went to and fro making little signs in red pencil and sometimes sitting beside the boy to show him how to hold his pen
he had tried to spell out the headline for himself though he knew already what it was for it was the last of the book
zeal without prudence is like a ship adrift but the lines of the letters were like fine invisible threads and it was only by closing his right eye tight and staring out of the left eye that he could make out the full curves of the capital
but mr harford was very decent and never got into a wax
all the other masters got into dreadful waxes
but why were they to suffer for what fellows in the higher line did
wells had said that they had drunk some of the altar wine out of the press in the sacristy and that it had been found out who had done it by the smell
perhaps they had stolen a monstrance to run away with and sell it somewhere
that must have been a terrible sin to go in there quietly at night to open the dark press and steal the flashing gold thing into which god was put on the altar in the middle of flowers and candles at benediction while the incense went up in clouds at both sides as the fellow swung the censer and dominic kelly sang the first part by himself in the choir
but god was not in it of course when they stole it
but still it was a strange and a great sin even to touch it
he thought of it with deep awe a terrible and strange sin it thrilled him to think of it in the silence when the pens scraped lightly
but to drink the altar wine out of the press and be found out by the smell was a sin too but it was not terrible and strange
it only made you feel a little sickish on account of the smell of the wine
because on the day when he had made his first holy communion in the chapel he had shut his eyes and opened his mouth and put out his tongue a little and when the rector had stooped down to give him the holy communion he had smelt a faint winy smell off the rectors breath after the wine of the mass
the word was beautiful wine
it made you think of dark purple because the grapes were dark purple that grew in greece outside houses like white temples
but the faint smell of the rectors breath had made him feel a sick feeling on the morning of his first communion
the day of your first communion was the happiest day of your life
and once a lot of generals had asked napoleon what was the happiest day of his life
they thought he would say the day he won some great battle or the day he was made an emperor
but he said  gentlemen the happiest day of my life was the day on which i made my first holy communion
father arnall came in and the latin lesson began and he remained still leaning on the desk with his arms folded
father arnall gave out the themebooks and he said that they were scandalous and that they were all to be written out again with the corrections at once
but the worst of all was flemings theme because the pages were stuck together by a blot and father arnall held it up by a corner and said it was an insult to any master to send him up such a theme
then he asked jack lawton to decline the noun mare and jack lawton stopped at the ablative singular and could not go on with the plural
you should be ashamed of yourself said father arnall sternly
you the leader of the class
then he asked the next boy and the next and the next
nobody knew
father arnall became very quiet more and more quiet as each boy tried to answer it and could not
but his face was blacklooking and his eyes were staring though his voice was so quiet
then he asked fleming and fleming said that the word had no plural
father arnall suddenly shut the book and shouted at him  kneel out there in the middle of the class
you are one of the idlest boys i ever met
copy out your themes again the rest of you
fleming moved heavily out of his place and knelt between the two last benches
the other boys bent over their themebooks and began to write
a silence filled the classroom and stephen glancing timidly at father arnalls dark face saw that it was a little red from the wax he was in
was that a sin for father arnall to be in a wax or was he allowed to get into a wax when the boys were idle because that made them study better or was he only letting on to be in a wax
it was because he was allowed because a priest would know what a sin was and would not do it
but if he did it one time by mistake what would he do to go to confession
perhaps he would go to confession to the minister
and if the minister did it he would go to the rector and the rector to the provincial and the provincial to the general of the jesuits
that was called the order and he had heard his father say that they were all clever men
they could all have become highup people in the world if they had not become jesuits
and he wondered what father arnall and paddy barrett would have become and what mr mcglade and mr gleeson would have become if they had not become jesuits
it was hard to think what because you would have to think of them in a different way with different coloured coats and trousers and with beards and moustaches and different kinds of hats
the door opened quietly and closed
a quick whisper ran through the class the prefect of studies
there was an instant of dead silence and then the loud crack of a pandybat on the last desk
stephens heart leapt up in fear
any boys want flogging here father arnall
cried the prefect of studies
any lazy idle loafers that want flogging in this class
he came to the middle of the class and saw fleming on his knees
hoho
he cried
who is this boy
why is he on his knees
what is your name boy
fleming sir
hoho fleming
an idler of course
i can see it in your eye
why is he on his knees father arnall
he wrote a bad latin theme father arnall said and he missed all the questions in grammar
of course he did
cried the prefect of studies of course he did
a born idler
i can see it in the corner of his eye
he banged his pandybat down on the desk and cried  up fleming
up my boy
fleming stood up slowly
hold out
cried the prefect of studies
fleming held out his hand
the pandybat came down on it with a loud smacking sound one two three four five six
other hand
the pandybat came down again in six loud quick smacks
kneel down
cried the prefect of studies
fleming knelt down squeezing his hands under his armpits his face contorted with pain but stephen knew how hard his hands were because fleming was always rubbing rosin into them
but perhaps he was in great pain for the noise of the pandybat was terrible
stephens heart was beating and fluttering
at your work all of you
shouted the prefect of studies
we want no lazy idle loafers here lazy idle little schemers
at your work i tell you
father dolan will be in to see you every day
father dolan will be in tomorrow
he poked one of the boys in the side with his pandybat saying  you boy
when will father dolan be in again
tomorrow sir said tom furlongs voice
tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow said the prefect of studies
make up your minds for that
every day father dolan
write away
you boy who are you
stephens heart jumped suddenly
dedalus sir
why are you not writing like the others
i my
he could not speak with fright
why is he not writing father arnall
he broke his glasses said father arnall and i exempted him from work
broke
what is this i hear
what is this
your name is
said the prefect of studies
dedalus sir
out here dedalus
lazy little schemer
i see schemer in your face
where did you break your glasses
stephen stumbled into the middle of the class blinded by fear and haste
where did you break your glasses
repeated the prefect of studies
the cinderpath sir
hoho
the cinderpath
cried the prefect of studies
i know that trick
stephen lifted his eyes in wonder and saw for a moment father dolans whitegrey not young face his baldy whitegrey head with fluff at the sides of it the steel rims of his spectacles and his nocoloured eyes looking through the glasses
why did he say he knew that trick
lazy idle little loafer
cried the prefect of studies
broke my glasses
an old schoolboy trick
out with your hand this moment
stephen closed his eyes and held out in the air his trembling hand with the palm upwards
he felt the prefect of studies touch it for a moment at the fingers to straighten it and then the swish of the sleeve of the soutane as the pandybat was lifted to strike
a hot burning stinging tingling blow like the loud crack of a broken stick made his trembling hand crumple together like a leaf in the fire and at the sound and the pain scalding tears were driven into his eyes
his whole body was shaking with fright his arm was shaking and his crumpled burning livid hand shook like a loose leaf in the air
a cry sprang to his lips a prayer to be let off
but though the tears scalded his eyes and his limbs quivered with pain and fright he held back the hot tears and the cry that scalded his throat
other hand
shouted the prefect of studies
stephen drew back his maimed and quivering right arm and held out his left hand
the soutane sleeve swished again as the pandybat was lifted and a loud crashing sound and a fierce maddening tingling burning pain made his hand shrink together with the palms and fingers in a livid quivering mass
the scalding water burst forth from his eyes and burning with shame and agony and fear he drew back his shaking arm in terror and burst out into a whine of pain
his body shook with a palsy of fright and in shame and rage he felt the scalding cry come from his throat and the scalding tears falling out of his eyes and down his flaming cheeks
kneel down cried the prefect of studies
stephen knelt down quickly pressing his beaten hands to his sides
to think of them beaten and swollen with pain all in a moment made him feel so sorry for them as if they were not his own but someone elses that he felt sorry for
and as he knelt calming the last sobs in his throat and feeling the burning tingling pain pressed into his sides he thought of the hands which he had held out in the air with the palms up and of the firm touch of the prefect of studies when he had steadied the shaking fingers and of the beaten swollen reddened mass of palm and fingers that shook helplessly in the air
get at your work all of you cried the prefect of studies from the door
father dolan will be in every day to see if any boy any lazy idle little loafer wants flogging
every day
every day
the door closed behind him
the hushed class continued to copy out the themes
father arnall rose from his seat and went among them helping the boys with gentle words and telling them the mistakes they had made
his voice was very gentle and soft
then he returned to his seat and said to fleming and stephen  you may return to your places you two
fleming and stephen rose and walking to their seats sat down
stephen scarlet with shame opened a book quickly with one weak hand and bent down upon it his face close to the page
it was unfair and cruel because the doctor had told him not to read without glasses and he had written home to his father that morning to send him a new pair
and father arnall had said that he need not study till the new glasses came
then to be called a schemer before the class and to be pandied when he always got the card for first or second and was the leader of the yorkists
how could the prefect of studies know that it was a trick
he felt the touch of the prefects fingers as they had steadied his hand and at first he had thought he was going to shake hands with him because the fingers were soft and firm but then in an instant he had heard the swish of the soutane sleeve and the crash
it was cruel and unfair to make him kneel in the middle of the class then and father arnall had told them both that they might return to their places without making any difference between them
he listened to father arnalls low and gentle voice as he corrected the themes
perhaps he was sorry now and wanted to be decent
but it was unfair and cruel
the prefect of studies was a priest but that was cruel and unfair
and his whitegrey face and the nocoloured eyes behind the steel rimmed spectacles were cruel looking because he had steadied the hand first with his firm soft fingers and that was to hit it better and louder
its a stinking mean thing thats what it is said fleming in the corridor as the classes were passing out in file to the refectory to pandy a fellow for what is not his fault
you really broke your glasses by accident didnt you
nasty roche asked
stephen felt his heart filled by flemings words and did not answer
of course he did
said fleming
i wouldnt stand it
id go up and tell the rector on him
yes said cecil thunder eagerly and i saw him lift the pandybat over his shoulder and hes not allowed to do that
did they hurt you much
nasty roche asked
very much stephen said
i wouldnt stand it fleming repeated from baldyhead or any other baldyhead
its a stinking mean low trick thats what it is
id go straight up to the rector and tell him about it after dinner
yes do
yes do said cecil thunder
yes do
yes go up and tell the rector on him dedalus said nasty roche because he said that hed come in tomorrow again and pandy you
yes yes
tell the rector all said
and there were some fellows out of second of grammar listening and one of them said  the senate and the roman people declared that dedalus had been wrongly punished
it was wrong it was unfair and cruel and as he sat in the refectory he suffered time after time in memory the same humiliation until he began to wonder whether it might not really be that there was something in his face which made him look like a schemer and he wished he had a little mirror to see
but there could not be and it was unjust and cruel and unfair
he could not eat the blackish fish fritters they got on wednesdays in lent and one of his potatoes had the mark of the spade in it
yes he would do what the fellows had told him
he would go up and tell the rector that he had been wrongly punished
a thing like that had been done before by somebody in history by some great person whose head was in the books of history
and the rector would declare that he had been wrongly punished because the senate and the roman people always declared that the men who did that had been wrongly punished
those were the great men whose names were in richmal magnalls questions
history was all about those men and what they did and that was what peter parleys tales about greece and rome were all about
peter parley himself was on the first page in a picture
there was a road over a heath with grass at the side and little bushes and peter parley had a broad hat like a protestant minister and a big stick and he was walking fast along the road to greece and rome
it was easy what he had to do
all he had to do was when the dinner was over and he came out in his turn to go on walking but not out to the corridor but up the staircase on the right that led to the castle
he had nothing to do but that to turn to the right and walk fast up the staircase and in half a minute he would be in the low dark narrow corridor that led through the castle to the rectors room
and every fellow had said that it was unfair even the fellow out of second of grammar who had said that about the senate and the roman people
what would happen
he heard the fellows of the higher line stand up at the top of the refectory and heard their steps as they came down the matting paddy rath and jimmy magee and the spaniard and the portuguese and the fifth was big corrigan who was going to be flogged by mr gleeson
that was why the prefect of studies had called him a schemer and pandied him for nothing and straining his weak eyes tired with the tears he watched big corrigans broad shoulders and big hanging black head passing in the file
but he had done something and besides mr gleeson would not flog him hard and he remembered how big corrigan looked in the bath
he had skin the same colour as the turfcoloured bogwater in the shallow end of the bath and when he walked along the side his feet slapped loudly on the wet tiles and at every step his thighs shook a little because he was fat
the refectory was half empty and the fellows were still passing out in file
he could go up the staircase because there was never a priest or a prefect outside the refectory door
but he could not go
the rector would side with the prefect of studies and think it was a schoolboy trick and then the prefect of studies would come in every day the same only it would be worse because he would be dreadfully waxy at any fellow going up to the rector about him
the fellows had told him to go but they would not go themselves
they had forgotten all about it
no it was best to forget all about it and perhaps the prefect of studies had only said he would come in
no it was best to hide out of the way because when you were small and young you could often escape that way
the fellows at his table stood up
he stood up and passed out among them in the file
he had to decide
he was coming near the door
if he went on with the fellows he could never go up to the rector because he could not leave the playground for that
and if he went and was pandied all the same all the fellows would make fun and talk about young dedalus going up to the rector to tell on the prefect of studies
he was walking down along the matting and he saw the door before him
it was impossible he could not
he thought of the baldy head of the prefect of studies with the cruel nocoloured eyes looking at him and he heard the voice of the prefect of studies asking him twice what his name was
why could he not remember the name when he was told the first time
was he not listening the first time or was it to make fun out of the name
the great men in the history had names like that and nobody made fun of them
it was his own name that he should have made fun of if he wanted to make fun
dolan it was like the name of a woman who washed clothes
he had reached the door and turning quickly up to the right walked up the stairs and before he could make up his mind to come back he had entered the low dark narrow corridor that led to the castle
and as he crossed the threshold of the door of the corridor he saw without turning his head to look that all the fellows were looking after him as they went filing by
he passed along the narrow dark corridor passing little doors that were the doors of the rooms of the community
he peered in front of him and right and left through the gloom and thought that those must be portraits
it was dark and silent and his eyes were weak and tired with tears so that he could not see
but he thought they were the portraits of the saints and great men of the order who were looking down on him silently as he passed saint ignatius loyola holding an open book and pointing to the words ad majorem dei gloriam in it saint francis xavier pointing to his chest lorenzo ricci with his berretta on his head like one of the prefects of the lines the three patrons of holy youth saint stanislaus kostka saint aloysius gonzago and blessed john berchmans all with young faces because they died when they were young and father peter kenny sitting in a chair wrapped in a big cloak
he came out on the landing above the entrance hall and looked about him
that was where hamilton rowan had passed and the marks of the soldiers slugs were there
and it was there that the old servants had seen the ghost in the white cloak of a marshal
an old servant was sweeping at the end of the landing
he asked him where was the rectors room and the old servant pointed to the door at the far end and looked after him as he went on to it and knocked
there was no answer
he knocked again more loudly and his heart jumped when he heard a muffled voice say  come in
he turned the handle and opened the door and fumbled for the handle of the green baize door inside
he found it and pushed it open and went in
he saw the rector sitting at a desk writing
there was a skull on the desk and a strange solemn smell in the room like the old leather of chairs
his heart was beating fast on account of the solemn place he was in and the silence of the room and he looked at the skull and at the rectors kindlooking face
well my little man said the rector what is it
stephen swallowed down the thing in his throat and said  i broke my glasses sir
the rector opened his mouth and said  o
then he smiled and said  well if we broke our glasses we must write home for a new pair
i wrote home sir said stephen and father arnall said i am not to study till they come
quite right
said the rector
stephen swallowed down the thing again and tried to keep his legs and his voice from shaking
but sir  yes
father dolan came in today and pandied me because i was not writing my theme
the rector looked at him in silence and he could feel the blood rising to his face and the tears about to rise to his eyes
the rector said  your name is dedalus isnt it
yes sir
and where did you break your glasses
on the cinderpath sir
a fellow was coming out of the bicycle house and i fell and they got broken
i dont know the fellows name
the rector looked at him again in silence
then he smiled and said  o well it was a mistake i am sure father dolan did not know
but i told him i broke them sir and he pandied me
did you tell him that you had written home for a new pair
the rector asked
no sir
o well then said the rector father dolan did not understand
you can say that i excuse you from your lessons for a few days
stephen said quickly for fear his trembling would prevent him  yes sir but father dolan said he will come in tomorrow to pandy me again for it
very well the rector said it is a mistake and i shall speak to father dolan myself
will that do now
stephen felt the tears wetting his eyes and murmured  o yes sir thanks
the rector held his hand across the side of the desk where the skull was and stephen placing his hand in it for a moment felt a cool moist palm
good day now said the rector withdrawing his hand and bowing
good day sir said stephen
he bowed and walked quietly out of the room closing the doors carefully and slowly
but when he had passed the old servant on the landing and was again in the low narrow dark corridor he began to walk faster and faster
faster and faster he hurried on through the gloom excitedly
he bumped his elbow against the door at the end and hurrying down the staircase walked quickly through the two corridors and out into the air
he could hear the cries of the fellows on the playgrounds
he broke into a run and running quicker and quicker ran across the cinderpath and reached the third line playground panting
the fellows had seen him running
they closed round him in a ring pushing one against another to hear
tell us
tell us
what did he say
did you go in
what did he say
tell us
tell us
he told them what he had said and what the rector had said and when he had told them all the fellows flung their caps spinning up into the air and cried  hurroo
they caught their caps and sent them up again spinning skyhigh and cried again  hurroo
hurroo
they made a cradle of their locked hands and hoisted him up among them and carried him along till he struggled to get free
and when he had escaped from them they broke away in all directions flinging their caps again into the air and whistling as they went spinning up and crying  hurroo
and they gave three groans for baldyhead dolan and three cheers for conmee and they said he was the decentest rector that was ever in clongowes
the cheers died away in the soft grey air
he was alone
he was happy and free but he would not be anyway proud with father dolan
he would be very quiet and obedient and he wished that he could do something kind for him to show him that he was not proud
the air was soft and grey and mild and evening was coming
there was the smell of evening in the air the smell of the fields in the country where they digged up turnips to peel them and eat them when they went out for a walk to major bartons the smell there was in the little wood beyond the pavilion where the gallnuts were
the fellows were practising long shies and bowling lobs and slow twisters
in the soft grey silence he could hear the bump of the balls and from here and from there through the quiet air the sound of the cricket bats pick pack pock puck like drops of water in a fountain falling softly in the brimming bowl
chapter ii   uncle charles smoked such black twist that at last his nephew suggested to him to enjoy his morning smoke in a little outhouse at the end of the garden
very good simon
all serene simon said the old man tranquilly
anywhere you like
the outhouse will do me nicely it will be more salubrious
damn me said mr dedalus frankly if i know how you can smoke such villainous awful tobacco
its like gunpowder by god
its very nice simon replied the old man
very cool and mollifying
every morning therefore uncle charles repaired to his outhouse but not before he had greased and brushed scrupulously his back hair and brushed and put on his tall hat
while he smoked the brim of his tall hat and the bowl of his pipe were just visible beyond the jambs of the outhouse door
his arbour as he called the reeking outhouse which he shared with the cat and the garden tools served him also as a soundingbox and every morning he hummed contentedly one of his favourite songs o twine me a bower or blue eyes and golden hair or the groves of blarney while the grey and blue coils of smoke rose slowly from his pipe and vanished in the pure air
during the first part of the summer in blackrock uncle charles was stephens constant companion
uncle charles was a hale old man with a well tanned skin rugged features and white side whiskers
on week days he did messages between the house in carysfort avenue and those shops in the main street of the town with which the family dealt
stephen was glad to go with him on these errands for uncle charles helped him very liberally to handfuls of whatever was exposed in open boxes and barrels outside the counter
he would seize a handful of grapes and sawdust or three or four american apples and thrust them generously into his grandnephews hand while the shopman smiled uneasily and on stephens feigning reluctance to take them he would frown and say  take them sir
do you hear me sir
theyre good for your bowels
when the order list had been booked the two would go on to the park where an old friend of stephens father mike flynn would be found seated on a bench waiting for them
then would begin stephens run round the park
mike flynn would stand at the gate near the railway station watch in hand while stephen ran round the track in the style mike flynn favoured his head high lifted his knees well lifted and his hands held straight down by his sides
when the morning practice was over the trainer would make his comments and sometimes illustrate them by shuffling along for a yard or so comically in an old pair of blue canvas shoes
a small ring of wonderstruck children and nursemaids would gather to watch him and linger even when he and uncle charles had sat down again and were talking athletics and politics
though he had heard his father say that mike flynn had put some of the best runners of modern times through his hands stephen often glanced at his trainers flabby stubblecovered face as it bent over the long stained fingers through which he rolled his cigarette and with pity at the mild lustreless blue eyes which would look up suddenly from the task and gaze vaguely into the blue distance while the long swollen fingers ceased their rolling and grains and fibres of tobacco fell back into the pouch
on the way home uncle charles would often pay a visit to the chapel and as the font was above stephens reach the old man would dip his hand and then sprinkle the water briskly about stephens clothes and on the floor of the porch
while he prayed he knelt on his red handkerchief and read above his breath from a thumb blackened prayerbook wherein catchwords were printed at the foot of every page
stephen knelt at his side respecting though he did not share his piety
he often wondered what his granduncle prayed for so seriously
perhaps he prayed for the souls in purgatory or for the grace of a happy death or perhaps he prayed that god might send him back a part of the big fortune he had squandered in cork
on sundays stephen with his father and his granduncle took their constitutional
the old man was a nimble walker in spite of his corns and often ten or twelve miles of the road were covered
the little village of stillorgan was the parting of the ways
either they went to the left towards the dublin mountains or along the goatstown road and thence into dundrum coming home by sandyford
trudging along the road or standing in some grimy wayside public house his elders spoke constantly of the subjects nearer their hearts of irish politics of munster and of the legends of their own family to all of which stephen lent an avid ear
words which he did not understand he said over and over to himself till he had learnt them by heart and through them he had glimpses of the real world about them
the hour when he too would take part in the life of that world seemed drawing near and in secret he began to make ready for the great part which he felt awaited him the nature of which he only dimly apprehended
his evenings were his own and he pored over a ragged translation of the count of monte cristo
the figure of that dark avenger stood forth in his mind for whatever he had heard or divined in childhood of the strange and terrible
at night he built up on the parlour table an image of the wonderful island cave out of transfers and paper flowers and coloured tissue paper and strips of the silver and golden paper in which chocolate is wrapped
when he had broken up this scenery weary of its tinsel there would come to his mind the bright picture of marseilles of sunny trellises and of mercedes
outside blackrock on the road that led to the mountains stood a small whitewashed house in the garden of which grew many rosebushes and in this house he told himself another mercedes lived
both on the outward and on the homeward journey he measured distance by this landmark and in his imagination he lived through a long train of adventures marvellous as those in the book itself towards the close of which there appeared an image of himself grown older and sadder standing in a moonlit garden with mercedes who had so many years before slighted his love and with a sadly proud gesture of refusal saying  madam i never eat muscatel grapes
he became the ally of a boy named aubrey mills and founded with him a gang of adventurers in the avenue
aubrey carried a whistle dangling from his buttonhole and a bicycle lamp attached to his belt while the others had short sticks thrust daggerwise through theirs
stephen who had read of napoleons plain style of dress chose to remain unadorned and thereby heightened for himself the pleasure of taking counsel with his lieutenant before giving orders
the gang made forays into the gardens of old maids or went down to the castle and fought a battle on the shaggy weedgrown rocks coming home after it weary stragglers with the stale odours of the foreshore in their nostrils and the rank oils of the seawrack upon their hands and in their hair
aubrey and stephen had a common milkman and often they drove out in the milkcar to carrickmines where the cows were at grass
while the men were milking the boys would take turns in riding the tractable mare round the field
but when autumn came the cows were driven home from the grass and the first sight of the filthy cowyard at stradbrook with its foul green puddles and clots of liquid dung and steaming bran troughs sickened stephens heart
the cattle which had seemed so beautiful in the country on sunny days revolted him and he could not even look at the milk they yielded
the coming of september did not trouble him this year for he was not to be sent back to clongowes
the practice in the park came to an end when mike flynn went into hospital
aubrey was at school and had only an hour or two free in the evening
the gang fell asunder and there were no more nightly forays or battles on the rocks
stephen sometimes went round with the car which delivered the evening milk and these chilly drives blew away his memory of the filth of the cowyard and he felt no repugnance at seeing the cow hairs and hayseeds on the milkmans coat
whenever the car drew up before a house he waited to catch a glimpse of a well scrubbed kitchen or of a softly lighted hall and to see how the servant would hold the jug and how she would close the door
he thought it should be a pleasant life enough driving along the roads every evening to deliver milk if he had warm gloves and a fat bag of gingernuts in his pocket to eat from
but the same foreknowledge which had sickened his heart and made his legs sag suddenly as he raced round the park the same intuition which had made him glance with mistrust at his trainers flabby stubblecovered face as it bent heavily over his long stained fingers dissipated any vision of the future
in a vague way he understood that his father was in trouble and that this was the reason why he himself had not been sent back to clongowes
for some time he had felt the slight change in his house and those changes in what he had deemed unchangeable were so many slight shocks to his boyish conception of the world
the ambition which he felt astir at times in the darkness of his soul sought no outlet
a dusk like that of the outer world obscured his mind as he heard the mares hoofs clattering along the tramtrack on the rock road and the great can swaying and rattling behind him
he returned to mercedes and as he brooded upon her image a strange unrest crept into his blood
sometimes a fever gathered within him and led him to rove alone in the evening along the quiet avenue
the peace of the gardens and the kindly lights in the windows poured a tender influence into his restless heart
the noise of children at play annoyed him and their silly voices made him feel even more keenly than he had felt at clongowes that he was different from others
he did not want to play
he wanted to meet in the real world the unsubstantial image which his soul so constantly beheld
he did not know where to seek it or how but a premonition which led him on told him that this image would without any overt act of his encounter him
they would meet quietly as if they had known each other and had made their tryst perhaps at one of the gates or in some more secret place
they would be alone surrounded by darkness and silence and in that moment of supreme tenderness he would be transfigured
he would fade into something impalpable under her eyes and then in a moment he would be transfigured
weakness and timidity and inexperience would fall from him in that magic moment
two great yellow caravans had halted one morning before the door and men had come tramping into the house to dismantle it
the furniture had been hustled out through the front garden which was strewn with wisps of straw and rope ends and into the huge vans at the gate
when all had been safely stowed the vans had set off noisily down the avenue and from the window of the railway carriage in which he had sat with his redeyed mother stephen had seen them lumbering along the merrion road
the parlour fire would not draw that evening and mr dedalus rested the poker against the bars of the grate to attract the flame
uncle charles dozed in a corner of the half furnished uncarpeted room and near him the family portraits leaned against the wall
the lamp on the table shed a weak light over the boarded floor muddied by the feet of the vanmen
stephen sat on a footstool beside his father listening to a long and incoherent monologue
he understood little or nothing of it at first but he became slowly aware that his father had enemies and that some fight was going to take place
he felt too that he was being enlisted for the fight that some duty was being laid upon his shoulders
the sudden flight from the comfort and reverie of blackrock the passage through the gloomy foggy city the thought of the bare cheerless house in which they were now to live made his heart heavy and again an intuition a foreknowledge of the future came to him
he understood also why the servants had often whispered together in the hall and why his father had often stood on the hearthrug with his back to the fire talking loudly to uncle charles who urged him to sit down and eat his dinner
theres a crack of the whip left in me yet stephen old chap said mr dedalus poking at the dull fire with fierce energy
were not dead yet sonny
no by the lord jesus god forgive me nor half dead
dublin was a new and complex sensation
uncle charles had grown so witless that he could no longer be sent out on errands and the disorder in settling in the new house left stephen freer than he had been in blackrock
in the beginning he contented himself with circling timidly round the neighbouring square or at most going half way down one of the side streets but when he had made a skeleton map of the city in his mind he followed boldly one of its central lines until he reached the custom house
he passed unchallenged among the docks and along the quays wondering at the multitude of corks that lay bobbing on the surface of the water in a thick yellow scum at the crowds of quay porters and the rumbling carts and the illdressed bearded policeman
the vastness and strangeness of the life suggested to him by the bales of merchandise stocked along the walls or swung aloft out of the holds of steamers wakened again in him the unrest which had sent him wandering in the evening from garden to garden in search of mercedes
and amid this new bustling life he might have fancied himself in another marseilles but that he missed the bright sky and the sunwarmed trellises of the wineshops
a vague dissatisfaction grew up within him as he looked on the quays and on the river and on the lowering skies and yet he continued to wander up and down day after day as if he really sought someone that eluded him
he went once or twice with his mother to visit their relatives and though they passed a jovial array of shops lit up and adorned for christmas his mood of embittered silence did not leave him
the causes of his embitterment were many remote and near
he was angry with himself for being young and the prey of restless foolish impulses angry also with the change of fortune which was reshaping the world about him into a vision of squalor and insincerity
yet his anger lent nothing to the vision
he chronicled with patience what he saw detaching himself from it and tasting its mortifying flavour in secret
he was sitting on the backless chair in his aunts kitchen
a lamp with a reflector hung on the japanned wall of the fireplace and by its light his aunt was reading the evening paper that lay on her knees
she looked a long time at a smiling picture that was set in it and said musingly  the beautiful mabel hunter
a ringletted girl stood on tiptoe to peer at the picture and said softly  what is she in mud
in a pantomime love
the child leaned her ringletted head against her mothers sleeve gazing on the picture and murmured as if fascinated  the beautiful mabel hunter
as if fascinated her eyes rested long upon those demurely taunting eyes and she murmured devotedly  isnt she an exquisite creature
and the boy who came in from the street stamping crookedly under his stone of coal heard her words
he dropped his load promptly on the floor and hurried to her side to see
he mauled the edges of the paper with his reddened and blackened hands shouldering her aside and complaining that he could not see
he was sitting in the narrow breakfast room high up in the old darkwindowed house
the firelight flickered on the wall and beyond the window a spectral dusk was gathering upon the river
before the fire an old woman was busy making tea and as she bustled at the task she told in a low voice of what the priest and the doctor had said
she told too of certain changes they had seen in her of late and of her odd ways and sayings
he sat listening to the words and following the ways of adventure that lay open in the coals arches and vaults and winding galleries and jagged caverns
suddenly he became aware of something in the doorway
a skull appeared suspended in the gloom of the doorway
a feeble creature like a monkey was there drawn thither by the sound of voices at the fire
a whining voice came from the door asking  is that josephine
the old bustling woman answered cheerily from the fireplace  no ellen its stephen
o o good evening stephen
he answered the greeting and saw a silly smile break over the face in the doorway
do you want anything ellen
asked the old woman at the fire
but she did not answer the question and said  i thought it was josephine
i thought you were josephine stephen
and repeating this several times she fell to laughing feebly
he was sitting in the midst of a childrens party at harolds cross
his silent watchful manner had grown upon him and he took little part in the games
the children wearing the spoils of their crackers danced and romped noisily and though he tried to share their merriment he felt himself a gloomy figure amid the gay cocked hats and sunbonnets
but when he had sung his song and withdrawn into a snug corner of the room he began to taste the joy of his loneliness
the mirth which in the beginning of the evening had seemed to him false and trivial was like a soothing air to him passing gaily by his senses hiding from other eyes the feverish agitation of his blood while through the circling of the dancers and amid the music and laughter her glance travelled to his corner flattering taunting searching exciting his heart
in the hall the children who had stayed latest were putting on their things the party was over
she had thrown a shawl about her and as they went together towards the tram sprays of her fresh warm breath flew gaily above her cowled head and her shoes tapped blithely on the glassy road
it was the last tram
the lank brown horses knew it and shook their bells to the clear night in admonition
the conductor talked with the driver both nodding often in the green light of the lamp
on the empty seats of the tram were scattered a few coloured tickets
no sound of footsteps came up or down the road
no sound broke the peace of the night save when the lank brown horses rubbed their noses together and shook their bells
they seemed to listen he on the upper step and she on the lower
she came up to his step many times and went down to hers again between their phrases and once or twice stood close beside him for some moments on the upper step forgetting to go down and then went down
his heart danced upon her movements like a cork upon a tide
he heard what her eyes said to him from beneath their cowl and knew that in some dim past whether in life or reverie he had heard their tale before
he saw her urge her vanities her fine dress and sash and long black stockings and knew that he had yielded to them a thousand times
yet a voice within him spoke above the noise of his dancing heart asking him would he take her gift to which he had only to stretch out his hand
and he remembered the day when he and eileen had stood looking into the hotel grounds watching the waiters running up a trail of bunting on the flagstaff and the fox terrier scampering to and fro on the sunny lawn and how all of a sudden she had broken out into a peal of laughter and had run down the sloping curve of the path
now as then he stood listlessly in his place seemingly a tranquil watcher of the scene before him
she too wants me to catch hold of her he thought
thats why she came with me to the tram
i could easily catch hold of her when she comes up to my step nobody is looking
i could hold her and kiss her
but he did neither and when he was sitting alone in the deserted tram he tore his ticket into shreds and stared gloomily at the corrugated footboard
the next day he sat at his table in the bare upper room for many hours
before him lay a new pen a new bottle of ink and a new emerald exercise
from force of habit he had written at the top of the first page the initial letters of the jesuit motto amdg
on the first line of the page appeared the title of the verses he was trying to write to e c
he knew it was right to begin so for he had seen similar titles in the collected poems of lord byron
when he had written this title and drawn an ornamental line underneath he fell into a daydream and began to draw diagrams on the cover of the book
he saw himself sitting at his table in bray the morning after the discussion at the christmas dinner table trying to write a poem about parnell on the back of one of his fathers second moiety notices
but his brain had then refused to grapple with the theme and desisting he had covered the page with the names and addresses of certain of his classmates      roderick kickham     john lawton     anthony macswiney     simon moonan   now it seemed as if he would fail again but by dint of brooding on the incident he thought himself into confidence
during this process all those elements which he deemed common and insignificant fell out of the scene
there remained no trace of the tram itself nor of the trammen nor of the horses nor did he and she appear vividly
the verses told only of the night and the balmy breeze and the maiden lustre of the moon
some undefined sorrow was hidden in the hearts of the protagonists as they stood in silence beneath the leafless trees and when the moment of farewell had come the kiss which had been withheld by one was given by both
after this the letters l d s were written at the foot of the page and having hidden the book he went into his mothers bedroom and gazed at his face for a long time in the mirror of her dressingtable
but his long spell of leisure and liberty was drawing to its end
one evening his father came home full of news which kept his tongue busy all through dinner
stephen had been awaiting his fathers return for there had been mutton hash that day and he knew that his father would make him dip his bread in the gravy
but he did not relish the hash for the mention of clongowes had coated his palate with a scum of disgust
i walked bang into him said mr dedalus for the fourth time just at the corner of the square
then i suppose said mrs dedalus he will be able to arrange it
i mean about belvedere
of course he will said mr dedalus
dont i tell you hes provincial of the order now
i never liked the idea of sending him to the christian brothers myself said mrs dedalus
christian brothers be damned
said mr dedalus
is it with paddy stink and micky mud
no let him stick to the jesuits in gods name since he began with them
theyll be of service to him in after years
those are the fellows that can get you a position
and theyre a very rich order arent they simon
rather
they live well i tell you
you saw their table at clongowes
fed up by god like gamecocks
mr dedalus pushed his plate over to stephen and bade him finish what was on it
now then stephen he said you must put your shoulder to the wheel old chap
youve had a fine long holiday
o im sure hell work very hard now said mrs dedalus especially when he has maurice with him
o holy paul i forgot about maurice said mr dedalus
here maurice
come here you thickheaded ruffian
do you know im going to send you to a college where theyll teach you to spell cat
cat
and ill buy you a nice little penny handkerchief to keep your nose dry
wont that be grand fun
maurice grinned at his father and then at his brother
mr dedalus screwed his glass into his eye and stared hard at both his sons
stephen mumbled his bread without answering his fathers gaze
by the bye said mr dedalus at length the rector or provincial rather was telling me that story about you and father dolan
youre an impudent thief he said
o he didnt simon
not he
said mr dedalus
but he gave me a great account of the whole affair
we were chatting you know and one word borrowed another
and by the way who do you think he told me will get that job in the corporation
but ill tell you that after
well as i was saying we were chatting away quite friendly and he asked me did our friend here wear glasses still and then he told me the whole story
and was he annoyed simon
annoyed
not he
manly little chap he said
mr dedalus imitated the mincing nasal tone of the provincial
father dolan and i when i told them all at dinner about it father dolan and i had a great laugh over it
you better mind yourself father dolan said i or young dedalus will send you up for twice nine
we had a famous laugh together over it
ha
ha
ha
mr dedalus turned to his wife and interjected in his natural voice  shows you the spirit in which they take the boys there
o a jesuit for your life for diplomacy
he reassumed the provincials voice and repeated  i told them all at dinner about it and father dolan and i and all of us we had a hearty laugh together over it
ha
ha

the night of the whitsuntide play had come and stephen from the window of the dressingroom looked out on the small grassplot across which lines of chinese lanterns were stretched
he watched the visitors come down the steps from the house and pass into the theatre
stewards in evening dress old belvedereans loitered in groups about the entrance to the theatre and ushered in the visitors with ceremony
under the sudden glow of a lantern he could recognise the smiling face of a priest
the blessed sacrament had been removed from the tabernacle and the first benches had been driven back so as to leave the dais of the altar and the space before it free
against the walls stood companies of barbells and indian clubs the dumbbells were piled in one corner and in the midst of countless hillocks of gymnasium shoes and sweaters and singlets in untidy brown parcels there stood the stout leatherjacketed vaulting horse waiting its turn to be carried up on the stage and set in the middle of the winning team at the end of the gymnastic display
stephen though in deference to his reputation for essay writing he had been elected secretary to the gymnasium had had no part in the first section of the programme but in the play which formed the second section he had the chief part that of a farcical pedagogue
he had been cast for it on account of his stature and grave manners for he was now at the end of his second year at belvedere and in number two
a score of the younger boys in white knickers and singlets came pattering down from the stage through the vestry and into the chapel
the vestry and chapel were peopled with eager masters and boys
the plump bald sergeant major was testing with his foot the springboard of the vaulting horse
the lean young man in a long overcoat who was to give a special display of intricate club swinging stood near watching with interest his silvercoated clubs peeping out of his deep sidepockets
the hollow rattle of the wooden dumbbells was heard as another team made ready to go up on the stage and in another moment the excited prefect was hustling the boys through the vestry like a flock of geese flapping the wings of his soutane nervously and crying to the laggards to make haste
a little troop of neapolitan peasants were practising their steps at the end of the chapel some circling their arms above their heads some swaying their baskets of paper violets and curtseying
in a dark corner of the chapel at the gospel side of the altar a stout old lady knelt amid her copious black skirts
when she stood up a pinkdressed figure wearing a curly golden wig and an oldfashioned straw sunbonnet with black pencilled eyebrows and cheeks delicately rouged and powdered was discovered
a low murmur of curiosity ran round the chapel at the discovery of this girlish figure
one of the prefects smiling and nodding his head approached the dark corner and having bowed to the stout old lady said pleasantly  is this a beautiful young lady or a doll that you have here mrs tallon
then bending down to peer at the smiling painted face under the leaf of the bonnet he exclaimed  no
upon my word i believe its little bertie tallon after all
stephen at his post by the window heard the old lady and the priest laugh together and heard the boys murmurs of admiration behind him as they passed forward to see the little boy who had to dance the sunbonnet dance by himself
a movement of impatience escaped him
he let the edge of the blind fall and stepping down from the bench on which he had been standing walked out of the chapel
he passed out of the schoolhouse and halted under the shed that flanked the garden
from the theatre opposite came the muffled noise of the audience and sudden brazen clashes of the soldiers band
the light spread upwards from the glass roof making the theatre seem a festive ark anchored among the hulks of houses her frail cables of lanterns looping her to her moorings
a side door of the theatre opened suddenly and a shaft of light flew across the grassplots
a sudden burst of music issued from the ark the prelude of a waltz and when the side door closed again the listener could hear the faint rhythm of the music
the sentiment of the opening bars their languor and supple movement evoked the incommunicable emotion which had been the cause of all his days unrest and of his impatient movement of a moment before
his unrest issued from him like a wave of sound and on the tide of flowing music the ark was journeying trailing her cables of lanterns in her wake
then a noise like dwarf artillery broke the movement
it was the clapping that greeted the entry of the dumbbell team on the stage
at the far end of the shed near the street a speck of pink light showed in the darkness and as he walked towards it he became aware of a faint aromatic odour
two boys were standing in the shelter of a doorway smoking and before he reached them he had recognised heron by his voice
here comes the noble dedalus
cried a high throaty voice
welcome to our trusty friend
this welcome ended in a soft peal of mirthless laughter as heron salaamed and then began to poke the ground with his cane
here i am said stephen halting and glancing from heron to his friend
the latter was a stranger to him but in the darkness by the aid of the glowing cigarette tips he could make out a pale dandyish face over which a smile was travelling slowly a tall overcoated figure and a hard hat
heron did not trouble himself about an introduction but said instead  i was just telling my friend wallis what a lark it would be tonight if you took off the rector in the part of the schoolmaster
it would be a ripping good joke
heron made a poor attempt to imitate for his friend wallis the rectors pedantic bass and then laughing at his failure asked stephen to do it
go on dedalus he urged you can take him off rippingly
he that will not hear the churcha let him be to theea as the heathena and the publicana  the imitation was prevented by a mild expression of anger from wallis in whose mouthpiece the cigarette had become too tightly wedged
damn this blankety blank holder he said taking it from his mouth and smiling and frowning upon it tolerantly
its always getting stuck like that
do you use a holder
i dont smoke answered stephen
no said heron dedalus is a model youth
he doesnt smoke and he doesnt go to bazaars and he doesnt flirt and he doesnt damn anything or damn all
stephen shook his head and smiled in his rivals flushed and mobile face beaked like a birds
he had often thought it strange that vincent heron had a birds face as well as a birds name
a shock of pale hair lay on the forehead like a ruffled crest the forehead was narrow and bony and a thin hooked nose stood out between the closeset prominent eyes which were light and inexpressive
the rivals were school friends
they sat together in class knelt together in the chapel talked together after beads over their lunches
as the fellows in number one were undistinguished dullards stephen and heron had been during the year the virtual heads of the school
it was they who went up to the rector together to ask for a free day or to get a fellow off
o by the way said heron suddenly i saw your governor going in
the smile waned on stephens face
any allusion made to his father by a fellow or by a master put his calm to rout in a moment
he waited in timorous silence to hear what heron might say next
heron however nudged him expressively with his elbow and said  youre a sly dog
why so
said stephen
youd think butter wouldnt melt in your mouth said heron
but im afraid youre a sly dog
might i ask you what you are talking about
said stephen urbanely
indeed you might answered heron
we saw her wallis didnt we
and deucedly pretty she is too
and inquisitive
and what part does stephen take mr dedalus
and will stephen not sing mr dedalus your governor was staring at her through that eyeglass of his for all he was worth so that i think the old man has found you out too
i wouldnt care a bit by jove
shes ripping isnt she wallis
not half bad answered wallis quietly as he placed his holder once more in a corner of his mouth
a shaft of momentary anger flew through stephens mind at these indelicate allusions in the hearing of a stranger
for him there was nothing amusing in a girls interest and regard
all day he had thought of nothing but their leavetaking on the steps of the tram at harolds cross the stream of moody emotions it had made to course through him and the poem he had written about it
all day he had imagined a new meeting with her for he knew that she was to come to the play
the old restless moodiness had again filled his breast as it had done on the night of the party but had not found an outlet in verse
the growth and knowledge of two years of boyhood stood between then and now forbidding such an outlet and all day the stream of gloomy tenderness within him had started forth and returned upon itself in dark courses and eddies wearying him in the end until the pleasantry of the prefect and the painted little boy had drawn from him a movement of impatience
so you may as well admit heron went on that weve fairly found you out this time
you cant play the saint on me any more thats one sure five
a soft peal of mirthless laughter escaped from his lips and bending down as before he struck stephen lightly across the calf of the leg with his cane as if in jesting reproof
stephens moment of anger had already passed
he was neither flattered nor confused but simply wished the banter to end
he scarcely resented what had seemed to him a silly indelicateness for he knew that the adventure in his mind stood in no danger from these words and his face mirrored his rivals false smile
admit
repeated heron striking him again with his cane across the calf of the leg
the stroke was playful but not so lightly given as the first one had been
stephen felt the skin tingle and glow slightly and almost painlessly and bowing submissively as if to meet his companions jesting mood began to recite the confiteor
the episode ended well for both heron and wallis laughed indulgently at the irreverence
the confession came only from stephens lips and while they spoke the words a sudden memory had carried him to another scene called up as if by magic at the moment when he had noted the faint cruel dimples at the corners of herons smiling lips and had felt the familiar stroke of the cane against his calf and had heard the familiar word of admonition  admit
it was towards the close of his first term in the college when he was in number six
his sensitive nature was still smarting under the lashes of an undivined and squalid way of life
his soul was still disquieted and cast down by the dull phenomenon of dublin
he had emerged from a two years spell of reverie to find himself in the midst of a new scene every event and figure of which affected him intimately disheartened him or allured and whether alluring or disheartening filled him always with unrest and bitter thoughts
all the leisure which his school life left him was passed in the company of subversive writers whose gibes and violence of speech set up a ferment in his brain before they passed out of it into his crude writings
the essay was for him the chief labour of his week and every tuesday as he marched from home to the school he read his fate in the incidents of the way pitting himself against some figure ahead of him and quickening his pace to outstrip it before a certain goal was reached or planting his steps scrupulously in the spaces of the patchwork of the pathway and telling himself that he would be first and not first in the weekly essay
on a certain tuesday the course of his triumphs was rudely broken
mr tate the english master pointed his finger at him and said bluntly  this fellow has heresy in his essay
a hush fell on the class
mr tate did not break it but dug with his hand between his thighs while his heavily starched linen creaked about his neck and wrists
stephen did not look up
it was a raw spring morning and his eyes were still smarting and weak
he was conscious of failure and of detection of the squalor of his own mind and home and felt against his neck the raw edge of his turned and jagged collar
a short loud laugh from mr tate set the class more at ease
perhaps you didnt know that he said
where
asked stephen
mr tate withdrew his delving hand and spread out the essay
here
its about the creator and the soul
rrm rrm rrm ah
without a possibility of ever approaching nearer thats heresy
stephen murmured  i meant without a possibility of ever reaching
it was a submission and mr tate appeased folded up the essay and passed it across to him saying  o ah
ever reaching thats another story
but the class was not so soon appeased
though nobody spoke to him of the affair after class he could feel about him a vague general malignant joy
a few nights after this public chiding he was walking with a letter along the drumcondra road when he heard a voice cry  halt
he turned and saw three boys of his own class coming towards him in the dusk
it was heron who had called out and as he marched forward between his two attendants he cleft the air before him with a thin cane in time to their steps
boland his friend marched beside him a large grin on his face while nash came on a few steps behind blowing from the pace and wagging his great red head
as soon as the boys had turned into clonliffe road together they began to speak about books and writers saying what books they were reading and how many books there were in their fathers bookcases at home
stephen listened to them in some wonderment for boland was the dunce and nash the idler of the class
in fact after some talk about their favourite writers nash declared for captain marryat who he said was the greatest writer
fudge
said heron
ask dedalus
who is the greatest writer dedalus
stephen noted the mockery in the question and said  of prose do you mean
yes
newman i think
is it cardinal newman
asked boland
yes answered stephen
the grin broadened on nashs freckled face as he turned to stephen and said  and do you like cardinal newman dedalus
o many say that newman has the best prose style heron said to the other two in explanation of course hes not a poet
and who is the best poet heron
asked boland
lord tennyson of course answered heron
o yes lord tennyson said nash
we have all his poetry at home in a book
at this stephen forgot the silent vows he had been making and burst out  tennyson a poet
why hes only a rhymester
o get out
said heron
everyone knows that tennyson is the greatest poet
and who do you think is the greatest poet
asked boland nudging his neighbour
byron of course answered stephen
heron gave the lead and all three joined in a scornful laugh
what are you laughing at
asked stephen
you said heron
byron the greatest poet
hes only a poet for uneducated people
he must be a fine poet
said boland
you may keep your mouth shut said stephen turning on him boldly
all you know about poetry is what you wrote up on the slates in the yard and were going to be sent to the loft for
boland in fact was said to have written on the slates in the yard a couplet about a classmate of his who often rode home from the college on a pony    as tyson was riding into jerusalem   he fell and hurt his alec kafoozelum
this thrust put the two lieutenants to silence but heron went on  in any case byron was a heretic and immoral too
i dont care what he was cried stephen hotly
you dont care whether he was a heretic or not
said nash
what do you know about it
shouted stephen
you never read a line of anything in your life except a trans or boland either
i know that byron was a bad man said boland
here catch hold of this heretic heron called out
in a moment stephen was a prisoner
tate made you buck up the other day heron went on about the heresy in your essay
ill tell him tomorrow said boland
will you
said stephen
youd be afraid to open your lips
afraid
ay
afraid of your life
behave yourself
cried heron cutting at stephens legs with his cane
it was the signal for their onset
nash pinioned his arms behind while boland seized a long cabbage stump which was lying in the gutter
struggling and kicking under the cuts of the cane and the blows of the knotty stump stephen was borne back against a barbed wire fence
admit that byron was no good
no
admit
no
admit
no
no
at last after a fury of plunges he wrenched himself free
his tormentors set off towards joness road laughing and jeering at him while he half blinded with tears stumbled on clenching his fists madly and sobbing
while he was still repeating the confiteor amid the indulgent laughter of his hearers and while the scenes of that malignant episode were still passing sharply and swiftly before his mind he wondered why he bore no malice now to those who had tormented him
he had not forgotten a whit of their cowardice and cruelty but the memory of it called forth no anger from him
all the descriptions of fierce love and hatred which he had met in books had seemed to him therefore unreal
even that night as he stumbled homewards along joness road he had felt that some power was divesting him of that suddenwoven anger as easily as a fruit is divested of its soft ripe peel
he remained standing with his two companions at the end of the shed listening idly to their talk or to the bursts of applause in the theatre
she was sitting there among the others perhaps waiting for him to appear
he tried to recall her appearance but could not
he could remember only that she had worn a shawl about her head like a cowl and that her dark eyes had invited and unnerved him
he wondered had he been in her thoughts as she had been in his
then in the dark and unseen by the other two he rested the tips of the fingers of one hand upon the palm of the other hand scarcely touching it lightly
but the pressure of her fingers had been lighter and steadier and suddenly the memory of their touch traversed his brain and body like an invisible wave
a boy came towards them running along under the shed
he was excited and breathless
o dedalus he cried doyle is in a great bake about you
youre to go in at once and get dressed for the play
hurry up you better
hes coming now said heron to the messenger with a haughty drawl when he wants to
the boy turned to heron and repeated  but doyle is in an awful bake
will you tell doyle with my best compliments that i damned his eyes
answered heron
well i must go now said stephen who cared little for such points of honour
i wouldnt said heron damn me if i would
thats no way to send for one of the senior boys
in a bake indeed
i think its quite enough that youre taking a part in his bally old play
this spirit of quarrelsome comradeship which he had observed lately in his rival had not seduced stephen from his habits of quiet obedience
he mistrusted the turbulence and doubted the sincerity of such comradeship which seemed to him a sorry anticipation of manhood
the question of honour here raised was like all such questions trivial to him
while his mind had been pursuing its intangible phantoms and turning in irresolution from such pursuit he had heard about him the constant voices of his father and of his masters urging him to be a gentleman above all things and urging him to be a good catholic above all things
these voices had now come to be hollowsounding in his ears
when the gymnasium had been opened he had heard another voice urging him to be strong and manly and healthy and when the movement towards national revival had begun to be felt in the college yet another voice had bidden him be true to his country and help to raise up her language and tradition
in the profane world as he foresaw a worldly voice would bid him raise up his fathers fallen state by his labours and meanwhile the voice of his school comrades urged him to be a decent fellow to shield others from blame or to beg them off and to do his best to get free days for the school
and it was the din of all these hollowsounding voices that made him halt irresolutely in the pursuit of phantoms
he gave them ear only for a time but he was happy only when he was far from them beyond their call alone or in the company of phantasmal comrades
in the vestry a plump freshfaced jesuit and an elderly man in shabby blue clothes were dabbling in a case of paints and chalks
the boys who had been painted walked about or stood still awkwardly touching their faces in a gingerly fashion with their furtive fingertips
in the middle of the vestry a young jesuit who was then on a visit to the college stood rocking himself rhythmically from the tips of his toes to his heels and back again his hands thrust well forward into his sidepockets
his small head set off with glossy red curls and his newly shaven face agreed well with the spotless decency of his soutane and with his spotless shoes
as he watched this swaying form and tried to read for himself the legend of the priests mocking smile there came into stephens memory a saying which he had heard from his father before he had been sent to clongowes that you could always tell a jesuit by the style of his clothes
at the same moment he thought he saw a likeness between his fathers mind and that of this smiling welldressed priest and he was aware of some desecration of the priests office or of the vestry itself whose silence was now routed by loud talk and joking and its air pungent with the smells of the gasjets and the grease
while his forehead was being wrinkled and his jaws painted black and blue by the elderly man he listened distractedly to the voice of the plump young jesuit which bade him speak up and make his points clearly
he could hear the band playing the lily of killarney and knew that in a few moments the curtain would go up
he felt no stage fright but the thought of the part he had to play humiliated him
a remembrance of some of his lines made a sudden flush rise to his painted cheeks
he saw her serious alluring eyes watching him from among the audience and their image at once swept away his scruples leaving his will compact
another nature seemed to have been lent him the infection of the excitement and youth about him entered into and transformed his moody mistrustfulness
for one rare moment he seemed to be clothed in the real apparel of boyhood and as he stood in the wings among the other players he shared the common mirth amid which the drop scene was hauled upwards by two ablebodied priests with violent jerks and all awry
a few moments after he found himself on the stage amid the garish gas and the dim scenery acting before the innumerable faces of the void
it surprised him to see that the play which he had known at rehearsals for a disjointed lifeless thing had suddenly assumed a life of its own
it seemed now to play itself he and his fellow actors aiding it with their parts
when the curtain fell on the last scene he heard the void filled with applause and through a rift in a side scene saw the simple body before which he had acted magically deformed the void of faces breaking at all points and falling asunder into busy groups
he left the stage quickly and rid himself of his mummery and passed out through the chapel into the college garden
now that the play was over his nerves cried for some further adventure
he hurried onwards as if to overtake it
the doors of the theatre were all open and the audience had emptied out
on the lines which he had fancied the moorings of an ark a few lanterns swung in the night breeze flickering cheerlessly
he mounted the steps from the garden in haste eager that some prey should not elude him and forced his way through the crowd in the hall and past the two jesuits who stood watching the exodus and bowing and shaking hands with the visitors
he pushed onward nervously feigning a still greater haste and faintly conscious of the smiles and stares and nudges which his powdered head left in its wake
when he came out on the steps he saw his family waiting for him at the first lamp
in a glance he noted that every figure of the group was familiar and ran down the steps angrily
i have to leave a message down in georges street he said to his father quickly
ill be home after you
without waiting for his fathers questions he ran across the road and began to walk at breakneck speed down the hill
he hardly knew where he was walking
pride and hope and desire like crushed herbs in his heart sent up vapours of maddening incense before the eyes of his mind
he strode down the hill amid the tumult of suddenrisen vapours of wounded pride and fallen hope and baffled desire
they streamed upwards before his anguished eyes in dense and maddening fumes and passed away above him till at last the air was clear and cold again
a film still veiled his eyes but they burned no longer
a power akin to that which had often made anger or resentment fall from him brought his steps to rest
he stood still and gazed up at the sombre porch of the morgue and from that to the dark cobbled laneway at its side
he saw the word lotts on the wall of the lane and breathed slowly the rank heavy air
that is horse piss and rotted straw he thought
it is a good odour to breathe
it will calm my heart
my heart is quite calm now
i will go back
stephen was once again seated beside his father in the corner of a railway carriage at kingsbridge
he was travelling with his father by the night mail to cork
as the train steamed out of the station he recalled his childish wonder of years before and every event of his first day at clongowes
but he felt no wonder now
he saw the darkening lands slipping away past him the silent telegraphpoles passing his window swiftly every four seconds the little glimmering stations manned by a few silent sentries flung by the mail behind her and twinkling for a moment in the darkness like fiery grains flung backwards by a runner
he listened without sympathy to his fathers evocation of cork and of scenes of his youth a tale broken by sighs or draughts from his pocket flask whenever the image of some dead friend appeared in it or whenever the evoker remembered suddenly the purpose of his actual visit
stephen heard but could feel no pity
the images of the dead were all strangers to him save that of uncle charles an image which had lately been fading out of memory
he knew however that his fathers property was going to be sold by auction and in the manner of his own dispossession he felt the world give the lie rudely to his phantasy
at maryborough he fell asleep
when he awoke the train had passed out of mallow and his father was stretched asleep on the other seat
the cold light of the dawn lay over the country over the unpeopled fields and the closed cottages
the terror of sleep fascinated his mind as he watched the silent country or heard from time to time his fathers deep breath or sudden sleepy movement
the neighbourhood of unseen sleepers filled him with strange dread as though they could harm him and he prayed that the day might come quickly
his prayer addressed neither to god nor saint began with a shiver as the chilly morning breeze crept through the chink of the carriage door to his feet and ended in a trail of foolish words which he made to fit the insistent rhythm of the train and silently at intervals of four seconds the telegraphpoles held the galloping notes of the music between punctual bars
this furious music allayed his dread and leaning against the windowledge he let his eyelids close again
they drove in a jingle across cork while it was still early morning and stephen finished his sleep in a bedroom of the victoria hotel
the bright warm sunlight was streaming through the window and he could hear the din of traffic
his father was standing before the dressingtable examining his hair and face and moustache with great care craning his neck across the waterjug and drawing it back sideways to see the better
while he did so he sang softly to himself with quaint accent and phrasing      tis youth and folly     makes young men marry     so here my love ill     no longer stay
what cant be cured sure     must be injured sure     so ill go to     amerikay
my love shes handsome     my love shes bony     shes like good whisky     when it is new     but when tis old     and growing cold     it fades and dies like     the mountain dew
the consciousness of the warm sunny city outside his window and the tender tremors with which his fathers voice festooned the strange sad happy air drove off all the mists of the nights ill humour from stephens brain
he got up quickly to dress and when the song had ended said  thats much prettier than any of your other comeallyous
do you think so
asked mr dedalus
i like it said stephen
its a pretty old air said mr dedalus twirling the points of his moustache
ah but you should have heard mick lacy sing it
poor mick lacy
he had little turns for it grace notes that he used to put in that i havent got
that was the boy who could sing a comeallyou if you like
mr dedalus had ordered drisheens for breakfast and during the meal he crossexamined the waiter for local news
for the most part they spoke at cross purposes when a name was mentioned the waiter having in mind the present holder and mr dedalus his father or perhaps his grandfather
well i hope they havent moved the queens college anyhow said mr dedalus for i want to show it to this youngster of mine
along the mardyke the trees were in bloom
they entered the grounds of the college and were led by the garrulous porter across the quadrangle
but their progress across the gravel was brought to a halt after every dozen or so paces by some reply of the porters
ah do you tell me so
and is poor pottlebelly dead
yes sir
dead sir
during these halts stephen stood awkwardly behind the two men weary of the subject and waiting restlessly for the slow march to begin again
by the time they had crossed the quadrangle his restlessness had risen to fever
he wondered how his father whom he knew for a shrewd suspicious man could be duped by the servile manners of the porter and the lively southern speech which had entertained him all the morning now irritated his ears
they passed into the anatomy theatre where mr dedalus the porter aiding him searched the desks for his initials
stephen remained in the background depressed more than ever by the darkness and silence of the theatre and by the air it wore of jaded and formal study
on the desk he read the word ftus cut several times in the dark stained wood
the sudden legend startled his blood he seemed to feel the absent students of the college about him and to shrink from their company
a vision of their life which his fathers words had been powerless to evoke sprang up before him out of the word cut in the desk
a broadshouldered student with a moustache was cutting in the letters with a jackknife seriously
other students stood or sat near him laughing at his handiwork
one jogged his elbow
the big student turned on him frowning
he was dressed in loose grey clothes and had tan boots
stephens name was called
he hurried down the steps of the theatre so as to be as far away from the vision as he could be and peering closely at his fathers initials hid his flushed face
but the word and the vision capered before his eyes as he walked back across the quadrangle and towards the college gate
it shocked him to find in the outer world a trace of what he had deemed till then a brutish and individual malady of his own mind
his monstrous reveries came thronging into his memory
they too had sprung up before him suddenly and furiously out of mere words
he had soon given in to them and allowed them to sweep across and abase his intellect wondering always where they came from from what den of monstrous images and always weak and humble towards others restless and sickened of himself when they had swept over him
ay bedad
and theres the groceries sure enough
cried mr dedalus
you often heard me speak of the groceries didnt you stephen
manys the time we went down there when our names had been marked a crowd of us harry peard and little jack mountain and bob dyas and maurice moriarty the frenchman and tom ogrady and mick lacy that i told you of this morning and joey corbet and poor little goodhearted johnny keevers of the tantiles
the leaves of the trees along the mardyke were astir and whispering in the sunlight
a team of cricketers passed agile young men in flannels and blazers one of them carrying the long green wicketbag
in a quiet bystreet a german band of five players in faded uniforms and with battered brass instruments was playing to an audience of street arabs and leisurely messenger boys
a maid in a white cap and apron was watering a box of plants on a sill which shone like a slab of limestone in the warm glare
from another window open to the air came the sound of a piano scale after scale rising into the treble
stephen walked on at his fathers side listening to stories he had heard before hearing again the names of the scattered and dead revellers who had been the companions of his fathers youth
and a faint sickness sighed in his heart
he recalled his own equivocal position in belvedere a free boy a leader afraid of his own authority proud and sensitive and suspicious battling against the squalor of his life and against the riot of his mind
the letters cut in the stained wood of the desk stared upon him mocking his bodily weakness and futile enthusiasms and making him loathe himself for his own mad and filthy orgies
the spittle in his throat grew bitter and foul to swallow and the faint sickness climbed to his brain so that for a moment he closed his eyes and walked on in darkness
he could still hear his fathers voice  when you kick out for yourself stephenas i daresay you will one of these daysremember whatever you do to mix with gentlemen
when i was a young fellow i tell you i enjoyed myself
i mixed with fine decent fellows
everyone of us could do something
one fellow had a good voice another fellow was a good actor another could sing a good comic song another was a good oarsman or a good racket player another could tell a good story and so on
we kept the ball rolling anyhow and enjoyed ourselves and saw a bit of life and we were none the worse of it either
but we were all gentlemen stephenat least i hope we wereand bloody good honest irishmen too
thats the kind of fellows i want you to associate with fellows of the right kidney
im talking to you as a friend stephen
i dont believe a son should be afraid of his father
no i treat you as your grandfather treated me when i was a young chap
we were more like brothers than father and son
ill never forget the first day he caught me smoking
i was standing at the end of the south terrace one day with some maneens like myself and sure we thought we were grand fellows because we had pipes stuck in the corners of our mouths
suddenly the governor passed
he didnt say a word or stop even
but the next day sunday we were out for a walk together and when we were coming home he took out his cigar case and saidby the by simon i didnt know you smoked or something like thatof course i tried to carry it off as best i couldif you want a good smoke he said try one of these cigars
an american captain made me a present of them last night in queenstown
stephen heard his fathers voice break into a laugh which was almost a sob
he was the handsomest man in cork at that time by god he was
the women used to stand to look after him in the street
he heard the sob passing loudly down his fathers throat and opened his eyes with a nervous impulse
the sunlight breaking suddenly on his sight turned the sky and clouds into a fantastic world of sombre masses with lakelike spaces of dark rosy light
his very brain was sick and powerless
he could scarcely interpret the letters of the signboards of the shops
by his monstrous way of life he seemed to have put himself beyond the limits of reality
nothing moved him or spoke to him from the real world unless he heard in it an echo of the infuriated cries within him
he could respond to no earthly or human appeal dumb and insensible to the call of summer and gladness and companionship wearied and dejected by his fathers voice
he could scarcely recognise as his own thoughts and repeated slowly to himself  i am stephen dedalus
i am walking beside my father whose name is simon dedalus
we are in cork in ireland
cork is a city
our room is in the victoria hotel
victoria and stephen and simon
simon and stephen and victoria
names
the memory of his childhood suddenly grew dim
he tried to call forth some of its vivid moments but could not
he recalled only names
dante parnell clane clongowes
a little boy had been taught geography by an old woman who kept two brushes in her wardrobe
then he had been sent away from home to a college he had made his first communion and eaten slim jim out of his cricketcap and watched the firelight leaping and dancing on the wall of a little bedroom in the infirmary and dreamed of being dead of mass being said for him by the rector in a black and gold cope of being buried then in the little graveyard of the community off the main avenue of limes
but he had not died then
parnell had died
there had been no mass for the dead in the chapel and no procession
he had not died but he had faded out like a film in the sun
he had been lost or had wandered out of existence for he no longer existed
how strange to think of him passing out of existence in such a way not by death but by fading out in the sun or by being lost and forgotten somewhere in the universe
it was strange to see his small body appear again for a moment a little boy in a grey belted suit
his hands were in his sidepockets and his trousers were tucked in at the knees by elastic bands
on the evening of the day on which the property was sold stephen followed his father meekly about the city from bar to bar
to the sellers in the market to the barmen and barmaids to the beggars who importuned him for a lob mr dedalus told the same tale that he was an old corkonian that he had been trying for thirty years to get rid of his cork accent up in dublin and that peter pickackafax beside him was his eldest son but that he was only a dublin jackeen
they had set out early in the morning from newcombes coffeehouse where mr dedalus cup had rattled noisily against its saucer and stephen had tried to cover that shameful sign of his fathers drinking bout of the night before by moving his chair and coughing
one humiliation had succeeded anotherthe false smiles of the market sellers the curvetings and oglings of the barmaids with whom his father flirted the compliments and encouraging words of his fathers friends
they had told him that he had a great look of his grandfather and mr dedalus had agreed that he was an ugly likeness
they had unearthed traces of a cork accent in his speech and made him admit that the lee was a much finer river than the liffey
one of them in order to put his latin to the proof had made him translate short passages from dilectus and asked him whether it was correct to say tempora mutantur nos et mutamur in illis or tempora mutantur et nos mutamur in illis another a brisk old man whom mr dedalus called johnny cashman had covered him with confusion by asking him to say which were prettier the dublin girls or the cork girls
hes not that way built said mr dedalus
leave him alone
hes a levelheaded thinking boy who doesnt bother his head about that kind of nonsense
then hes not his fathers son said the little old man
i dont know im sure said mr dedalus smiling complacently
your father said the little old man to stephen was the boldest flirt in the city of cork in his day
do you know that
stephen looked down and studied the tiled floor of the bar into which they had drifted
now dont be putting ideas into his head said mr dedalus
leave him to his maker
yerra sure i wouldnt put any ideas into his head
im old enough to be his grandfather
and i am a grandfather said the little old man to stephen
do you know that
are you
asked stephen
bedad i am said the little old man
i have two bouncing grandchildren out at sundays well
now then
what age do you think i am
and i remember seeing your grandfather in his red coat riding out to hounds
that was before you were born
ay or thought of said mr dedalus
bedad i did repeated the little old man
and more than that i can remember even your greatgrandfather old john stephen dedalus and a fierce old fireeater he was
now then
theres a memory for you
thats three generationsfour generations said another of the company
why johnny cashman you must be nearing the century
well ill tell you the truth said the little old man
im just twentyseven years of age
were as old as we feel johnny said mr dedalus
and just finish what you have there and well have another
here tim or tom or whatever your name is give us the same again here
by god i dont feel more than eighteen myself
theres that son of mine there not half my age and im a better man than he is any day of the week
draw it mild now dedalus
i think its time for you to take a back seat said the gentleman who had spoken before
no by god
asserted mr dedalus
ill sing a tenor song against him or ill vault a fivebarred gate against him or ill run with him after the hounds across the country as i did thirty years ago along with the kerry boy and the best man for it
but hell beat you here said the little old man tapping his forehead and raising his glass to drain it
well i hope hell be as good a man as his father
thats all i can say said mr dedalus
if he is hell do said the little old man
and thanks be to god johnny said mr dedalus that we lived so long and did so little harm
but did so much good simon said the little old man gravely
thanks be to god we lived so long and did so much good
stephen watched the three glasses being raised from the counter as his father and his two cronies drank to the memory of their past
an abyss of fortune or of temperament sundered him from them
his mind seemed older than theirs it shone coldly on their strifes and happiness and regrets like a moon upon a younger earth
no life or youth stirred in him as it had stirred in them
he had known neither the pleasure of companionship with others nor the vigour of rude male health nor filial piety
nothing stirred within his soul but a cold and cruel and loveless lust
his childhood was dead or lost and with it his soul capable of simple joys and he was drifting amid life like the barren shell of the moon
art thou pale for weariness   of climbing heaven and gazing on the earth   wandering companionless
he repeated to himself the lines of shelleys fragment
its alternation of sad human ineffectiveness with vast inhuman cycles of activity chilled him and he forgot his own human and ineffectual grieving
stephens mother and his brother and one of his cousins waited at the corner of quiet foster place while he and his father went up the steps and along the colonnade where the highland sentry was parading
when they had passed into the great hall and stood at the counter stephen drew forth his orders on the governor of the bank of ireland for thirty and three pounds and these sums the moneys of his exhibition and essay prize were paid over to him rapidly by the teller in notes and in coin respectively
he bestowed them in his pockets with feigned composure and suffered the friendly teller to whom his father chatted to take his hand across the broad counter and wish him a brilliant career in after life
he was impatient of their voices and could not keep his feet at rest
but the teller still deferred the serving of others to say he was living in changed times and that there was nothing like giving a boy the best education that money could buy
mr dedalus lingered in the hall gazing about him and up at the roof and telling stephen who urged him to come out that they were standing in the house of commons of the old irish parliament
god help us
he said piously to think of the men of those times stephen hely hutchinson and flood and henry grattan and charles kendal bushe and the noblemen we have now leaders of the irish people at home and abroad
why by god they wouldnt be seen dead in a tenacre field with them
no stephen old chap im sorry to say that they are only as i roved out one fine may morning in the merry month of sweet july
a keen october wind was blowing round the bank
the three figures standing at the edge of the muddy path had pinched cheeks and watery eyes
stephen looked at his thinly clad mother and remembered that a few days before he had seen a mantle priced at twenty guineas in the windows of barnardos
well thats done said mr dedalus
we had better go to dinner said stephen
where
dinner
said mr dedalus
well i suppose we had better what
some place thats not too dear said mrs dedalus
underdones
yes
some quiet place
come along said stephen quickly
it doesnt matter about the dearness
he walked on before them with short nervous steps smiling
they tried to keep up with him smiling also at his eagerness
take it easy like a good young fellow said his father
were not out for the half mile are we
for a swift season of merrymaking the money of his prizes ran through stephens fingers
great parcels of groceries and delicacies and dried fruits arrived from the city
every day he drew up a bill of fare for the family and every night led a party of three or four to the theatre to see ingomar or the lady of lyons
in his coat pockets he carried squares of vienna chocolate for his guests while his trousers pocket bulged with masses of silver and copper coins
he bought presents for everyone overhauled his room wrote out resolutions marshalled his books up and down their shelves pored upon all kinds of price lists drew up a form of commonwealth for the household by which every member of it held some office opened a loan bank for his family and pressed loans on willing borrowers so that he might have the pleasure of making out receipts and reckoning the interests on the sums lent
when he could do no more he drove up and down the city in trams
then the season of pleasure came to an end
the pot of pink enamel paint gave out and the wainscot of his bedroom remained with its unfinished and illplastered coat
his household returned to its usual way of life
his mother had no further occasion to upbraid him for squandering his money
he too returned to his old life at school and all his novel enterprises fell to pieces
the commonwealth fell the loan bank closed its coffers and its books on a sensible loss the rules of life which he had drawn about himself fell into desuetude
how foolish his aim had been
he had tried to build a breakwater of order and elegance against the sordid tide of life without him and to dam up by rules of conduct and active interest and new filial relations the powerful recurrence of the tides within him
useless
from without as from within the water had flowed over his barriers their tides began once more to jostle fiercely above the crumbled mole
he saw clearly too his own futile isolation
he had not gone one step nearer the lives he had sought to approach nor bridged the restless shame and rancour that had divided him from mother and brother and sister
he felt that he was hardly of the one blood with them but stood to them rather in the mystical kinship of fosterage fosterchild and fosterbrother
he turned to appease the fierce longings of his heart before which everything else was idle and alien
he cared little that he was in mortal sin that his life had grown to be a tissue of subterfuge and falsehood
beside the savage desire within him to realise the enormities which he brooded on nothing was sacred
he bore cynically with the shameful details of his secret riots in which he exulted to defile with patience whatever image had attracted his eyes
by day and by night he moved among distorted images of the outer world
a figure that had seemed to him by day demure and innocent came towards him by night through the winding darkness of sleep her face transfigured by a lecherous cunning her eyes bright with brutish joy
only the morning pained him with its dim memory of dark orgiastic riot its keen and humiliating sense of transgression
he returned to his wanderings
the veiled autumnal evenings led him from street to street as they had led him years before along the quiet avenues of blackrock
but no vision of trim front gardens or of kindly lights in the windows poured a tender influence upon him now
only at times in the pauses of his desire when the luxury that was wasting him gave room to a softer languor the image of mercedes traversed the background of his memory
he saw again the small white house and the garden of rosebushes on the road that led to the mountains and he remembered the sadly proud gesture of refusal which he was to make there standing with her in the moonlit garden after years of estrangement and adventure
at those moments the soft speeches of claude melnotte rose to his lips and eased his unrest
a tender premonition touched him of the tryst he had then looked forward to and in spite of the horrible reality which lay between his hope of then and now of the holy encounter he had then imagined at which weakness and timidity and inexperience were to fall from him
such moments passed and the wasting fires of lust sprang up again
the verses passed from his lips and the inarticulate cries and the unspoken brutal words rushed forth from his brain to force a passage
his blood was in revolt
he wandered up and down the dark slimy streets peering into the gloom of lanes and doorways listening eagerly for any sound
he moaned to himself like some baffled prowling beast
he wanted to sin with another of his kind to force another being to sin with him and to exult with her in sin
he felt some dark presence moving irresistibly upon him from the darkness a presence subtle and murmurous as a flood filling him wholly with itself
its murmur besieged his ears like the murmur of some multitude in sleep its subtle streams penetrated his being
his hands clenched convulsively and his teeth set together as he suffered the agony of its penetration
he stretched out his arms in the street to hold fast the frail swooning form that eluded him and incited him and the cry that he had strangled for so long in his throat issued from his lips
it broke from him like a wail of despair from a hell of sufferers and died in a wail of furious entreaty a cry for an iniquitous abandonment a cry which was but the echo of an obscene scrawl which he had read on the oozing wall of a urinal
he had wandered into a maze of narrow and dirty streets
from the foul laneways he heard bursts of hoarse riot and wrangling and the drawling of drunken singers
he walked onward undismayed wondering whether he had strayed into the quarter of the jews
women and girls dressed in long vivid gowns traversed the street from house to house
they were leisurely and perfumed
a trembling seized him and his eyes grew dim
the yellow gasflames arose before his troubled vision against the vapoury sky burning as if before an altar
before the doors and in the lighted halls groups were gathered arrayed as for some rite
he was in another world he had awakened from a slumber of centuries
he stood still in the middle of the roadway his heart clamouring against his bosom in a tumult
a young woman dressed in a long pink gown laid her hand on his arm to detain him and gazed into his face
she said gaily  good night willie dear
her room was warm and lightsome
a huge doll sat with her legs apart in the copious easychair beside the bed
he tried to bid his tongue speak that he might seem at ease watching her as she undid her gown noting the proud conscious movements of her perfumed head
as he stood silent in the middle of the room she came over to him and embraced him gaily and gravely
her round arms held him firmly to her and he seeing her face lifted to him in serious calm and feeling the warm calm rise and fall of her breast all but burst into hysterical weeping
tears of joy and relief shone in his delighted eyes and his lips parted though they would not speak
she passed her tinkling hand through his hair calling him a little rascal
give me a kiss she said
his lips would not bend to kiss her
he wanted to be held firmly in her arms to be caressed slowly slowly slowly
in her arms he felt that he had suddenly become strong and fearless and sure of himself
but his lips would not bend to kiss her
with a sudden movement she bowed his head and joined her lips to his and he read the meaning of her movements in her frank uplifted eyes
it was too much for him
he closed his eyes surrendering himself to her body and mind conscious of nothing in the world but the dark pressure of her softly parting lips
they pressed upon his brain as upon his lips as though they were the vehicle of a vague speech and between them he felt an unknown and timid pressure darker than the swoon of sin softer than sound or odour
chapter iii   the swift december dusk had come tumbling clownishly after its dull day and as he stared through the dull square of the window of the schoolroom he felt his belly crave for its food
he hoped there would be stew for dinner turnips and carrots and bruised potatoes and fat mutton pieces to be ladled out in thick peppered flourfattened sauce
stuff it into you his belly counselled him
it would be a gloomy secret night
after early nightfall the yellow lamps would light up here and there the squalid quarter of the brothels
he would follow a devious course up and down the streets circling always nearer and nearer in a tremor of fear and joy until his feet led him suddenly round a dark corner
the whores would be just coming out of their houses making ready for the night yawning lazily after their sleep and settling the hairpins in their clusters of hair
he would pass by them calmly waiting for a sudden movement of his own will or a sudden call to his sinloving soul from their soft perfumed flesh
yet as he prowled in quest of that call his senses stultified only by his desire would note keenly all that wounded or shamed them his eyes a ring of porter froth on a clothless table or a photograph of two soldiers standing to attention or a gaudy playbill his ears the drawling jargon of greeting  hello bertie any good in your mind
is that you pigeon
number ten
fresh nelly is waiting on you
good night husband
coming in to have a short time
the equation on the page of his scribbler began to spread out a widening tail eyed and starred like a peacocks and when the eyes and stars of its indices had been eliminated began slowly to fold itself together again
the indices appearing and disappearing were eyes opening and closing the eyes opening and closing were stars being born and being quenched
the vast cycle of starry life bore his weary mind outward to its verge and inward to its centre a distant music accompanying him outward and inward
what music
the music came nearer and he recalled the words the words of shelleys fragment upon the moon wandering companionless pale for weariness
the stars began to crumble and a cloud of fine stardust fell through space
the dull light fell more faintly upon the page whereon another equation began to unfold itself slowly and to spread abroad its widening tail
it was his own soul going forth to experience unfolding itself sin by sin spreading abroad the balefire of its burning stars and folding back upon itself fading slowly quenching its own lights and fires
they were quenched and the cold darkness filled chaos
a cold lucid indifference reigned in his soul
at his first violent sin he had felt a wave of vitality pass out of him and had feared to find his body or his soul maimed by the excess
instead the vital wave had carried him on its bosom out of himself and back again when it receded and no part of body or soul had been maimed but a dark peace had been established between them
the chaos in which his ardour extinguished itself was a cold indifferent knowledge of himself
he had sinned mortally not once but many times and he knew that while he stood in danger of eternal damnation for the first sin alone by every succeeding sin he multiplied his guilt and his punishment
his days and works and thoughts could make no atonement for him the fountains of sanctifying grace having ceased to refresh his soul
at most by an alms given to a beggar whose blessing he fled from he might hope wearily to win for himself some measure of actual grace
devotion had gone by the board
what did it avail to pray when he knew that his soul lusted after its own destruction
a certain pride a certain awe withheld him from offering to god even one prayer at night though he knew it was in gods power to take away his life while he slept and hurl his soul hellward ere he could beg for mercy
his pride in his own sin his loveless awe of god told him that his offence was too grievous to be atoned for in whole or in part by a false homage to the allseeing and allknowing
well now ennis i declare you have a head and so has my stick
do you mean to say that you are not able to tell me what a surd is
the blundering answer stirred the embers of his contempt of his fellows
towards others he felt neither shame nor fear
on sunday mornings as he passed the church door he glanced coldly at the worshippers who stood bareheaded four deep outside the church morally present at the mass which they could neither see nor hear
their dull piety and the sickly smell of the cheap hairoil with which they had anointed their heads repelled him from the altar they prayed at
he stooped to the evil of hypocrisy with others sceptical of their innocence which he could cajole so easily
on the wall of his bedroom hung an illuminated scroll the certificate of his prefecture in the college of the sodality of the blessed virgin mary
on saturday mornings when the sodality met in the chapel to recite the little office his place was a cushioned kneelingdesk at the right of the altar from which he led his wing of boys through the responses
the falsehood of his position did not pain him
if at moments he felt an impulse to rise from his post of honour and confessing before them all his unworthiness to leave the chapel a glance at their faces restrained him
the imagery of the psalms of prophecy soothed his barren pride
the glories of mary held his soul captive spikenard and myrrh and frankincense symbolising her royal lineage her emblems the lateflowering plant and lateblossoming tree symbolising the agelong gradual growth of her cultus among men
when it fell to him to read the lesson towards the close of the office he read it in a veiled voice lulling his conscience to its music
quasi cedrus exaltata sum in libanon et quasi cupressus in monte sion
quasi palma exaltata sum in gades et quasi plantatio rosae in jericho
quasi uliva speciosa in campis et quasi platanus exaltata sum juxta aquam in plateis
sicut cinnamomum et balsamum aromatizans odorem dedi et quasi myrrha electa dedi suavitatem odoris  his sin which had covered him from the sight of god had led him nearer to the refuge of sinners
her eyes seemed to regard him with mild pity her holiness a strange light glowing faintly upon her frail flesh did not humiliate the sinner who approached her
if ever he was impelled to cast sin from him and to repent the impulse that moved him was the wish to be her knight
if ever his soul reentering her dwelling shyly after the frenzy of his bodys lust had spent itself was turned towards her whose emblem is the morning star bright and musical telling of heaven and infusing peace it was when her names were murmured softly by lips whereon there still lingered foul and shameful words the savour itself of a lewd kiss
that was strange
he tried to think how it could be but the dusk deepening in the schoolroom covered over his thoughts
the bell rang
the master marked the sums and cuts to be done for the next lesson and went out
heron beside stephen began to hum tunelessly
my excellent friend bombados
ennis who had gone to the yard came back saying  the boy from the house is coming up for the rector
a tall boy behind stephen rubbed his hands and said  thats game ball
we can scut the whole hour
he wont be in till after half two
then you can ask him questions on the catechism dedalus
stephen leaning back and drawing idly on his scribbler listened to the talk about him which heron checked from time to time by saying  shut up will you
dont make such a bally racket
it was strange too that he found an arid pleasure in following up to the end the rigid lines of the doctrines of the church and penetrating into obscure silences only to hear and feel the more deeply his own condemnation
the sentence of saint james which says that he who offends against one commandment becomes guilty of all had seemed to him first a swollen phrase until he had begun to grope in the darkness of his own state
from the evil seed of lust all other deadly sins had sprung forth pride in himself and contempt of others covetousness in using money for the purchase of unlawful pleasures envy of those whose vices he could not reach to and calumnious murmuring against the pious gluttonous enjoyment of food the dull glowering anger amid which he brooded upon his longing the swamp of spiritual and bodily sloth in which his whole being had sunk
as he sat in his bench gazing calmly at the rectors shrewd harsh face his mind wound itself in and out of the curious questions proposed to it
if a man had stolen a pound in his youth and had used that pound to amass a huge fortune how much was he obliged to give back the pound he had stolen only or the pound together with the compound interest accruing upon it or all his huge fortune
if a layman in giving baptism pour the water before saying the words is the child baptised
is baptism with a mineral water valid
how comes it that while the first beatitude promises the kingdom of heaven to the poor of heart the second beatitude promises also to the meek that they shall possess the land
why was the sacrament of the eucharist instituted under the two species of bread and wine if jesus christ be present body and blood soul and divinity in the bread alone and in the wine alone
does a tiny particle of the consecrated bread contain all the body and blood of jesus christ or a part only of the body and blood
if the wine change into vinegar and the host crumble into corruption after they have been consecrated is jesus christ still present under their species as god and as man
here he is
here he is
a boy from his post at the window had seen the rector come from the house
all the catechisms were opened and all heads bent upon them silently
the rector entered and took his seat on the dais
a gentle kick from the tall boy in the bench behind urged stephen to ask a difficult question
the rector did not ask for a catechism to hear the lesson from
he clasped his hands on the desk and said  the retreat will begin on wednesday afternoon in honour of saint francis xavier whose feast day is saturday
the retreat will go on from wednesday to friday
on friday confession will be heard all the afternoon after beads
if any boys have special confessors perhaps it will be better for them not to change
mass will be on saturday morning at nine oclock and general communion for the whole college
saturday will be a free day
but saturday and sunday being free days some boys might be inclined to think that monday is a free day also
beware of making that mistake
i think you lawless are likely to make that mistake
i sir
why sir
a little wave of quiet mirth broke forth over the class of boys from the rectors grim smile
stephens heart began slowly to fold and fade with fear like a withering flower
the rector went on gravely  you are all familiar with the story of the life of saint francis xavier i suppose the patron of your college
he came of an old and illustrious spanish family and you remember that he was one of the first followers of saint ignatius
they met in paris where francis xavier was professor of philosophy at the university
this young and brilliant nobleman and man of letters entered heart and soul into the ideas of our glorious founder and you know that he at his own desire was sent by saint ignatius to preach to the indians
he is called as you know the apostle of the indies
he went from country to country in the east from africa to india from india to japan baptising the people
he is said to have baptised as many as ten thousand idolaters in one month
it is said that his right arm had grown powerless from having been raised so often over the heads of those whom he baptised
he wished then to go to china to win still more souls for god but he died of fever on the island of sancian
a great saint saint francis xavier
a great soldier of god
the rector paused and then shaking his clasped hands before him went on  he had the faith in him that moves mountains
ten thousand souls won for god in a single month
that is a true conqueror true to the motto of our order ad majorem dei gloriam a saint who has great power in heaven remember power to intercede for us in our grief power to obtain whatever we pray for if it be for the good of our souls power above all to obtain for us the grace to repent if we be in sin
a great saint saint francis xavier
a great fisher of souls
he ceased to shake his clasped hands and resting them against his forehead looked right and left of them keenly at his listeners out of his dark stern eyes
in the silence their dark fire kindled the dusk into a tawny glow
stephens heart had withered up like a flower of the desert that feels the simoom coming from afar
remember only thy last things and thou shalt not sin for everwords taken my dear little brothers in christ from the book of ecclesiastes seventh chapter fortieth verse
in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost
amen
stephen sat in the front bench of the chapel
father arnall sat at a table to the left of the altar
he wore about his shoulders a heavy cloak his pale face was drawn and his voice broken with rheum
the figure of his old master so strangely rearisen brought back to stephens mind his life at clongowes the wide playgrounds swarming with boys the square ditch the little cemetery off the main avenue of limes where he had dreamed of being buried the firelight on the wall of the infirmary where he lay sick the sorrowful face of brother michael
his soul as these memories came back to him became again a childs soul
we are assembled here today my dear little brothers in christ for one brief moment far away from the busy bustle of the outer world to celebrate and to honour one of the greatest of saints the apostle of the indies the patron saint also of your college saint francis xavier
year after year for much longer than any of you my dear little boys can remember or than i can remember the boys of this college have met in this very chapel to make their annual retreat before the feast day of their patron saint
time has gone on and brought with it its changes
even in the last few years what changes can most of you not remember
many of the boys who sat in those front benches a few years ago are perhaps now in distant lands in the burning tropics or immersed in professional duties or in seminaries or voyaging over the vast expanse of the deep or it may be already called by the great god to another life and to the rendering up of their stewardship
and still as the years roll by bringing with them changes for good and bad the memory of the great saint is honoured by the boys of this college who make every year their annual retreat on the days preceding the feast day set apart by our holy mother the church to transmit to all the ages the name and fame of one of the greatest sons of catholic spain
now what is the meaning of this word retreat and why is it allowed on all hands to be a most salutary practice for all who desire to lead before god and in the eyes of men a truly christian life
a retreat my dear boys signifies a withdrawal for a while from the cares of our life the cares of this workaday world in order to examine the state of our conscience to reflect on the mysteries of holy religion and to understand better why we are here in this world
during these few days i intend to put before you some thoughts concerning the four last things
they are as you know from your catechism death judgement hell and heaven
we shall try to understand them fully during these few days so that we may derive from the understanding of them a lasting benefit to our souls
and remember my dear boys that we have been sent into this world for one thing and for one thing alone to do gods holy will and to save our immortal souls
all else is worthless
one thing alone is needful the salvation of ones soul
what doth it profit a man to gain the whole world if he suffer the loss of his immortal soul
ah my dear boys believe me there is nothing in this wretched world that can make up for such a loss
i will ask you therefore my dear boys to put away from your minds during these few days all worldly thoughts whether of study or pleasure or ambition and to give all your attention to the state of your souls
i need hardly remind you that during the days of the retreat all boys are expected to preserve a quiet and pious demeanour and to shun all loud unseemly pleasure
the elder boys of course will see that this custom is not infringed and i look especially to the prefects and officers of the sodality of our blessed lady and of the sodality of the holy angels to set a good example to their fellowstudents
let us try therefore to make this retreat in honour of saint francis with our whole heart and our whole mind
gods blessing will then be upon all your years studies
but above and beyond all let this retreat be one to which you can look back in after years when maybe you are far from this college and among very different surroundings to which you can look back with joy and thankfulness and give thanks to god for having granted you this occasion of laying the first foundation of a pious honourable zealous christian life
and if as may so happen there be at this moment in these benches any poor soul who has had the unutterable misfortune to lose gods holy grace and to fall into grievous sin i fervently trust and pray that this retreat may be the turning point in the life of that soul
i pray to god through the merits of his zealous servant francis xavier that such a soul may be led to sincere repentance and that the holy communion on saint franciss day of this year may be a lasting covenant between god and that soul
for just and unjust for saint and sinner alike may this retreat be a memorable one
help me my dear little brothers in christ
help me by your pious attention by your own devotion by your outward demeanour
banish from your minds all worldly thoughts and think only of the last things death judgement hell and heaven
he who remembers these things says ecclesiastes shall not sin for ever
he who remembers the last things will act and think with them always before his eyes
he will live a good life and die a good death believing and knowing that if he has sacrificed much in this earthly life it will be given to him a hundredfold and a thousandfold more in the life to come in the kingdom without enda blessing my dear boys which i wish you from my heart one and all in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost
amen
as he walked home with silent companions a thick fog seemed to compass his mind
he waited in stupor of mind till it should lift and reveal what it had hidden
he ate his dinner with surly appetite and when the meal was over and the greasestrewn plates lay abandoned on the table he rose and went to the window clearing the thick scum from his mouth with his tongue and licking it from his lips
so he had sunk to the state of a beast that licks his chaps after meat
this was the end and a faint glimmer of fear began to pierce the fog of his mind
he pressed his face against the pane of the window and gazed out into the darkening street
forms passed this way and that through the dull light
and that was life
the letters of the name of dublin lay heavily upon his mind pushing one another surlily hither and thither with slow boorish insistence
his soul was fattening and congealing into a gross grease plunging ever deeper in its dull fear into a sombre threatening dusk while the body that was his stood listless and dishonoured gazing out of darkened eyes helpless perturbed and human for a bovine god to stare upon
the next day brought death and judgement stirring his soul slowly from its listless despair
the faint glimmer of fear became a terror of spirit as the hoarse voice of the preacher blew death into his soul
he suffered its agony
he felt the deathchill touch the extremities and creep onward towards the heart the film of death veiling the eyes the bright centres of the brain extinguished one by one like lamps the last sweat oozing upon the skin the powerlessness of the dying limbs the speech thickening and wandering and failing the heart throbbing faintly and more faintly all but vanquished the breath the poor breath the poor helpless human spirit sobbing and sighing gurgling and rattling in the throat
no help
no help
hehe himselfhis body to which he had yielded was dying
into the grave with it
nail it down into a wooden box the corpse
carry it out of the house on the shoulders of hirelings
thrust it out of mens sight into a long hole in the ground into the grave to rot to feed the mass of its creeping worms and to be devoured by scuttling plumpbellied rats
and while the friends were still standing in tears by the bedside the soul of the sinner was judged
at the last moment of consciousness the whole earthly life passed before the vision of the soul and ere it had time to reflect the body had died and the soul stood terrified before the judgement seat
god who had long been merciful would then be just
he had long been patient pleading with the sinful soul giving it time to repent sparing it yet awhile
but that time had gone
time was to sin and to enjoy time was to scoff at god and at the warnings of his holy church time was to defy his majesty to disobey his commands to hoodwink ones fellow men to commit sin after sin and to hide ones corruption from the sight of men
but that time was over
now it was gods turn and he was not to be hoodwinked or deceived
every sin would then come forth from its lurkingplace the most rebellious against the divine will and the most degrading to our poor corrupt nature the tiniest imperfection and the most heinous atrocity
what did it avail then to have been a great emperor a great general a marvellous inventor the most learned of the learned
all were as one before the judgement seat of god
he would reward the good and punish the wicked
one single instant was enough for the trial of a mans soul
one single instant after the bodys death the soul had been weighed in the balance
the particular judgement was over and the soul had passed to the abode of bliss or to the prison of purgatory or had been hurled howling into hell
nor was that all
gods justice had still to be vindicated before men after the particular there still remained the general judgement
the last day had come
doomsday was at hand
the stars of heaven were falling upon the earth like the figs cast by the figtree which the wind has shaken
the sun the great luminary of the universe had become as sackcloth of hair
the moon was bloodred
the firmament was as a scroll rolled away
the archangel michael the prince of the heavenly host appeared glorious and terrible against the sky
with one foot on the sea and one foot on the land he blew from the archangelical trumpet the brazen death of time
the three blasts of the angel filled all the universe
time is time was but time shall be no more
at the last blast the souls of universal humanity throng towards the valley of jehosaphat rich and poor gentle and simple wise and foolish good and wicked
the soul of every human being that has ever existed the souls of all those who shall yet be born all the sons and daughters of adam all are assembled on that supreme day
and lo the supreme judge is coming
no longer the lowly lamb of god no longer the meek jesus of nazareth no longer the man of sorrows no longer the good shepherd he is seen now coming upon the clouds in great power and majesty attended by nine choirs of angels angels and archangels principalities powers and virtues thrones and dominations cherubim and seraphim god omnipotent god everlasting
he speaks and his voice is heard even at the farthest limits of space even in the bottomless abyss
supreme judge from his sentence there will be and can be no appeal
he calls the just to his side bidding them enter into the kingdom the eternity of bliss prepared for them
the unjust he casts from him crying in his offended majesty depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire which was prepared for the devil and his angels o what agony then for the miserable sinners
friend is torn apart from friend children are torn from their parents husbands from their wives
the poor sinner holds out his arms to those who were dear to him in this earthly world to those whose simple piety perhaps he made a mock of to those who counselled him and tried to lead him on the right path to a kind brother to a loving sister to the mother and father who loved him so dearly
but it is too late the just turn away from the wretched damned souls which now appear before the eyes of all in their hideous and evil character
o you hypocrites o you whited sepulchres o you who present a smooth smiling face to the world while your soul within is a foul swamp of sin how will it fare with you in that terrible day
and this day will come shall come must come the day of death and the day of judgement
it is appointed unto man to die and after death the judgement
death is certain
the time and manner are uncertain whether from long disease or from some unexpected accident the son of god cometh at an hour when you little expect him
be therefore ready every moment seeing that you may die at any moment
death is the end of us all
death and judgement brought into the world by the sin of our first parents are the dark portals that close our earthly existence the portals that open into the unknown and the unseen portals through which every soul must pass alone unaided save by its good works without friend or brother or parent or master to help it alone and trembling
let that thought be ever before our minds and then we cannot sin
death a cause of terror to the sinner is a blessed moment for him who has walked in the right path fulfilling the duties of his station in life attending to his morning and evening prayers approaching the holy sacrament frequently and performing good and merciful works
for the pious and believing catholic for the just man death is no cause of terror
was it not addison the great english writer who when on his deathbed sent for the wicked young earl of warwick to let him see how a christian can meet his end
he it is and he alone the pious and believing christian who can say in his heart      o grave where is thy victory
o death where is thy sting
every word of it was for him
against his sin foul and secret the whole wrath of god was aimed
the preachers knife had probed deeply into his disclosed conscience and he felt now that his soul was festering in sin
yes the preacher was right
gods turn had come
like a beast in its lair his soul had lain down in its own filth but the blasts of the angels trumpet had driven him forth from the darkness of sin into the light
the words of doom cried by the angel shattered in an instant his presumptuous peace
the wind of the last day blew through his mind his sins the jeweleyed harlots of his imagination fled before the hurricane squeaking like mice in their terror and huddled under a mane of hair
as he crossed the square walking homeward the light laughter of a girl reached his burning ear
the frail gay sound smote his heart more strongly than a trumpetblast and not daring to lift his eyes he turned aside and gazed as he walked into the shadow of the tangled shrubs
shame rose from his smitten heart and flooded his whole being
the image of emma appeared before him and under her eyes the flood of shame rushed forth anew from his heart
if she knew to what his mind had subjected her or how his brutelike lust had torn and trampled upon her innocence
was that boyish love
was that chivalry
was that poetry
the sordid details of his orgies stank under his very nostrils
the sootcoated packet of pictures which he had hidden in the flue of the fireplace and in the presence of whose shameless or bashful wantonness he lay for hours sinning in thought and deed his monstrous dreams peopled by apelike creatures and by harlots with gleaming jewel eyes the foul long letters he had written in the joy of guilty confession and carried secretly for days and days only to throw them under cover of night among the grass in the corner of a field or beneath some hingeless door in some niche in the hedges where a girl might come upon them as she walked by and read them secretly
mad
mad
was it possible he had done these things
a cold sweat broke out upon his forehead as the foul memories condensed within his brain
when the agony of shame had passed from him he tried to raise his soul from its abject powerlessness
god and the blessed virgin were too far from him god was too great and stern and the blessed virgin too pure and holy
but he imagined that he stood near emma in a wide land and humbly and in tears bent and kissed the elbow of her sleeve
in the wide land under a tender lucid evening sky a cloud drifting westward amid a pale green sea of heaven they stood together children that had erred
their error had offended deeply gods majesty though it was the error of two children but it had not offended her whose beauty is not like earthly beauty dangerous to look upon but like the morning star which is its emblem bright and musical the eyes were not offended which she turned upon him nor reproachful
she placed their hands together hand in hand and said speaking to their hearts  take hands stephen and emma
it is a beautiful evening now in heaven
you have erred but you are always my children
it is one heart that loves another heart
take hands together my dear children and you will be happy together and your hearts will love each other
the chapel was flooded by the dull scarlet light that filtered through the lowered blinds and through the fissure between the last blind and the sash a shaft of wan light entered like a spear and touched the embossed brasses of the candlesticks upon the altar that gleamed like the battleworn mail armour of angels
rain was falling on the chapel on the garden on the college
it would rain for ever noiselessly
the water would rise inch by inch covering the grass and shrubs covering the trees and houses covering the monuments and the mountain tops
all life would be choked off noiselessly birds men elephants pigs children noiselessly floating corpses amid the litter of the wreckage of the world
forty days and forty nights the rain would fall till the waters covered the face of the earth
it might be
why not
hell has enlarged its soul and opened its mouth without any limitswords  taken my dear little brothers in christ jesus from the book of isaias fifth chapter fourteenth verse
in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost
amen
the preacher took a chainless watch from a pocket within his soutane and having considered its dial for a moment in silence placed it silently before him on the table
he began to speak in a quiet tone
adam and eve my dear boys were as you know our first parents and you will remember that they were created by god in order that the seats in heaven left vacant by the fall of lucifer and his rebellious angels might be filled again
lucifer we are told was a son of the morning a radiant and mighty angel yet he fell he fell and there fell with him a third part of the host of heaven he fell and was hurled with his rebellious angels into hell
what his sin was we cannot say
theologians consider that it was the sin of pride the sinful thought conceived in an instant non serviam i will not serve that instant was his ruin
he offended the majesty of god by the sinful thought of one instant and god cast him out of heaven into hell for ever
adam and eve were then created by god and placed in eden in the plain of damascus that lovely garden resplendent with sunlight and colour teeming with luxuriant vegetation
the fruitful earth gave them her bounty beasts and birds were their willing servants they knew not the ills our flesh is heir to disease and poverty and death all that a great and generous god could do for them was done
but there was one condition imposed on them by god obedience to his word
they were not to eat of the fruit of the forbidden tree
alas my dear little boys they too fell
the devil once a shining angel a son of the morning now a foul fiend came in the shape of a serpent the subtlest of all the beasts of the field
he envied them
he the fallen great one could not bear to think that man a being of clay should possess the inheritance which he by his sin had forfeited for ever
he came to the woman the weaker vessel and poured the poison of his eloquence into her ear promising hero the blasphemy of that promisethat if she and adam ate of the forbidden fruit they would become as gods nay as god himself
eve yielded to the wiles of the arch tempter
she ate the apple and gave it also to adam who had not the moral courage to resist her
the poison tongue of satan had done its work
they fell
and then the voice of god was heard in that garden calling his creature man to account and michael prince of the heavenly host with a sword of flame in his hand appeared before the guilty pair and drove them forth from eden into the world the world of sickness and striving of cruelty and disappointment of labour and hardship to earn their bread in the sweat of their brow
but even then how merciful was god
he took pity on our poor degraded parents and promised that in the fullness of time he would send down from heaven one who would redeem them make them once more children of god and heirs to the kingdom of heaven and that one that redeemer of fallen man was to be gods only begotten son the second person of the most blessed trinity the eternal word
he came
he was born of a virgin pure mary the virgin mother
he was born in a poor cowhouse in judea and lived as a humble carpenter for thirty years until the hour of his mission had come
and then filled with love for men he went forth and called to men to hear the new gospel
did they listen
yes they listened but would not hear
he was seized and bound like a common criminal mocked at as a fool set aside to give place to a public robber scourged with five thousand lashes crowned with a crown of thorns hustled through the streets by the jewish rabble and the roman soldiery stripped of his garments and hanged upon a gibbet and his side was pierced with a lance and from the wounded body of our lord water and blood issued continually
yet even then in that hour of supreme agony our merciful redeemer had pity for mankind
yet even there on the hill of calvary he founded the holy catholic church against which it is promised the gates of hell shall not prevail
he founded it upon the rock of ages and endowed it with his grace with sacraments and sacrifice and promised that if men would obey the word of his church they would still enter into eternal life but if after all that had been done for them they still persisted in their wickedness there remained for them an eternity of torment hell
the preachers voice sank
he paused joined his palms for an instant parted them
then he resumed  now let us try for a moment to realise as far as we can the nature of that abode of the damned which the justice of an offended god has called into existence for the eternal punishment of sinners
hell is a strait and dark and foulsmelling prison an abode of demons and lost souls filled with fire and smoke
the straitness of this prison house is expressly designed by god to punish those who refused to be bound by his laws
in earthly prisons the poor captive has at least some liberty of movement were it only within the four walls of his cell or in the gloomy yard of his prison
not so in hell
there by reason of the great number of the damned the prisoners are heaped together in their awful prison the walls of which are said to be four thousand miles thick and the damned are so utterly bound and helpless that as a blessed saint saint anselm writes in his book on similitudes they are not even able to remove from the eye a worm that gnaws it
they lie in exterior darkness
for remember the fire of hell gives forth no light
as at the command of god the fire of the babylonian furnace lost its heat but not its light so at the command of god the fire of hell while retaining the intensity of its heat burns eternally in darkness
it is a neverending storm of darkness dark flames and dark smoke of burning brimstone amid which the bodies are heaped one upon another without even a glimpse of air
of all the plagues with which the land of the pharaohs were smitten one plague alone that of darkness was called horrible
what name then shall we give to the darkness of hell which is to last not for three days alone but for all eternity
the horror of this strait and dark prison is increased by its awful stench
all the filth of the world all the offal and scum of the world we are told shall run there as to a vast reeking sewer when the terrible conflagration of the last day has purged the world
the brimstone too which burns there in such prodigious quantity fills all hell with its intolerable stench and the bodies of the damned themselves exhale such a pestilential odour that as saint bonaventure says one of them alone would suffice to infect the whole world
the very air of this world that pure element becomes foul and unbreathable when it has been long enclosed
consider then what must be the foulness of the air of hell
imagine some foul and putrid corpse that has lain rotting and decomposing in the grave a jellylike mass of liquid corruption
imagine such a corpse a prey to flames devoured by the fire of burning brimstone and giving off dense choking fumes of nauseous loathsome decomposition
and then imagine this sickening stench multiplied a millionfold and a millionfold again from the millions upon millions of fetid carcasses massed together in the reeking darkness a huge and rotting human fungus
imagine all this and you will have some idea of the horror of the stench of hell
but this stench is not horrible though it is the greatest physical torment to which the damned are subjected
the torment of fire is the greatest torment to which the tyrant has ever subjected his fellow creatures
place your finger for a moment in the flame of a candle and you will feel the pain of fire
but our earthly fire was created by god for the benefit of man to maintain in him the spark of life and to help him in the useful arts whereas the fire of hell is of another quality and was created by god to torture and punish the unrepentant sinner
our earthly fire also consumes more or less rapidly according as the object which it attacks is more or less combustible so that human ingenuity has even succeeded in inventing chemical preparations to check or frustrate its action
but the sulphurous brimstone which burns in hell is a substance which is specially designed to burn for ever and for ever with unspeakable fury
moreover our earthly fire destroys at the same time as it burns so that the more intense it is the shorter is its duration but the fire of hell has this property that it preserves that which it burns and though it rages with incredible intensity it rages for ever
our earthly fire again no matter how fierce or widespread it may be is always of a limited extent but the lake of fire in hell is boundless shoreless and bottomless
it is on record that the devil himself when asked the question by a certain soldier was obliged to confess that if a whole mountain were thrown into the burning ocean of hell it would be burned up in an instant like a piece of wax
and this terrible fire will not afflict the bodies of the damned only from without but each lost soul will be a hell unto itself the boundless fire raging in its very vitals
o how terrible is the lot of those wretched beings
the blood seethes and boils in the veins the brains are boiling in the skull the heart in the breast glowing and bursting the bowels a redhot mass of burning pulp the tender eyes flaming like molten balls
and yet what i have said as to the strength and quality and boundlessness of this fire is as nothing when compared to its intensity an intensity which it has as being the instrument chosen by divine design for the punishment of soul and body alike
it is a fire which proceeds directly from the ire of god working not of its own activity but as an instrument of divine vengeance
as the waters of baptism cleanse the soul with the body so do the fires of punishment torture the spirit with the flesh
every sense of the flesh is tortured and every faculty of the soul therewith the eyes with impenetrable utter darkness the nose with noisome odours the ears with yells and howls and execrations the taste with foul matter leprous corruption nameless suffocating filth the touch with redhot goads and spikes with cruel tongues of flame
and through the several torments of the senses the immortal soul is tortured eternally in its very essence amid the leagues upon leagues of glowing fires kindled in the abyss by the offended majesty of the omnipotent god and fanned into everlasting and everincreasing fury by the breath of the anger of the godhead
consider finally that the torment of this infernal prison is increased by the company of the damned themselves
evil company on earth is so noxious that the plants as if by instinct withdraw from the company of whatsoever is deadly or hurtful to them
in hell all laws are overturnedthere is no thought of family or country of ties of relationships
the damned howl and scream at one another their torture and rage intensified by the presence of beings tortured and raging like themselves
all sense of humanity is forgotten
the yells of the suffering sinners fill the remotest corners of the vast abyss
the mouths of the damned are full of blasphemies against god and of hatred for their fellow sufferers and of curses against those souls which were their accomplices in sin
in olden times it was the custom to punish the parricide the man who had raised his murderous hand against his father by casting him into the depths of the sea in a sack in which were placed a cock a monkey and a serpent
the intention of those lawgivers who framed such a law which seems cruel in our times was to punish the criminal by the company of hurtful and hateful beasts
but what is the fury of those dumb beasts compared with the fury of execration which bursts from the parched lips and aching throats of the damned in hell when they behold in their companions in misery those who aided and abetted them in sin those whose words sowed the first seeds of evil thinking and evil living in their minds those whose immodest suggestions led them on to sin those whose eyes tempted and allured them from the path of virtue
they turn upon those accomplices and upbraid them and curse them
but they are helpless and hopeless it is too late now for repentance
last of all consider the frightful torment to those damned souls tempters and tempted alike of the company of the devils
these devils will afflict the damned in two ways by their presence and by their reproaches
we can have no idea of how horrible these devils are
saint catherine of siena once saw a devil and she has written that rather than look again for one single instant on such a frightful monster she would prefer to walk until the end of her life along a track of red coals
these devils who were once beautiful angels have become as hideous and ugly as they once were beautiful
they mock and jeer at the lost souls whom they dragged down to ruin
it is they the foul demons who are made in hell the voices of conscience
why did you sin
why did you lend an ear to the temptings of friends
why did you turn aside from your pious practices and good works
why did you not shun the occasions of sin
why did you not leave that evil companion
why did you not give up that lewd habit that impure habit
why did you not listen to the counsels of your confessor
why did you not even after you had fallen the first or the second or the third or the fourth or the hundredth time repent of your evil ways and turn to god who only waited for your repentance to absolve you of your sins
now the time for repentance has gone by
time is time was but time shall be no more
time was to sin in secrecy to indulge in that sloth and pride to covet the unlawful to yield to the promptings of your lower nature to live like the beasts of the field nay worse than the beasts of the field for they at least are but brutes and have no reason to guide them time was but time shall be no more
god spoke to you by so many voices but you would not hear
you would not crush out that pride and anger in your heart you would not restore those illgotten goods you would not obey the precepts of your holy church nor attend to your religious duties you would not abandon those wicked companions you would not avoid those dangerous temptations
such is the language of those fiendish tormentors words of taunting and of reproach of hatred and of disgust
of disgust yes
for even they the very devils when they sinned sinned by such a sin as alone was compatible with such angelical natures a rebellion of the intellect and they even they the foul devils must turn away revolted and disgusted from the contemplation of those unspeakable sins by which degraded man outrages and defiles the temple of the holy ghost defiles and pollutes himself
o my dear little brothers in christ may it never be our lot to hear that language
may it never be our lot i say
in the last day of terrible reckoning i pray fervently to god that not a single soul of those who are in this chapel today may be found among those miserable beings whom the great judge shall command to depart for ever from his sight that not one of us may ever hear ringing in his ears the awful sentence of rejection depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire which was prepared for the devil and his angels  he came down the aisle of the chapel his legs shaking and the scalp of his head trembling as though it had been touched by ghostly fingers
he passed up the staircase and into the corridor along the walls of which the overcoats and waterproofs hung like gibbeted malefactors headless and dripping and shapeless
and at every step he feared that he had already died that his soul had been wrenched forth of the sheath of his body that he was plunging headlong through space
he could not grip the floor with his feet and sat heavily at his desk opening one of his books at random and poring over it
every word for him
it was true
god was almighty
god could call him now call him as he sat at his desk before he had time to be conscious of the summons
god had called him
yes
what
yes
his flesh shrank together as it felt the approach of the ravenous tongues of flames dried up as it felt about it the swirl of stifling air
he had died
yes
he was judged
a wave of fire swept through his body the first
again a wave
his brain began to glow
another
his brain was simmering and bubbling within the cracking tenement of the skull
flames burst forth from his skull like a corolla shrieking like voices  hell
hell
hell
hell
hell
voices spoke near him  on hell
i suppose he rubbed it into you well
you bet he did
he put us all into a blue funk
thats what you fellows want and plenty of it to make you work
he leaned back weakly in his desk
he had not died
god had spared him still
he was still in the familiar world of the school
mr tate and vincent heron stood at the window talking jesting gazing out at the bleak rain moving their heads
i wish it would clear up
i had arranged to go for a spin on the bike with some fellows out by malahide
but the roads must be kneedeep
it might clear up sir
the voices that he knew so well the common words the quiet of the classroom when the voices paused and the silence was filled by the sound of softly browsing cattle as the other boys munched their lunches tranquilly lulled his aching soul
there was still time
o mary refuge of sinners intercede for him
o virgin undefiled save him from the gulf of death
the english lesson began with the hearing of the history
royal persons favourites intriguers bishops passed like mute phantoms behind their veil of names
all had died all had been judged
what did it profit a man to gain the whole world if he lost his soul
at last he had understood and human life lay around him a plain of peace whereon antlike men laboured in brotherhood their dead sleeping under quiet mounds
the elbow of his companion touched him and his heart was touched and when he spoke to answer a question of his master he heard his own voice full of the quietude of humility and contrition
his soul sank back deeper into depths of contrite peace no longer able to suffer the pain of dread and sending forth as he sank a faint prayer
ah yes he would still be spared he would repent in his heart and be forgiven and then those above those in heaven would see what he would do to make up for the past a whole life every hour of life
only wait
all god
all all
a messenger came to the door to say that confessions were being heard in the chapel
four boys left the room and he heard others passing down the corridor
a tremulous chill blew round his heart no stronger than a little wind and yet listening and suffering silently he seemed to have laid an ear against the muscle of his own heart feeling it close and quail listening to the flutter of its ventricles
no escape
he had to confess to speak out in words what he had done and thought sin after sin
how
how
father i
the thought slid like a cold shining rapier into his tender flesh confession
but not there in the chapel of the college
he would confess all every sin of deed and thought sincerely but not there among his school companions
far away from there in some dark place he would murmur out his own shame and he besought god humbly not to be offended with him if he did not dare to confess in the college chapel and in utter abjection of spirit he craved forgiveness mutely of the boyish hearts about him
time passed
he sat again in the front bench of the chapel
the daylight without was already failing and as it fell slowly through the dull red blinds it seemed that the sun of the last day was going down and that all souls were being gathered for the judgement
i am cast away from the sight of thine eyes words taken my dear little brothers in christ from the book of psalms thirtieth chapter twentythird verse
in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost
amen
the preacher began to speak in a quiet friendly tone
his face was kind and he joined gently the fingers of each hand forming a frail cage by the union of their tips
this morning we endeavoured in our reflection upon hell to make what our holy founder calls in his book of spiritual exercises the composition of place
we endeavoured that is to imagine with the senses of the mind in our imagination the material character of that awful place and of the physical torments which all who are in hell endure
this evening we shall consider for a few moments the nature of the spiritual torments of hell
sin remember is a twofold enormity
it is a base consent to the promptings of our corrupt nature to the lower instincts to that which is gross and beastlike and it is also a turning away from the counsel of our higher nature from all that is pure and holy from the holy god himself
for this reason mortal sin is punished in hell by two different forms of punishment physical and spiritual
now of all these spiritual pains by far the greatest is the pain of loss so great in fact that in itself it is a torment greater than all the others
saint thomas the greatest doctor of the church the angelic doctor as he is called says that the worst damnation consists in this that the understanding of man is totally deprived of divine light and his affection obstinately turned away from the goodness of god
god remember is a being infinitely good and therefore the loss of such a being must be a loss infinitely painful
in this life we have not a very clear idea of what such a loss must be but the damned in hell for their greater torment have a full understanding of that which they have lost and understand that they have lost it through their own sins and have lost it for ever
at the very instant of death the bonds of the flesh are broken asunder and the soul at once flies towards god as towards the centre of her existence
remember my dear little boys our souls long to be with god
we come from god we live by god we belong to god we are his inalienably his
god loves with a divine love every human soul and every human soul lives in that love
how could it be otherwise
every breath that we draw every thought of our brain every instant of life proceeds from gods inexhaustible goodness
and if it be pain for a mother to be parted from her child for a man to be exiled from hearth and home for friend to be sundered from friend o think what pain what anguish it must be for the poor soul to be spurned from the presence of the supremely good and loving creator who has called that soul into existence from nothingness and sustained it in life and loved it with an immeasurable love
this then to be separated for ever from its greatest good from god and to feel the anguish of that separation knowing full well that it is unchangeable this is the greatest torment which the created soul is capable of bearing pna damni the pain of loss
the second pain which will afflict the souls of the damned in hell is the pain of conscience
just as in dead bodies worms are engendered by putrefaction so in the souls of the lost there arises a perpetual remorse from the putrefaction of sin the sting of conscience the worm as pope innocent the third calls it of the triple sting
the first sting inflicted by this cruel worm will be the memory of past pleasures
o what a dreadful memory will that be
in the lake of alldevouring flame the proud king will remember the pomps of his court the wise but wicked man his libraries and instruments of research the lover of artistic pleasures his marbles and pictures and other art treasures he who delighted in the pleasures of the table his gorgeous feasts his dishes prepared with such delicacy his choice wines the miser will remember his hoard of gold the robber his illgotten wealth the angry and revengeful and merciless murderers their deeds of blood and violence in which they revelled the impure and adulterous the unspeakable and filthy pleasures in which they delighted
they will remember all this and loathe themselves and their sins
for how miserable will all those pleasures seem to the soul condemned to suffer in hellfire for ages and ages
how they will rage and fume to think that they have lost the bliss of heaven for the dross of earth for a few pieces of metal for vain honours for bodily comforts for a tingling of the nerves
they will repent indeed and this is the second sting of the worm of conscience a late and fruitless sorrow for sins committed
divine justice insists that the understanding of those miserable wretches be fixed continually on the sins of which they were guilty and moreover as saint augustine points out god will impart to them his own knowledge of sin so that sin will appear to them in all its hideous malice as it appears to the eyes of god himself
they will behold their sins in all their foulness and repent but it will be too late and then they will bewail the good occasions which they neglected
this is the last and deepest and most cruel sting of the worm of conscience
the conscience will say you had time and opportunity to repent and would not
you were brought up religiously by your parents
you had the sacraments and grace and indulgences of the church to aid you
you had the minister of god to preach to you to call you back when you had strayed to forgive you your sins no matter how many how abominable if only you had confessed and repented
no
you would not
you flouted the ministers of holy religion you turned your back on the confessional you wallowed deeper and deeper in the mire of sin
god appealed to you threatened you entreated you to return to him
o what shame what misery
the ruler of the universe entreated you a creature of clay to love him who made you and to keep his law
no
you would not
and now though you were to flood all hell with your tears if you could still weep all that sea of repentance would not gain for you what a single tear of true repentance shed during your mortal life would have gained for you
you implore now a moment of earthly life wherein to repent in vain
that time is gone gone for ever
such is the threefold sting of conscience the viper which gnaws the very hearts core of the wretches in hell so that filled with hellish fury they curse themselves for their folly and curse the evil companions who have brought them to such ruin and curse the devils who tempted them in life and now mock them in eternity and even revile and curse the supreme being whose goodness and patience they scorned and slighted but whose justice and power they cannot evade
the next spiritual pain to which the damned are subjected is the pain of extension
man in this earthly life though he be capable of many evils is not capable of them all at once inasmuch as one evil corrects and counteracts another just as one poison frequently corrects another
in hell on the contrary one torment instead of counteracting another lends it still greater force and moreover as the internal faculties are more perfect than the external senses so are they more capable of suffering
just as every sense is afflicted with a fitting torment so is every spiritual faculty the fancy with horrible images the sensitive faculty with alternate longing and rage the mind and understanding with an interior darkness more terrible even than the exterior darkness which reigns in that dreadful prison
the malice impotent though it be which possesses these demon souls is an evil of boundless extension of limitless duration a frightful state of wickedness which we can scarcely realise unless we bear in mind the enormity of sin and the hatred god bears to it
opposed to this pain of extension and yet coexistent with it we have the pain of intensity
hell is the centre of evils and as you know things are more intense at their centres than at their remotest points
there are no contraries or admixtures of any kind to temper or soften in the least the pains of hell
nay things which are good in themselves become evil in hell
company elsewhere a source of comfort to the afflicted will be there a continual torment knowledge so much longed for as the chief good of the intellect will there be hated worse than ignorance light so much coveted by all creatures from the lord of creation down to the humblest plant in the forest will be loathed intensely
in this life our sorrows are either not very long or not very great because nature either overcomes them by habits or puts an end to them by sinking under their weight
but in hell the torments cannot be overcome by habit for while they are of terrible intensity they are at the same time of continual variety each pain so to speak taking fire from another and reendowing that which has enkindled it with a still fiercer flame
nor can nature escape from these intense and various tortures by succumbing to them for the soul is sustained and maintained in evil so that its suffering may be the greater
boundless extension of torment incredible intensity of suffering unceasing variety of torturethis is what the divine majesty so outraged by sinners demands this is what the holiness of heaven slighted and set aside for the lustful and low pleasures of the corrupt flesh requires this is what the blood of the innocent lamb of god shed for the redemption of sinners trampled upon by the vilest of the vile insists upon
last and crowning torture of all the tortures of that awful place is the eternity of hell
eternity
o dread and dire word
eternity
what mind of man can understand it
and remember it is an eternity of pain
even though the pains of hell were not so terrible as they are yet they would become infinite as they are destined to last for ever
but while they are everlasting they are at the same time as you know intolerably intense unbearably extensive
to bear even the sting of an insect for all eternity would be a dreadful torment
what must it be then to bear the manifold tortures of hell for ever
for ever
for all eternity
not for a year or for an age but for ever
try to imagine the awful meaning of this
you have often seen the sand on the seashore
how fine are its tiny grains
and how many of those tiny little grains go to make up the small handful which a child grasps in its play
now imagine a mountain of that sand a million miles high reaching from the earth to the farthest heavens and a million miles broad extending to remotest space and a million miles in thickness and imagine such an enormous mass of countless particles of sand multiplied as often as there are leaves in the forest drops of water in the mighty ocean feathers on birds scales on fish hairs on animals atoms in the vast expanse of the air and imagine that at the end of every million years a little bird came to that mountain and carried away in its beak a tiny grain of that sand
how many millions upon millions of centuries would pass before that bird had carried away even a square foot of that mountain how many eons upon eons of ages before it had carried away all
yet at the end of that immense stretch of time not even one instant of eternity could be said to have ended
at the end of all those billions and trillions of years eternity would have scarcely begun
and if that mountain rose again after it had been all carried away and if the bird came again and carried it all away again grain by grain and if it so rose and sank as many times as there are stars in the sky atoms in the air drops of water in the sea leaves on the trees feathers upon birds scales upon fish hairs upon animals at the end of all those innumerable risings and sinkings of that immeasurably vast mountain not one single instant of eternity could be said to have ended even then at the end of such a period after that eon of time the mere thought of which makes our very brain reel dizzily eternity would scarcely have begun
a holy saint one of our own fathers i believe it was was once vouchsafed a vision of hell
it seemed to him that he stood in the midst of a great hall dark and silent save for the ticking of a great clock
the ticking went on unceasingly and it seemed to this saint that the sound of the ticking was the ceaseless repetition of the words ever never ever never
ever to be in hell never to be in heaven ever to be shut off from the presence of god never to enjoy the beatific vision ever to be eaten with flames gnawed by vermin goaded with burning spikes never to be free from those pains ever to have the conscience upbraid one the memory enrage the mind filled with darkness and despair never to escape ever to curse and revile the foul demons who gloat fiendishly over the misery of their dupes never to behold the shining raiment of the blessed spirits ever to cry out of the abyss of fire to god for an instant a single instant of respite from such awful agony never to receive even for an instant gods pardon ever to suffer never to enjoy ever to be damned never to be saved ever never ever never
o what a dreadful punishment
an eternity of endless agony of endless bodily and spiritual torment without one ray of hope without one moment of cessation of agony limitless in intensity of torment infinitely varied of torture that sustains eternally that which it eternally devours of anguish that everlastingly preys upon the spirit while it racks the flesh an eternity every instant of which is itself an eternity of woe
such is the terrible punishment decreed for those who die in mortal sin by an almighty and a just god
yes a just god
men reasoning always as men are astonished that god should mete out an everlasting and infinite punishment in the fires of hell for a single grievous sin
they reason thus because blinded by the gross illusion of the flesh and the darkness of human understanding they are unable to comprehend the hideous malice of mortal sin
they reason thus because they are unable to comprehend that even venial sin is of such a foul and hideous nature that even if the omnipotent creator could end all the evil and misery in the world the wars the diseases the robberies the crimes the deaths the murders on condition that he allowed a single venial sin to pass unpunished a single venial sin a lie an angry look a moment of wilful sloth he the great omnipotent god could not do so because sin be it in thought or deed is a transgression of his law and god would not be god if he did not punish the transgressor
a sin an instant of rebellious pride of the intellect made lucifer and a third part of the cohort of angels fall from their glory
a sin an instant of folly and weakness drove adam and eve out of eden and brought death and suffering into the world
to retrieve the consequences of that sin the only begotten son of god came down to earth lived and suffered and died a most painful death hanging for three hours on the cross
o my dear little brethren in christ jesus will we then offend that good redeemer and provoke his anger
will we trample again upon that torn and mangled corpse
will we spit upon that face so full of sorrow and love
will we too like the cruel jews and the brutal soldiers mock that gentle and compassionate saviour who trod alone for our sake the awful winepress of sorrow
every word of sin is a wound in his tender side
every sinful act is a thorn piercing his head
every impure thought deliberately yielded to is a keen lance transfixing that sacred and loving heart
no no
it is impossible for any human being to do that which offends so deeply the divine majesty that which is punished by an eternity of agony that which crucifies again the son of god and makes a mockery of him
i pray to god that my poor words may have availed today to confirm in holiness those who are in a state of grace to strengthen the wavering to lead back to the state of grace the poor soul that has strayed if any such be among you
i pray to god and do you pray with me that we may repent of our sins
i will ask you now all of you to repeat after me the act of contrition kneeling here in this humble chapel in the presence of god
he is there in the tabernacle burning with love for mankind ready to comfort the afflicted
be not afraid
no matter how many or how foul the sins if you only repent of them they will be forgiven you
let no worldly shame hold you back
god is still the merciful lord who wishes not the eternal death of the sinner but rather that he be converted and live
he calls you to him
you are his
he made you out of nothing
he loved you as only a god can love
his arms are open to receive you even though you have sinned against him
come to him poor sinner poor vain and erring sinner
now is the acceptable time
now is the hour
the priest rose and turning towards the altar knelt upon the step before the tabernacle in the fallen gloom
he waited till all in the chapel had knelt and every least noise was still
then raising his head he repeated the act of contrition phrase by phrase with fervour
the boys answered him phrase by phrase
stephen his tongue cleaving to his palate bowed his head praying with his heart
 o my god   o my god   i am heartily sorry   i am heartily sorry   for having offended thee   for having offended thee   and i detest my sins   and i detest my sins   above every other evil   above every other evil   because they displease thee my god   because they displease thee my god   who art so deserving   who art so deserving   of all my love   of all my love   and i firmly purpose   and i firmly purpose   by thy holy grace   by thy holy grace   never more to offend thee   never more to offend thee   and to amend my life   and to amend my life  he went up to his room after dinner in order to be alone with his soul and at every step his soul seemed to sigh at every step his soul mounted with his feet sighing in the ascent through a region of viscid gloom
he halted on the landing before the door and then grasping the porcelain knob opened the door quickly
he waited in fear his soul pining within him praying silently that death might not touch his brow as he passed over the threshold that the fiends that inhabit darkness might not be given power over him
he waited still at the threshold as at the entrance to some dark cave
faces were there eyes they waited and watched
we knew perfectly well of course that though it was bound to come to the light he would find considerable difficulty in endeavouring to try to induce himself to try to endeavour to ascertain the spiritual plenipotentiary and so we knew of course perfectly well  murmuring faces waited and watched murmurous voices filled the dark shell of the cave
he feared intensely in spirit and in flesh but raising his head bravely he strode into the room firmly
a doorway a room the same room same window
he told himself calmly that those words had absolutely no sense which had seemed to rise murmurously from the dark
he told himself that it was simply his room with the door open
he closed the door and walking swiftly to the bed knelt beside it and covered his face with his hands
his hands were cold and damp and his limbs ached with chill
bodily unrest and chill and weariness beset him routing his thoughts
why was he kneeling there like a child saying his evening prayers
to be alone with his soul to examine his conscience to meet his sins face to face to recall their times and manners and circumstances to weep over them
he could not weep
he could not summon them to his memory
he felt only an ache of soul and body his whole being memory will understanding flesh benumbed and weary
that was the work of devils to scatter his thoughts and overcloud his conscience assailing him at the gates of the cowardly and sincorrupted flesh and praying god timidly to forgive him his weakness he crawled up on to the bed and wrapping the blankets closely about him covered his face again with his hands
he had sinned
he had sinned so deeply against heaven and before god that he was not worthy to be called gods child
could it be that he stephen dedalus had done those things
his conscience sighed in answer
yes he had done them secretly filthily time after time and hardened in sinful impenitence he had dared to wear the mask of holiness before the tabernacle itself while his soul within was a living mass of corruption
how came it that god had not struck him dead
the leprous company of his sins closed about him breathing upon him bending over him from all sides
he strove to forget them in an act of prayer huddling his limbs closer together and binding down his eyelids but the senses of his soul would not be bound and though his eyes were shut fast he saw the places where he had sinned and though his ears were tightly covered he heard
he desired with all his will not to hear or see
he desired till his frame shook under the strain of his desire and until the senses of his soul closed
they closed for an instant and then opened
he saw
a field of stiff weeds and thistles and tufted nettlebunches
thick among the tufts of rank stiff growth lay battered canisters and clots and coils of solid excrement
a faint marshlight struggling upwards from all the ordure through the bristling greygreen weeds
an evil smell faint and foul as the light curled upwards sluggishly out of the canisters and from the stale crusted dung
creatures were in the field one three six creatures were moving in the field hither and thither
goatish creatures with human faces hornybrowed lightly bearded and grey as indiarubber
the malice of evil glittered in their hard eyes as they moved hither and thither trailing their long tails behind them
a rictus of cruel malignity lit up greyly their old bony faces
one was clasping about his ribs a torn flannel waistcoat another complained monotonously as his beard stuck in the tufted weeds
soft language issued from their spittleless lips as they swished in slow circles round and round the field winding hither and thither through the weeds dragging their long tails amid the rattling canisters
they moved in slow circles circling closer and closer to enclose to enclose soft language issuing from their lips their long swishing tails besmeared with stale shite thrusting upwards their terrific faces  help
he flung the blankets from him madly to free his face and neck
that was his hell
god had allowed him to see the hell reserved for his sins stinking bestial malignant a hell of lecherous goatish fiends
for him
for him
he sprang from the bed the reeking odour pouring down his throat clogging and revolting his entrails
air
the air of heaven
he stumbled towards the window groaning and almost fainting with sickness
at the washstand a convulsion seized him within and clasping his cold forehead wildly he vomited profusely in agony
when the fit had spent itself he walked weakly to the window and lifting the sash sat in a corner of the embrasure and leaned his elbow upon the sill
the rain had drawn off and amid the moving vapours from point to point of light the city was spinning about herself a soft cocoon of yellowish haze
heaven was still and faintly luminous and the air sweet to breathe as in a thicket drenched with showers and amid peace and shimmering lights and quiet fragrance he made a covenant with his heart
he prayed  he once had meant to come on earth in heavenly glory but we sinned and then he could not safely visit us but with a shrouded majesty and a bedimmed radiance for he was god
so he came himself in weakness not in power and he sent thee a creature in his stead with a creatures comeliness and lustre suited to our state
and now thy very face and form dear mother speak to us of the eternal not like earthly beauty dangerous to look upon but like the morning star which is thy emblem bright and musical breathing purity telling of heaven and infusing peace
o harbringer of day
o light of the pilgrim
lead us still as thou hast led
in the dark night across the bleak wilderness guide us on to our lord jesus guide us home  his eyes were dimmed with tears and looking humbly up to heaven he wept for the innocence he had lost
when evening had fallen he left the house and the first touch of the damp dark air and the noise of the door as it closed behind him made ache again his conscience lulled by prayer and tears
confess
confess
it was not enough to lull the conscience with a tear and a prayer
he had to kneel before the minister of the holy ghost and tell over his hidden sins truly and repentantly
before he heard again the footboard of the housedoor trail over the threshold as it opened to let him in before he saw again the table in the kitchen set for supper he would have knelt and confessed
it was quite simple
the ache of conscience ceased and he walked onward swiftly through the dark streets
there were so many flagstones on the footpath of that street and so many streets in that city and so many cities in the world
yet eternity had no end
he was in mortal sin
even once was a mortal sin
it could happen in an instant
but how so quickly
by seeing or by thinking of seeing
the eyes see the thing without having wished first to see
then in an instant it happens
but does that part of the body understand or what
the serpent the most subtle beast of the field
it must understand when it desires in one instant and then prolongs its own desire instant after instant sinfully
it feels and understands and desires
what a horrible thing
who made it to be like that a bestial part of the body able to understand bestially and desire bestially
was that then he or an inhuman thing moved by a lower soul
his soul sickened at the thought of a torpid snaky life feeding itself out of the tender marrow of his life and fattening upon the slime of lust
o why was that so
o why
he cowered in the shadow of the thought abasing himself in the awe of god who had made all things and all men
madness
who could think such a thought
and cowering in darkness and abject he prayed mutely to his guardian angel to drive away with his sword the demon that was whispering to his brain
the whisper ceased and he knew then clearly that his own soul had sinned in thought and word and deed wilfully through his own body
confess
he had to confess every sin
how could he utter in words to the priest what he had done
must must
or how could he explain without dying of shame
or how could he have done such things without shame
a madman
confess
o he would indeed to be free and sinless again
perhaps the priest would know
o dear god
he walked on and on through illlit streets fearing to stand still for a moment lest it might seem that he held back from what awaited him fearing to arrive at that towards which he still turned with longing
how beautiful must be a soul in the state of grace when god looked upon it with love
frowsy girls sat along the curbstones before their baskets
their dank hair hung trailed over their brows
they were not beautiful to see as they crouched in the mire
but their souls were seen by god and if their souls were in a state of grace they were radiant to see and god loved them seeing them
a wasting breath of humiliation blew bleakly over his soul to think of how he had fallen to feel that those souls were dearer to god than his
the wind blew over him and passed on to the myriads and myriads of other souls on whom gods favour shone now more and now less stars now brighter and now dimmer sustained and failing
and the glimmering souls passed away sustained and failing merged in a moving breath
one soul was lost a tiny soul his
it flickered once and went out forgotten lost
the end black cold void waste
consciousness of place came ebbing back to him slowly over a vast tract of time unlit unfelt unlived
the squalid scene composed itself around him the common accents the burning gasjets in the shops odours of fish and spirits and wet sawdust moving men and women
an old woman was about to cross the street an oilcan in her hand
he bent down and asked her was there a chapel near
a chapel sir
yes sir
church street chapel
church
she shifted the can to her other hand and directed him and as she held out her reeking withered right hand under its fringe of shawl he bent lower towards her saddened and soothed by her voice
thank you
you are quite welcome sir
the candles on the high altar had been extinguished but the fragrance of incense still floated down the dim nave
bearded workmen with pious faces were guiding a canopy out through a side door the sacristan aiding them with quiet gestures and words
a few of the faithful still lingered praying before one of the sidealtars or kneeling in the benches near the confessionals
he approached timidly and knelt at the last bench in the body thankful for the peace and silence and fragrant shadow of the church
the board on which he knelt was narrow and worn and those who knelt near him were humble followers of jesus
jesus too had been born in poverty and had worked in the shop of a carpenter cutting boards and planing them and had first spoken of the kingdom of god to poor fishermen teaching all men to be meek and humble of heart
he bowed his head upon his hands bidding his heart be meek and humble that he might be like those who knelt beside him and his prayer as acceptable as theirs
he prayed beside them but it was hard
his soul was foul with sin and he dared not ask forgiveness with the simple trust of those whom jesus in the mysterious ways of god had called first to his side the carpenters the fishermen poor and simple people following a lowly trade handling and shaping the wood of trees mending their nets with patience
a tall figure came down the aisle and the penitents stirred and at the last moment glancing up swiftly he saw a long grey beard and the brown habit of a capuchin
the priest entered the box and was hidden
two penitents rose and entered the confessional at either side
the wooden slide was drawn back and the faint murmur of a voice troubled the silence
his blood began to murmur in his veins murmuring like a sinful city summoned from its sleep to hear its doom
little flakes of fire fell and powdery ashes fell softly alighting on the houses of men
they stirred waking from sleep troubled by the heated air
the slide was shot back
the penitent emerged from the side of the box
the farther side was drawn
a woman entered quietly and deftly where the first penitent had knelt
the faint murmur began again
he could still leave the chapel
he could stand up put one foot before the other and walk out softly and then run run run swiftly through the dark streets
he could still escape from the shame
had it been any terrible crime but that one sin
had it been murder
little fiery flakes fell and touched him at all points shameful thoughts shameful words shameful acts
shame covered him wholly like fine glowing ashes falling continually
to say it in words
his soul stifling and helpless would cease to be
the slide was shot back
a penitent emerged from the farther side of the box
the near slide was drawn
a penitent entered where the other penitent had come out
a soft whispering noise floated in vaporous cloudlets out of the box
it was the woman soft whispering cloudlets soft whispering vapour whispering and vanishing
he beat his breast with his fist humbly secretly under cover of the wooden armrest
he would be at one with others and with god
he would love his neighbour
he would love god who had made and loved him
he would kneel and pray with others and be happy
god would look down on him and on them and would love them all
it was easy to be good
gods yoke was sweet and light
it was better never to have sinned to have remained always a child for god loved little children and suffered them to come to him
it was a terrible and a sad thing to sin
but god was merciful to poor sinners who were truly sorry
how true that was
that was indeed goodness
the slide was shot to suddenly
the penitent came out
he was next
he stood up in terror and walked blindly into the box
at last it had come
he knelt in the silent gloom and raised his eyes to the white crucifix suspended above him
god could see that he was sorry
he would tell all his sins
his confession would be long long
everybody in the chapel would know then what a sinner he had been
let them know
it was true
but god had promised to forgive him if he was sorry
he was sorry
he clasped his hands and raised them towards the white form praying with his darkened eyes praying with all his trembling body swaying his head to and fro like a lost creature praying with whimpering lips
sorry
sorry
o sorry
the slide clicked back and his heart bounded in his breast
the face of an old priest was at the grating averted from him leaning upon a hand
he made the sign of the cross and prayed of the priest to bless him for he had sinned
then bowing his head he repeated the confiteor in fright
at the words my most grievous fault he ceased breathless
how long is it since your last confession my child
a long time father
a month my child
longer father
three months my child
longer father
six months
eight months father
he had begun
the priest asked  and what do you remember since that time
he began to confess his sins masses missed prayers not said lies
anything else my child
sins of anger envy of others gluttony vanity disobedience
anything else my child
there was no help
he murmured  i committed sins of impurity father
the priest did not turn his head
with yourself my child
and with others
with women my child
yes father
were they married women my child
he did not know
his sins trickled from his lips one by one trickled in shameful drops from his soul festering and oozing like a sore a squalid stream of vice
the last sins oozed forth sluggish filthy
there was no more to tell
he bowed his head overcome
the priest was silent
then he asked  how old are you my child
sixteen father
the priest passed his hand several times over his face
then resting his forehead against his hand he leaned towards the grating and with eyes still averted spoke slowly
his voice was weary and old
you are very young my child he said and let me implore of you to give up that sin
it is a terrible sin
it kills the body and it kills the soul
it is the cause of many crimes and misfortunes
give it up my child for gods sake
it is dishonourable and unmanly
you cannot know where that wretched habit will lead you or where it will come against you
as long as you commit that sin my poor child you will never be worth one farthing to god
pray to our mother mary to help you
she will help you my child
pray to our blessed lady when that sin comes into your mind
i am sure you will do that will you not
you repent of all those sins
i am sure you do
and you will promise god now that by his holy grace you will never offend him any more by that wicked sin
you will make that solemn promise to god will you not
yes father
the old and weary voice fell like sweet rain upon his quaking parching heart
how sweet and sad
do so my poor child
the devil has led you astray
drive him back to hell when he tempts you to dishonour your body in that waythe foul spirit who hates our lord
promise god now that you will give up that sin that wretched wretched sin
blinded by his tears and by the light of gods mercifulness he bent his head and heard the grave words of absolution spoken and saw the priests hand raised above him in token of forgiveness
god bless you my child
pray for me
he knelt to say his penance praying in a corner of the dark nave and his prayers ascended to heaven from his purified heart like perfume streaming upwards from a heart of white rose
the muddy streets were gay
he strode homeward conscious of an invisible grace pervading and making light his limbs
in spite of all he had done it
he had confessed and god had pardoned him
his soul was made fair and holy once more holy and happy
it would be beautiful to die if god so willed
it was beautiful to live in grace a life of peace and virtue and forbearance with others
he sat by the fire in the kitchen not daring to speak for happiness
till that moment he had not known how beautiful and peaceful life could be
the green square of paper pinned round the lamp cast down a tender shade
on the dresser was a plate of sausages and white pudding and on the shelf there were eggs
they would be for the breakfast in the morning after the communion in the college chapel
white pudding and eggs and sausages and cups of tea
how simple and beautiful was life after all
and life lay all before him
in a dream he fell asleep
in a dream he rose and saw that it was morning
in a waking dream he went through the quiet morning towards the college
the boys were all there kneeling in their places
he knelt among them happy and shy
the altar was heaped with fragrant masses of white flowers and in the morning light the pale flames of the candles among the white flowers were clear and silent as his own soul
he knelt before the altar with his classmates holding the altar cloth with them over a living rail of hands
his hands were trembling and his soul trembled as he heard the priest pass with the ciborium from communicant to communicant
corpus domini nostri
could it be
he knelt there sinless and timid and he would hold upon his tongue the host and god would enter his purified body
in vitam eternam
amen  another life
a life of grace and virtue and happiness
it was true
it was not a dream from which he would wake
the past was past
corpus domini nostri
the ciborium had come to him
chapter iv   sunday was dedicated to the mystery of the holy trinity monday to the holy ghost tuesday to the guardian angels wednesday to saint joseph thursday to the most blessed sacrament of the altar friday to the suffering jesus saturday to the blessed virgin mary
every morning he hallowed himself anew in the presence of some holy image or mystery
his day began with an heroic offering of its every moment of thought or action for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff and with an early mass
the raw morning air whetted his resolute piety and often as he knelt among the few worshippers at the sidealtar following with his interleaved prayerbook the murmur of the priest he glanced up for an instant towards the vested figure standing in the gloom between the two candles which were the old and the new testaments and imagined that he was kneeling at mass in the catacombs
his daily life was laid out in devotional areas
by means of ejaculations and prayers he stored up ungrudgingly for the souls in purgatory centuries of days and quarantines and years yet the spiritual triumph which he felt in achieving with ease so many fabulous ages of canonical penances did not wholly reward his zeal of prayer since he could never know how much temporal punishment he had remitted by way of suffrage for the agonising souls and fearful lest in the midst of the purgatorial fire which differed from the infernal only in that it was not everlasting his penance might avail no more than a drop of moisture he drove his soul daily through an increasing circle of works of supererogation
every part of his day divided by what he regarded now as the duties of his station in life circled about its own centre of spiritual energy
his life seemed to have drawn near to eternity every thought word and deed every instance of consciousness could be made to revibrate radiantly in heaven and at times his sense of such immediate repercussion was so lively that he seemed to feel his soul in devotion pressing like fingers the keyboard of a great cash register and to see the amount of his purchase start forth immediately in heaven not as a number but as a frail column of incense or as a slender flower
the rosaries too which he said constantlyfor he carried his beads loose in his trousers pockets that he might tell them as he walked the streetstransformed themselves into coronals of flowers of such vague unearthly texture that they seemed to him as hueless and odourless as they were nameless
he offered up each of his three daily chaplets that his soul might grow strong in each of the three theological virtues in faith in the father who had created him in hope in the son who had redeemed him and in love of the holy ghost who had sanctified him and this thrice triple prayer he offered to the three persons through mary in the name of her joyful and sorrowful and glorious mysteries
on each of the seven days of the week he further prayed that one of the seven gifts of the holy ghost might descend upon his soul and drive out of it day by day the seven deadly sins which had defiled it in the past and he prayed for each gift on its appointed day confident that it would descend upon him though it seemed strange to him at times that wisdom and understanding and knowledge were so distinct in their nature that each should be prayed for apart from the others
yet he believed that at some future stage of his spiritual progress this difficulty would be removed when his sinful soul had been raised up from its weakness and enlightened by the third person of the most blessed trinity
he believed this all the more and with trepidation because of the divine gloom and silence wherein dwelt the unseen paraclete whose symbols were a dove and a mighty wind to sin against whom was a sin beyond forgiveness the eternal mysterious secret being to whom as god the priests offered up mass once a year robed in the scarlet of the tongues of fire
the imagery through which the nature and kinship of the three persons of the trinity were darkly shadowed forth in the books of devotion which he readthe father contemplating from all eternity as in a mirror his divine perfections and thereby begetting eternally the eternal son and the holy spirit proceeding out of father and son from all eternitywere easier of acceptance by his mind by reason of their august incomprehensibility than was the simple fact that god had loved his soul from all eternity for ages before he had been born into the world for ages before the world itself had existed
he had heard the names of the passions of love and hate pronounced solemnly on the stage and in the pulpit had found them set forth solemnly in books and had wondered why his soul was unable to harbour them for any time or to force his lips to utter their names with conviction
a brief anger had often invested him but he had never been able to make it an abiding passion and had always felt himself passing out of it as if his very body were being divested with ease of some outer skin or peel
he had felt a subtle dark and murmurous presence penetrate his being and fire him with a brief iniquitous lust it too had slipped beyond his grasp leaving his mind lucid and indifferent
this it seemed was the only love and that the only hate his soul would harbour
but he could no longer disbelieve in the reality of love since god himself had loved his individual soul with divine love from all eternity
gradually as his soul was enriched with spiritual knowledge he saw the whole world forming one vast symmetrical expression of gods power and love
life became a divine gift for every moment and sensation of which were it even the sight of a single leaf hanging on the twig of a tree his soul should praise and thank the giver
the world for all its solid substance and complexity no longer existed for his soul save as a theorem of divine power and love and universality
so entire and unquestionable was this sense of the divine meaning in all nature granted to his soul that he could scarcely understand why it was in any way necessary that he should continue to live
yet that was part of the divine purpose and he dared not question its use he above all others who had sinned so deeply and so foully against the divine purpose
meek and abased by this consciousness of the one eternal omnipresent perfect reality his soul took up again her burden of pieties masses and prayers and sacraments and mortifications and only then for the first time since he had brooded on the great mystery of love did he feel within him a warm movement like that of some newly born life or virtue of the soul itself
the attitude of rapture in sacred art the raised and parted hands the parted lips and eyes as of one about to swoon became for him an image of the soul in prayer humiliated and faint before her creator
but he had been forewarned of the dangers of spiritual exaltation and did not allow himself to desist from even the least or lowliest devotion striving also by constant mortification to undo the sinful past rather than to achieve a saintliness fraught with peril
each of his senses was brought under a rigorous discipline
in order to mortify the sense of sight he made it his rule to walk in the street with downcast eyes glancing neither to right nor left and never behind him
his eyes shunned every encounter with the eyes of women
from time to time also he balked them by a sudden effort of the will as by lifting them suddenly in the middle of an unfinished sentence and closing the book
to mortify his hearing he exerted no control over his voice which was then breaking neither sang nor whistled and made no attempt to flee from noises which caused him painful nervous irritation such as the sharpening of knives on the knifeboard the gathering of cinders on the fireshovel and the twigging of the carpet
to mortify his smell was more difficult as he found in himself no instinctive repugnance to bad odours whether they were the odours of the outdoor world such as those of dung or tar or the odours of his own person among which he had made many curious comparisons and experiments
he found in the end that the only odour against which his sense of smell revolted was a certain stale fishy stink like that of longstanding urine and whenever it was possible he subjected himself to this unpleasant odour
to mortify the taste he practised strict habits at table observed to the letter all the fasts of the church and sought by distraction to divert his mind from the savours of different foods
but it was to the mortification of touch he brought the most assiduous ingenuity of inventiveness
he never consciously changed his position in bed sat in the most uncomfortable positions suffered patiently every itch and pain kept away from the fire remained on his knees all through the mass except at the gospels left part of his neck and face undried so that air might sting them and whenever he was not saying his beads carried his arms stiffly at his sides like a runner and never in his pockets or clasped behind him
he had no temptations to sin mortally
it surprised him however to find that at the end of his course of intricate piety and selfrestraint he was so easily at the mercy of childish and unworthy imperfections
his prayers and fasts availed him little for the suppression of anger at hearing his mother sneeze or at being disturbed in his devotions
it needed an immense effort of his will to master the impulse which urged him to give outlet to such irritation
images of the outbursts of trivial anger which he had often noted among his masters their twitching mouths closeshut lips and flushed cheeks recurred to his memory discouraging him for all his practice of humility by the comparison
to merge his life in the common tide of other lives was harder for him than any fasting or prayer and it was his constant failure to do this to his own satisfaction which caused in his soul at last a sensation of spiritual dryness together with a growth of doubts and scruples
his soul traversed a period of desolation in which the sacraments themselves seemed to have turned into dried up sources
his confession became a channel for the escape of scrupulous and unrepented imperfections
his actual reception of the eucharist did not bring him the same dissolving moments of virginal selfsurrender as did those spiritual communions made by him sometimes at the close of some visit to the blessed sacrament
the book which he used for these visits was an old neglected book written by saint alphonsus liguori with fading characters and sere foxpapered leaves
a faded world of fervent love and virginal responses seemed to be evoked for his soul by the reading of its pages in which the imagery of the canticles was interwoven with the communicants prayers
an inaudible voice seemed to caress the soul telling her names and glories bidding her arise as for espousal and come away bidding her look forth a spouse from amana and from the mountains of the leopards and the soul seemed to answer with the same inaudible voice surrendering herself inter ubera mea commorabitur  this idea of surrender had a perilous attraction for his mind now that he felt his soul beset once again by the insistent voices of the flesh which began to murmur to him again during his prayers and meditations
it gave him an intense sense of power to know that he could by a single act of consent in a moment of thought undo all that he had done
he seemed to feel a flood slowly advancing towards his naked feet and to be waiting for the first faint timid noiseless wavelet to touch his fevered skin
then almost at the instant of that touch almost at the verge of sinful consent he found himself standing far away from the flood upon a dry shore saved by a sudden act of the will or a sudden ejaculation and seeing the silver line of the flood far away and beginning again its slow advance towards his feet a new thrill of power and satisfaction shook his soul to know that he had not yielded nor undone all
when he had eluded the flood of temptation many times in this way he grew troubled and wondered whether the grace which he had refused to lose was not being filched from him little by little
the clear certitude of his own immunity grew dim and to it succeeded a vague fear that his soul had really fallen unawares
it was with difficulty that he won back his old consciousness of his state of grace by telling himself that he had prayed to god at every temptation and that the grace which he had prayed for must have been given to him inasmuch as god was obliged to give it
the very frequency and violence of temptations showed him at last the truth of what he had heard about the trials of the saints
frequent and violent temptations were a proof that the citadel of the soul had not fallen and that the devil raged to make it fall
often when he had confessed his doubts and scruples some momentary inattention at prayer a movement of trivial anger in his soul or a subtle wilfulness in speech or act he was bidden by his confessor to name some sin of his past life before absolution was given him
he named it with humility and shame and repented of it once more
it humiliated and shamed him to think that he would never be freed from it wholly however holily he might live or whatever virtues or perfections he might attain
a restless feeling of guilt would always be present with him he would confess and repent and be absolved confess and repent again and be absolved again fruitlessly
perhaps that first hasty confession wrung from him by the fear of hell had not been good
perhaps concerned only for his imminent doom he had not had sincere sorrow for his sin
but the surest sign that his confession had been good and that he had had sincere sorrow for his sin was he knew the amendment of his life
i have amended my life have i not
he asked himself
the director stood in the embrasure of the window his back to the light leaning an elbow on the brown crossblind and as he spoke and smiled slowly dangling and looping the cord of the other blind stephen stood before him following for a moment with his eyes the waning of the long summer daylight above the roofs or the slow deft movements of the priestly fingers
the priests face was in total shadow but the waning daylight from behind him touched the deeply grooved temples and the curves of the skull
stephen followed also with his ears the accents and intervals of the priests voice as he spoke gravely and cordially of indifferent themes the vacation which had just ended the colleges of the order abroad the transference of masters
the grave and cordial voice went on easily with its tale and in the pauses stephen felt bound to set it on again with respectful questions
he knew that the tale was a prelude and his mind waited for the sequel
ever since the message of summons had come for him from the director his mind had struggled to find the meaning of the message and during the long restless time he had sat in the college parlour waiting for the director to come in his eyes had wandered from one sober picture to another around the walls and his mind wandered from one guess to another until the meaning of the summons had almost become clear
then just as he was wishing that some unforeseen cause might prevent the director from coming he had heard the handle of the door turning and the swish of a soutane
the director had begun to speak of the dominican and franciscan orders and of the friendship between saint thomas and saint bonaventure
the capuchin dress he thought was rather too  stephens face gave back the priests indulgent smile and not being anxious to give an opinion he made a slight dubitative movement with his lips
i believe continued the director that there is some talk now among the capuchins themselves of doing away with it and following the example of the other franciscans
i suppose they would retain it in the cloisters
said stephen
o certainly said the director
for the cloister it is all right but for the street i really think it would be better to do away with it dont you
it must be troublesome i imagine
of course it is of course
just imagine when i was in belgium i used to see them out cycling in all kinds of weather with this thing up about their knees
it was really ridiculous
les jupes they call them in belgium
the vowel was so modified as to be indistinct
what do they call them
les jupes
o
stephen smiled again in answer to the smile which he could not see on the priests shadowed face its image or spectre only passing rapidly across his mind as the low discreet accent fell upon his ear
he gazed calmly before him at the waning sky glad of the cool of the evening and of the faint yellow glow which hid the tiny flame kindling upon his cheek
the names of articles of dress worn by women or of certain soft and delicate stuffs used in their making brought always to his mind a delicate and sinful perfume
as a boy he had imagined the reins by which horses are driven as slender silken bands and it shocked him to feel at stradbrooke the greasy leather of harness
it had shocked him too when he had felt for the first time beneath his tremulous fingers the brittle texture of a womans stocking for retaining nothing of all he read save that which seemed to him an echo or a prophecy of his own state it was only amid softworded phrases or within rosesoft stuffs that he dared to conceive of the soul or body of a woman moving with tender life
but the phrase on the priests lips was disingenuous for he knew that a priest should not speak lightly on that theme
the phrase had been spoken lightly with design and he felt that his face was being searched by the eyes in the shadow
whatever he had heard or read of the craft of jesuits he had put aside frankly as not borne out by his own experience
his masters even when they had not attracted him had seemed to him always intelligent and serious priests athletic and highspirited prefects
he thought of them as men who washed their bodies briskly with cold water and wore clean cold linen
during all the years he had lived among them in clongowes and in belvedere he had received only two pandies and though these had been dealt him in the wrong he knew that he had often escaped punishment
during all those years he had never heard from any of his masters a flippant word it was they who had taught him christian doctrine and urged him to live a good life and when he had fallen into grievous sin it was they who had led him back to grace
their presence had made him diffident of himself when he was a muff in clongowes and it had made him diffident of himself also while he had held his equivocal position in belvedere
a constant sense of this had remained with him up to the last year of his school life
he had never once disobeyed or allowed turbulent companions to seduce him from his habit of quiet obedience and even when he doubted some statement of a master he had never presumed to doubt openly
lately some of their judgements had sounded a little childish in his ears and had made him feel a regret and pity as though he were slowly passing out of an accustomed world and were hearing its language for the last time
one day when some boys had gathered round a priest under the shed near the chapel he had heard the priest say  i believe that lord macaulay was a man who probably never committed a mortal sin in his life that is to say a deliberate mortal sin
some of the boys had then asked the priest if victor hugo were not the greatest french writer
the priest had answered that victor hugo had never written half so well when he had turned against the church as he had written when he was a catholic
but there are many eminent french critics said the priest who consider that even victor hugo great as he certainly was had not so pure a french style as louis veuillot
the tiny flame which the priests allusion had kindled upon stephens cheek had sunk down again and his eyes were still fixed calmly on the colourless sky
but an unresting doubt flew hither and thither before his mind
masked memories passed quickly before him he recognised scenes and persons yet he was conscious that he had failed to perceive some vital circumstance in them
he saw himself walking about the grounds watching the sports in clongowes and eating slim jim out of his cricketcap
some jesuits were walking round the cycletrack in the company of ladies
the echoes of certain expressions used in clongowes sounded in remote caves of his mind
his ears were listening to these distant echoes amid the silence of the parlour when he became aware that the priest was addressing him in a different voice
i sent for you today stephen because i wished to speak to you on a very important subject
yes sir
have you ever felt that you had a vocation
stephen parted his lips to answer yes and then withheld the word suddenly
the priest waited for the answer and added  i mean have you ever felt within yourself in your soul a desire to join the order
think
i have sometimes thought of it said stephen
the priest let the blindcord fall to one side and uniting his hands leaned his chin gravely upon them communing with himself
in a college like this he said at length there is one boy or perhaps two or three boys whom god calls to the religious life
such a boy is marked off from his companions by his piety by the good example he shows to others
he is looked up to by them he is chosen perhaps as prefect by his fellow sodalists
and you stephen have been such a boy in this college prefect of our blessed ladys sodality
perhaps you are the boy in this college whom god designs to call to himself
a strong note of pride reinforcing the gravity of the priests voice made stephens heart quicken in response
to receive that call stephen said the priest is the greatest honour that the almighty god can bestow upon a man
no king or emperor on this earth has the power of the priest of god
no angel or archangel in heaven no saint not even the blessed virgin herself has the power of a priest of god the power of the keys the power to bind and to loose from sin the power of exorcism the power to cast out from the creatures of god the evil spirits that have power over them the power the authority to make the great god of heaven come down upon the altar and take the form of bread and wine
what an awful power stephen
a flame began to flutter again on stephens cheek as he heard in this proud address an echo of his own proud musings
how often had he seen himself as a priest wielding calmly and humbly the awful power of which angels and saints stood in reverence
his soul had loved to muse in secret on this desire
he had seen himself a young and silentmannered priest entering a confessional swiftly ascending the altarsteps incensing genuflecting accomplishing the vague acts of the priesthood which pleased him by reason of their semblance of reality and of their distance from it
in that dim life which he had lived through in his musings he had assumed the voices and gestures which he had noted with various priests
he had bent his knee sideways like such a one he had shaken the thurible only slightly like such a one his chasuble had swung open like that of such another as he turned to the altar again after having blessed the people
and above all it had pleased him to fill the second place in those dim scenes of his imagining
he shrank from the dignity of celebrant because it displeased him to imagine that all the vague pomp should end in his own person or that the ritual should assign to him so clear and final an office
he longed for the minor sacred offices to be vested with the tunicle of subdeacon at high mass to stand aloof from the altar forgotten by the people his shoulders covered with a humeral veil holding the paten within its folds or when the sacrifice had been accomplished to stand as deacon in a dalmatic of cloth of gold on the step below the celebrant his hands joined and his face towards the people and sing the chant ite missa est if ever he had seen himself celebrant it was as in the pictures of the mass in his childs massbook in a church without worshippers save for the angel of the sacrifice at a bare altar and served by an acolyte scarcely more boyish than himself
in vague sacrificial or sacramental acts alone his will seemed drawn to go forth to encounter reality and it was partly the absence of an appointed rite which had always constrained him to inaction whether he had allowed silence to cover his anger or pride or had suffered only an embrace he longed to give
he listened in reverent silence now to the priests appeal and through the words he heard even more distinctly a voice bidding him approach offering him secret knowledge and secret power
he would know then what was the sin of simon magus and what the sin against the holy ghost for which there was no forgiveness
he would know obscure things hidden from others from those who were conceived and born children of wrath
he would know the sins the sinful longings and sinful thoughts and sinful acts of others hearing them murmured into his ears in the confessional under the shame of a darkened chapel by the lips of women and of girls but rendered immune mysteriously at his ordination by the imposition of hands his soul would pass again uncontaminated to the white peace of the altar
no touch of sin would linger upon the hands with which he would elevate and break the host no touch of sin would linger on his lips in prayer to make him eat and drink damnation to himself not discerning the body of the lord
he would hold his secret knowledge and secret power being as sinless as the innocent and he would be a priest for ever according to the order of melchisedec
i will offer up my mass tomorrow morning said the director that almighty god may reveal to you his holy will
and let you stephen make a novena to your holy patron saint the first martyr who is very powerful with god that god may enlighten your mind
but you must be quite sure stephen that you have a vocation because it would be terrible if you found afterwards that you had none
once a priest always a priest remember
your catechism tells you that the sacrament of holy orders is one of those which can be received only once because it imprints on the soul an indelible spiritual mark which can never be effaced
it is before you must weigh well not after
it is a solemn question stephen because on it may depend the salvation of your eternal soul
but we will pray to god together
he held open the heavy hall door and gave his hand as if already to a companion in the spiritual life
stephen passed out on to the wide platform above the steps and was conscious of the caress of mild evening air
towards findlaters church a quartet of young men were striding along with linked arms swaying their heads and stepping to the agile melody of their leaders concertina
the music passed in an instant as the first bars of sudden music always did over the fantastic fabrics of his mind dissolving them painlessly and noiselessly as a sudden wave dissolves the sandbuilt turrets of children
smiling at the trivial air he raised his eyes to the priests face and seeing in it a mirthless reflection of the sunken day detached his hand slowly which had acquiesced faintly in that companionship
as he descended the steps the impression which effaced his troubled selfcommunion was that of a mirthless mask reflecting a sunken day from the threshold of the college
the shadow then of the life of the college passed gravely over his consciousness
it was a grave and ordered and passionless life that awaited him a life without material cares
he wondered how he would pass the first night in the novitiate and with what dismay he would wake the first morning in the dormitory
the troubling odour of the long corridors of clongowes came back to him and he heard the discreet murmur of the burning gasflames
at once from every part of his being unrest began to irradiate
a feverish quickening of his pulses followed and a din of meaningless words drove his reasoned thoughts hither and thither confusedly
his lungs dilated and sank as if he were inhaling a warm moist unsustaining air and he smelt again the moist warm air which hung in the bath in clongowes above the sluggish turfcoloured water
some instinct waking at these memories stronger than education or piety quickened within him at every near approach to that life an instinct subtle and hostile and armed him against acquiescence
the chill and order of the life repelled him
he saw himself rising in the cold of the morning and filing down with the others to early mass and trying vainly to struggle with his prayers against the fainting sickness of his stomach
he saw himself sitting at dinner with the community of a college
what then had become of that deeprooted shyness of his which had made him loth to eat or drink under a strange roof
what had come of the pride of his spirit which had always made him conceive himself as a being apart in every order
the reverend stephen dedalus s j
his name in that new life leaped into characters before his eyes and to it there followed a mental sensation of an undefined face or colour of a face
the colour faded and became strong like a changing glow of pallid brick red
was it the raw reddish glow he had so often seen on wintry mornings on the shaven gills of the priests
the face was eyeless and sourfavoured and devout shot with pink tinges of suffocated anger
was it not a mental spectre of the face of one of the jesuits whom some of the boys called lantern jaws and others foxy campbell
he was passing at that moment before the jesuit house in gardiner street and wondered vaguely which window would be his if he ever joined the order
then he wondered at the vagueness of his wonder at the remoteness of his own soul from what he had hitherto imagined her sanctuary at the frail hold which so many years of order and obedience had of him when once a definite and irrevocable act of his threatened to end for ever in time and in eternity his freedom
the voice of the director urging upon him the proud claims of the church and the mystery and power of the priestly office repeated itself idly in his memory
his soul was not there to hear and greet it and he knew now that the exhortation he had listened to had already fallen into an idle formal tale
he would never swing the thurible before the tabernacle as priest
his destiny was to be elusive of social or religious orders
the wisdom of the priests appeal did not touch him to the quick
he was destined to learn his own wisdom apart from others or to learn the wisdom of others himself wandering among the snares of the world
the snares of the world were its ways of sin
he would fall
he had not yet fallen but he would fall silently in an instant
not to fall was too hard too hard and he felt the silent lapse of his soul as it would be at some instant to come falling falling but not yet fallen still unfallen but about to fall
he crossed the bridge over the stream of the tolka and turned his eyes coldly for an instant towards the faded blue shrine of the blessed virgin which stood fowlwise on a pole in the middle of a hamshaped encampment of poor cottages
then bending to the left he followed the lane which led up to his house
the faint sour stink of rotted cabbages came towards him from the kitchen gardens on the rising ground above the river
he smiled to think that it was this disorder the misrule and confusion of his fathers house and the stagnation of vegetable life which was to win the day in his soul
then a short laugh broke from his lips as he thought of that solitary farmhand in the kitchen gardens behind their house whom they had nicknamed the man with the hat
a second laugh taking rise from the first after a pause broke from him involuntarily as he thought of how the man with the hat worked considering in turn the four points of the sky and then regretfully plunging his spade in the earth
he pushed open the latchless door of the porch and passed through the naked hallway into the kitchen
a group of his brothers and sisters was sitting round the table
tea was nearly over and only the last of the second watered tea remained in the bottoms of the small glass jars and jampots which did service for teacups
discarded crusts and lumps of sugared bread turned brown by the tea which had been poured over them lay scattered on the table
little wells of tea lay here and there on the board and a knife with a broken ivory handle was stuck through the pith of a ravaged turnover
the sad quiet greyblue glow of the dying day came through the window and the open door covering over and allaying quietly a sudden instinct of remorse in stephens heart
all that had been denied them had been freely given to him the eldest but the quiet glow of evening showed him in their faces no sign of rancour
he sat near them at the table and asked where his father and mother were
one answered  goneboro toboro lookboro atboro aboro houseboro
still another removal
a boy named fallon in belvedere had often asked him with a silly laugh why they moved so often
a frown of scorn darkened quickly his forehead as he heard again the silly laugh of the questioner
he asked  why are we on the move again if its a fair question
becauseboro theboro landboro lordboro willboro putboro usboro outboro
the voice of his youngest brother from the farther side of the fireplace began to sing the air oft in the stilly night
one by one the others took up the air until a full choir of voices was singing
they would sing so for hours melody after melody glee after glee till the last pale light died down on the horizon till the first dark nightclouds came forth and night fell
he waited for some moments listening before he too took up the air with them
he was listening with pain of spirit to the overtone of weariness behind their frail fresh innocent voices
even before they set out on lifes journey they seemed weary already of the way
he heard the choir of voices in the kitchen echoed and multiplied through an endless reverberation of the choirs of endless generations of children and heard in all the echoes an echo also of the recurring note of weariness and pain
all seemed weary of life even before entering upon it
and he remembered that newman had heard this note also in the broken lines of virgil giving utterance like the voice of nature herself to that pain and weariness yet hope of better things which has been the experience of her children in every time  he could wait no longer
from the door of byrons publichouse to the gate of clontarf chapel from the gate of clontarf chapel to the door of byrons publichouse and then back again to the chapel and then back again to the publichouse he had paced slowly at first planting his steps scrupulously in the spaces of the patchwork of the footpath then timing their fall to the fall of verses
a full hour had passed since his father had gone in with dan crosby the tutor to find out for him something about the university
for a full hour he had paced up and down waiting but he could wait no longer
he set off abruptly for the bull walking rapidly lest his fathers shrill whistle might call him back and in a few moments he had rounded the curve at the police barrack and was safe
yes his mother was hostile to the idea as he had read from her listless silence
yet her mistrust pricked him more keenly than his fathers pride and he thought coldly how he had watched the faith which was fading down in his soul ageing and strengthening in her eyes
a dim antagonism gathered force within him and darkened his mind as a cloud against her disloyalty and when it passed cloudlike leaving his mind serene and dutiful towards her again he was made aware dimly and without regret of a first noiseless sundering of their lives
the university
so he had passed beyond the challenge of the sentries who had stood as guardians of his boyhood and had sought to keep him among them that he might be subject to them and serve their ends
pride after satisfaction uplifted him like long slow waves
the end he had been born to serve yet did not see had led him to escape by an unseen path and now it beckoned to him once more and a new adventure was about to be opened to him
it seemed to him that he heard notes of fitful music leaping upwards a tone and downwards a diminished fourth upwards a tone and downwards a major third like triplebranching flames leaping fitfully flame after flame out of a midnight wood
it was an elfin prelude endless and formless and as it grew wilder and faster the flames leaping out of time he seemed to hear from under the boughs and grasses wild creatures racing their feet pattering like rain upon the leaves
their feet passed in pattering tumult over his mind the feet of hares and rabbits the feet of harts and hinds and antelopes until he heard them no more and remembered only a proud cadence from newman  whose feet are as the feet of harts and underneath the everlasting arms
the pride of that dim image brought back to his mind the dignity of the office he had refused
all through his boyhood he had mused upon that which he had so often thought to be his destiny and when the moment had come for him to obey the call he had turned aside obeying a wayward instinct
now time lay between the oils of ordination would never anoint his body
he had refused
why
he turned seaward from the road at dollymount and as he passed on to the thin wooden bridge he felt the planks shaking with the tramp of heavily shod feet
a squad of christian brothers was on its way back from the bull and had begun to pass two by two across the bridge
soon the whole bridge was trembling and resounding
the uncouth faces passed him two by two stained yellow or red or livid by the sea and as he strove to look at them with ease and indifference a faint stain of personal shame and commiseration rose to his own face
angry with himself he tried to hide his face from their eyes by gazing down sideways into the shallow swirling water under the bridge but he still saw a reflection therein of their topheavy silk hats and humble tapelike collars and loosely hanging clerical clothes
brother hickey
brother quaid
brother macardle
brother keogh   their piety would be like their names like their faces like their clothes and it was idle for him to tell himself that their humble and contrite hearts it might be paid a far richer tribute of devotion than his had ever been a gift tenfold more acceptable than his elaborate adoration
it was idle for him to move himself to be generous towards them to tell himself that if he ever came to their gates stripped of his pride beaten and in beggars weeds that they would be generous towards him loving him as themselves
idle and embittering finally to argue against his own dispassionate certitude that the commandment of love bade us not to love our neighbour as ourselves with the same amount and intensity of love but to love him as ourselves with the same kind of love
he drew forth a phrase from his treasure and spoke it softly to himself  a day of dappled seaborne clouds
the phrase and the day and the scene harmonised in a chord
words
was it their colours
he allowed them to glow and fade hue after hue sunrise gold the russet and green of apple orchards azure of waves the greyfringed fleece of clouds
no it was not their colours it was the poise and balance of the period itself
did he then love the rhythmic rise and fall of words better than their associations of legend and colour
or was it that being as weak of sight as he was shy of mind he drew less pleasure from the reflection of the glowing sensible world through the prism of a language manycoloured and richly storied than from the contemplation of an inner world of individual emotions mirrored perfectly in a lucid supple periodic prose
he passed from the trembling bridge on to firm land again
at that instant as it seemed to him the air was chilled and looking askance towards the water he saw a flying squall darkening and crisping suddenly the tide
a faint click at his heart a faint throb in his throat told him once more of how his flesh dreaded the cold infrahuman odour of the sea yet he did not strike across the downs on his left but held straight on along the spine of rocks that pointed against the rivers mouth
a veiled sunlight lit up faintly the grey sheet of water where the river was embayed
in the distance along the course of the slowflowing liffey slender masts flecked the sky and more distant still the dim fabric of the city lay prone in haze
like a scene on some vague arras old as mans weariness the image of the seventh city of christendom was visible to him across the timeless air no older nor more weary nor less patient of subjection than in the days of the thingmote
disheartened he raised his eyes towards the slowdrifting clouds dappled and seaborne
they were voyaging across the deserts of the sky a host of nomads on the march voyaging high over ireland westward bound
the europe they had come from lay out there beyond the irish sea europe of strange tongues and valleyed and woodbegirt and citadelled and of entrenched and marshalled races
he heard a confused music within him as of memories and names which he was almost conscious of but could not capture even for an instant then the music seemed to recede to recede to recede and from each receding trail of nebulous music there fell always one longdrawn calling note piercing like a star the dusk of silence
again
again
again
a voice from beyond the world was calling
hello stephanos

he recognised their speech collectively before he distinguished their faces
the mere sight of that medley of wet nakedness chilled him to the bone
their bodies corpsewhite or suffused with a pallid golden light or rawly tanned by the sun gleamed with the wet of the sea
their divingstone poised on its rude supports and rocking under their plunges and the roughhewn stones of the sloping breakwater over which they scrambled in their horseplay gleamed with cold wet lustre
the towels with which they smacked their bodies were heavy with cold seawater and drenched with cold brine was their matted hair
he stood still in deference to their calls and parried their banter with easy words
how characterless they looked shuley without his deep unbuttoned collar ennis without his scarlet belt with the snaky clasp and connolly without his norfolk coat with the flapless sidepockets
it was a pain to see them and a swordlike pain to see the signs of adolescence that made repellent their pitiable nakedness
perhaps they had taken refuge in number and noise from the secret dread in their souls
but he apart from them and in silence remembered in what dread he stood of the mystery of his own body
stephanos dedalos
bous stephanoumenos
bous stephaneforos
their banter was not new to him and now it flattered his mild proud sovereignty
now as never before his strange name seemed to him a prophecy
so timeless seemed the grey warm air so fluid and impersonal his own mood that all ages were as one to him
a moment before the ghost of the ancient kingdom of the danes had looked forth through the vesture of the hazewrapped city
now at the name of the fabulous artificer he seemed to hear the noise of dim waves and to see a winged form flying above the waves and slowly climbing the air
what did it mean
was it a quaint device opening a page of some medieval book of prophecies and symbols a hawklike man flying sunward above the sea a prophecy of the end he had been born to serve and had been following through the mists of childhood and boyhood a symbol of the artist forging anew in his workshop out of the sluggish matter of the earth a new soaring impalpable imperishable being
his heart trembled his breath came faster and a wild spirit passed over his limbs as though he was soaring sunward
his heart trembled in an ecstasy of fear and his soul was in flight
his soul was soaring in an air beyond the world and the body he knew was purified in a breath and delivered of incertitude and made radiant and commingled with the element of the spirit
an ecstasy of flight made radiant his eyes and wild his breath and tremulous and wild and radiant his windswept limbs

stephaneforos
his throat ached with a desire to cry aloud the cry of a hawk or eagle on high to cry piercingly of his deliverance to the winds
this was the call of life to his soul not the dull gross voice of the world of duties and despair not the inhuman voice that had called him to the pale service of the altar
an instant of wild flight had delivered him and the cry of triumph which his lips withheld cleft his brain
stephaneforos
what were they now but cerements shaken from the body of deaththe fear he had walked in night and day the incertitude that had ringed him round the shame that had abased him within and withoutcerements the linens of the grave
his soul had arisen from the grave of boyhood spurning her graveclothes
yes
yes
yes
he would create proudly out of the freedom and power of his soul as the great artificer whose name he bore a living thing new and soaring and beautiful impalpable imperishable
he started up nervously from the stoneblock for he could no longer quench the flame in his blood
he felt his cheeks aflame and his throat throbbing with song
there was a lust of wandering in his feet that burned to set out for the ends of the earth
on
on
his heart seemed to cry
evening would deepen above the sea night fall upon the plains dawn glimmer before the wanderer and show him strange fields and hills and faces
where
he looked northward towards howth
the sea had fallen below the line of seawrack on the shallow side of the breakwater and already the tide was running out fast along the foreshore
already one long oval bank of sand lay warm and dry amid the wavelets
here and there warm isles of sand gleamed above the shallow tide and about the isles and around the long bank and amid the shallow currents of the beach were lightclad figures wading and delving
in a few moments he was barefoot his stockings folded in his pockets and his canvas shoes dangling by their knotted laces over his shoulders and picking a pointed salteaten stick out of the jetsam among the rocks he clambered down the slope of the breakwater
there was a long rivulet in the strand and as he waded slowly up its course he wondered at the endless drift of seaweed
emerald and black and russet and olive it moved beneath the current swaying and turning
the water of the rivulet was dark with endless drift and mirrored the highdrifting clouds
the clouds were drifting above him silently and silently the seatangle was drifting below him and the grey warm air was still and a new wild life was singing in his veins
where was his boyhood now
where was the soul that had hung back from her destiny to brood alone upon the shame of her wounds and in her house of squalor and subterfuge to queen it in faded cerements and in wreaths that withered at the touch
or where was he
he was alone
he was unheeded happy and near to the wild heart of life
he was alone and young and wilful and wildhearted alone amid a waste of wild air and brackish waters and the seaharvest of shells and tangle and veiled grey sunlight and gayclad lightclad figures of children and girls and voices childish and girlish in the air
a girl stood before him in midstream alone and still gazing out to sea
she seemed like one whom magic had changed into the likeness of a strange and beautiful seabird
her long slender bare legs were delicate as a cranes and pure save where an emerald trail of seaweed had fashioned itself as a sign upon the flesh
her thighs fuller and softhued as ivory were bared almost to the hips where the white fringes of her drawers were like feathering of soft white down
her slateblue skirts were kilted boldly about her waist and dovetailed behind her
her bosom was as a birds soft and slight slight and soft as the breast of some darkplumaged dove
but her long fair hair was girlish and girlish and touched with the wonder of mortal beauty her face
she was alone and still gazing out to sea and when she felt his presence and the worship of his eyes her eyes turned to him in quiet sufferance of his gaze without shame or wantonness
long long she suffered his gaze and then quietly withdrew her eyes from his and bent them towards the stream gently stirring the water with her foot hither and thither
the first faint noise of gently moving water broke the silence low and faint and whispering faint as the bells of sleep hither and thither hither and thither and a faint flame trembled on her cheek
heavenly god
cried stephens soul in an outburst of profane joy
he turned away from her suddenly and set off across the strand
his cheeks were aflame his body was aglow his limbs were trembling
on and on and on and on he strode far out over the sands singing wildly to the sea crying to greet the advent of the life that had cried to him
her image had passed into his soul for ever and no word had broken the holy silence of his ecstasy
her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call
to live to err to fall to triumph to recreate life out of life
a wild angel had appeared to him the angel of mortal youth and beauty an envoy from the fair courts of life to throw open before him in an instant of ecstasy the gates of all the ways of error and glory
on and on and on and on
he halted suddenly and heard his heart in the silence
how far had he walked
what hour was it
there was no human figure near him nor any sound borne to him over the air
but the tide was near the turn and already the day was on the wane
he turned landward and ran towards the shore and running up the sloping beach reckless of the sharp shingle found a sandy nook amid a ring of tufted sandknolls and lay down there that the peace and silence of the evening might still the riot of his blood
he felt above him the vast indifferent dome and the calm processes of the heavenly bodies and the earth beneath him the earth that had borne him had taken him to her breast
he closed his eyes in the languor of sleep
his eyelids trembled as if they felt the vast cyclic movement of the earth and her watchers trembled as if they felt the strange light of some new world
his soul was swooning into some new world fantastic dim uncertain as under sea traversed by cloudy shapes and beings
a world a glimmer or a flower
glimmering and trembling trembling and unfolding a breaking light an opening flower it spread in endless succession to itself breaking in full crimson and unfolding and fading to palest rose leaf by leaf and wave of light by wave of light flooding all the heavens with its soft flushes every flush deeper than the other
evening had fallen when he woke and the sand and arid grasses of his bed glowed no longer
he rose slowly and recalling the rapture of his sleep sighed at its joy
he climbed to the crest of the sandhill and gazed about him
evening had fallen
a rim of the young moon cleft the pale waste of skyline the rim of a silver hoop embedded in grey sand and the tide was flowing in fast to the land with a low whisper of her waves islanding a few last figures in distant pools
chapter v   he drained his third cup of watery tea to the dregs and set to chewing the crusts of fried bread that were scattered near him staring into the dark pool of the jar
the yellow dripping had been scooped out like a boghole and the pool under it brought back to his memory the dark turfcoloured water of the bath in clongowes
the box of pawn tickets at his elbow had just been rifled and he took up idly one after another in his greasy fingers the blue and white dockets scrawled and sanded and creased and bearing the name of the pledger as daly or macevoy
 pair buskins
 d coat
 articles and white
 mans pants
then he put them aside and gazed thoughtfully at the lid of the box speckled with louse marks and asked vaguely  how much is the clock fast now
his mother straightened the battered alarm clock that was lying on its side in the middle of the mantelpiece until its dial showed a quarter to twelve and then laid it once more on its side
an hour and twentyfive minutes she said
the right time now is twenty past ten
the dear knows you might try to be in time for your lectures
fill out the place for me to wash said stephen
katey fill out the place for stephen to wash  boody fill out the place for stephen to wash  i cant im going for blue
fill it out you maggy
when the enamelled basin had been fitted into the well of the sink and the old washing glove flung on the side of it he allowed his mother to scrub his neck and root into the folds of his ears and into the interstices at the wings of his nose
well its a poor case she said when a university student is so dirty that his mother has to wash him
but it gives you pleasure said stephen calmly
an earsplitting whistle was heard from upstairs and his mother thrust a damp overall into his hands saying  dry yourself and hurry out for the love of goodness
a second shrill whistle prolonged angrily brought one of the girls to the foot of the staircase
yes father
is your lazy bitch of a brother gone out yet
yes father
sure
yes father
hm
the girl came back making signs to him to be quick and go out quietly by the back
stephen laughed and said  he has a curious idea of genders if he thinks a bitch is masculine
ah its a scandalous shame for you stephen said his mother and youll live to rue the day you set your foot in that place
i know how it has changed you
good morning everybody said stephen smiling and kissing the tips of his fingers in adieu
the lane behind the terrace was waterlogged and as he went down it slowly choosing his steps amid heaps of wet rubbish he heard a mad nun screeching in the nuns madhouse beyond the wall
jesus
o jesus
jesus
he shook the sound out of his ears by an angry toss of his head and hurried on stumbling through the mouldering offal his heart already bitten by an ache of loathing and bitterness
his fathers whistle his mothers mutterings the screech of an unseen maniac were to him now so many voices offending and threatening to humble the pride of his youth
he drove their echoes even out of his heart with an execration but as he walked down the avenue and felt the grey morning light falling about him through the dripping trees and smelt the strange wild smell of the wet leaves and bark his soul was loosed of her miseries
the rainladen trees of the avenue evoked in him as always memories of the girls and women in the plays of gerhart hauptmann and the memory of their pale sorrows and the fragrance falling from the wet branches mingled in a mood of quiet joy
his morning walk across the city had begun and he foreknew that as he passed the sloblands of fairview he would think of the cloistral silverveined prose of newman that as he walked along the north strand road glancing idly at the windows of the provision shops he would recall the dark humour of guido cavalcanti and smile that as he went by bairds stonecutting works in talbot place the spirit of ibsen would blow through him like a keen wind a spirit of wayward boyish beauty and that passing a grimy marine dealers shop beyond the liffey he would repeat the song by ben jonson which begins      i was not wearier where i lay
his mind when wearied of its search for the essence of beauty amid the spectral words of aristotle or aquinas turned often for its pleasure to the dainty songs of the elizabethans
his mind in the vesture of a doubting monk stood often in shadow under the windows of that age to hear the grave and mocking music of the lutenists or the frank laughter of waistcoateers until a laugh too low a phrase tarnished by time of chambering and false honour stung his monkish pride and drove him on from his lurkingplace
the lore which he was believed to pass his days brooding upon so that it had rapt him from the companionship of youth was only a garner of slender sentences from aristotles poetics and psychology and a synopsis philosophi scholastic ad mentem divi thom
his thinking was a dusk of doubt and selfmistrust lit up at moments by the lightnings of intuition but lightnings of so clear a splendour that in those moments the world perished about his feet as if it had been fireconsumed and thereafter his tongue grew heavy and he met the eyes of others with unanswering eyes for he felt that the spirit of beauty had folded him round like a mantle and that in reverie at least he had been acquainted with nobility
but when this brief pride of silence upheld him no longer he was glad to find himself still in the midst of common lives passing on his way amid the squalor and noise and sloth of the city fearlessly and with a light heart
near the hoardings on the canal he met the consumptive man with the dolls face and the brimless hat coming towards him down the slope of the bridge with little steps tightly buttoned into his chocolate overcoat and holding his furled umbrella a span or two from him like a divining rod
it must be eleven he thought and peered into a dairy to see the time
the clock in the dairy told him that it was five minutes to five but as he turned away he heard a clock somewhere near him but unseen beating eleven strokes in swift precision
he laughed as he heard it for it made him think of maccann and he saw him a squat figure in a shooting jacket and breeches and with a fair goatee standing in the wind at hopkins corner and heard him say  dedalus youre an antisocial being wrapped up in yourself
im not
im a democrat and ill work and act for social liberty and equality among all classes and sexes in the united states of the europe of the future
eleven
then he was late for that lecture too
what day of the week was it
he stopped at a newsagents to read the headline of a placard
thursday
ten to eleven english eleven to twelve french twelve to one physics
he fancied to himself the english lecture and felt even at that distance restless and helpless
he saw the heads of his classmates meekly bent as they wrote in their notebooks the points they were bidden to note nominal definitions essential definitions and examples or dates of birth or death chief works a favourable and an unfavourable criticism side by side
his own head was unbent for his thoughts wandered abroad and whether he looked around the little class of students or out of the window across the desolate gardens of the green an odour assailed him of cheerless cellardamp and decay
another head than his right before him in the first benches was poised squarely above its bending fellows like the head of a priest appealing without humility to the tabernacle for the humble worshippers about him
why was it that when he thought of cranly he could never raise before his mind the entire image of his body but only the image of the head and face
even now against the grey curtain of the morning he saw it before him like the phantom of a dream the face of a severed head or death mask crowned on the brows by its stiff black upright hair as by an iron crown
it was a priestlike face priestlike in its pallor in the wide winged nose in the shadowings below the eyes and along the jaws priestlike in the lips that were long and bloodless and faintly smiling and stephen remembering swiftly how he had told cranly of all the tumults and unrest and longings in his soul day after day and night by night only to be answered by his friends listening silence would have told himself that it was the face of a guilty priest who heard confessions of those whom he had not power to absolve but that he felt again in memory the gaze of its dark womanish eyes
through this image he had a glimpse of a strange dark cavern of speculation but at once turned away from it feeling that it was not yet the hour to enter it
but the nightshade of his friends listlessness seemed to be diffusing in the air around him a tenuous and deadly exhalation and he found himself glancing from one casual word to another on his right or left in stolid wonder that they had been so silently emptied of instantaneous sense until every mean shop legend bound his mind like the words of a spell and his soul shrivelled up sighing with age as he walked on in a lane among heaps of dead language
his own consciousness of language was ebbing from his brain and trickling into the very words themselves which set to band and disband themselves in wayward rhythms      the ivy whines upon the wall     and whines and twines upon the wall     the yellow ivy upon the wall     ivy ivy up the wall
did anyone ever hear such drivel
lord almighty
who ever heard of ivy whining on a wall
yellow ivy that was all right
yellow ivory also
and what about ivory ivy
the word now shone in his brain clearer and brighter than any ivory sawn from the mottled tusks of elephants
ivory ivoire avorio ebur one of the first examples that he had learnt in latin had run india mittit ebur and he recalled the shrewd northern face of the rector who had taught him to construe the metamorphoses of ovid in a courtly english made whimsical by the mention of porkers and potsherds and chines of bacon
he had learnt what little he knew of the laws of latin verse from a ragged book written by a portuguese priest
contrahit orator variant in carmine vates
the crises and victories and secessions in roman history were handed on to him in the trite words in tanto discrimine and he had tried to peer into the social life of the city of cities through the words implere ollam denariorum which the rector had rendered sonorously as the filling of a pot with denaries
the pages of his timeworn horace never felt cold to the touch even when his own fingers were cold they were human pages and fifty years before they had been turned by the human fingers of john duncan inverarity and by his brother william malcolm inverarity
yes those were noble names on the dusky flyleaf and even for so poor a latinist as he the dusky verses were as fragrant as though they had lain all those years in myrtle and lavender and vervain but yet it wounded him to think that he would never be but a shy guest at the feast of the worlds culture and that the monkish learning in terms of which he was striving to forge out an esthetic philosophy was held no higher by the age he lived in than the subtle and curious jargons of heraldry and falconry
the grey block of trinity on his left set heavily in the citys ignorance like a dull stone set in a cumbrous ring pulled his mind downward and while he was striving this way and that to free his feet from the fetters of the reformed conscience he came upon the droll statue of the national poet of ireland
he looked at it without anger for though sloth of the body and of the soul crept over it like unseen vermin over the shuffling feet and up the folds of the cloak and around the servile head it seemed humbly conscious of its indignity
it was a firbolg in the borrowed cloak of a milesian and he thought of his friend davin the peasant student
it was a jesting name between them but the young peasant bore with it lightly  go on stevie i have a hard head you tell me
call me what you will
the homely version of his christian name on the lips of his friend had touched stephen pleasantly when first heard for he was as formal in speech with others as they were with him
often as he sat in davins rooms in grantham street wondering at his friends wellmade boots that flanked the wall pair by pair and repeating for his friends simple ear the verses and cadences of others which were the veils of his own longing and dejection the rude firbolg mind of his listener had drawn his mind towards it and flung it back again drawing it by a quiet inbred courtesy of attention or by a quaint turn of old english speech or by the force of its delight in rude bodily skillfor davin had sat at the feet of michael cusack the gaelrepelling swiftly and suddenly by a grossness of intelligence or by a bluntness of feeling or by a dull stare of terror in the eyes the terror of soul of a starving irish village in which the curfew was still a nightly fear
side by side with his memory of the deeds of prowess of his uncle mat davin the athlete the young peasant worshipped the sorrowful legend of ireland
the gossip of his fellowstudents which strove to render the flat life of the college significant at any cost loved to think of him as a young fenian
his nurse had taught him irish and shaped his rude imagination by the broken lights of irish myth
he stood towards the myth upon which no individual mind had ever drawn out a line of beauty and to its unwieldy tales that divided  themselves as they moved down the cycles in the same attitude as towards the roman catholic religion the attitude of a dullwitted loyal serf
whatsoever of thought or of feeling came to him from england or by way of english culture his mind stood armed against in obedience to a password and of the world that lay beyond england he knew only the foreign legion of france in which he spoke of serving
coupling this ambition with the young mans humour stephen had often called him one of the tame geese and there was even a point of irritation in the name pointed against that very reluctance of speech and deed in his friend which seemed so often to stand between stephens mind eager of speculation and the hidden ways of irish life
one night the young peasant his spirit stung by the violent or luxurious language in which stephen escaped from the cold silence of intellectual revolt had called up before stephens mind a strange vision
the two were walking slowly towards davins rooms through the dark narrow streets of the poorer jews
a thing happened to myself stevie last autumn coming on winter and i never told it to a living soul and you are the first person now i ever told it to
i disremember if it was october or november
it was october because it was before i came up here to join the matriculation class
stephen had turned his smiling eyes towards his friends face flattered by his confidence and won over to sympathy by the speakers simple accent
i was away all that day from my own place over in buttevanti dont know if you know where that isat a hurling match between the crokes own boys and the fearless thurles and by god stevie that was the hard fight
my first cousin fonsy davin was stripped to his buff that day minding cool for the limericks but he was up with the forwards half the time and shouting like mad
i never will forget that day
one of the crokes made a woeful wipe at him one time with his caman and i declare to god he was within an aims ace of getting it at the side of his temple
oh honest to god if the crook of it caught him that time he was done for
i am glad he escaped stephen had said with a laugh but surely thats not the strange thing that happened you
well i suppose that doesnt interest you but leastways there was such noise after the match that i missed the train home and i couldnt get any kind of a yoke to give me a lift for as luck would have it there was a mass meeting that same day over in castletownroche and all the cars in the country were there
so there was nothing for it only to stay the night or to foot it out
well i started to walk and on i went and it was coming on night when i got into the ballyhoura hills thats better than ten miles from kilmallock and theres a long lonely road after that
you wouldnt see the sign of a christian house along the road or hear a sound
it was pitch dark almost
once or twice i stopped by the way under a bush to redden my pipe and only for the dew was thick id have stretched out there and slept
at last after a bend of the road i spied a little cottage with a light in the window
i went up and knocked at the door
a voice asked who was there and i answered i was over at the match in buttevant and was walking back and that id be thankful for a glass of water
after a while a young woman opened the door and brought me out a big mug of milk
she was half undressed as if she was going to bed when i knocked and she had her hair hanging and i thought by her figure and by something in the look of her eyes that she must be carrying a child
she kept me in talk a long while at the door and i thought it strange because her breast and her shoulders were bare
she asked me was i tired and would i like to stop the night there
she said she was all alone in the house and that her husband had gone that morning to queenstown with his sister to see her off
and all the time she was talking stevie she had her eyes fixed on my face and she stood so close to me i could hear her breathing
when i handed her back the mug at last she took my hand to draw me in over the threshold and said come in and stay the night here
youve no call to be frightened
theres no one in it but ourselves i didnt go in stevie
i thanked her and went on my way again all in a fever
at the first bend of the road i looked back and she was standing at the door
the last words of davins story sang in his memory and the figure of the woman in the story stood forth reflected in other figures of the peasant women whom he had seen standing in the doorways at clane as the college cars drove by as a type of her race and of his own a batlike soul waking to the consciousness of itself in darkness and secrecy and loneliness and through the eyes and voice and gesture of a woman without guile calling the stranger to her bed
a hand was laid on his arm and a young voice cried  ah gentleman your own girl sir
the first handsel today gentleman
buy that lovely bunch
will you gentleman
the blue flowers which she lifted towards him and her young blue eyes seemed to him at that instant images of guilelessness and he halted till the image had vanished and he saw only her ragged dress and damp coarse hair and hoydenish face
do gentleman
dont forget your own girl sir
i have no money said stephen
buy them lovely ones will you sir
only a penny
did you hear what i said
asked stephen bending towards her
i told you i had no money
i tell you again now
well sure you will some day sir please god the girl answered after an instant
possibly said stephen but i dont think it likely
he left her quickly fearing that her intimacy might turn to gibing and wishing to be out of the way before she offered her ware to another a tourist from england or a student of trinity
grafton street along which he walked prolonged that moment of discouraged poverty
in the roadway at the head of the street a slab was set to the memory of wolfe tone and he remembered having been present with his father at its laying
he remembered with bitterness that scene of tawdry tribute
there were four french delegates in a brake and one a plump smiling young man held wedged on a stick a card on which were printed the words vive lirlande  but the trees in stephens green were fragrant of rain and the rainsodden earth gave forth its mortal odour a faint incense rising upward through the mould from many hearts
the soul of the gallant venal city which his elders had told him of had shrunk with time to a faint mortal odour rising from the earth and he knew that in a moment when he entered the sombre college he would be conscious of a corruption other than that of buck egan and burnchapel whaley
it was too late to go upstairs to the french class
he crossed the hall and took the corridor to the left which led to the physics theatre
the corridor was dark and silent but not unwatchful
why did he feel that it was not unwatchful
was it because he had heard that in buck whaleys time there was a secret staircase there
or was the jesuit house extraterritorial and was he walking among aliens
the ireland of tone and of parnell seemed to have receded in space
he opened the door of the theatre and halted in the chilly grey light that struggled through the dusty windows
a figure was crouching before the large grate and by its leanness and greyness he knew that it was the dean of studies lighting the fire
stephen closed the door quietly and approached the fireplace
good morning sir
can i help you
the priest looked up quickly and said  one moment now mr dedalus and you will see
there is an art in lighting a fire
we have the liberal arts and we have the useful arts
this is one of the useful arts
i will try to learn it said stephen
not too much coal said the dean working briskly at his task that is one of the secrets
he produced four candlebutts from the sidepockets of his soutane and placed them deftly among the coals and twisted papers
stephen watched him in silence
kneeling thus on the flagstone to kindle the fire and busied with the disposition of his wisps of paper and candlebutts he seemed more than ever a humble server making ready the place of sacrifice in an empty temple a levite of the lord
like a levites robe of plain linen the faded worn soutane draped the kneeling figure of one whom the canonicals or the bellbordered ephod would irk and trouble
his very body had waxed old in lowly service of the lordin tending the fire upon the altar in bearing tidings secretly in waiting upon worldlings in striking swiftly when biddenand yet had remained ungraced by aught of saintly or of prelatic beauty
nay his very soul had waxed old in that service without growing towards light and beauty or spreading abroad a sweet odour of her sanctitya mortified will no more responsive to the thrill of its obedience than was to the thrill of love or combat his ageing body spare and sinewy greyed with a silverpointed down
the dean rested back on his hunkers and watched the sticks catch
stephen to fill the silence said  i am sure i could not light a fire
you are an artist are you not mr dedalus
said the dean glancing up and blinking his pale eyes
the object of the artist is the creation of the beautiful
what the beautiful is is another question
he rubbed his hands slowly and drily over the difficulty
can you solve that question now
he asked
aquinas answered stephen says pulcra sunt qu visa placent
this fire before us said the dean will be pleasing to the eye
will it therefore be beautiful
in so far as it is apprehended by the sight which i suppose means here esthetic intellection it will be beautiful
but aquinas also says bonum est in quod tendit appetitus
in so far as it satisfies the animal craving for warmth fire is a good
in hell however it is an evil
quite so said the dean you have certainly hit the nail on the head
he rose nimbly and went towards the door set it ajar and said  a draught is said to be a help in these matters
as he came back to the hearth limping slightly but with a brisk step stephen saw the silent soul of a jesuit look out at him from the pale loveless eyes
like ignatius he was lame but in his eyes burned no spark of ignatius enthusiasm
even the legendary craft of the company a craft subtler and more secret than its fabled books of secret subtle wisdom had not fired his soul with the energy of apostleship
it seemed as if he used the shifts and lore and cunning of the world as bidden to do for the greater glory of god without joy in their handling or hatred of that in them which was evil but turning them with a firm gesture of obedience back upon themselves and for all this silent service it seemed as if he loved not at all the master and little if at all the ends he served
similiter atque senis baculus he was as the founder would have had him like a staff in an old mans hand to be leaned on in the road at nightfall or in stress of weather to lie with a ladys nosegay on a garden seat to be raised in menace
the dean returned to the hearth and began to stroke his chin
when may we expect to have something from you on the esthetic question
he asked
from me
said stephen in astonishment
i stumble on an idea once a fortnight if i am lucky
these questions are very profound mr dedalus said the dean
it is like looking down from the cliffs of moher into the depths
many go down into the depths and never come up
only the trained diver can go down into those depths and explore them and come to the surface again
if you mean speculation sir said stephen i also am sure that there is no such thing as free thinking inasmuch as all thinking must be bound by its own laws
ha
for my purpose i can work on at present by the light of one or two ideas of aristotle and aquinas
i see
i quite see your point
i need them only for my own use and guidance until i have done something for myself by their light
if the lamp smokes or smells i shall try to trim it
if it does not give light enough i shall sell it and buy another
epictetus also had a lamp said the dean which was sold for a fancy price after his death
it was the lamp he wrote his philosophical dissertations by
you know epictetus
an old gentleman said stephen coarsely who said that the soul is very like a bucketful of water
he tells us in his homely way the dean went on that he put an iron lamp before a statue of one of the gods and that a thief stole the lamp
what did the philosopher do
he reflected that it was in the character of a thief to steal and determined to buy an earthen lamp next day instead of the iron lamp
a smell of molten tallow came up from the deans candle butts and fused itself in stephens consciousness with the jingle of the words bucket and lamp and lamp and bucket
the priests voice too had a hard jingling tone
stephens mind halted by instinct checked by the strange tone and the imagery and by the priests face which seemed like an unlit lamp or a reflector hung in a false focus
what lay behind it or within it
a dull torpor of the soul or the dullness of the thundercloud charged with intellection and capable of the gloom of god
i meant a different kind of lamp sir said stephen
undoubtedly said the dean
one difficulty said stephen in esthetic discussion is to know whether words are being used according to the literary tradition or according to the tradition of the marketplace
i remember a sentence of newmans in which he says of the blessed virgin that she was detained in the full company of the saints
the use of the word in the marketplace is quite different
i hope i am not detaining you  not in the least said the dean politely
no no said stephen smiling i mean  yes yes i see said the dean quickly i quite catch the point detain
he thrust forward his under jaw and uttered a dry short cough
to return to the lamp he said the feeding of it is also a nice problem
you must choose the pure oil and you must be careful when you pour it in not to overflow it not to pour in more than the funnel can hold
what funnel
asked stephen
the funnel through which you pour the oil into your lamp
that
said stephen
is that called a funnel
is it not a tundish
what is a tundish
that
the the funnel
is that called a tundish in ireland
asked the dean
i never heard the word in my life
it is called a tundish in lower drumcondra said stephen laughing where they speak the best english
a tundish said the dean reflectively
that is a most interesting word
i must look that word up
upon my word i must
his courtesy of manner rang a little false and stephen looked at the english convert with the same eyes as the elder brother in the parable may have turned on the prodigal
a humble follower in the wake of clamorous conversions a poor englishman in ireland he seemed to have entered on the stage of jesuit history when that strange play of intrigue and suffering and envy and struggle and indignity had been all but given througha latecomer a tardy spirit
from what had he set out
perhaps he had been born and bred among serious dissenters seeing salvation in jesus only and abhorring the vain pomps of the establishment
had he felt the need of an implicit faith amid the welter of sectarianism and the jargon of its turbulent schisms six principle men peculiar people seed and snake baptists supralapsarian dogmatists
had he found the true church all of a sudden in winding up to the end like a reel of cotton some finespun line of reasoning upon insufflation on the imposition of hands or the procession of the holy ghost
or had lord christ touched him and bidden him follow like that disciple who had sat at the receipt of custom as he sat by the door of some zincroofed chapel yawning and telling over his church pence
the dean repeated the word yet again
tundish
well now that is interesting
the question you asked me a moment ago seems to me more interesting
what is that beauty which the artist struggles to express from lumps of earth said stephen coldly
the little word seemed to have turned a rapier point of his sensitiveness against this courteous and vigilant foe
he felt with a smart of dejection that the man to whom he was speaking was a countryman of ben jonson
he thought  the language in which we are speaking is his before it is mine
how different are the words home christ ale master on his lips and on mine
i cannot speak or write these words without unrest of spirit
his language so familiar and so foreign will always be for me an acquired speech
i have not made or accepted its words
my voice holds them at bay
my soul frets in the shadow of his language
and to distinguish between the beautiful and the sublime the dean added to distinguish between moral beauty and material beauty
and to inquire what kind of beauty is proper to each of the various arts
these are some interesting points we might take up
stephen disheartened suddenly by the deans firm dry tone was silent and through the silence a distant noise of many boots and confused voices came up the staircase
in pursuing these speculations said the dean conclusively there is however the danger of perishing of inanition
first you must take your degree
set that before you as your first aim
then little by little you will see your way
i mean in every sense your way in life and in thinking
it may be uphill pedalling at first
take mr moonan
he was a long time before he got to the top
but he got there
i may not have his talent said stephen quietly
you never know said the dean brightly
we never can say what is in us
i most certainly should not be despondent
per aspera ad astra  he left the hearth quickly and went towards the landing to oversee the arrival of the first arts class
leaning against the fireplace stephen heard him greet briskly and impartially every student of the class and could almost see the frank smiles of the coarser students
a desolating pity began to fall like dew upon his easily embittered heart for this faithful servingman of the knightly loyola for this halfbrother of the clergy more venal than they in speech more steadfast of soul than they one whom he would never call his ghostly father and he thought how this man and his companions had earned the name of worldlings at the hands not of the unworldly only but of the worldly also for having pleaded during all their history at the bar of gods justice for the souls of the lax and the lukewarm and the prudent
the entry of the professor was signalled by a few rounds of kentish fire from the heavy boots of those students who sat on the highest tier of the gloomy theatre under the grey cobwebbed windows
the calling of the roll began and the responses to the names were given out in all tones until the name of peter byrne was reached
here
a deep bass note in response came from the upper tier followed by coughs of protest along the other benches
the professor paused in his reading and called the next name  cranly
no answer
mr cranly
a smile flew across stephens face as he thought of his friends studies
try leopardstown
said a voice from the bench behind
stephen glanced up quickly but moynihans snoutish face outlined on the grey light was impassive
a formula was given out
amid the rustling of the notebooks stephen turned back again and said  give me some paper for gods sake
are you as bad as that
asked moynihan with a broad grin
he tore a sheet from his scribbler and passed it down whispering  in case of necessity any layman or woman can do it
the formula which he wrote obediently on the sheet of paper the coiling and uncoiling calculations of the professor the spectrelike symbols of force and velocity fascinated and jaded stephens mind
he had heard some say that the old professor was an atheist freemason
o the grey dull day
it seemed a limbo of painless patient consciousness through which souls of mathematicians might wander projecting long slender fabrics from plane to plane of ever rarer and paler twilight radiating swift eddies to the last verges of a universe ever vaster farther and more impalpable
so we must distinguish between elliptical and ellipsoidal
perhaps some of you gentlemen may be familiar with the works of mr w s gilbert
in one of his songs he speaks of the billiard sharp who is condemned to play      on a cloth untrue     with a twisted cue     and elliptical billiard balls
he means a ball having the form of the ellipsoid of the principal axes of which i spoke a moment ago
moynihan leaned down towards stephens ear and murmured  what price ellipsoidal balls
chase me ladies im in the cavalry
his fellow students rude humour ran like a gust through the cloister of stephens mind shaking into gay life limp priestly vestments that hung upon the walls setting them to sway and caper in a sabbath of misrule
the forms of the community emerged from the gustblown vestments the dean of studies the portly florid bursar with his cap of grey hair the president the little priest with feathery hair who wrote devout verses the squat peasant form of the professor of economics the tall form of the young professor of mental science discussing on the landing a case of conscience with his class like a giraffe cropping high leafage among a herd of antelopes the grave troubled prefect of the sodality the plump roundheaded professor of italian with his rogues eyes
they came ambling and stumbling tumbling and capering kilting their gowns for leap frog holding one another back shaken with deep false laughter smacking one another behind and laughing at their rude malice calling to one another by familiar nicknames protesting with sudden dignity at some rough usage whispering two and two behind their hands
the professor had gone to the glass cases on the sidewall from a shelf of which he took down a set of coils blew away the dust from many points and bearing it carefully to the table held a finger on it while he proceeded with his lecture
he explained that the wires in modern coils were of a compound called platinoid lately discovered by f w martino
he spoke clearly the initials and surname of the discoverer
moynihan whispered from behind  good old fresh water martin
ask him stephen whispered back with weary humour if he wants a subject for electrocution
he can have me
moynihan seeing the professor bend over the coils rose in his bench and clacking noiselessly the fingers of his right hand began to call with the voice of a slobbering urchin  please teacher
this boy is after saying a bad word teacher
platinoid the professor said solemnly is preferred to german silver because it has a lower coefficient of resistance by changes of temperature
the platinoid wire is insulated and the covering of silk that insulates it is wound on the ebonite bobbins just where my finger is
if it were wound single an extra current would be induced in the coils
the bobbins are saturated in hot paraffin wax  a sharp ulster voice said from the bench below stephen  are we likely to be asked questions on applied science
the professor began to juggle gravely with the terms pure science and applied science
a heavybuilt student wearing gold spectacles stared with some wonder at the questioner
moynihan murmured from behind in his natural voice  isnt macalister a devil for his pound of flesh
stephen looked coldly on the oblong skull beneath him overgrown with tangled twinecoloured hair
the voice the accent the mind of the questioner offended him and he allowed the offence to carry him towards wilful unkindness bidding his mind think that the students father would have done better had he sent his son to belfast to study and have saved something on the train fare by so doing
the oblong skull beneath did not turn to meet this shaft of thought and yet the shaft came back to its bowstring for he saw in a moment the students wheypale face
that thought is not mine he said to himself quickly
it came from the comic irishman in the bench behind
patience
can you say with certitude by whom the soul of your race was bartered and its elect betrayedby the questioner or by the mocker
patience
remember epictetus
it is probably in his character to ask such a question at such a moment in such a tone and to pronounce the word science as a monosyllable
the droning voice of the professor continued to wind itself slowly round and round the coils it spoke of doubling trebling quadrupling its somnolent energy as the coil multiplied its ohms of resistance
moynihans voice called from behind in echo to a distant bell  closing time gents
the entrance hall was crowded and loud with talk
on a table near the door were two photographs in frames and between them a long roll of paper bearing an irregular tail of signatures
maccann went briskly to and fro among the students talking rapidly answering rebuffs and leading one after another to the table
in the inner hall the dean of studies stood talking to a young professor stroking his chin gravely and nodding his head
stephen checked by the crowd at the door halted irresolutely
from under the wide falling leaf of a soft hat cranlys dark eyes were watching him
have you signed
stephen asked
cranly closed his long thinlipped mouth communed with himself an instant and answered  ego habeo
what is it for
quod  what is it for
cranly turned his pale face to stephen and said blandly and bitterly  per pax universalis  stephen pointed to the tsars photograph and said  he has the face of a besotted christ
the scorn and anger in his voice brought cranlys eyes back from a calm survey of the walls of the hall
are you annoyed
he asked
no answered stephen
are you in bad humour
no
credo ut vos sanguinarius mendax estis said cranly quia facies vostra monstrat ut vos in damno malo humore estis  moynihan on his way to the table said in stephens ear  maccann is in tiptop form
ready to shed the last drop
brand new world
no stimulants and votes for the bitches
stephen smiled at the manner of this confidence and when moynihan had passed turned again to meet cranlys eyes
perhaps you can tell me he said why he pours his soul so freely into my ear
can you
a dull scowl appeared on cranlys forehead
he stared at the table where moynihan had bent to write his name on the roll and then said flatly  a sugar
quis est in malo humore said stephen ego aut vos  cranly did not take up the taunt
he brooded sourly on his judgement and repeated with the same flat force  a flaming bloody sugar thats what he is
it was his epitaph for all dead friendships and stephen wondered whether it would ever be spoken in the same tone over his memory
the heavy lumpish phrase sank slowly out of hearing like a stone through a quagmire
stephen saw it sink as he had seen many another feeling its heaviness depress his heart
cranlys speech unlike that of davin had neither rare phrases of elizabethan english nor quaintly turned versions of irish idioms
its drawl was an echo of the quays of dublin given back by a bleak decaying seaport its energy an echo of the sacred eloquence of dublin given back flatly by a wicklow pulpit
the heavy scowl faded from cranlys face as maccann marched briskly towards them from the other side of the hall
here you are
said maccann cheerily
here i am
said stephen
late as usual
can you not combine the progressive tendency with a respect for punctuality
that question is out of order said stephen
next business
his smiling eyes were fixed on a silverwrapped tablet of milk chocolate which peeped out of the propagandists breastpocket
a little ring of listeners closed round to hear the war of wits
a lean student with olive skin and lank black hair thrust his face between the two glancing from one to the other at each phrase and seeming to try to catch each flying phrase in his open moist mouth
cranly took a small grey handball from his pocket and began to examine it closely turning it over and over
next business
said maccann
hom
he gave a loud cough of laughter smiled broadly and tugged twice at the strawcoloured goatee which hung from his blunt chin
the next business is to sign the testimonial
will you pay me anything if i sign
asked stephen
i thought you were an idealist said maccann
the gipsylike student looked about him and addressed the onlookers in an indistinct bleating voice
by hell thats a queer notion
i consider that notion to be a mercenary notion
his voice faded into silence
no heed was paid to his words
he turned his olive face equine in expression towards stephen inviting him to speak again
maccann began to speak with fluent energy of the tsars rescript of stead of general disarmament arbitration in cases of international disputes of the signs of the times of the new humanity and the new gospel of life which would make it the business of the community to secure as cheaply as possible the greatest possible happiness of the greatest possible number
the gipsy student responded to the close of the period by crying  three cheers for universal brotherhood
go on temple said a stout ruddy student near him
ill stand you a pint after
im a believer in universal brotherhood said temple glancing about him out of his dark oval eyes
marx is only a bloody cod
cranly gripped his arm tightly to check his tongue smiling uneasily and repeated  easy easy easy
temple struggled to free his arm but continued his mouth flecked by a thin foam  socialism was founded by an irishman and the first man in europe who preached the freedom of thought was collins
two hundred years ago
he denounced priestcraft the philosopher of middlesex
three cheers for john anthony collins
a thin voice from the verge of the ring replied  pip
pip
moynihan murmured beside stephens ear  and what about john anthonys poor little sister      lottie collins lost her drawers     wont you kindly lend her yours
stephen laughed and moynihan pleased with the result murmured again  well have five bob each way on john anthony collins
i am waiting for your answer said maccann briefly
the affair doesnt interest me in the least said stephen wearily
you know that well
why do you make a scene about it
good
said maccann smacking his lips
you are a reactionary then
do you think you impress me stephen asked when you flourish your wooden sword
metaphors
said maccann bluntly
come to facts
stephen blushed and turned aside
maccann stood his ground and said with hostile humour  minor poets i suppose are above such trivial questions as the question of universal peace
cranly raised his head and held the handball between the two students by way of a peaceoffering saying  pax super totum sanguinarium globum  stephen moving away the bystanders jerked his shoulder angrily in the direction of the tsars image saying  keep your icon
if we must have a jesus let us have a legitimate jesus
by hell thats a good one
said the gipsy student to those about him thats a fine expression
i like that expression immensely
he gulped down the spittle in his throat as if he were gulping down the phrase and fumbling at the peak of his tweed cap turned to stephen saying  excuse me sir what do you mean by that expression you uttered just now
feeling himself jostled by the students near him he said to them  i am curious to know now what he meant by that expression
he turned again to stephen and said in a whisper  do you believe in jesus
i believe in man
of course i dont know if you believe in man
i admire you sir
i admire the mind of man independent of all religions
is that your opinion about the mind of jesus
go on temple said the stout ruddy student returning as was his wont to his first idea that pint is waiting for you
he thinks im an imbecile temple explained to stephen because im a believer in the power of mind
cranly linked his arms into those of stephen and his admirer and said  nos ad manum ballum jocabimus  stephen in the act of being led away caught sight of maccanns flushed bluntfeatured face
my signature is of no account he said politely
you are right to go your way
leave me to go mine
dedalus said maccann crisply i believe youre a good fellow but you have yet to learn the dignity of altruism and the responsibility of the human individual
a voice said  intellectual crankery is better out of this movement than in it
stephen recognising the harsh tone of macalisters voice did not turn in the direction of the voice
cranly pushed solemnly through the throng of students linking stephen and temple like a celebrant attended by his ministers on his way to the altar
temple bent eagerly across cranlys breast and said  did you hear macalister what he said
that youth is jealous of you
did you see that
i bet cranly didnt see that
by hell i saw that at once
as they crossed the inner hall the dean of studies was in the act of escaping from the student with whom he had been conversing
he stood at the foot of the staircase a foot on the lowest step his threadbare soutane gathered about him for the ascent with womanish care nodding his head often and repeating  not a doubt of it mr hackett
very fine
not a doubt of it
in the middle of the hall the prefect of the college sodality was speaking earnestly in a soft querulous voice with a boarder
as he spoke he wrinkled a little his freckled brow and bit between his phrases at a tiny bone pencil
i hope the matric men will all come
the first arts men are pretty sure
second arts too
we must make sure of the newcomers
temple bent again across cranly as they were passing through the doorway and said in a swift whisper  do you know that he is a married man
he was a married man before they converted him
he has a wife and children somewhere
by hell i think thats the queerest notion i ever heard
eh
his whisper trailed off into sly cackling laughter
the moment they were through the doorway cranly seized him rudely by the neck and shook him saying  you flaming floundering fool
ill take my dying bible there isnt a bigger bloody ape do you know than you in the whole flaming bloody world
temple wriggled in his grip laughing still with sly content while cranly repeated flatly at every rude shake  a flaming flaring bloody idiot
they crossed the weedy garden together
the president wrapped in a heavy loose cloak was coming towards them along one of the walks reading his office
at the end of the walk he halted before turning and raised his eyes
the students saluted temple fumbling as before at the peak of his cap
they walked forward in silence
as they neared the alley stephen could hear the thuds of the players hands and the wet smacks of the ball and davins voice crying out excitedly at each stroke
the three students halted round the box on which davin sat to follow the game
temple after a few moments sidled across to stephen and said  excuse me i wanted to ask you do you believe that jean jacques rousseau was a sincere man
stephen laughed outright
cranly picking up the broken stave of a cask from the grass at his feet turned swiftly and said sternly  temple i declare to the living god if you say another word do you know to anybody on any subject ill kill you super spottum  he was like you i fancy said stephen an emotional man
blast him curse him
said cranly broadly
dont talk to him at all
sure you might as well be talking do you know to a flaming chamberpot as talking to temple
go home temple
for gods sake go home
i dont care a damn about you cranly answered temple moving out of reach of the uplifted stave and pointing at stephen
hes the only man i see in this institution that has an individual mind
institution
individual
cried cranly
go home blast you for youre a hopeless bloody man
im an emotional man said temple
thats quite rightly expressed
and im proud that im an emotionalist
he sidled out of the alley smiling slily
cranly watched him with a blank expressionless face
look at him
he said
did you ever see such a gobythewall
his phrase was greeted by a strange laugh from a student who lounged against the wall his peaked cap down on his eyes
the laugh pitched in a high key and coming from a so muscular frame seemed like the whinny of an elephant
the students body shook all over and to ease his mirth he rubbed both his hands delightedly over his groins
lynch is awake said cranly
lynch for answer straightened himself and thrust forward his chest
lynch puts out his chest said stephen as a criticism of life
lynch smote himself sonorously on the chest and said  who has anything to say about my girth
cranly took him at the word and the two began to tussle
when their faces had flushed with the struggle they drew apart panting
stephen bent down towards davin who intent on the game had paid no heed to the talk of the others
and how is my little tame goose
he asked
did he sign too
davin nodded and said  and you stevie
stephen shook his head
youre a terrible man stevie said davin taking the short pipe from his mouth always alone
now that you have signed the petition for universal peace said stephen i suppose you will burn that little copybook i saw in your room
as davin did not answer stephen began to quote  long pace fianna
right incline fianna
fianna by numbers salute one two
thats a different question said davin
im an irish nationalist first and foremost
but thats you all out
youre a born sneerer stevie
when you make the next rebellion with hurleysticks said stephen and want the indispensable informer tell me
i can find you a few in this college
i cant understand you said davin
one time i hear you talk against english literature
now you talk against the irish informers
what with your name and your ideas 
  are you irish at all
come with me now to the office of arms and i will show you the tree of my family said stephen
then be one of us said davin
why dont you learn irish
why did you drop out of the league class after the first lesson
you know one reason why answered stephen
davin tossed his head and laughed
oh come now he said
is it on account of that certain young lady and father moran
but thats all in your own mind stevie
they were only talking and laughing
stephen paused and laid a friendly hand upon davins shoulder
do you remember he said when we knew each other first
the first morning we met you asked me to show you the way to the matriculation class putting a very strong stress on the first syllable
you remember
then you used to address the jesuits as father you remember
i ask myself about you is he as innocent as his speech  im a simple person said davin
you know that
when you told me that night in harcourt street those things about your private life honest to god stevie i was not able to eat my dinner
i was quite bad
i was awake a long time that night
why did you tell me those things
thanks said stephen
you mean i am a monster
no said davin
but i wish you had not told me
a tide began to surge beneath the calm surface of stephens friendliness
this race and this country and this life produced me he said
i shall express myself as i am
try to be one of us repeated davin
in heart you are an irishman but your pride is too powerful
my ancestors threw off their language and took another stephen said
they allowed a handful of foreigners to subject them
do you fancy i am going to pay in my own life and person debts they made
what for
for our freedom said davin
no honourable and sincere man said stephen has given up to you his life and his youth and his affections from the days of tone to those of parnell but you sold him to the enemy or failed him in need or reviled him and left him for another
and you invite me to be one of you
id see you damned first
they died for their ideals stevie said davin
our day will come yet believe me
stephen following his own thought was silent for an instant
the soul is born he said vaguely first in those moments i told you of
it has a slow and dark birth more mysterious than the birth of the body
when the soul of a man is born in this country there are nets flung at it to hold it back from flight
you talk to me of nationality language religion
i shall try to fly by those nets
davin knocked the ashes from his pipe
too deep for me stevie he said
but a mans country comes first
ireland first stevie
you can be a poet or a mystic after
do you know what ireland is
asked stephen with cold violence
ireland is the old sow that eats her farrow
davin rose from his box and went towards the players shaking his head sadly
but in a moment his sadness left him and he was hotly disputing with cranly and the two players who had finished their game
a match of four was arranged cranly insisting however that his ball should be used
he let it rebound twice or thrice to his hand and struck it strongly and swiftly towards the base of the alley exclaiming in answer to its thud  your soul
stephen stood with lynch till the score began to rise
then he plucked him by the sleeve to come away
lynch obeyed saying  let us eke go as cranly has it
stephen smiled at this sidethrust
they passed back through the garden and out through the hall where the doddering porter was pinning up a hall notice in the frame
at the foot of the steps they halted and stephen took a packet of cigarettes from his pocket and offered it to his companion
i know you are poor he said
damn your yellow insolence answered lynch
this second proof of lynchs culture made stephen smile again
it was a great day for european culture he said when you made up your mind to swear in yellow
they lit their cigarettes and turned to the right
after a pause stephen began  aristotle has not defined pity and terror
i have
i say  lynch halted and said bluntly  stop
i wont listen
i am sick
i was out last night on a yellow drunk with horan and goggins
stephen went on  pity is the feeling which arrests the mind in the presence of whatsoever is grave and constant in human sufferings and unites it with the human sufferer
terror is the feeling which arrests the mind in the presence of whatsoever is grave and constant in human sufferings and unites it with the secret cause
repeat said lynch
stephen repeated the definitions slowly
a girl got into a hansom a few days ago he went on in london
she was on her way to meet her mother whom she had not seen for many years
at the corner of a street the shaft of a lorry shivered the window of the hansom in the shape of a star
a long fine needle of the shivered glass pierced her heart
she died on the instant
the reporter called it a tragic death
it is not
it is remote from terror and pity according to the terms of my definitions
the tragic emotion in fact is a face looking two ways towards terror and towards pity both of which are phases of it
you see i use the word arrest
i mean that the tragic emotion is static
or rather the dramatic emotion is
the feelings excited by improper art are kinetic desire or loathing
desire urges us to possess to go to something loathing urges us to abandon to go from something
the arts which excite them pornographical or didactic are therefore improper arts
the esthetic emotion i used the general term is therefore static
the mind is arrested and raised above desire and loathing
you say that art must not excite desire said lynch
i told you that one day i wrote my name in pencil on the backside of the venus of praxiteles in the museum
was that not desire
i speak of normal natures said stephen
you also told me that when you were a boy in that charming carmelite school you ate pieces of dried cowdung
lynch broke again into a whinny of laughter and again rubbed both his hands over his groins but without taking them from his pockets
o i did
i did
he cried
stephen turned towards his companion and looked at him for a moment boldly in the eyes
lynch recovering from his laughter answered his look from his humbled eyes
the long slender flattened skull beneath the long pointed cap brought before stephens mind the image of a hooded reptile
the eyes too were reptilelike in glint and gaze
yet at that instant humbled and alert in their look they were lit by one tiny human point the window of a shrivelled soul poignant and selfembittered
as for that stephen said in polite parenthesis we are all animals
i also am an animal
you are said lynch
but we are just now in a mental world stephen continued
the desire and loathing excited by improper esthetic means are really not esthetic emotions not only because they are kinetic in character but also because they are not more than physical
our flesh shrinks from what it dreads and responds to the stimulus of what it desires by a purely reflex action of the nervous system
our eyelid closes before we are aware that the fly is about to enter our eye
not always said lynch critically
in the same way said stephen your flesh responded to the stimulus of a naked statue but it was i say simply a reflex action of the nerves
beauty expressed by the artist cannot awaken in us an emotion which is kinetic or a sensation which is purely physical
it awakens or ought to awaken or induces or ought to induce an esthetic stasis an ideal pity or an ideal terror a stasis called forth prolonged and at last dissolved by what i call the rhythm of beauty
what is that exactly
asked lynch
rhythm said stephen is the first formal esthetic relation of part to part in any esthetic whole or of an esthetic whole to its part or parts or of any part to the esthetic whole of which it is a part
if that is rhythm said lynch let me hear what you call beauty and please remember though i did eat a cake of cowdung once that i admire only beauty
stephen raised his cap as if in greeting
then blushing slightly he laid his hand on lynchs thick tweed sleeve
we are right he said and the others are wrong
to speak of these things and to try to understand their nature and having understood it to try slowly and humbly and constantly to express to press out again from the gross earth or what it brings forth from sound and shape and colour which are the prison gates of our soul an image of the beauty we have come to understandthat is art
they had reached the canal bridge and turning from their course went on by the trees
a crude grey light mirrored in the sluggish water and a smell of wet branches over their heads seemed to war against the course of stephens thought
but you have not answered my question said lynch
what is art
what is the beauty it expresses
that was the first definition i gave you you sleepyheaded wretch said stephen when i began to try to think out the matter for myself
do you remember the night
cranly lost his temper and began to talk about wicklow bacon
i remember said lynch
he told us about them flaming fat devils of pigs
art said stephen is the human disposition of sensible or intelligible matter for an esthetic end
you remember the pigs and forget that
you are a distressing pair you and cranly
lynch made a grimace at the raw grey sky and said  if i am to listen to your esthetic philosophy give me at least another cigarette
i dont care about it
i dont even care about women
damn you and damn everything
i want a job of five hundred a year
you cant get me one
stephen handed him the packet of cigarettes
lynch took the last one that remained saying simply  proceed
aquinas said stephen says that is beautiful the apprehension of which pleases
lynch nodded
i remember that he said pulcra sunt qu visa placent  he uses the word visa said stephen to cover esthetic apprehensions of all kinds whether through sight or hearing or through any other avenue of apprehension
this word though it is vague is clear enough to keep away good and evil which excite desire and loathing
it means certainly a stasis and not a kinesis
how about the true
it produces also a stasis of the mind
you would not write your name in pencil across the hypothenuse of a rightangled triangle
no said lynch give me the hypothenuse of the venus of praxiteles
static therefore said stephen
plato i believe said that beauty is the splendour of truth
i dont think that it has a meaning but the true and the beautiful are akin
truth is beheld by the intellect which is appeased by the most satisfying relations of the intelligible beauty is beheld by the imagination which is appeased by the most satisfying relations of the sensible
the first step in the direction of truth is to understand the frame and scope of the intellect itself to comprehend the act itself of intellection
aristotles entire system of philosophy rests upon his book of psychology and that i think rests on his statement that the same attribute cannot at the same time and in the same connexion belong to and not belong to the same subject
the first step in the direction of beauty is to understand the frame and scope of the imagination to comprehend the act itself of esthetic apprehension
is that clear
but what is beauty
asked lynch impatiently
out with another definition
something we see and like
is that the best you and aquinas can do
let us take woman said stephen
let us take her
said lynch fervently
the greek the turk the chinese the copt the hottentot said stephen all admire a different type of female beauty
that seems to be a maze out of which we cannot escape
i see however two ways out
one is this hypothesis that every physical quality admired by men in women is in direct connexion with the manifold functions of women for the propagation of the species
it may be so
the world it seems is drearier than even you lynch imagined
for my part i dislike that way out
it leads to eugenics rather than to esthetic
it leads you out of the maze into a new gaudy lectureroom where maccann with one hand on the origin of species and the other hand on the new testament tells you that you admired the great flanks of venus because you felt that she would bear you burly offspring and admired her great breasts because you felt that she would give good milk to her children and yours
then maccann is a sulphuryellow liar said lynch energetically
there remains another way out said stephen laughing
to wit
said lynch
this hypothesis stephen began
a long dray laden with old iron came round the corner of sir patrick duns hospital covering the end of stephens speech with the harsh roar of jangled and rattling metal
lynch closed his ears and gave out oath after oath till the dray had passed
then he turned on his heel rudely
stephen turned also and waited for a few moments till his companions illhumour had had its vent
this hypothesis stephen repeated is the other way out that though the same object may not seem beautiful to all people all people who admire a beautiful object find in it certain relations which satisfy and coincide with the stages themselves of all esthetic apprehension
these relations of the sensible visible to you through one form and to me through another must be therefore the necessary qualities of beauty
now we can return to our old friend saint thomas for another pennyworth of wisdom
lynch laughed
it amuses me vastly he said to hear you quoting him time after time like a jolly round friar
are you laughing in your sleeve
macalister answered stephen would call my esthetic theory applied aquinas
so far as this side of esthetic philosophy extends aquinas will carry me all along the line
when we come to the phenomena of artistic conception artistic gestation and artistic reproduction i require a new terminology and a new personal experience
of course said lynch
after all aquinas in spite of his intellect was exactly a good round friar
but you will tell me about the new personal experience and new terminology some other day
hurry up and finish the first part
who knows
said stephen smiling
perhaps aquinas would understand me better than you
he was a poet himself
he wrote a hymn for maundy thursday
it begins with the words pange lingua gloriosi they say it is the highest glory of the hymnal
it is an intricate and soothing hymn
i like it but there is no hymn that can be put beside that mournful and majestic processional song the vexilla regis of venantius fortunatus
lynch began to sing softly and solemnly in a deep bass voice      inpleta sunt qu concinit     david fideli carmine     dicendo nationibus     regnavit a ligno deus
thats great
he said well pleased
great music
they turned into lower mount street
a few steps from the corner a fat young man wearing a silk neckcloth saluted them and stopped
did you hear the results of the exams
he asked
griffin was plucked
halpin and oflynn are through the home civil
moonan got fifth place in the indian
oshaughnessy got fourteenth
the irish fellows in clarks gave them a feed last night
they all ate curry
his pallid bloated face expressed benevolent malice and as he had advanced through his tidings of success his small fatencircled eyes vanished out of sight and his weak wheezing voice out of hearing
in reply to a question of stephens his eyes and his voice came forth again from their lurkingplaces
yes maccullagh and i he said
hes taking pure mathematics and im taking constitutional history
there are twenty subjects
im taking botany too
you know im a member of the field club
he drew back from the other two in a stately fashion and placed a plump woollengloved hand on his breast from which muttered wheezing laughter at once broke forth
bring us a few turnips and onions the next time you go out said stephen drily to make a stew
the fat student laughed indulgently and said  we are all highly respectable people in the field club
last saturday we went out to glenmalure seven of us
with women donovan
said lynch
donovan again laid his hand on his chest and said  our end is the acquisition of knowledge
then he said quickly  i hear you are writing some essays about esthetics
stephen made a vague gesture of denial
goethe and lessing said donovan have written a lot on that subject the classical school and the romantic school and all that
the laocoon interested me very much when i read it
of course it is idealistic german ultraprofound
neither of the others spoke
donovan took leave of them urbanely
i must go he said softly and benevolently i have a strong suspicion amounting almost to a conviction that my sister intended to make pancakes today for the dinner of the donovan family
goodbye stephen said in his wake
dont forget the turnips for me and my mate
lynch gazed after him his lip curling in slow scorn till his face resembled a devils mask  to think that that yellow pancakeeating excrement can get a good job he said at length and i have to smoke cheap cigarettes
they turned their faces towards merrion square and went for a little in silence
to finish what i was saying about beauty said stephen the most satisfying relations of the sensible must therefore correspond to the necessary phases of artistic apprehension
find these and you find the qualities of universal beauty
aquinas says ad pulcritudinem tria requiruntur integritas consonantia claritas i translate it so three things are needed for beauty wholeness harmony and radiance do these correspond to the phases of apprehension
are you following
of course i am said lynch
if you think i have an excrementitious intelligence run after donovan and ask him to listen to you
stephen pointed to a basket which a butchers boy had slung inverted on his head
look at that basket he said
i see it said lynch
in order to see that basket said stephen your mind first of all separates the basket from the rest of the visible universe which is not the basket
the first phase of apprehension is a bounding line drawn about the object to be apprehended
an esthetic image is presented to us either in space or in time
what is audible is presented in time what is visible is presented in space
but temporal or spatial the esthetic image is first luminously apprehended as selfbounded and selfcontained upon the immeasurable background of space or time which is not it
you apprehended it as one thing
you see it as one whole
you apprehend its wholeness
that is integritas  bulls eye
said lynch laughing
go on
then said stephen you pass from point to point led by its formal lines you apprehend it as balanced part against part within its limits you feel the rhythm of its structure
in other words the synthesis of immediate perception is followed by the analysis of apprehension
having first felt that it is one thing you feel now that it is a thing
you apprehend it as complex multiple divisible separable made up of its parts the result of its parts and their sum harmonious
that is consonantia
bulls eye again
said lynch wittily
tell me now what is claritas and you win the cigar
the connotation of the word stephen said is rather vague
aquinas uses a term which seems to be inexact
it baffled me for a long time
it would lead you to believe that he had in mind symbolism or idealism the supreme quality of beauty being a light from some other world the idea of which the matter is but the shadow the reality of which it is but the symbol
i thought he might mean that claritas is the artistic discovery and representation of the divine purpose in anything or a force of generalization which would make the esthetic image a universal one make it outshine its proper conditions
but that is literary talk
i understand it so
when you have apprehended that basket as one thing and have then analysed it according to its form and apprehended it as a thing you make the only synthesis which is logically and esthetically permissible
you see that it is that thing which it is and no other thing
the radiance of which he speaks in the scholastic quidditas the whatness of a thing
this supreme quality is felt by the artist when the esthetic image is first conceived in his imagination
the mind in that mysterious instant shelley likened beautifully to a fading coal
the instant wherein that supreme quality of beauty the clear radiance of the esthetic image is apprehended luminously by the mind which has been arrested by its wholeness and fascinated by its harmony is the luminous silent stasis of esthetic pleasure a spiritual state very like to that cardiac condition which the italian physiologist luigi galvani using a phrase almost as beautiful as shelleys called the enchantment of the heart
stephen paused and though his companion did not speak felt that his words had called up around them a thoughtenchanted silence
what i have said he began again refers to beauty in the wider sense of the word in the sense which the word has in the literary tradition
in the marketplace it has another sense
when we speak of beauty in the second sense of the term our judgement is influenced in the first place by the art itself and by the form of that art
the image it is clear must be set between the mind or senses of the artist himself and the mind or senses of others
if you bear this in memory you will see that art necessarily divides itself into three forms progressing from one to the next
these forms are the lyrical form the form wherein the artist presents his image in immediate relation to himself the epical form the form wherein he presents his image in mediate relation to himself and to others the dramatic form the form wherein he presents his image in immediate relation to others
that you told me a few nights ago said lynch and we began the famous discussion
i have a book at home said stephen in which i have written down questions which are more amusing than yours were
in finding the answers to them i found the theory of esthetic which i am trying to explain
here are some questions i set myself is a chair finely made tragic or comic
is the portrait of mona lisa good if i desire to see it
is the bust of sir philip crampton lyrical epical or dramatic
if not why not  why not indeed
said lynch laughing
if a man hacking in fury at a block of wood stephen continued make there an image of a cow is that image a work of art
if not why not  thats a lovely one said lynch laughing again
that has the true scholastic stink
lessing said stephen should not have taken a group of statues to write of
the art being inferior does not present the forms i spoke of distinguished clearly one from another
even in literature the highest and most spiritual art the forms are often confused
the lyrical form is in fact the simplest verbal vesture of an instant of emotion a rhythmical cry such as ages ago cheered on the man who pulled at the oar or dragged stones up a slope
he who utters it is more conscious of the instant of emotion than of himself as feeling emotion
the simplest epical form is seen emerging out of lyrical literature when the artist prolongs and broods upon himself as the centre of an epical event and this form progresses till the centre of emotional gravity is equidistant from the artist himself and from others
the narrative is no longer purely personal
the personality of the artist passes into the narration itself flowing round and round the persons and the action like a vital sea
this progress you will see easily in that old english ballad turpin hero which begins in the first person and ends in the third person
the dramatic form is reached when the vitality which has flowed and eddied round each person fills every person with such vital force that he or she assumes a proper and intangible esthetic life
the personality of the artist at first a cry or a cadence or a mood and then a fluid and lambent narrative finally refines itself out of existence impersonalizes itself so to speak
the esthetic image in the dramatic form is life purified in and reprojected from the human imagination
the mystery of esthetic like that of material creation is accomplished
the artist like the god of creation remains within or behind or beyond or above his handiwork invisible refined out of existence indifferent paring his fingernails
trying to refine them also out of existence said lynch
a fine rain began to fall from the high veiled sky and they turned into the dukes lawn to reach the national library before the shower came
what do you mean lynch asked surlily by prating about beauty and the imagination in this miserable godforsaken island
no wonder the artist retired within or behind his handiwork after having perpetrated this country
the rain fell faster
when they passed through the passage beside kildare house they found many students sheltering under the arcade of the library
cranly leaning against a pillar was picking his teeth with a sharpened match listening to some companions
some girls stood near the entrance door
lynch whispered to stephen  your beloved is here
stephen took his place silently on the step below the group of students heedless of the rain which fell fast turning his eyes towards her from time to time
she too stood silently among her companions
she has no priest to flirt with he thought with conscious bitterness remembering how he had seen her last
lynch was right
his mind emptied of theory and courage lapsed back into a listless peace
he heard the students talking among themselves
they spoke of two friends who had passed the final medical examination of the chances of getting places on ocean liners of poor and rich practices
thats all a bubble
an irish country practice is better
hynes was two years in liverpool and he says the same
a frightful hole he said it was
nothing but midwifery cases
do you mean to say it is better to have a job here in the country than in a rich city like that
i know a fellow  hynes has no brains
he got through by stewing pure stewing
dont mind him
theres plenty of money to be made in a big commercial city
depends on the practice
ego credo ut vita pauperum est simpliciter atrox simpliciter sanguinarius atrox in liverpoolio  their voices reached his ears as if from a distance in interrupted pulsation
she was preparing to go away with her companions
the quick light shower had drawn off tarrying in clusters of diamonds among the shrubs of the quadrangle where an exhalation was breathed forth by the blackened earth
their trim boots prattled as they stood on the steps of the colonnade talking quietly and gaily glancing at the clouds holding their umbrellas at cunning angles against the few last raindrops closing them again holding their skirts demurely
and if he had judged her harshly
if her life were a simple rosary of hours her life simple and strange as a birds life gay in the morning restless all day tired at sundown
her heart simple and wilful as a birds heart
towards dawn he awoke
o what sweet music
his soul was all dewy wet
over his limbs in sleep pale cool waves of light had passed
he lay still as if his soul lay amid cool waters conscious of faint sweet music
his mind was waking slowly to a tremulous morning knowledge a morning inspiration
a spirit filled him pure as the purest water sweet as dew moving as music
but how faintly it was inbreathed how passionlessly as if the seraphim themselves were breathing upon him
his soul was waking slowly fearing to awake wholly
it was that windless hour of dawn when madness wakes and strange plants open to the light and the moth flies forth silently
an enchantment of the heart
the night had been enchanted
in a dream or vision he had known the ecstasy of seraphic life
was it an instant of enchantment only or long hours and years and ages
the instant of inspiration seemed now to be reflected from all sides at once from a multitude of cloudy circumstances of what had happened or of what might have happened
the instant flashed forth like a point of light and now from cloud on cloud of vague circumstance confused form was veiling softly its afterglow
o
in the virgin womb of the imagination the word was made flesh
gabriel the seraph had come to the virgins chamber
an afterglow deepened within his spirit whence the white flame had passed deepening to a rose and ardent light
that rose and ardent light was her strange wilful heart strange that no man had known or would know wilful from before the beginning of the world and lured by that ardent roselike glow the choirs of the seraphim were falling from heaven
are you not weary of ardent ways     lure of the fallen seraphim
tell no more of enchanted days
the verses passed from his mind to his lips and murmuring them over he felt the rhythmic movement of a villanelle pass through them
the roselike glow sent forth its rays of rhyme ways days blaze praise raise
its rays burned up the world consumed the hearts of men and angels the rays from the rose that was her wilful heart
your eyes have set mans heart ablaze     and you have had your will of him
are you not weary of ardent ways
and then
the rhythm died away ceased began again to move and beat
and then
smoke incense ascending from the altar of the world
above the flame the smoke of praise     goes up from ocean rim to rim     tell no more of enchanted days
smoke went up from the whole earth from the vapoury oceans smoke of her praise
the earth was like a swinging swaying censer a ball of incense an ellipsoidal ball
the rhythm died out at once the cry of his heart was broken
his lips began to murmur the first verses over and over then went on stumbling through half verses stammering and baffled then stopped
the hearts cry was broken
the veiled windless hour had passed and behind the panes of the naked window the morning light was gathering
a bell beat faintly very far away
a bird twittered two birds three
the bell and the bird ceased and the dull white light spread itself east and west covering the world covering the roselight in his heart
fearing to lose all he raised himself suddenly on his elbow to look for paper and pencil
there was neither on the table only the soup plate he had eaten the rice from for supper and the candlestick with its tendrils of tallow and its paper socket singed by the last flame
he stretched his arm wearily towards the foot of the bed groping with his hand in the pockets of the coat that hung there
his fingers found a pencil and then a cigarette packet
he lay back and tearing open the packet placed the last cigarette on the window ledge and began to write out the stanzas of the villanelle in small neat letters on the rough cardboard surface
having written them out he lay back on the lumpy pillow murmuring them again
the lumps of knotted flock under his head reminded him of the lumps of knotted horsehair in the sofa of her parlour on which he used to sit smiling or serious asking himself why he had come displeased with her and with himself confounded by the print of the sacred heart above the untenanted sideboard
he saw her approach him in a lull of the talk and beg him to sing one of his curious songs
then he saw himself sitting at the old piano striking chords softly from its speckled keys and singing amid the talk which had risen again in the room to her who leaned beside the mantelpiece a dainty song of the elizabethans a sad and sweet loth to depart the victory chant of agincourt the happy air of greensleeves
while he sang and she listened or feigned to listen his heart was at rest but when the quaint old songs had ended and he heard again the voices in the room he remembered his own sarcasm the house where young men are called by their christian names a little too soon
at certain instants her eyes seemed about to trust him but he had waited in vain
she passed now dancing lightly across his memory as she had been that night at the carnival ball her white dress a little lifted a white spray nodding in her hair
she danced lightly in the round
she was dancing towards him and as she came her eyes were a little averted and a faint glow was on her cheek
at the pause in the chain of hands her hand had lain in his an instant a soft merchandise
you are a great stranger now
yes
i was born to be a monk
i am afraid you are a heretic
are you much afraid
for answer she had danced away from him along the chain of hands dancing lightly and discreetly giving herself to none
the white spray nodded to her dancing and when she was in shadow the glow was deeper on her cheek
a monk
his own image started forth a profaner of the cloister a heretic franciscan willing and willing not to serve spinning like gherardino da borgo san donnino a lithe web of sophistry and whispering in her ear
no it was not his image
it was like the image of the young priest in whose company he had seen her last looking at him out of doves eyes toying with the pages of her irish phrasebook
yes yes the ladies are coming round to us
i can see it every day
the ladies are with us
the best helpers the language has
and the church father moran
the church too
coming round too
the work is going ahead there too
dont fret about the church
bah
he had done well to leave the room in disdain
he had done well not to salute her on the steps of the library
he had done well to leave her to flirt with her priest to toy with a church which was the scullerymaid of christendom
rude brutal anger routed the last lingering instant of ecstasy from his soul
it broke up violently her fair image and flung the fragments on all sides
on all sides distorted reflections of her image started from his memory the flower girl in the ragged dress with damp coarse hair and a hoydens face who had called herself his own girl and begged his handsel the kitchengirl in the next house who sang over the clatter of her plates with the drawl of a country singer the first bars of by killarneys lakes and fells a girl who had laughed gaily to see him stumble when the iron grating in the footpath near cork hill had caught the broken sole of his shoe a girl he had glanced at attracted by her small ripe mouth as she passed out of jacobs biscuit factory who had cried to him over her shoulder  do you like what you seen of me straight hair and curly eyebrows
and yet he felt that however he might revile and mock her image his anger was also a form of homage
he had left the classroom in disdain that was not wholly sincere feeling that perhaps the secret of her race lay behind those dark eyes upon which her long lashes flung a quick shadow
he had told himself bitterly as he walked through the streets that she was a figure of the womanhood of her country a batlike soul waking to the consciousness of itself in darkness and secrecy and loneliness tarrying awhile loveless and sinless with her mild lover and leaving him to whisper of innocent transgressions in the latticed ear of a priest
his anger against her found vent in coarse railing at her paramour whose name and voice and features offended his baffled pride a priested peasant with a brother a policeman in dublin and a brother a potboy in moycullen
to him she would unveil her souls shy nakedness to one who was but schooled in the discharging of a formal rite rather than to him a priest of the eternal imagination transmuting the daily bread of experience into the radiant body of everliving life
the radiant image of the eucharist united again in an instant his bitter and despairing thoughts their cries arising unbroken in a hymn of thanksgiving
our broken cries and mournful lays     rise in one eucharistic hymn     are you not weary of ardent ways
while sacrificing hands upraise     the chalice flowing to the brim     tell no more of enchanted days
he spoke the verses aloud from the first lines till the music and rhythm suffused his mind turning it to quiet indulgence then copied them painfully to feel them the better by seeing them then lay back on his bolster
the full morning light had come
no sound was to be heard but he knew that all around him life was about to awaken in common noises hoarse voices sleepy prayers
shrinking from that life he turned towards the wall making a cowl of the blanket and staring at the great overblown scarlet flowers of the tattered wallpaper
he tried to warm his perishing joy in their scarlet glow imagining a roseway from where he lay upwards to heaven all strewn with scarlet flowers
weary
weary
he too was weary of ardent ways
a gradual warmth a languorous weariness passed over him descending along his spine from his closely cowled head
he felt it descend and seeing himself as he lay smiled
soon he would sleep
he had written verses for her again after ten years
ten years before she had worn her shawl cowlwise about her head sending sprays of her warm breath into the night air tapping her foot upon the glassy road
it was the last tram the lank brown horses knew it and shook their bells to the clear night in admonition
the conductor talked with the driver both nodding often in the green light of the lamp
they stood on the steps of the tram he on the upper she on the lower
she came up to his step many times between their phrases and went down again and once or twice remained beside him forgetting to go down and then went down
let be
let be
ten years from that wisdom of children to his folly
if he sent her the verses
they would be read out at breakfast amid the tapping of eggshells
folly indeed
her brothers would laugh and try to wrest the page from each other with their strong hard fingers
the suave priest her uncle seated in his armchair would hold the page at arms length read it smiling and approve of the literary form
no no that was folly
even if he sent her the verses she would not show them to others
no no she could not
he began to feel that he had wronged her
a sense of her innocence moved him almost to pity her an innocence he had never understood till he had come to the knowledge of it through sin an innocence which she too had not understood while she was innocent or before the strange humiliation of her nature had first come upon her
then first her soul had begun to live as his soul had when he had first sinned and a tender compassion filled his heart as he remembered her frail pallor and her eyes humbled and saddened by the dark shame of womanhood
while his soul had passed from ecstasy to languor where had she been
might it be in the mysterious ways of spiritual life that her soul at those same moments had been conscious of his homage
it might be
a glow of desire kindled again his soul and fired and fulfilled all his body
conscious of his desire she was waking from odorous sleep the temptress of his villanelle
her eyes dark and with a look of languor were opening to his eyes
her nakedness yielded to him radiant warm odorous and lavishlimbed enfolded him like a shining cloud enfolded him like water with a liquid life and like a cloud of vapour or like waters circumfluent in space the liquid letters of speech symbols of the element of mystery flowed forth over his brain
are you not weary of ardent ways     lure of the fallen seraphim
tell no more of enchanted days
your eyes have set mans heart ablaze     and you have had your will of him
are you not weary of ardent ways
above the flame the smoke of praise     goes up from ocean rim to rim
tell no more of enchanted days
our broken cries and mournful lays     rise in one eucharistic hymn
are you not weary of ardent ways
while sacrificing hands upraise     the chalice flowing to the brim
tell no more of enchanted days
and still you hold our longing gaze     with languorous look and lavish limb
are you not weary of ardent ways
tell no more of enchanted days
what birds were they
he stood on the steps of the library to look at them leaning wearily on his ashplant
they flew round and round the jutting shoulder of a house in molesworth street
the air of the late march evening made clear their flight their dark darting quivering bodies flying clearly against the sky as against a limphung cloth of smoky tenuous blue
he watched their flight bird after bird a dark flash a swerve a flutter of wings
he tried to count them before all their darting quivering bodies passed six ten eleven and wondered were they odd or even in number
twelve thirteen for two came wheeling down from the upper sky
they were flying high and low but ever round and round in straight and curving lines and ever flying from left to right circling about a temple of air
he listened to the cries like the squeak of mice behind the wainscot a shrill twofold note
but the notes were long and shrill and whirring unlike the cry of vermin falling a third or a fourth and trilled as the flying beaks clove the air
their cry was shrill and clear and fine and falling like threads of silken light unwound from whirring spools
the inhuman clamour soothed his ears in which his mothers sobs and reproaches murmured insistently and the dark frail quivering bodies wheeling and fluttering and swerving round an airy temple of the tenuous sky soothed his eyes which still saw the image of his mothers face
why was he gazing upwards from the steps of the porch hearing their shrill twofold cry watching their flight
for an augury of good or evil
a phrase of cornelius agrippa flew through his mind and then there flew hither and thither shapeless thoughts from swedenborg on the correspondence of birds to things of the intellect and of how the creatures of the air have their knowledge and know their times and seasons because they unlike man are in the order of their life and have not perverted that order by reason
and for ages men had gazed upward as he was gazing at birds in flight
the colonnade above him made him think vaguely of an ancient temple and the ashplant on which he leaned wearily of the curved stick of an augur
a sense of fear of the unknown moved in the heart of his weariness a fear of symbols and portents of the hawklike man whose name he bore soaring out of his captivity on osierwoven wings of thoth the god of writers writing with a reed upon a tablet and bearing on his narrow ibis head the cusped moon
he smiled as he thought of the gods image for it made him think of a bottlenosed judge in a wig putting commas into a document which he held at arms length and he knew that he would not have remembered the gods name but that it was like an irish oath
it was folly
but was it for this folly that he was about to leave for ever the house of prayer and prudence into which he had been born and the order of life out of which he had come
they came back with shrill cries over the jutting shoulder of the house flying darkly against the fading air
what birds were they
he thought that they must be swallows who had come back from the south
then he was to go away for they were birds ever going and coming building ever an unlasting home under the eaves of mens houses and ever leaving the homes they had built to wander
bend down your faces oona and aleel
i gaze upon them as the swallow gazes     upon the nest under the eave before     he wander the loud waters
a soft liquid joy like the noise of many waters flowed over his memory and he felt in his heart the soft peace of silent spaces of fading tenuous sky above the waters of oceanic silence of swallows flying through the seadusk over the flowing waters
a soft liquid joy flowed through the words where the soft long vowels hurtled noiselessly and fell away lapping and flowing back and ever shaking the white bells of their waves in mute chime and mute peal and soft low swooning cry and he felt that the augury he had sought in the wheeling darting birds and in the pale space of sky above him had come forth from his heart like a bird from a turret quietly and swiftly
symbol of departure or of loneliness
the verses crooned in the ear of his memory composed slowly before his remembering eyes the scene of the hall on the night of the opening of the national theatre
he was alone at the side of the balcony looking out of jaded eyes at the culture of dublin in the stalls and at the tawdry scenecloths and human dolls framed by the garish lamps of the stage
a burly policeman sweated behind him and seemed at every moment about to act
the catcalls and hisses and mocking cries ran in rude gusts round the hall from his scattered fellow students
a libel on ireland
made in germany
blasphemy
we never sold our faith
no irish woman ever did it
we want no amateur atheists
we want no budding buddhists
a sudden swift hiss fell from the windows above him and he knew that the electric lamps had been switched on in the readers room
he turned into the pillared hall now calmly lit went up the staircase and passed in through the clicking turnstile
cranly was sitting over near the dictionaries
a thick book opened at the frontispiece lay before him on the wooden rest
he leaned back in his chair inclining his ear like that of a confessor to the face of the medical student who was reading to him a problem from the chess page of a journal
stephen sat down at his right and the priest at the other side of the table closed his copy of the tablet with an angry snap and stood up
cranly gazed after him blandly and vaguely
the medical student went on in a softer voice  pawn to kings fourth
we had better go dixon said stephen in warning
he has gone to complain
dixon folded the journal and rose with dignity saying  our men retired in good order
with guns and cattle added stephen pointing to the titlepage of cranlys book on which was printed diseases of the ox
as they passed through a lane of the tables stephen said  cranly i want to speak to you
cranly did not answer or turn
he laid his book on the counter and passed out his wellshod feet sounding flatly on the floor
on the staircase he paused and gazing absently at dixon repeated  pawn to kings bloody fourth
put it that way if you like dixon said
he had a quiet toneless voice and urbane manners and on a finger of his plump clean hand he displayed at moments a signet ring
as they crossed the hall a man of dwarfish stature came towards them
under the dome of his tiny hat his unshaven face began to smile with pleasure and he was heard to murmur
the eyes were melancholy as those of a monkey
good evening gentlemen said the stubblegrown monkeyish face
warm weather for march said cranly
they have the windows open upstairs
dixon smiled and turned his ring
the blackish monkeypuckered face pursed its human mouth with gentle pleasure and its voice purred  delightful weather for march
simply delightful
there are two nice young ladies upstairs captain tired of waiting dixon said
cranly smiled and said kindly  the captain has only one love sir walter scott
isnt that so captain
what are you reading now captain
dixon asked
the bride of lammermoor  i love old scott the flexible lips said i think he writes something lovely
there is no writer can touch sir walter scott
he moved a thin shrunken brown hand gently in the air in time to his praise and his thin quick eyelids beat often over his sad eyes
sadder to stephens ear was his speech a genteel accent low and moist marred by errors and listening to it he wondered was the story true and was the thin blood that flowed in his shrunken frame noble and come of an incestuous love
the park trees were heavy with rain and rain fell still and ever in the lake lying grey like a shield
a game of swans flew there and the water and the shore beneath were fouled with their greenwhite slime
they embraced softly impelled by the grey rainy light the wet silent trees the shieldlike witnessing lake the swans
they embraced without joy or passion his arm about his sisters neck
a grey woollen cloak was wrapped athwart her from her shoulder to her waist and her fair head was bent in willing shame
he had loose redbrown hair and tender shapely strong freckled hands
face
there was no face seen
the brothers face was bent upon her fair rainfragrant hair
the hand freckled and strong and shapely and caressing was davins hand
he frowned angrily upon his thought and on the shrivelled mannikin who had called it forth
his fathers gibes at the bantry gang leaped out of his memory
he held them at a distance and brooded uneasily on his own thought again
why were they not cranlys hands
had davins simplicity and innocence stung him more secretly
he walked on across the hall with dixon leaving cranly to take leave elaborately of the dwarf
under the colonnade temple was standing in the midst of a little group of students
one of them cried  dixon come over till you hear
temple is in grand form
temple turned on him his dark gipsy eyes
youre a hypocrite okeeffe he said
and dixon is a smiler
by hell i think thats a good literary expression
he laughed slily looking in stephens face repeating  by hell im delighted with that name
a smiler
a stout student who stood below them on the steps said  come back to the mistress temple
we want to hear about that
he had faith temple said
and he was a married man too
and all the priests used to be dining there
by hell i think they all had a touch
we shall call it riding a hack to spare the hunter said dixon
tell us temple okeeffe said how many quarts of porter have you in you
all your intellectual soul is in that phrase okeeffe said temple with open scorn
he moved with a shambling gait round the group and spoke to stephen
did you know that the forsters are the kings of belgium
he asked
cranly came out through the door of the entrance hall his hat thrust back on the nape of his neck and picking his teeth with care
and heres the wiseacre said temple
do you know that about the forsters
he paused for an answer
cranly dislodged a figseed from his teeth on the point of his rude toothpick and gazed at it intently
the forster family temple said is descended from baldwin the first king of flanders
he was called the forester
forester and forster are the same name
a descendant of baldwin the first captain francis forster settled in ireland and married the daughter of the last chieftain of clanbrassil
then there are the blake forsters
thats a different branch
from baldhead king of flanders cranly repeated rooting again deliberately at his gleaming uncovered teeth
where did you pick up all that history
okeeffe asked
i know all the history of your family too temple said turning to stephen
do you know what giraldus cambrensis says about your family
is he descended from baldwin too
asked a tall consumptive student with dark eyes
baldhead cranly repeated sucking at a crevice in his teeth
pernobilis et pervetusta familia temple said to stephen
the stout student who stood below them on the steps farted briefly
dixon turned towards him saying in a soft voice  did an angel speak
cranly turned also and said vehemently but without anger  goggins youre the flamingest dirty devil i ever met do you know
i had it on my mind to say that goggins answered firmly
it did no one any harm did it
we hope dixon said suavely that it was not of the kind known to science as a paulo post futurum  didnt i tell you he was a smiler
said temple turning right and left
didnt i give him that name
you did
were not deaf said the tall consumptive
cranly still frowned at the stout student below him
then with a snort of disgust he shoved him violently down the steps
go away from here he said rudely
go away you stinkpot
and you are a stinkpot
goggins skipped down on to the gravel and at once returned to his place with good humour
temple turned back to stephen and asked  do you believe in the law of heredity
are you drunk or what are you or what are you trying to say
asked cranly facing round on him with an expression of wonder
the most profound sentence ever written temple said with enthusiasm is the sentence at the end of the zoology
reproduction is the beginning of death
he touched stephen timidly at the elbow and said eagerly  do you feel how profound that is because you are a poet
cranly pointed his long forefinger
look at him
he said with scorn to the others
look at irelands hope
they laughed at his words and gesture
temple turned on him bravely saying  cranly youre always sneering at me
i can see that
but i am as good as you any day
do you know what i think about you now as compared with myself
my dear man said cranly urbanely you are incapable do you know absolutely incapable of thinking
but do you know temple went on what i think of you and of myself compared together
out with it temple
the stout student cried from the steps
get it out in bits
temple turned right and left making sudden feeble gestures as he spoke
im a ballocks he said shaking his head in despair
i am and i know i am
and i admit it that i am
dixon patted him lightly on the shoulder and said mildly  and it does you every credit temple
but he temple said pointing to cranly he is a ballocks too like me
only he doesnt know it
and thats the only difference i see
a burst of laughter covered his words
but he turned again to stephen and said with a sudden eagerness  that word is a most interesting word
thats the only english dual number
did you know
is it
stephen said vaguely
he was watching cranlys firmfeatured suffering face lit up now by a smile of false patience
the gross name had passed over it like foul water poured over an old stone image patient of injuries and as he watched him he saw him raise his hat in salute and uncover the black hair that stood stiffly from his forehead like an iron crown
she passed out from the porch of the library and bowed across stephen in reply to cranlys greeting
he also
was there not a slight flush on cranlys cheek
or had it come forth at temples words
the light had waned
he could not see
did that explain his friends listless silence his harsh comments the sudden intrusions of rude speech with which he had shattered so often stephens ardent wayward confessions
stephen had forgiven freely for he had found this rudeness also in himself
and he remembered an evening when he had dismounted from a borrowed creaking bicycle to pray to god in a wood near malahide
he had lifted up his arms and spoken in ecstasy to the sombre nave of the trees knowing that he stood on holy ground and in a holy hour
and when two constabulary men had come into sight round a bend in the gloomy road he had broken off his prayer to whistle loudly an air from the last pantomime
he began to beat the frayed end of his ashplant against the base of a pillar
had cranly not heard him
yet he could wait
the talk about him ceased for a moment and a soft hiss fell again from a window above
but no other sound was in the air and the swallows whose flight he had followed with idle eyes were sleeping
she had passed through the dusk
and therefore the air was silent save for one soft hiss that fell
and therefore the tongues about him had ceased their babble
darkness was falling
darkness falls from the air
a trembling joy lambent as a faint light played like a fairy host around him
but why
her passage through the darkening air or the verse with its black vowels and its opening sound rich and lutelike
he walked away slowly towards the deeper shadows at the end of the colonnade beating the stone softly with his stick to hide his reverie from the students whom he had left and allowed his mind to summon back to itself the age of dowland and byrd and nash
eyes opening from the darkness of desire eyes that dimmed the breaking east
what was their languid grace but the softness of chambering
and what was their shimmer but the shimmer of the scum that mantled the cesspool of the court of a slobbering stuart
and he tasted in the language of memory ambered wines dying fallings of sweet airs the proud pavan and saw with the eyes of memory kind gentlewomen in covent garden wooing from their balconies with sucking mouths and the poxfouled wenches of the taverns and young wives that gaily yielding to their ravishers clipped and clipped again
the images he had summoned gave him no pleasure
they were secret and inflaming but her image was not entangled by them
that was not the way to think of her
it was not even the way in which he thought of her
could his mind then not trust itself
old phrases sweet only with a disinterred sweetness like the figseeds cranly rooted out of his gleaming teeth
it was not thought nor vision though he knew vaguely that her figure was passing homeward through the city
vaguely first and then more sharply he smelt her body
a conscious unrest seethed in his blood
yes it was her body he smelt a wild and languid smell the tepid limbs over which his music had flowed desirously and the secret soft linen upon which her flesh distilled odour and a dew
a louse crawled over the nape of his neck and putting his thumb and forefinger deftly beneath his loose collar he caught it
he rolled its body tender yet brittle as a grain of rice between thumb and finger for an instant before he let it fall from him and wondered would it live or die
there came to his mind a curious phrase from cornelius a lapide which said that the lice born of human sweat were not created by god with the other animals on the sixth day
but the tickling of the skin of his neck made his mind raw and red
the life of his body ill clad ill fed louse eaten made him close his eyelids in a sudden spasm of despair and in the darkness he saw the brittle bright bodies of lice falling from the air and turning often as they fell
yes and it was not darkness that fell from the air
it was brightness
brightness falls from the air
he had not even remembered rightly nashs line
all the images it had awakened were false
his mind bred vermin
his thoughts were lice born of the sweat of sloth
he came back quickly along the colonnade towards the group of students
well then let her go and be damned to her
she could love some clean athlete who washed himself every morning to the waist and had black hair on his chest
let her
cranly had taken another dried fig from the supply in his pocket and was eating it slowly and noisily
temple sat on the pediment of a pillar leaning back his cap pulled down on his sleepy eyes
a squat young man came out of the porch a leather portfolio tucked under his armpit
he marched towards the group striking the flags with the heels of his boots and with the ferrule of his heavy umbrella
then raising the umbrella in salute he said to all  good evening sirs
he struck the flags again and tittered while his head trembled with a slight nervous movement
the tall consumptive student and dixon and okeeffe were speaking in irish and did not answer him
then turning to cranly he said  good evening particularly to you
he moved the umbrella in indication and tittered again
cranly who was still chewing the fig answered with loud movements of his jaws
good
yes
it is a good evening
the squat student looked at him seriously and shook his umbrella gently and reprovingly
i can see he said that you are about to make obvious remarks
um cranly answered holding out what remained of the half chewed fig and jerking it towards the squat students mouth in sign that he should eat
the squat student did not eat it but indulging his special humour said gravely still tittering and prodding his phrase with his umbrella  do you intend that
he broke off pointed bluntly to the munched pulp of the fig and said loudly  i allude to that
um cranly said as before
do you intend that now the squat student said as ipso facto or let us say as so to speak
dixon turned aside from his group saying  goggins was waiting for you glynn
he has gone round to the adelphi to look for you and moynihan
what have you there
he asked tapping the portfolio under glynns arm
examination papers glynn answered
i give them monthly examinations to see that they are profiting by my tuition
he also tapped the portfolio and coughed gently and smiled
tuition
said cranly rudely
i suppose you mean the barefooted children that are taught by a bloody ape like you
god help them
he bit off the rest of the fig and flung away the butt
i suffer little children to come unto me glynn said amiably
a bloody ape cranly repeated with emphasis and a blasphemous bloody ape
temple stood up and pushing past cranly addressed glynn  that phrase you said now he said is from the new testament about suffer the children to come to me
go to sleep again temple said okeeffe
very well then temple continued still addressing glynn and if jesus suffered the children to come why does the church send them all to hell if they die unbaptised
why is that
were you baptised yourself temple
the consumptive student asked
but why are they sent to hell if jesus said they were all to come
temple said his eyes searching glynns eyes
glynn coughed and said gently holding back with difficulty the nervous titter in his voice and moving his umbrella at every word  and as you remark if it is thus i ask emphatically whence comes this thusness
because the church is cruel like all old sinners temple said
are you quite orthodox on that point temple
dixon said suavely
saint augustine says that about unbaptised children going to hell temple answered because he was a cruel old sinner too
i bow to you dixon said but i had the impression that limbo existed for such cases
dont argue with him dixon cranly said brutally
dont talk to him or look at him
lead him home with a sugan the way youd lead a bleating goat
limbo
temple cried
thats a fine invention too
like hell
but with the unpleasantness left out dixon said
he turned smiling to the others and said  i think i am voicing the opinions of all present in saying so much
you are glynn said in a firm tone
on that point ireland is united
he struck the ferrule of his umbrella on the stone floor of the colonnade
hell temple said
i can respect that invention of the grey spouse of satan
hell is roman like the walls of the romans strong and ugly
but what is limbo
put him back into the perambulator cranly okeeffe called out
cranly made a swift step towards temple halted stamping his foot crying as if to a fowl  hoosh
temple moved away nimbly
do you know what limbo is
he cried
do you know what we call a notion like that in roscommon
hoosh
blast you
cranly cried clapping his hands
neither my arse nor my elbow
temple cried out scornfully
and thats what i call limbo
give us that stick here cranly said
he snatched the ashplant roughly from stephens hand and sprang down the steps but temple hearing him move in pursuit fled through the dusk like a wild creature nimble and fleetfooted
cranlys heavy boots were heard loudly charging across the quadrangle and then returning heavily foiled and spurning the gravel at each step
his step was angry and with an angry abrupt gesture he thrust the stick back into stephens hand
stephen felt that his anger had another cause but feigning patience touched his arm slightly and said quietly  cranly i told you i wanted to speak to you
come away
cranly looked at him for a few moments and asked  now
yes now stephen said
we cant speak here
come away
they crossed the quadrangle together without speaking
the bird call from siegfried whistled softly followed them from the steps of the porch
cranly turned and dixon who had whistled called out  where are you fellows off to
what about that game cranly
they parleyed in shouts across the still air about a game of billiards to be played in the adelphi hotel
stephen walked on alone and out into the quiet of kildare street opposite maples hotel he stood to wait patient again
the name of the hotel a colourless polished wood and its colourless front stung him like a glance of polite disdain
he stared angrily back at the softly lit drawingroom of the hotel in which he imagined the sleek lives of the patricians of ireland housed in calm
they thought of army commissions and land agents peasants greeted them along the roads in the country they knew the names of certain french dishes and gave orders to jarvies in highpitched provincial voices which pierced through their skintight accents
how could he hit their conscience or how cast his shadow over the imaginations of their daughters before their squires begat upon them that they might breed a race less ignoble than their own
and under the deepened dusk he felt the thoughts and desires of the race to which he belonged flitting like bats across the dark country lanes under trees by the edges of streams and near the poolmottled bogs
a woman had waited in the doorway as davin had passed by at night and offering him a cup of milk had all but wooed him to her bed for davin had the mild eyes of one who could be secret
but him no womans eyes had wooed
his arm was taken in a strong grip and cranlys voice said  let us eke go
they walked southward in silence
then cranly said  that blithering idiot temple
i swear to moses do you know that ill be the death of that fellow one time
but his voice was no longer angry and stephen wondered was he thinking of her greeting to him under the porch
they turned to the left and walked on as before
when they had gone on so for some time stephen said  cranly i had an unpleasant quarrel this evening
with your people
cranly asked
with my mother
about religion
yes stephen answered
after a pause cranly asked  what age is your mother
not old stephen said
she wishes me to make my easter duty
and will you
i will not stephen said
why not
cranly said
i will not serve answered stephen
that remark was made before cranly said calmly
it is made behind now said stephen hotly
cranly pressed stephens arm saying  go easy my dear man
youre an excitable bloody man do you know
he laughed nervously as he spoke and looking up into stephens face with moved and friendly eyes said  do you know that you are an excitable man
i daresay i am said stephen laughing also
their minds lately estranged seemed suddenly to have been drawn closer one to the other
do you believe in the eucharist
cranly asked
i do not stephen said
do you disbelieve then
i neither believe in it nor disbelieve in it stephen answered
many persons have doubts even religious persons yet they overcome them or put them aside cranly said
are your doubts on that point too strong
i do not wish to overcome them stephen answered
cranly embarrassed for a moment took another fig from his pocket and was about to eat it when stephen said  dont please
you cannot discuss this question with your mouth full of chewed fig
cranly examined the fig by the light of a lamp under which he halted
then he smelt it with both nostrils bit a tiny piece spat it out and threw the fig rudely into the gutter
addressing it as it lay he said  depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire
taking stephens arm he went on again and said  do you not fear that those words may be spoken to you on the day of judgement
what is offered me on the other hand
stephen asked
an eternity of bliss in the company of the dean of studies
remember cranly said that he would be glorified
ay stephen said somewhat bitterly bright agile impassible and above all subtle
it is a curious thing do you know cranly said dispassionately how your mind is supersaturated with the religion in which you say you disbelieve
did you believe in it when you were at school
i bet you did
i did stephen answered
and were you happier then
cranly asked softly happier than you are now for instance
often happy stephen said and often unhappy
i was someone else then
how someone else
what do you mean by that statement
i mean said stephen that i was not myself as i am now as i had to become
not as you are now not as you had to become cranly repeated
let me ask you a question
do you love your mother
stephen shook his head slowly
i dont know what your words mean he said simply
have you never loved anyone
cranly asked
do you mean women
i am not speaking of that cranly said in a colder tone
i ask you if you ever felt love towards anyone or anything
stephen walked on beside his friend staring gloomily at the footpath
i tried to love god he said at length
it seems now i failed
it is very difficult
i tried to unite my will with the will of god instant by instant
in that i did not always fail
i could perhaps do that still  cranly cut him short by asking  has your mother had a happy life
how do i know
stephen said
how many children had she
nine or ten stephen answered
some died
was your father cranly interrupted himself for an instant and then said i dont want to pry into your family affairs
but was your father what is called welltodo
i mean when you were growing up
yes stephen said
what was he
cranly asked after a pause
stephen began to enumerate glibly his fathers attributes
a medical student an oarsman a tenor an amateur actor a shouting politician a small landlord a small investor a drinker a good fellow a storyteller somebodys secretary something in a distillery a taxgatherer a bankrupt and at present a praiser of his own past
cranly laughed tightening his grip on stephens arm and said  the distillery is damn good
is there anything else you want to know
stephen asked
are you in good circumstances at present
do i look it
stephen asked bluntly
so then cranly went on musingly you were born in the lap of luxury
he used the phrase broadly and loudly as he often used technical expressions as if he wished his hearer to understand that they were used by him without conviction
your mother must have gone through a good deal of suffering he said then
would you not try to save her from suffering more even if or would you
if i could stephen said that would cost me very little
then do so cranly said
do as she wishes you to do
what is it for you
you disbelieve in it
it is a form nothing else
and you will set her mind at rest
he ceased and as stephen did not reply remained silent
then as if giving utterance to the process of his own thought he said  whatever else is unsure in this stinking dunghill of a world a mothers love is not
your mother brings you into the world carries you first in her body
what do we know about what she feels
but whatever she feels it at least must be real
it must be
what are our ideas or ambitions
play
ideas
why that bloody bleating goat temple has ideas
maccann has ideas too
every jackass going the roads thinks he has ideas
stephen who had been listening to the unspoken speech behind the words said with assumed carelessness  pascal if i remember rightly would not suffer his mother to kiss him as he feared the contact of her sex
pascal was a pig said cranly
aloysius gonzaga i think was of the same mind stephen said
and he was another pig then said cranly
the church calls him a saint stephen objected
i dont care a flaming damn what anyone calls him cranly said rudely and flatly
i call him a pig
stephen preparing the words neatly in his mind continued  jesus too seems to have treated his mother with scant courtesy in public but suarez a jesuit theologian and spanish gentleman has apologised for him
did the idea ever occur to you cranly asked that jesus was not what he pretended to be
the first person to whom that idea occurred stephen answered was jesus himself
i mean cranly said hardening in his speech did the idea ever occur to you that he was himself a conscious hypocrite what he called the jews of his time a whited sepulchre
or to put it more plainly that he was a blackguard
that idea never occurred to me stephen answered
but i am curious to know are you trying to make a convert of me or a pervert of yourself
he turned towards his friends face and saw there a raw smile which some force of will strove to make finely significant
cranly asked suddenly in a plain sensible tone  tell me the truth
were you at all shocked by what i said
somewhat stephen said
and why were you shocked cranly pressed on in the same tone if you feel sure that our religion is false and that jesus was not the son of god
i am not at all sure of it stephen said
he is more like a son of god than a son of mary
and is that why you will not communicate cranly asked because you are not sure of that too because you feel that the host too may be the body and blood of the son of god and not a wafer of bread
and because you fear that it may be
yes stephen said quietly i feel that and i also fear it
i see cranly said
stephen struck by his tone of closure reopened the discussion at once by saying  i fear many things dogs horses firearms the sea thunderstorms machinery the country roads at night
but why do you fear a bit of bread
i imagine stephen said that there is a malevolent reality behind those things i say i fear
do you fear then cranly asked that the god of the roman catholics would strike you dead and damn you if you made a sacrilegious communion
the god of the roman catholics could do that now stephen said
i fear more than that the chemical action which would be set up in my soul by a false homage to a symbol behind which are massed twenty centuries of authority and veneration
would you cranly asked in extreme danger commit that particular sacrilege
for instance if you lived in the penal days
i cannot answer for the past stephen replied
possibly not
then said cranly you do not intend to become a protestant
i said that i had lost the faith stephen answered but not that i had lost selfrespect
what kind of liberation would that be to forsake an absurdity which is logical and coherent and to embrace one which is illogical and incoherent
they had walked on towards the township of pembroke and now as they went on slowly along the avenues the trees and the scattered lights in the villas soothed their minds
the air of wealth and repose diffused about them seemed to comfort their neediness
behind a hedge of laurel a light glimmered in the window of a kitchen and the voice of a servant was heard singing as she sharpened knives
she sang in short broken bars  rosie ogrady  cranly stopped to listen saying  mulier cantat  the soft beauty of the latin word touched with an enchanting touch the dark of the evening with a touch fainter and more persuading than the touch of music or of a womans hand
the strife of their minds was quelled
the figure of a woman as she appears in the liturgy of the church passed silently through the darkness a whiterobed figure small and slender as a boy and with a falling girdle
her voice frail and high as a boys was heard intoning from a distant choir the first words of a woman which pierce the gloom and clamour of the first chanting of the passion  et tu cum jesu galilo eras  and all hearts were touched and turned to her voice shining like a young star shining clearer as the voice intoned the proparoxyton and more faintly as the cadence died
the singing ceased
they went on together cranly repeating in strongly stressed rhythm the end of the refrain      and when we are married     o how happy well be     for i love sweet rosie ogrady     and rosie ogrady loves me
theres real poetry for you he said
theres real love
he glanced sideways at stephen with a strange smile and said  do you consider that poetry
or do you know what the words mean
i want to see rosie first said stephen
shes easy to find cranly said
his hat had come down on his forehead
he shoved it back and in the shadow of the trees stephen saw his pale face framed by the dark and his large dark eyes
yes
his face was handsome and his body was strong and hard
he had spoken of a mothers love
he felt then the sufferings of women the weaknesses of their bodies and souls and would shield them with a strong and resolute arm and bow his mind to them
away then it is time to go
a voice spoke softly to stephens lonely heart bidding him go and telling him that his friendship was coming to an end
yes he would go
he could not strive against another
he knew his part
probably i shall go away he said
where
cranly asked
where i can stephen said
yes cranly said
it might be difficult for you to live here now
but is it that makes you go
i have to go stephen answered
because cranly continued you need not look upon yourself as driven away if you do not wish to go or as a heretic or an outlaw
there are many good believers who think as you do
would that surprise you
the church is not the stone building nor even the clergy and their dogmas
it is the whole mass of those born into it
i dont know what you wish to do in life
is it what you told me the night we were standing outside harcourt street station
yes stephen said smiling in spite of himself at cranlys way of remembering thoughts in connexion with places
the night you spent half an hour wrangling with doherty about the shortest way from sallygap to larras
pothead
cranly said with calm contempt
what does he know about the way from sallygap to larras
or what does he know about anything for that matter
and the big slobbering washingpot head of him
he broke into a loud long laugh
well
stephen said
do you remember the rest
what you said is it
cranly asked
yes i remember it
to discover the mode of life or of art whereby your spirit could express itself in unfettered freedom
stephen raised his hat in acknowledgement
freedom
cranly repeated
but you are not free enough yet to commit a sacrilege
tell me would you rob
i would beg first stephen said
and if you got nothing would you rob
you wish me to say stephen answered that the rights of property are provisional and that in certain circumstances it is not unlawful to rob
everyone would act in that belief
so i will not make you that answer
apply to the jesuit theologian juan mariana de talavera who will also explain to you in what circumstances you may lawfully kill your king and whether you had better hand him his poison in a goblet or smear it for him upon his robe or his saddlebow
ask me rather would i suffer others to rob me or if they did would i call down upon them what i believe is called the chastisement of the secular arm
and would you
i think stephen said it would pain me as much to do so as to be robbed
i see cranly said
he produced his match and began to clean the crevice between two teeth
then he said carelessly  tell me for example would you deflower a virgin
excuse me stephen said politely is that not the ambition of most young gentlemen
what then is your point of view
cranly asked
his last phrase sour smelling as the smoke of charcoal and disheartening excited stephens brain over which its fumes seemed to brood
look here cranly he said
you have asked me what i would do and what i would not do
i will tell you what i will do and what i will not do
i will not serve that in which i no longer believe whether it call itself my home my fatherland or my church and i will try to express myself in some mode of life or art as freely as i can and as wholly as i can using for my defence the only arms i allow myself to usesilence exile and cunning
cranly seized his arm and steered him round so as to lead him back towards leeson park
he laughed almost slily and pressed stephens arm with an elders affection
cunning indeed
he said
is it you
you poor poet you
and you made me confess to you stephen said thrilled by his touch as i have confessed to you so many other things have i not
yes my child cranly said still gaily
you made me confess the fears that i have
but i will tell you also what i do not fear
i do not fear to be alone or to be spurned for another or to leave whatever i have to leave
and i am not afraid to make a mistake even a great mistake a lifelong mistake and perhaps as long as eternity too
cranly now grave again slowed his pace and said  alone quite alone
you have no fear of that
and you know what that word means
not only to be separate from all others but to have not even one friend
i will take the risk said stephen
and not to have any one person cranly said who would be more than a friend more even than the noblest and truest friend a man ever had
his words seemed to have struck some deep chord in his own nature
had he spoken of himself of himself as he was or wished to be
stephen watched his face for some moments in silence
a cold sadness was there
he had spoken of himself of his own loneliness which he feared
of whom are you speaking
stephen asked at length
cranly did not answer
march 
long talk with cranly on the subject of my revolt
he had his grand manner on
i supple and suave
attacked me on the score of love for ones mother
tried to imagine his mother cannot
told me once in a moment of thoughtlessness his father was sixtyone when he was born
can see him
strong farmer type
pepper and salt suit
square feet
unkempt grizzled beard
probably attends coursing matches
pays his dues regularly but not plentifully to father dwyer of larras
sometimes talks to girls after nightfall
but his mother
very young or very old
hardly the first
if so cranly would not have spoken as he did
old then
probably and neglected
hence cranlys despair of soul the child of exhausted loins
march  morning
thought this in bed last night but was too lazy and free to add to it
free yes
the exhausted loins are those of elizabeth and zacchary
then he is the precursor
item he eats chiefly belly bacon and dried figs
read locusts and wild honey
also when thinking of him saw always a stern severed head or death mask as if outlined on a grey curtain or veronica
decollation they call it in the fold
puzzled for the moment by saint john at the latin gate
what do i see
a decollated precursor trying to pick the lock
march  night
free
soul free and fancy free
let the dead bury the dead
ay
and let the dead marry the dead
march 
in company with lynch followed a sizeable hospital nurse
lynchs idea
dislike it
two lean hungry greyhounds walking after a heifer
march 
have not seen her since that night
unwell
sits at the fire perhaps with mammas shawl on her shoulders
but not peevish
a nice bowl of gruel
wont you now
march 
began with a discussion with my mother
subject bvm
handicapped by my sex and youth
to escape held up relations between jesus and papa against those between mary and her son
said religion was not a lyingin hospital
mother indulgent
said i have a queer mind and have read too much
not true
have read little and understood less
then she said i would come back to faith because i had a restless mind
this means to leave church by backdoor of sin and reenter through the skylight of repentance
cannot repent
told her so and asked for sixpence
got threepence
then went to college
other wrangle with little round head rogues eye ghezzi
this time about bruno the nolan
began in italian and ended in pidgin english
he said bruno was a terrible heretic
i said he was terribly burned
he agreed to this with some sorrow
then gave me recipe for what he calls risotto alla bergamasca
when he pronounces a soft o he protrudes his full carnal lips as if he kissed the vowel
has he
and could he repent
yes he could and cry two round rogues tears one from each eye
crossing stephens that is my green remembered that his countrymen and not mine had invented what cranly the other night called our religion
a quartet of them soldiers of the ninetyseventh infantry regiment sat at the foot of the cross and tossed up dice for the overcoat of the crucified
went to library
tried to read three reviews
useless
she is not out yet
am i alarmed
about what
that she will never be out again
blake wrote      i wonder if william bond will die     for assuredly he is very ill   alas poor william
i was once at a diorama in rotunda
at the end were pictures of big nobs
among them william ewart gladstone just then dead
orchestra played o willie we have missed you  a race of clodhoppers
march  morning
a troubled night of dreams
want to get them off my chest
a long curving gallery
from the floor ascend pillars of dark vapours
it is peopled by the images of fabulous kings set in stone
their hands are folded upon their knees in token of weariness and their eyes are darkened for the errors of men go up before them for ever as dark vapours
strange figures advance as from a cave
they are not as tall as men
one does not seem to stand quite apart from another
their faces are phosphorescent with darker streaks
they peer at me and their eyes seem to ask me something
they do not speak
march 
this evening cranly was in the porch of the library proposing a problem to dixon and her brother
a mother let her child fall into the nile
still harping on the mother
a crocodile seized the child
mother asked it back
crocodile said all right if she told him what he was going to do with the child eat it or not eat it
this mentality lepidus would say is indeed bred out of your mud by the operation of your sun
and mine
is it not too
then into nile mud with it
april 
disapprove of this last phrase
april 
saw her drinking tea and eating cakes in johnstons mooney and obriens
rather lynxeyed lynch saw her as we passed
he tells me cranly was invited there by brother
did he bring his crocodile
is he the shining light now
well i discovered him
i protest i did
shining quietly behind a bushel of wicklow bran
april 
met davin at the cigar shop opposite findlaters church
he was in a black sweater and had a hurley stick
asked me was it true i was going away and why
told him the shortest way to tara was via holyhead
just then my father came up
introduction
father polite and observant
asked davin if he might offer him some refreshment
davin could not was going to a meeting
when we came away father told me he had a good honest eye
asked me why i did not join a rowing club
i pretended to think it over
told me then how he broke pennyfeathers heart
wants me to read law
says i was cut out for that
more mud more crocodiles
april 
wild spring
scudding clouds
o life
dark stream of swirling bogwater on which appletrees have cast down their delicate flowers
eyes of girls among the leaves
girls demure and romping
all fair or auburn no dark ones
they blush better
houpla
april 
certainly she remembers the past
lynch says all women do
then she remembers the time of her childhoodand mine if i was ever a child
the past is consumed in the present and the present is living only because it brings forth the future
statues of women if lynch be right should always be fully draped one hand of the woman feeling regretfully her own hinder parts
april  later
michael robartes remembers forgotten beauty and when his arms wrap her round he presses in his arms the loveliness which has long faded from the world
not this
not at all
i desire to press in my arms the loveliness which has not yet come into the world
april 
faintly under the heavy night through the silence of the city which has turned from dreams to dreamless sleep as a weary lover whom no caresses move the sound of hoofs upon the road
not so faintly now as they come near the bridge and in a moment as they pass the darkened windows the silence is cloven by alarm as by an arrow
they are heard now far away hoofs that shine amid the heavy night as gems hurrying beyond the sleeping fields to what journeys endwhat heartbearing what tidings
april 
read what i wrote last night
vague words for a vague emotion
would she like it
i think so
then i should have to like it also
april 
that tundish has been on my mind for a long time
i looked it up and find it english and good old blunt english too
damn the dean of studies and his funnel
what did he come here for to teach us his own language or to learn it from us
damn him one way or the other
april 
john alphonsus mulrennan has just returned from the west of ireland
european and asiatic papers please copy
he told us he met an old man there in a mountain cabin
old man had red eyes and short pipe
old man spoke irish
mulrennan spoke irish
then old man and mulrennan spoke english
mulrennan spoke to him about universe and stars
old man sat listened smoked spat
then said  ah there must be terrible queer creatures at the latter end of the world
i fear him
i fear his redrimmed horny eyes
it is with him i must struggle all through this night till day come till he or i lie dead gripping him by the sinewy throat till till what
till he yield to me
no
i mean no harm
april 
met her today point blank in grafton street
the crowd brought us together
we both stopped
she asked me why i never came said she had heard all sorts of stories about me
this was only to gain time
asked me was i writing poems
about whom
i asked her
this confused her more and i felt sorry and mean
turned off that valve at once and opened the spiritualheroic refrigerating apparatus invented and patented in all countries by dante alighieri
talked rapidly of myself and my plans
in the midst of it unluckily i made a sudden gesture of a revolutionary nature
i must have looked like a fellow throwing a handful of peas into the air
people began to look at us
she shook hands a moment after and in going away said she hoped i would do what i said
now i call that friendly dont you
yes i liked her today
a little or much
dont know
i liked her and it seems a new feeling to me
then in that case all the rest all that i thought i thought and all that i felt i felt all the rest before now in fact o give it up old chap
sleep it off
april 
away
away
the spell of arms and voices the white arms of roads their promise of close embraces and the black arms of tall ships that stand against the moon their tale of distant nations
they are held out to say we are alonecome
and the voices say with them we are your kinsmen
and the air is thick with their company as they call to me their kinsman making ready to go shaking the wings of their exultant and terrible youth
april 
mother is putting my new secondhand clothes in order
she prays now she says that i may learn in my own life and away from home and friends what the heart is and what it feels
amen
so be it
welcome o life
i go to encounter for the millionth time the reality of experience and to forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race
april 
old father old artificer stand me now and ever in good stead
dublin 
trieste 
 cover     dubliners  by james joyce   contents   the sisters  an encounter  araby  eveline  after the race  two gallants  the boarding house  a little cloud  counterparts  clay  a painful case  ivy day in the committee room  a mother  grace  the dead     the sisters   there was no hope for him this time it was the third stroke
night after night i had passed the house it was vacation time and studied the lighted square of window and night after night i had found it lighted in the same way faintly and evenly
if he was dead i thought i would see the reflection of candles on the darkened blind for i knew that two candles must be set at the head of a corpse
he had often said to me i am not long for this world and i had thought his words idle
now i knew they were true
every night as i gazed up at the window i said softly to myself the word paralysis
it had always sounded strangely in my ears like the word gnomon in the euclid and the word simony in the catechism
but now it sounded to me like the name of some maleficent and sinful being
it filled me with fear and yet i longed to be nearer to it and to look upon its deadly work
old cotter was sitting at the fire smoking when i came downstairs to supper
while my aunt was ladling out my stirabout he said as if returning to some former remark of his  no i wouldnt say he was exactly  but there was something queer  there was something uncanny about him
ill tell you my opinion  he began to puff at his pipe no doubt arranging his opinion in his mind
tiresome old fool
when we knew him first he used to be rather interesting talking of faints and worms but i soon grew tired of him and his endless stories about the distillery
i have my own theory about it he said
i think it was one of those  peculiar cases
but its hard to say  he began to puff again at his pipe without giving us his theory
my uncle saw me staring and said to me  well so your old friend is gone youll be sorry to hear  who said i
father flynn  is he dead  mr cotter here has just told us
he was passing by the house  i knew that i was under observation so i continued eating as if the news had not interested me
my uncle explained to old cotter
the youngster and he were great friends
the old chap taught him a great deal mind you and they say he had a great wish for him  god have mercy on his soul said my aunt piously
old cotter looked at me for a while
i felt that his little beady black eyes were examining me but i would not satisfy him by looking up from my plate
he returned to his pipe and finally spat rudely into the grate
i wouldnt like children of mine he said to have too much to say to a man like that  how do you mean mr cotter asked my aunt
what i mean is said old cotter its bad for children
my idea is let a young lad run about and play with young lads of his own age and not be am i right jack  thats my principle too said my uncle
let him learn to box his corner
thats what im always saying to that rosicrucian there take exercise
why when i was a nipper every morning of my life i had a cold bath winter and summer
and thats what stands to me now
education is all very fine and large mr cotter might take a pick of that leg mutton he added to my aunt
no no not for me said old cotter
my aunt brought the dish from the safe and put it on the table
but why do you think its not good for children mr cotter she asked
its bad for children said old cotter because their minds are so impressionable
when children see things like that you know it has an effect  i crammed my mouth with stirabout for fear i might give utterance to my anger
tiresome old rednosed imbecile
it was late when i fell asleep
though i was angry with old cotter for alluding to me as a child i puzzled my head to extract meaning from his unfinished sentences
in the dark of my room i imagined that i saw again the heavy grey face of the paralytic
i drew the blankets over my head and tried to think of christmas
but the grey face still followed me
it murmured and i understood that it desired to confess something
i felt my soul receding into some pleasant and vicious region and there again i found it waiting for me
it began to confess to me in a murmuring voice and i wondered why it smiled continually and why the lips were so moist with spittle
but then i remembered that it had died of paralysis and i felt that i too was smiling feebly as if to absolve the simoniac of his sin
the next morning after breakfast i went down to look at the little house in great britain street
it was an unassuming shop registered under the vague name of drapery
the drapery consisted mainly of childrens bootees and umbrellas and on ordinary days a notice used to hang in the window saying umbrellas recovered
no notice was visible now for the shutters were up
a crape bouquet was tied to the doorknocker with ribbon
two poor women and a telegram boy were reading the card pinned on the crape
i also approached and read       july st       the rev
james flynn formerly of s catherines      church meath street aged sixtyfive years
r
i p  the reading of the card persuaded me that he was dead and i was disturbed to find myself at check
had he not been dead i would have gone into the little dark room behind the shop to find him sitting in his armchair by the fire nearly smothered in his greatcoat
perhaps my aunt would have given me a packet of high toast for him and this present would have roused him from his stupefied doze
it was always i who emptied the packet into his black snuffbox for his hands trembled too much to allow him to do this without spilling half the snuff about the floor
even as he raised his large trembling hand to his nose little clouds of smoke dribbled through his fingers over the front of his coat
it may have been these constant showers of snuff which gave his ancient priestly garments their green faded look for the red handkerchief blackened as it always was with the snuffstains of a week with which he tried to brush away the fallen grains was quite inefficacious
i wished to go in and look at him but i had not the courage to knock
i walked away slowly along the sunny side of the street reading all the theatrical advertisements in the shopwindows as i went
i found it strange that neither i nor the day seemed in a mourning mood and i felt even annoyed at discovering in myself a sensation of freedom as if i had been freed from something by his death
i wondered at this for as my uncle had said the night before he had taught me a great deal
he had studied in the irish college in rome and he had taught me to pronounce latin properly
he had told me stories about the catacombs and about napoleon bonaparte and he had explained to me the meaning of the different ceremonies of the mass and of the different vestments worn by the priest
sometimes he had amused himself by putting difficult questions to me asking me what one should do in certain circumstances or whether such and such sins were mortal or venial or only imperfections
his questions showed me how complex and mysterious were certain institutions of the church which i had always regarded as the simplest acts
the duties of the priest towards the eucharist and towards the secrecy of the confessional seemed so grave to me that i wondered how anybody had ever found in himself the courage to undertake them and i was not surprised when he told me that the fathers of the church had written books as thick as the post office directory and as closely printed as the law notices in the newspaper elucidating all these intricate questions
often when i thought of this i could make no answer or only a very foolish and halting one upon which he used to smile and nod his head twice or thrice
sometimes he used to put me through the responses of the mass which he had made me learn by heart and as i pattered he used to smile pensively and nod his head now and then pushing huge pinches of snuff up each nostril alternately
when he smiled he used to uncover his big discoloured teeth and let his tongue lie upon his lower lipa habit which had made me feel uneasy in the beginning of our acquaintance before i knew him well
as i walked along in the sun i remembered old cotters words and tried to remember what had happened afterwards in the dream
i remembered that i had noticed long velvet curtains and a swinging lamp of antique fashion
i felt that i had been very far away in some land where the customs were strangein persia i thought
but i could not remember the end of the dream
in the evening my aunt took me with her to visit the house of mourning
it was after sunset but the windowpanes of the houses that looked to the west reflected the tawny gold of a great bank of clouds
nannie received us in the hall and as it would have been unseemly to have shouted at her my aunt shook hands with her for all
the old woman pointed upwards interrogatively and on my aunts nodding proceeded to toil up the narrow staircase before us her bowed head being scarcely above the level of the banisterrail
at the first landing she stopped and beckoned us forward encouragingly towards the open door of the deadroom
my aunt went in and the old woman seeing that i hesitated to enter began to beckon to me again repeatedly with her hand
i went in on tiptoe
the room through the lace end of the blind was suffused with dusky golden light amid which the candles looked like pale thin flames
he had been coffined
nannie gave the lead and we three knelt down at the foot of the bed
i pretended to pray but i could not gather my thoughts because the old womans mutterings distracted me
i noticed how clumsily her skirt was hooked at the back and how the heels of her cloth boots were trodden down all to one side
the fancy came to me that the old priest was smiling as he lay there in his coffin
but no
when we rose and went up to the head of the bed i saw that he was not smiling
there he lay solemn and copious vested as for the altar his large hands loosely retaining a chalice
his face was very truculent grey and massive with black cavernous nostrils and circled by a scanty white fur
there was a heavy odour in the roomthe flowers
we blessed ourselves and came away
in the little room downstairs we found eliza seated in his armchair in state
i groped my way towards my usual chair in the corner while nannie went to the sideboard and brought out a decanter of sherry and some wineglasses
she set these on the table and invited us to take a little glass of wine
then at her sisters bidding she filled out the sherry into the glasses and passed them to us
she pressed me to take some cream crackers also but i declined because i thought i would make too much noise eating them
she seemed to be somewhat disappointed at my refusal and went over quietly to the sofa where she sat down behind her sister
no one spoke we all gazed at the empty fireplace
my aunt waited until eliza sighed and then said  ah well hes gone to a better world  eliza sighed again and bowed her head in assent
my aunt fingered the stem of her wineglass before sipping a little
did he  peacefully she asked
oh quite peacefully maam said eliza
you couldnt tell when the breath went out of him
he had a beautiful death god be praised  and everything  father orourke was in with him a tuesday and anointed him and prepared him and all  he knew then  he was quite resigned  he looks quite resigned said my aunt
thats what the woman we had in to wash him said
she said he just looked as if he was asleep he looked that peaceful and resigned
no one would think hed make such a beautiful corpse  yes indeed said my aunt
she sipped a little more from her glass and said  well miss flynn at any rate it must be a great comfort for you to know that you did all you could for him
you were both very kind to him i must say  eliza smoothed her dress over her knees
ah poor james she said
god knows we done all we could as poor as we arewe wouldnt see him want anything while he was in it  nannie had leaned her head against the sofapillow and seemed about to fall asleep
theres poor nannie said eliza looking at her shes wore out
all the work we had she and me getting in the woman to wash him and then laying him out and then the coffin and then arranging about the mass in the chapel
only for father orourke i dont know what wed have done at all
it was him brought us all them flowers and them two candlesticks out of the chapel and wrote out the notice for the freemans general and took charge of all the papers for the cemetery and poor jamess insurance  wasnt that good of him said my aunt
eliza closed her eyes and shook her head slowly
ah theres no friends like the old friends she said when all is said and done no friends that a body can trust  indeed thats true said my aunt
and im sure now that hes gone to his eternal reward he wont forget you and all your kindness to him  ah poor james said eliza
he was no great trouble to us
you wouldnt hear him in the house any more than now
still i know hes gone and all to that  its when its all over that youll miss him said my aunt
i know that said eliza
i wont be bringing him in his cup of beeftea any more nor you maam sending him his snuff
ah poor james  she stopped as if she were communing with the past and then said shrewdly  mind you i noticed there was something queer coming over him latterly
whenever id bring in his soup to him there id find him with his breviary fallen to the floor lying back in the chair and his mouth open  she laid a finger against her nose and frowned then she continued  but still and all he kept on saying that before the summer was over hed go out for a drive one fine day just to see the old house again where we were all born down in irishtown and take me and nannie with him
if we could only get one of them newfangled carriages that makes no noise that father orourke told him about them with the rheumatic wheels for the day cheaphe said at johnny rushs over the way there and drive out the three of us together of a sunday evening
he had his mind set on that poor james  the lord have mercy on his soul said my aunt
eliza took out her handkerchief and wiped her eyes with it
then she put it back again in her pocket and gazed into the empty grate for some time without speaking
he was too scrupulous always she said
the duties of the priesthood was too much for him
and then his life was you might say crossed  yes said my aunt
he was a disappointed man
you could see that  a silence took possession of the little room and under cover of it i approached the table and tasted my sherry and then returned quietly to my chair in the corner
eliza seemed to have fallen into a deep revery
we waited respectfully for her to break the silence and after a long pause she said slowly  it was that chalice he broke that was the beginning of it
of course they say it was all right that it contained nothing i mean
but still
they say it was the boys fault
but poor james was so nervous god be merciful to him  and was that it said my aunt
i heard something  eliza nodded
that affected his mind she said
after that he began to mope by himself talking to no one and wandering about by himself
so one night he was wanted for to go on a call and they couldnt find him anywhere
they looked high up and low down and still they couldnt see a sight of him anywhere
so then the clerk suggested to try the chapel
so then they got the keys and opened the chapel and the clerk and father orourke and another priest that was there brought in a light for to look for him and what do you think but there he was sitting up by himself in the dark in his confessionbox wideawake and laughinglike softly to himself  she stopped suddenly as if to listen
i too listened but there was no sound in the house and i knew that the old priest was lying still in his coffin as we had seen him solemn and truculent in death an idle chalice on his breast
eliza resumed  wideawake and laughinglike to himself
so then of course when they saw that that made them think that there was something gone wrong with him     an encounter   it was joe dillon who introduced the wild west to us
he had a little library made up of old numbers of the union jack pluck and the halfpenny marvel
every evening after school we met in his back garden and arranged indian battles
he and his fat young brother leo the idler held the loft of the stable while we tried to carry it by storm or we fought a pitched battle on the grass
but however well we fought we never won siege or battle and all our bouts ended with joe dillons war dance of victory
his parents went to eightoclock mass every morning in gardiner street and the peaceful odour of mrs dillon was prevalent in the hall of the house
but he played too fiercely for us who were younger and more timid
he looked like some kind of an indian when he capered round the garden an old teacosy on his head beating a tin with his fist and yelling  ya
yaka yaka yaka  everyone was incredulous when it was reported that he had a vocation for the priesthood
nevertheless it was true
a spirit of unruliness diffused itself among us and under its influence differences of culture and constitution were waived
we banded ourselves together some boldly some in jest and some almost in fear and of the number of these latter the reluctant indians who were afraid to seem studious or lacking in robustness i was one
the adventures related in the literature of the wild west were remote from my nature but at least they opened doors of escape
i liked better some american detective stories which were traversed from time to time by unkempt fierce and beautiful girls
though there was nothing wrong in these stories and though their intention was sometimes literary they were circulated secretly at school
one day when father butler was hearing the four pages of roman history clumsy leo dillon was discovered with a copy of the halfpenny marvel
this page or this page
this page
now dillon up
hardly had the day go on
what day
hardly had the day dawned have you studied it
what have you there in your pocket  everyones heart palpitated as leo dillon handed up the paper and everyone assumed an innocent face
father butler turned over the pages frowning
what is this rubbish he said
the apache chief is this what you read instead of studying your roman history
let me not find any more of this wretched stuff in this college
the man who wrote it i suppose was some wretched fellow who writes these things for a drink
im surprised at boys like you educated reading such stuff
i could understand it if you were  national school boys
now dillon i advise you strongly get at your work or  this rebuke during the sober hours of school paled much of the glory of the wild west for me and the confused puffy face of leo dillon awakened one of my consciences
but when the restraining influence of the school was at a distance i began to hunger again for wild sensations for the escape which those chronicles of disorder alone seemed to offer me
the mimic warfare of the evening became at last as wearisome to me as the routine of school in the morning because i wanted real adventures to happen to myself
but real adventures i reflected do not happen to people who remain at home they must be sought abroad
the summer holidays were near at hand when i made up my mind to break out of the weariness of schoollife for one day at least
with leo dillon and a boy named mahony i planned a days miching
each of us saved up sixpence
we were to meet at ten in the morning on the canal bridge
mahonys big sister was to write an excuse for him and leo dillon was to tell his brother to say he was sick
we arranged to go along the wharf road until we came to the ships then to cross in the ferryboat and walk out to see the pigeon house
leo dillon was afraid we might meet father butler or someone out of the college but mahony asked very sensibly what would father butler be doing out at the pigeon house
we were reassured and i brought the first stage of the plot to an end by collecting sixpence from the other two at the same time showing them my own sixpence
when we were making the last arrangements on the eve we were all vaguely excited
we shook hands laughing and mahony said  till tomorrow mates  that night i slept badly
in the morning i was firstcomer to the bridge as i lived nearest
i hid my books in the long grass near the ashpit at the end of the garden where nobody ever came and hurried along the canal bank
it was a mild sunny morning in the first week of june
i sat up on the coping of the bridge admiring my frail canvas shoes which i had diligently pipeclayed overnight and watching the docile horses pulling a tramload of business people up the hill
all the branches of the tall trees which lined the mall were gay with little light green leaves and the sunlight slanted through them on to the water
the granite stone of the bridge was beginning to be warm and i began to pat it with my hands in time to an air in my head
i was very happy
when i had been sitting there for five or ten minutes i saw mahonys grey suit approaching
he came up the hill smiling and clambered up beside me on the bridge
while we were waiting he brought out the catapult which bulged from his inner pocket and explained some improvements which he had made in it
i asked him why he had brought it and he told me he had brought it to have some gas with the birds
mahony used slang freely and spoke of father butler as old bunser
we waited on for a quarter of an hour more but still there was no sign of leo dillon
mahony at last jumped down and said  come along
i knew fattyd funk it  and his sixpence i said
thats forfeit said mahony
and so much the better for usa bob and a tanner instead of a bob  we walked along the north strand road till we came to the vitriol works and then turned to the right along the wharf road
mahony began to play the indian as soon as we were out of public sight
he chased a crowd of ragged girls brandishing his unloaded catapult and when two ragged boys began out of chivalry to fling stones at us he proposed that we should charge them
i objected that the boys were too small and so we walked on the ragged troop screaming after us swaddlers
swaddlers thinking that we were protestants because mahony who was darkcomplexioned wore the silver badge of a cricket club in his cap
when we came to the smoothing iron we arranged a siege but it was a failure because you must have at least three
we revenged ourselves on leo dillon by saying what a funk he was and guessing how many he would get at three oclock from mr ryan
we came then near the river
we spent a long time walking about the noisy streets flanked by high stone walls watching the working of cranes and engines and often being shouted at for our immobility by the drivers of groaning carts
it was noon when we reached the quays and as all the labourers seemed to be eating their lunches we bought two big currant buns and sat down to eat them on some metal piping beside the river
we pleased ourselves with the spectacle of dublins commercethe barges signalled from far away by their curls of woolly smoke the brown fishing fleet beyond ringsend the big white sailingvessel which was being discharged on the opposite quay
mahony said it would be right skit to run away to sea on one of those big ships and even i looking at the high masts saw or imagined the geography which had been scantily dosed to me at school gradually taking substance under my eyes
school and home seemed to recede from us and their influences upon us seemed to wane
we crossed the liffey in the ferryboat paying our toll to be transported in the company of two labourers and a little jew with a bag
we were serious to the point of solemnity but once during the short voyage our eyes met and we laughed
when we landed we watched the discharging of the graceful threemaster which we had observed from the other quay
some bystander said that she was a norwegian vessel
i went to the stern and tried to decipher the legend upon it but failing to do so i came back and examined the foreign sailors to see had any of them green eyes for i had some confused notion
the sailors eyes were blue and grey and even black
the only sailor whose eyes could have been called green was a tall man who amused the crowd on the quay by calling out cheerfully every time the planks fell  all right
all right  when we were tired of this sight we wandered slowly into ringsend
the day had grown sultry and in the windows of the grocers shops musty biscuits lay bleaching
we bought some biscuits and chocolate which we ate sedulously as we wandered through the squalid streets where the families of the fishermen live
we could find no dairy and so we went into a hucksters shop and bought a bottle of raspberry lemonade each
refreshed by this mahony chased a cat down a lane but the cat escaped into a wide field
we both felt rather tired and when we reached the field we made at once for a sloping bank over the ridge of which we could see the dodder
it was too late and we were too tired to carry out our project of visiting the pigeon house
we had to be home before four oclock lest our adventure should be discovered
mahony looked regretfully at his catapult and i had to suggest going home by train before he regained any cheerfulness
the sun went in behind some clouds and left us to our jaded thoughts and the crumbs of our provisions
there was nobody but ourselves in the field
when we had lain on the bank for some time without speaking i saw a man approaching from the far end of the field
i watched him lazily as i chewed one of those green stems on which girls tell fortunes
he came along by the bank slowly
he walked with one hand upon his hip and in the other hand he held a stick with which he tapped the turf lightly
he was shabbily dressed in a suit of greenishblack and wore what we used to call a jerry hat with a high crown
he seemed to be fairly old for his moustache was ashengrey
when he passed at our feet he glanced up at us quickly and then continued his way
we followed him with our eyes and saw that when he had gone on for perhaps fifty paces he turned about and began to retrace his steps
he walked towards us very slowly always tapping the ground with his stick so slowly that i thought he was looking for something in the grass
he stopped when he came level with us and bade us goodday
we answered him and he sat down beside us on the slope slowly and with great care
he began to talk of the weather saying that it would be a very hot summer and adding that the seasons had changed greatly since he was a boya long time ago
he said that the happiest time of ones life was undoubtedly ones schoolboy days and that he would give anything to be young again
while he expressed these sentiments which bored us a little we kept silent
then he began to talk of school and of books
he asked us whether we had read the poetry of thomas moore or the works of sir walter scott and lord lytton
i pretended that i had read every book he mentioned so that in the end he said  ah i can see you are a bookworm like myself
now he added pointing to mahony who was regarding us with open eyes he is different he goes in for games  he said he had all sir walter scotts works and all lord lyttons works at home and never tired of reading them
of course he said there were some of lord lyttons works which boys couldnt read mahony asked why couldnt boys read thema question which agitated and pained me because i was afraid the man would think i was as stupid as mahony
the man however only smiled
i saw that he had great gaps in his mouth between his yellow teeth
then he asked us which of us had the most sweethearts
mahony mentioned lightly that he had three totties
the man asked me how many had i i answered that i had none
he did not believe me and said he was sure i must have one
i was silent
tell us said mahony pertly to the man how many have you yourself  the man smiled as before and said that when he was our age he had lots of sweethearts
every boy he said has a little sweetheart  his attitude on this point struck me as strangely liberal in a man of his age
in my heart i thought that what he said about boys and sweethearts was reasonable
but i disliked the words in his mouth and i wondered why he shivered once or twice as if he feared something or felt a sudden chill
as he proceeded i noticed that his accent was good
he began to speak to us about girls saying what nice soft hair they had and how soft their hands were and how all girls were not so good as they seemed to be if one only knew
there was nothing he liked he said so much as looking at a nice young girl at her nice white hands and her beautiful soft hair
he gave me the impression that he was repeating something which he had learned by heart or that magnetised by some words of his own speech his mind was slowly circling round and round in the same orbit
at times he spoke as if he were simply alluding to some fact that everybody knew and at times he lowered his voice and spoke mysteriously as if he were telling us something secret which he did not wish others to overhear
he repeated his phrases over and over again varying them and surrounding them with his monotonous voice
i continued to gaze towards the foot of the slope listening to him
after a long while his monologue paused
he stood up slowly saying that he had to leave us for a minute or so a few minutes and without changing the direction of my gaze i saw him walking slowly away from us towards the near end of the field
we remained silent when he had gone
after a silence of a few minutes i heard mahony exclaim  i say
look what hes doing  as i neither answered nor raised my eyes mahony exclaimed again  i say hes a queer old josser  in case he asks us for our names i said let you be murphy and ill be smith  we said nothing further to each other
i was still considering whether i would go away or not when the man came back and sat down beside us again
hardly had he sat down when mahony catching sight of the cat which had escaped him sprang up and pursued her across the field
the man and i watched the chase
the cat escaped once more and mahony began to throw stones at the wall she had escaladed
desisting from this he began to wander about the far end of the field aimlessly
after an interval the man spoke to me
he said that my friend was a very rough boy and asked did he get whipped often at school
i was going to reply indignantly that we were not national school boys to be whipped as he called it but i remained silent
he began to speak on the subject of chastising boys
his mind as if magnetised again by his speech seemed to circle slowly round and round its new centre
he said that when boys were that kind they ought to be whipped and well whipped
when a boy was rough and unruly there was nothing would do him any good but a good sound whipping
a slap on the hand or a box on the ear was no good what he wanted was to get a nice warm whipping
i was surprised at this sentiment and involuntarily glanced up at his face
as i did so i met the gaze of a pair of bottlegreen eyes peering at me from under a twitching forehead
i turned my eyes away again
the man continued his monologue
he seemed to have forgotten his recent liberalism
he said that if ever he found a boy talking to girls or having a girl for a sweetheart he would whip him and whip him and that would teach him not to be talking to girls
and if a boy had a girl for a sweetheart and told lies about it then he would give him such a whipping as no boy ever got in this world
he said that there was nothing in this world he would like so well as that
he described to me how he would whip such a boy as if he were unfolding some elaborate mystery
he would love that he said better than anything in this world and his voice as he led me monotonously through the mystery grew almost affectionate and seemed to plead with me that i should understand him
i waited till his monologue paused again
then i stood up abruptly
lest i should betray my agitation i delayed a few moments pretending to fix my shoe properly and then saying that i was obliged to go i bade him goodday
i went up the slope calmly but my heart was beating quickly with fear that he would seize me by the ankles
when i reached the top of the slope i turned round and without looking at him called loudly across the field  murphy  my voice had an accent of forced bravery in it and i was ashamed of my paltry stratagem
i had to call the name again before mahony saw me and hallooed in answer
how my heart beat as he came running across the field to me
he ran as if to bring me aid
and i was penitent for in my heart i had always despised him a little
araby   north richmond street being blind was a quiet street except at the hour when the christian brothers school set the boys free
an uninhabited house of two storeys stood at the blind end detached from its neighbours in a square ground
the other houses of the street conscious of decent lives within them gazed at one another with brown imperturbable faces
the former tenant of our house a priest had died in the back drawingroom
air musty from having been long enclosed hung in all the rooms and the waste room behind the kitchen was littered with old useless papers
among these i found a few papercovered books the pages of which were curled and damp the abbot by walter scott the devout communicant and the memoirs of vidocq
i liked the last best because its leaves were yellow
the wild garden behind the house contained a central appletree and a few straggling bushes under one of which i found the late tenants rusty bicyclepump
he had been a very charitable priest in his will he had left all his money to institutions and the furniture of his house to his sister
when the short days of winter came dusk fell before we had well eaten our dinners
when we met in the street the houses had grown sombre
the space of sky above us was the colour of everchanging violet and towards it the lamps of the street lifted their feeble lanterns
the cold air stung us and we played till our bodies glowed
our shouts echoed in the silent street
the career of our play brought us through the dark muddy lanes behind the houses where we ran the gauntlet of the rough tribes from the cottages to the back doors of the dark dripping gardens where odours arose from the ashpits to the dark odorous stables where a coachman smoothed and combed the horse or shook music from the buckled harness
when we returned to the street light from the kitchen windows had filled the areas
if my uncle was seen turning the corner we hid in the shadow until we had seen him safely housed
or if mangans sister came out on the doorstep to call her brother in to his tea we watched her from our shadow peer up and down the street
we waited to see whether she would remain or go in and if she remained we left our shadow and walked up to mangans steps resignedly
she was waiting for us her figure defined by the light from the halfopened door
her brother always teased her before he obeyed and i stood by the railings looking at her
her dress swung as she moved her body and the soft rope of her hair tossed from side to side
every morning i lay on the floor in the front parlour watching her door
the blind was pulled down to within an inch of the sash so that i could not be seen
when she came out on the doorstep my heart leaped
i ran to the hall seized my books and followed her
i kept her brown figure always in my eye and when we came near the point at which our ways diverged i quickened my pace and passed her
this happened morning after morning
i had never spoken to her except for a few casual words and yet her name was like a summons to all my foolish blood
her image accompanied me even in places the most hostile to romance
on saturday evenings when my aunt went marketing i had to go to carry some of the parcels
we walked through the flaring streets jostled by drunken men and bargaining women amid the curses of labourers the shrill litanies of shopboys who stood on guard by the barrels of pigs cheeks the nasal chanting of streetsingers who sang a comeallyou about odonovan rossa or a ballad about the troubles in our native land
these noises converged in a single sensation of life for me i imagined that i bore my chalice safely through a throng of foes
her name sprang to my lips at moments in strange prayers and praises which i myself did not understand
my eyes were often full of tears i could not tell why and at times a flood from my heart seemed to pour itself out into my bosom
i thought little of the future
i did not know whether i would ever speak to her or not or if i spoke to her how i could tell her of my confused adoration
but my body was like a harp and her words and gestures were like fingers running upon the wires
one evening i went into the back drawingroom in which the priest had died
it was a dark rainy evening and there was no sound in the house
through one of the broken panes i heard the rain impinge upon the earth the fine incessant needles of water playing in the sodden beds
some distant lamp or lighted window gleamed below me
i was thankful that i could see so little
all my senses seemed to desire to veil themselves and feeling that i was about to slip from them i pressed the palms of my hands together until they trembled murmuring o love
o love many times
at last she spoke to me
when she addressed the first words to me i was so confused that i did not know what to answer
she asked me was i going to araby
i forgot whether i answered yes or no
it would be a splendid bazaar she said she would love to go
and why cant you i asked
while she spoke she turned a silver bracelet round and round her wrist
she could not go she said because there would be a retreat that week in her convent
her brother and two other boys were fighting for their caps and i was alone at the railings
she held one of the spikes bowing her head towards me
the light from the lamp opposite our door caught the white curve of her neck lit up her hair that rested there and falling lit up the hand upon the railing
it fell over one side of her dress and caught the white border of a petticoat just visible as she stood at ease
its well for you she said
if i go i said i will bring you something  what innumerable follies laid waste my waking and sleeping thoughts after that evening
i wished to annihilate the tedious intervening days
i chafed against the work of school
at night in my bedroom and by day in the classroom her image came between me and the page i strove to read
the syllables of the word araby were called to me through the silence in which my soul luxuriated and cast an eastern enchantment over me
i asked for leave to go to the bazaar on saturday night
my aunt was surprised and hoped it was not some freemason affair
i answered few questions in class
i watched my masters face pass from amiability to sternness he hoped i was not beginning to idle
i could not call my wandering thoughts together
i had hardly any patience with the serious work of life which now that it stood between me and my desire seemed to me childs play ugly monotonous childs play
on saturday morning i reminded my uncle that i wished to go to the bazaar in the evening
he was fussing at the hallstand looking for the hatbrush and answered me curtly  yes boy i know  as he was in the hall i could not go into the front parlour and lie at the window
i left the house in bad humour and walked slowly towards the school
the air was pitilessly raw and already my heart misgave me
when i came home to dinner my uncle had not yet been home
still it was early
i sat staring at the clock for some time and when its ticking began to irritate me i left the room
i mounted the staircase and gained the upper part of the house
the high cold empty gloomy rooms liberated me and i went from room to room singing
from the front window i saw my companions playing below in the street
their cries reached me weakened and indistinct and leaning my forehead against the cool glass i looked over at the dark house where she lived
i may have stood there for an hour seeing nothing but the brownclad figure cast by my imagination touched discreetly by the lamplight at the curved neck at the hand upon the railings and at the border below the dress
when i came downstairs again i found mrs mercer sitting at the fire
she was an old garrulous woman a pawnbrokers widow who collected used stamps for some pious purpose
i had to endure the gossip of the teatable
the meal was prolonged beyond an hour and still my uncle did not come
mrs mercer stood up to go she was sorry she couldnt wait any longer but it was after eight oclock and she did not like to be out late as the night air was bad for her
when she had gone i began to walk up and down the room clenching my fists
my aunt said  im afraid you may put off your bazaar for this night of our lord  at nine oclock i heard my uncles latchkey in the halldoor
i heard him talking to himself and heard the hallstand rocking when it had received the weight of his overcoat
i could interpret these signs
when he was midway through his dinner i asked him to give me the money to go to the bazaar
he had forgotten
the people are in bed and after their first sleep now he said
i did not smile
my aunt said to him energetically  cant you give him the money and let him go
youve kept him late enough as it is  my uncle said he was very sorry he had forgotten
he said he believed in the old saying all work and no play makes jack a dull boy he asked me where i was going and when i had told him a second time he asked me did i know the arabs farewell to his steed
when i left the kitchen he was about to recite the opening lines of the piece to my aunt
i held a florin tightly in my hand as i strode down buckingham street towards the station
the sight of the streets thronged with buyers and glaring with gas recalled to me the purpose of my journey
i took my seat in a thirdclass carriage of a deserted train
after an intolerable delay the train moved out of the station slowly
it crept onward among ruinous houses and over the twinkling river
at westland row station a crowd of people pressed to the carriage doors but the porters moved them back saying that it was a special train for the bazaar
i remained alone in the bare carriage
in a few minutes the train drew up beside an improvised wooden platform
i passed out on to the road and saw by the lighted dial of a clock that it was ten minutes to ten
in front of me was a large building which displayed the magical name
i could not find any sixpenny entrance and fearing that the bazaar would be closed i passed in quickly through a turnstile handing a shilling to a wearylooking man
i found myself in a big hall girdled at half its height by a gallery
nearly all the stalls were closed and the greater part of the hall was in darkness
i recognised a silence like that which pervades a church after a service
i walked into the centre of the bazaar timidly
a few people were gathered about the stalls which were still open
before a curtain over which the words caf chantant were written in coloured lamps two men were counting money on a salver
i listened to the fall of the coins
remembering with difficulty why i had come i went over to one of the stalls and examined porcelain vases and flowered teasets
at the door of the stall a young lady was talking and laughing with two young gentlemen
i remarked their english accents and listened vaguely to their conversation
o i never said such a thing  o but you did  o but i didnt  didnt she say that  yes
i heard her  o theres a  fib  observing me the young lady came over and asked me did i wish to buy anything
the tone of her voice was not encouraging she seemed to have spoken to me out of a sense of duty
i looked humbly at the great jars that stood like eastern guards at either side of the dark entrance to the stall and murmured  no thank you  the young lady changed the position of one of the vases and went back to the two young men
they began to talk of the same subject
once or twice the young lady glanced at me over her shoulder
i lingered before her stall though i knew my stay was useless to make my interest in her wares seem the more real
then i turned away slowly and walked down the middle of the bazaar
i allowed the two pennies to fall against the sixpence in my pocket
i heard a voice call from one end of the gallery that the light was out
the upper part of the hall was now completely dark
gazing up into the darkness i saw myself as a creature driven and derided by vanity and my eyes burned with anguish and anger
eveline   she sat at the window watching the evening invade the avenue
her head was leaned against the window curtains and in her nostrils was the odour of dusty cretonne
she was tired
few people passed
the man out of the last house passed on his way home she heard his footsteps clacking along the concrete pavement and afterwards crunching on the cinder path before the new red houses
one time there used to be a field there in which they used to play every evening with other peoples children
then a man from belfast bought the field and built houses in itnot like their little brown houses but bright brick houses with shining roofs
the children of the avenue used to play together in that fieldthe devines the waters the dunns little keogh the cripple she and her brothers and sisters
ernest however never played he was too grown up
her father used often to hunt them in out of the field with his blackthorn stick but usually little keogh used to keep nix and call out when he saw her father coming
still they seemed to have been rather happy then
her father was not so bad then and besides her mother was alive
that was a long time ago she and her brothers and sisters were all grown up her mother was dead
tizzie dunn was dead too and the waters had gone back to england
everything changes
now she was going to go away like the others to leave her home
home
she looked round the room reviewing all its familiar objects which she had dusted once a week for so many years wondering where on earth all the dust came from
perhaps she would never see again those familiar objects from which she had never dreamed of being divided
and yet during all those years she had never found out the name of the priest whose yellowing photograph hung on the wall above the broken harmonium beside the coloured print of the promises made to blessed margaret mary alacoque
he had been a school friend of her father
whenever he showed the photograph to a visitor her father used to pass it with a casual word  he is in melbourne now  she had consented to go away to leave her home
was that wise
she tried to weigh each side of the question
in her home anyway she had shelter and food she had those whom she had known all her life about her
of course she had to work hard both in the house and at business
what would they say of her in the stores when they found out that she had run away with a fellow
say she was a fool perhaps and her place would be filled up by advertisement
miss gavan would be glad
she had always had an edge on her especially whenever there were people listening
miss hill dont you see these ladies are waiting  look lively miss hill please  she would not cry many tears at leaving the stores
but in her new home in a distant unknown country it would not be like that
then she would be marriedshe eveline
people would treat her with respect then
she would not be treated as her mother had been
even now though she was over nineteen she sometimes felt herself in danger of her fathers violence
she knew it was that that had given her the palpitations
when they were growing up he had never gone for her like he used to go for harry and ernest because she was a girl but latterly he had begun to threaten her and say what he would do to her only for her dead mothers sake
and now she had nobody to protect her
ernest was dead and harry who was in the church decorating business was nearly always down somewhere in the country
besides the invariable squabble for money on saturday nights had begun to weary her unspeakably
she always gave her entire wagesseven shillingsand harry always sent up what he could but the trouble was to get any money from her father
he said she used to squander the money that she had no head that he wasnt going to give her his hardearned money to throw about the streets and much more for he was usually fairly bad of a saturday night
in the end he would give her the money and ask her had she any intention of buying sundays dinner
then she had to rush out as quickly as she could and do her marketing holding her black leather purse tightly in her hand as she elbowed her way through the crowds and returning home late under her load of provisions
she had hard work to keep the house together and to see that the two young children who had been left to her charge went to school regularly and got their meals regularly
it was hard worka hard lifebut now that she was about to leave it she did not find it a wholly undesirable life
she was about to explore another life with frank
frank was very kind manly openhearted
she was to go away with him by the nightboat to be his wife and to live with him in buenos ayres where he had a home waiting for her
how well she remembered the first time she had seen him he was lodging in a house on the main road where she used to visit
it seemed a few weeks ago
he was standing at the gate his peaked cap pushed back on his head and his hair tumbled forward over a face of bronze
then they had come to know each other
he used to meet her outside the stores every evening and see her home
he took her to see the bohemian girl and she felt elated as she sat in an unaccustomed part of the theatre with him
he was awfully fond of music and sang a little
people knew that they were courting and when he sang about the lass that loves a sailor she always felt pleasantly confused
he used to call her poppens out of fun
first of all it had been an excitement for her to have a fellow and then she had begun to like him
he had tales of distant countries
he had started as a deck boy at a pound a month on a ship of the allan line going out to canada
he told her the names of the ships he had been on and the names of the different services
he had sailed through the straits of magellan and he told her stories of the terrible patagonians
he had fallen on his feet in buenos ayres he said and had come over to the old country just for a holiday
of course her father had found out the affair and had forbidden her to have anything to say to him
i know these sailor chaps he said
one day he had quarrelled with frank and after that she had to meet her lover secretly
the evening deepened in the avenue
the white of two letters in her lap grew indistinct
one was to harry the other was to her father
ernest had been her favourite but she liked harry too
her father was becoming old lately she noticed he would miss her
sometimes he could be very nice
not long before when she had been laid up for a day he had read her out a ghost story and made toast for her at the fire
another day when their mother was alive they had all gone for a picnic to the hill of howth
she remembered her father putting on her mothers bonnet to make the children laugh
her time was running out but she continued to sit by the window leaning her head against the window curtain inhaling the odour of dusty cretonne
down far in the avenue she could hear a street organ playing
she knew the air
strange that it should come that very night to remind her of the promise to her mother her promise to keep the home together as long as she could
she remembered the last night of her mothers illness she was again in the close dark room at the other side of the hall and outside she heard a melancholy air of italy
the organplayer had been ordered to go away and given sixpence
she remembered her father strutting back into the sickroom saying  damned italians
coming over here  as she mused the pitiful vision of her mothers life laid its spell on the very quick of her beingthat life of commonplace sacrifices closing in final craziness
she trembled as she heard again her mothers voice saying constantly with foolish insistence  derevaun seraun
derevaun seraun  she stood up in a sudden impulse of terror
escape
she must escape
frank would save her
he would give her life perhaps love too
but she wanted to live
why should she be unhappy
she had a right to happiness
frank would take her in his arms fold her in his arms
he would save her
she stood among the swaying crowd in the station at the north wall
he held her hand and she knew that he was speaking to her saying something about the passage over and over again
the station was full of soldiers with brown baggages
through the wide doors of the sheds she caught a glimpse of the black mass of the boat lying in beside the quay wall with illumined portholes
she answered nothing
she felt her cheek pale and cold and out of a maze of distress she prayed to god to direct her to show her what was her duty
the boat blew a long mournful whistle into the mist
if she went tomorrow she would be on the sea with frank steaming towards buenos ayres
their passage had been booked
could she still draw back after all he had done for her
her distress awoke a nausea in her body and she kept moving her lips in silent fervent prayer
a bell clanged upon her heart
she felt him seize her hand  come  all the seas of the world tumbled about her heart
he was drawing her into them he would drown her
she gripped with both hands at the iron railing
come  no
no
no
it was impossible
her hands clutched the iron in frenzy
amid the seas she sent a cry of anguish
eveline
evvy  he rushed beyond the barrier and called to her to follow
he was shouted at to go on but he still called to her
she set her white face to him passive like a helpless animal
her eyes gave him no sign of love or farewell or recognition
after the race   the cars came scudding in towards dublin running evenly like pellets in the groove of the naas road
at the crest of the hill at inchicore sightseers had gathered in clumps to watch the cars careering homeward and through this channel of poverty and inaction the continent sped its wealth and industry
now and again the clumps of people raised the cheer of the gratefully oppressed
their sympathy however was for the blue carsthe cars of their friends the french
the french moreover were virtual victors
their team had finished solidly they had been placed second and third and the driver of the winning german car was reported a belgian
each blue car therefore received a double measure of welcome as it topped the crest of the hill and each cheer of welcome was acknowledged with smiles and nods by those in the car
in one of these trimly built cars was a party of four young men whose spirits seemed to be at present well above the level of successful gallicism in fact these four young men were almost hilarious
they were charles sgouin the owner of the car andr rivire a young electrician of canadian birth a huge hungarian named villona and a neatly groomed young man named doyle
sgouin was in good humour because he had unexpectedly received some orders in advance he was about to start a motor establishment in paris and rivire was in good humour because he was to be appointed manager of the establishment these two young men who were cousins were also in good humour because of the success of the french cars
villona was in good humour because he had had a very satisfactory luncheon and besides he was an optimist by nature
the fourth member of the party however was too excited to be genuinely happy
he was about twentysix years of age with a soft light brown moustache and rather innocentlooking grey eyes
his father who had begun life as an advanced nationalist had modified his views early
he had made his money as a butcher in kingstown and by opening shops in dublin and in the suburbs he had made his money many times over
he had also been fortunate enough to secure some of the police contracts and in the end he had become rich enough to be alluded to in the dublin newspapers as a merchant prince
he had sent his son to england to be educated in a big catholic college and had afterwards sent him to dublin university to study law
jimmy did not study very earnestly and took to bad courses for a while
he had money and he was popular and he divided his time curiously between musical and motoring circles
then he had been sent for a term to cambridge to see a little life
his father remonstrative but covertly proud of the excess had paid his bills and brought him home
it was at cambridge that he had met sgouin
they were not much more than acquaintances as yet but jimmy found great pleasure in the society of one who had seen so much of the world and was reputed to own some of the biggest hotels in france
such a person as his father agreed was well worth knowing even if he had not been the charming companion he was
villona was entertaining alsoa brilliant pianistbut unfortunately very poor
the car ran on merrily with its cargo of hilarious youth
the two cousins sat on the front seat jimmy and his hungarian friend sat behind
decidedly villona was in excellent spirits he kept up a deep bass hum of melody for miles of the road
the frenchmen flung their laughter and light words over their shoulders and often jimmy had to strain forward to catch the quick phrase
this was not altogether pleasant for him as he had nearly always to make a deft guess at the meaning and shout back a suitable answer in the face of a high wind
besides villonas humming would confuse anybody the noise of the car too
rapid motion through space elates one so does notoriety so does the possession of money
these were three good reasons for jimmys excitement
he had been seen by many of his friends that day in the company of these continentals
at the control sgouin had presented him to one of the french competitors and in answer to his confused murmur of compliment the swarthy face of the driver had disclosed a line of shining white teeth
it was pleasant after that honour to return to the profane world of spectators amid nudges and significant looks
then as to moneyhe really had a great sum under his control
sgouin perhaps would not think it a great sum but jimmy who in spite of temporary errors was at heart the inheritor of solid instincts knew well with what difficulty it had been got together
this knowledge had previously kept his bills within the limits of reasonable recklessness and if he had been so conscious of the labour latent in money when there had been question merely of some freak of the higher intelligence how much more so now when he was about to stake the greater part of his substance
it was a serious thing for him
of course the investment was a good one and sgouin had managed to give the impression that it was by a favour of friendship the mite of irish money was to be included in the capital of the concern
jimmy had a respect for his fathers shrewdness in business matters and in this case it had been his father who had first suggested the investment money to be made in the motor business pots of money
moreover sgouin had the unmistakable air of wealth
jimmy set out to translate into days work that lordly car in which he sat
how smoothly it ran
in what style they had come careering along the country roads
the journey laid a magical finger on the genuine pulse of life and gallantly the machinery of human nerves strove to answer the bounding courses of the swift blue animal
they drove down dame street
the street was busy with unusual traffic loud with the horns of motorists and the gongs of impatient tramdrivers
near the bank sgouin drew up and jimmy and his friend alighted
a little knot of people collected on the footpath to pay homage to the snorting motor
the party was to dine together that evening in sgouins hotel and meanwhile jimmy and his friend who was staying with him were to go home to dress
the car steered out slowly for grafton street while the two young men pushed their way through the knot of gazers
they walked northward with a curious feeling of disappointment in the exercise while the city hung its pale globes of light above them in a haze of summer evening
in jimmys house this dinner had been pronounced an occasion
a certain pride mingled with his parents trepidation a certain eagerness also to play fast and loose for the names of great foreign cities have at least this virtue
jimmy too looked very well when he was dressed and as he stood in the hall giving a last equation to the bows of his dress tie his father may have felt even commercially satisfied at having secured for his son qualities often unpurchaseable
his father therefore was unusually friendly with villona and his manner expressed a real respect for foreign accomplishments but this subtlety of his host was probably lost upon the hungarian who was beginning to have a sharp desire for his dinner
the dinner was excellent exquisite
sgouin jimmy decided had a very refined taste
the party was increased by a young englishman named routh whom jimmy had seen with sgouin at cambridge
the young men supped in a snug room lit by electric candlelamps
they talked volubly and with little reserve
jimmy whose imagination was kindling conceived the lively youth of the frenchmen twined elegantly upon the firm framework of the englishmans manner
a graceful image of his he thought and a just one
he admired the dexterity with which their host directed the conversation
the five young men had various tastes and their tongues had been loosened
villona with immense respect began to discover to the mildly surprised englishman the beauties of the english madrigal deploring the loss of old instruments
rivire not wholly ingenuously undertook to explain to jimmy the triumph of the french mechanicians
the resonant voice of the hungarian was about to prevail in ridicule of the spurious lutes of the romantic painters when sgouin shepherded his party into politics
here was congenial ground for all
jimmy under generous influences felt the buried zeal of his father wake to life within him he aroused the torpid routh at last
the room grew doubly hot and sgouins task grew harder each moment there was even danger of personal spite
the alert host at an opportunity lifted his glass to humanity and when the toast had been drunk he threw open a window significantly
that night the city wore the mask of a capital
the five young men strolled along stephens green in a faint cloud of aromatic smoke
they talked loudly and gaily and their cloaks dangled from their shoulders
the people made way for them
at the corner of grafton street a short fat man was putting two handsome ladies on a car in charge of another fat man
the car drove off and the short fat man caught sight of the party
andr  its farley  a torrent of talk followed
farley was an american
no one knew very well what the talk was about
villona and rivire were the noisiest but all the men were excited
they got up on a car squeezing themselves together amid much laughter
they drove by the crowd blended now into soft colours to a music of merry bells
they took the train at westland row and in a few seconds as it seemed to jimmy they were walking out of kingstown station
the ticketcollector saluted jimmy he was an old man  fine night sir  it was a serene summer night the harbour lay like a darkened mirror at their feet
they proceeded towards it with linked arms singing cadet roussel in chorus stamping their feet at every  ho
ho
hoh vraiment  they got into a rowboat at the slip and made out for the americans yacht
there was to be supper music cards
villona said with conviction  it is delightful  there was a yacht piano in the cabin
villona played a waltz for farley and rivire farley acting as cavalier and rivire as lady
then an impromptu square dance the men devising original figures
what merriment
jimmy took his part with a will this was seeing life at least
then farley got out of breath and cried stop a man brought in a light supper and the young men sat down to it for forms sake
they drank however it was bohemian
they drank ireland england france hungary the united states of america
jimmy made a speech a long speech villona saying hear
hear whenever there was a pause
there was a great clapping of hands when he sat down
it must have been a good speech
farley clapped him on the back and laughed loudly
what jovial fellows
what good company they were
cards
cards
the table was cleared
villona returned quietly to his piano and played voluntaries for them
the other men played game after game flinging themselves boldly into the adventure
they drank the health of the queen of hearts and of the queen of diamonds
jimmy felt obscurely the lack of an audience the wit was flashing
play ran very high and paper began to pass
jimmy did not know exactly who was winning but he knew that he was losing
but it was his own fault for he frequently mistook his cards and the other men had to calculate his ious for him
they were devils of fellows but he wished they would stop it was getting late
someone gave the toast of the yacht the belle of newport and then someone proposed one great game for a finish
the piano had stopped villona must have gone up on deck
it was a terrible game
they stopped just before the end of it to drink for luck
jimmy understood that the game lay between routh and sgouin
what excitement
jimmy was excited too he would lose of course
how much had he written away
the men rose to their feet to play the last tricks talking and gesticulating
routh won
the cabin shook with the young mens cheering and the cards were bundled together
they began then to gather in what they had won
farley and jimmy were the heaviest losers
he knew that he would regret in the morning but at present he was glad of the rest glad of the dark stupor that would cover up his folly
he leaned his elbows on the table and rested his head between his hands counting the beats of his temples
the cabin door opened and he saw the hungarian standing in a shaft of grey light  daybreak gentlemen     two gallants   the grey warm evening of august had descended upon the city and a mild warm air a memory of summer circulated in the streets
the streets shuttered for the repose of sunday swarmed with a gaily coloured crowd
like illumined pearls the lamps shone from the summits of their tall poles upon the living texture below which changing shape and hue unceasingly sent up into the warm grey evening air an unchanging unceasing murmur
two young men came down the hill of rutland square
one of them was just bringing a long monologue to a close
the other who walked on the verge of the path and was at times obliged to step on to the road owing to his companions rudeness wore an amused listening face
he was squat and ruddy
a yachting cap was shoved far back from his forehead and the narrative to which he listened made constant waves of expression break forth over his face from the corners of his nose and eyes and mouth
little jets of wheezing laughter followed one another out of his convulsed body
his eyes twinkling with cunning enjoyment glanced at every moment towards his companions face
once or twice he rearranged the light waterproof which he had slung over one shoulder in toreador fashion
his breeches his white rubber shoes and his jauntily slung waterproof expressed youth
but his figure fell into rotundity at the waist his hair was scant and grey and his face when the waves of expression had passed over it had a ravaged look
when he was quite sure that the narrative had ended he laughed noiselessly for fully half a minute
then he said  well
that takes the biscuit  his voice seemed winnowed of vigour and to enforce his words he added with humour  that takes the solitary unique and if i may so call it recherch biscuit  he became serious and silent when he had said this
his tongue was tired for he had been talking all the afternoon in a publichouse in dorset street
most people considered lenehan a leech but in spite of this reputation his adroitness and eloquence had always prevented his friends from forming any general policy against him
he had a brave manner of coming up to a party of them in a bar and of holding himself nimbly at the borders of the company until he was included in a round
he was a sporting vagrant armed with a vast stock of stories limericks and riddles
he was insensitive to all kinds of discourtesy
no one knew how he achieved the stern task of living but his name was vaguely associated with racing tissues
and where did you pick her up corley he asked
corley ran his tongue swiftly along his upper lip
one night man he said i was going along dame street and i spotted a fine tart under waterhouses clock and said goodnight you know
so we went for a walk round by the canal and she told me she was a slavey in a house in baggot street
i put my arm round her and squeezed her a bit that night
then next sunday man i met her by appointment
we went out to donnybrook and i brought her into a field there
she told me she used to go with a dairyman
it was fine man
cigarettes every night shed bring me and paying the tram out and back
and one night she brought me two bloody fine cigarso the real cheese you know that the old fellow used to smoke
i was afraid man shed get in the family way
but shes up to the dodge  maybe she thinks youll marry her said lenehan
i told her i was out of a job said corley
i told her i was in pims
she doesnt know my name
i was too hairy to tell her that
but she thinks im a bit of class you know  lenehan laughed again noiselessly
of all the good ones ever i heard he said that emphatically takes the biscuit  corleys stride acknowledged the compliment
the swing of his burly body made his friend execute a few light skips from the path to the roadway and back again
corley was the son of an inspector of police and he had inherited his fathers frame and gait
he walked with his hands by his sides holding himself erect and swaying his head from side to side
his head was large globular and oily it sweated in all weathers and his large round hat set upon it sideways looked like a bulb which had grown out of another
he always stared straight before him as if he were on parade and when he wished to gaze after someone in the street it was necessary for him to move his body from the hips
at present he was about town
whenever any job was vacant a friend was always ready to give him the hard word
he was often to be seen walking with policemen in plain clothes talking earnestly
he knew the inner side of all affairs and was fond of delivering final judgments
he spoke without listening to the speech of his companions
his conversation was mainly about himself what he had said to such a person and what such a person had said to him and what he had said to settle the matter
when he reported these dialogues he aspirated the first letter of his name after the manner of florentines
lenehan offered his friend a cigarette
as the two young men walked on through the crowd corley occasionally turned to smile at some of the passing girls but lenehans gaze was fixed on the large faint moon circled with a double halo
he watched earnestly the passing of the grey web of twilight across its face
at length he said  well  tell me corley i suppose youll be able to pull it off all right eh  corley closed one eye expressively as an answer
is she game for that asked lenehan dubiously
you can never know women  shes all right said corley
i know the way to get around her man
shes a bit gone on me  youre what i call a gay lothario said lenehan
and the proper kind of a lothario too  a shade of mockery relieved the servility of his manner
to save himself he had the habit of leaving his flattery open to the interpretation of raillery
but corley had not a subtle mind
theres nothing to touch a good slavey he affirmed
take my tip for it  by one who has tried them all said lenehan
first i used to go with girls you know said corley unbosoming girls off the south circular
i used to take them out man on the tram somewhere and pay the tram or take them to a band or a play at the theatre or buy them chocolate and sweets or something that way
i used to spend money on them right enough he added in a convincing tone as if he was conscious of being disbelieved
but lenehan could well believe it he nodded gravely
i know that game he said and its a mugs game  and damn the thing i ever got out of it said corley
ditto here said lenehan
only off of one of them said corley
he moistened his upper lip by running his tongue along it
the recollection brightened his eyes
he too gazed at the pale disc of the moon now nearly veiled and seemed to meditate
she was  a bit of all right he said regretfully
he was silent again
then he added  shes on the turf now
i saw her driving down earl street one night with two fellows with her on a car  i suppose thats your doing said lenehan
there was others at her before me said corley philosophically
this time lenehan was inclined to disbelieve
he shook his head to and fro and smiled
you know you cant kid me corley he said
honest to god said corley
didnt she tell me herself  lenehan made a tragic gesture
base betrayer he said
as they passed along the railings of trinity college lenehan skipped out into the road and peered up at the clock
twenty after he said
time enough said corley
shell be there all right
i always let her wait a bit  lenehan laughed quietly
ecod
corley you know how to take them he said
im up to all their little tricks corley confessed
but tell me said lenehan again are you sure you can bring it off all right
you know its a ticklish job
theyre damn close on that point
eh
what  his bright small eyes searched his companions face for reassurance
corley swung his head to and fro as if to toss aside an insistent insect and his brows gathered
ill pull it off he said
leave it to me cant you  lenehan said no more
he did not wish to ruffle his friends temper to be sent to the devil and told that his advice was not wanted
a little tact was necessary
but corleys brow was soon smooth again
his thoughts were running another way
shes a fine decent tart he said with appreciation thats what she is  they walked along nassau street and then turned into kildare street
not far from the porch of the club a harpist stood in the roadway playing to a little ring of listeners
he plucked at the wires heedlessly glancing quickly from time to time at the face of each newcomer and from time to time wearily also at the sky
his harp too heedless that her coverings had fallen about her knees seemed weary alike of the eyes of strangers and of her masters hands
one hand played in the bass the melody of silent o moyle while the other hand careered in the treble after each group of notes
the notes of the air sounded deep and full
the two young men walked up the street without speaking the mournful music following them
when they reached stephens green they crossed the road
here the noise of trams the lights and the crowd released them from their silence
there she is said corley
at the corner of hume street a young woman was standing
she wore a blue dress and a white sailor hat
she stood on the curbstone swinging a sunshade in one hand
lenehan grew lively
lets have a look at her corley he said
corley glanced sideways at his friend and an unpleasant grin appeared on his face
are you trying to get inside me he asked
damn it said lenehan boldly i dont want an introduction
all i want is to have a look at her
im not going to eat her  o a look at her said corley more amiably
well  ill tell you what
ill go over and talk to her and you can pass by  right said lenehan
corley had already thrown one leg over the chains when lenehan called out  and after
where will we meet  half ten answered corley bringing over his other leg
where  corner of merrion street
well be coming back  work it all right now said lenehan in farewell
corley did not answer
he sauntered across the road swaying his head from side to side
his bulk his easy pace and the solid sound of his boots had something of the conqueror in them
he approached the young woman and without saluting began at once to converse with her
she swung her umbrella more quickly and executed half turns on her heels
once or twice when he spoke to her at close quarters she laughed and bent her head
lenehan observed them for a few minutes
then he walked rapidly along beside the chains at some distance and crossed the road obliquely
as he approached hume street corner he found the air heavily scented and his eyes made a swift anxious scrutiny of the young womans appearance
she had her sunday finery on
her blue serge skirt was held at the waist by a belt of black leather
the great silver buckle of her belt seemed to depress the centre of her body catching the light stuff of her white blouse like a clip
she wore a short black jacket with motherofpearl buttons and a ragged black boa
the ends of her tulle collarette had been carefully disordered and a big bunch of red flowers was pinned in her bosom stems upwards
lenehans eyes noted approvingly her stout short muscular body
frank rude health glowed in her face on her fat red cheeks and in her unabashed blue eyes
her features were blunt
she had broad nostrils a straggling mouth which lay open in a contented leer and two projecting front teeth
as he passed lenehan took off his cap and after about ten seconds corley returned a salute to the air
this he did by raising his hand vaguely and pensively changing the angle of position of his hat
lenehan walked as far as the shelbourne hotel where he halted and waited
after waiting for a little time he saw them coming towards him and when they turned to the right he followed them stepping lightly in his white shoes down one side of merrion square
as he walked on slowly timing his pace to theirs he watched corleys head which turned at every moment towards the young womans face like a big ball revolving on a pivot
he kept the pair in view until he had seen them climbing the stairs of the donnybrook tram then he turned about and went back the way he had come
now that he was alone his face looked older
his gaiety seemed to forsake him and as he came by the railings of the dukes lawn he allowed his hand to run along them
the air which the harpist had played began to control his movements
his softly padded feet played the melody while his fingers swept a scale of variations idly along the railings after each group of notes
he walked listlessly round stephens green and then down grafton street
though his eyes took note of many elements of the crowd through which he passed they did so morosely
he found trivial all that was meant to charm him and did not answer the glances which invited him to be bold
he knew that he would have to speak a great deal to invent and to amuse and his brain and throat were too dry for such a task
the problem of how he could pass the hours till he met corley again troubled him a little
he could think of no way of passing them but to keep on walking
he turned to the left when he came to the corner of rutland square and felt more at ease in the dark quiet street the sombre look of which suited his mood
he paused at last before the window of a poorlooking shop over which the words refreshment bar were printed in white letters
on the glass of the window were two flying inscriptions ginger beer and ginger ale
a cut ham was exposed on a great blue dish while near it on a plate lay a segment of very light plumpudding
he eyed this food earnestly for some time and then after glancing warily up and down the street went into the shop quickly
he was hungry for except some biscuits which he had asked two grudging curates to bring him he had eaten nothing since breakfasttime
he sat down at an uncovered wooden table opposite two workgirls and a mechanic
a slatternly girl waited on him
how much is a plate of peas he asked
three halfpence sir said the girl
bring me a plate of peas he said and a bottle of ginger beer  he spoke roughly in order to belie his air of gentility for his entry had been followed by a pause of talk
his face was heated
to appear natural he pushed his cap back on his head and planted his elbows on the table
the mechanic and the two workgirls examined him point by point before resuming their conversation in a subdued voice
the girl brought him a plate of grocers hot peas seasoned with pepper and vinegar a fork and his ginger beer
he ate his food greedily and found it so good that he made a note of the shop mentally
when he had eaten all the peas he sipped his ginger beer and sat for some time thinking of corleys adventure
in his imagination he beheld the pair of lovers walking along some dark road he heard corleys voice in deep energetic gallantries and saw again the leer of the young womans mouth
this vision made him feel keenly his own poverty of purse and spirit
he was tired of knocking about of pulling the devil by the tail of shifts and intrigues
he would be thirtyone in november
would he never get a good job
would he never have a home of his own
he thought how pleasant it would be to have a warm fire to sit by and a good dinner to sit down to
he had walked the streets long enough with friends and with girls
he knew what those friends were worth he knew the girls too
experience had embittered his heart against the world
but all hope had not left him
he felt better after having eaten than he had felt before less weary of his life less vanquished in spirit
he might yet be able to settle down in some snug corner and live happily if he could only come across some good simpleminded girl with a little of the ready
he paid twopence halfpenny to the slatternly girl and went out of the shop to begin his wandering again
he went into capel street and walked along towards the city hall
then he turned into dame street
at the corner of georges street he met two friends of his and stopped to converse with them
he was glad that he could rest from all his walking
his friends asked him had he seen corley and what was the latest
he replied that he had spent the day with corley
his friends talked very little
they looked vacantly after some figures in the crowd and sometimes made a critical remark
one said that he had seen mac an hour before in westmoreland street
at this lenehan said that he had been with mac the night before in egans
the young man who had seen mac in westmoreland street asked was it true that mac had won a bit over a billiard match
lenehan did not know he said that holohan had stood them drinks in egans
he left his friends at a quarter to ten and went up georges street
he turned to the left at the city markets and walked on into grafton street
the crowd of girls and young men had thinned and on his way up the street he heard many groups and couples bidding one another goodnight
he went as far as the clock of the college of surgeons it was on the stroke of ten
he set off briskly along the northern side of the green hurrying for fear corley should return too soon
when he reached the corner of merrion street he took his stand in the shadow of a lamp and brought out one of the cigarettes which he had reserved and lit it
he leaned against the lamppost and kept his gaze fixed on the part from which he expected to see corley and the young woman return
his mind became active again
he wondered had corley managed it successfully
he wondered if he had asked her yet or if he would leave it to the last
he suffered all the pangs and thrills of his friends situation as well as those of his own
but the memory of corleys slowly revolving head calmed him somewhat he was sure corley would pull it off all right
all at once the idea struck him that perhaps corley had seen her home by another way and given him the slip
his eyes searched the street there was no sign of them
yet it was surely halfanhour since he had seen the clock of the college of surgeons
would corley do a thing like that
he lit his last cigarette and began to smoke it nervously
he strained his eyes as each tram stopped at the far corner of the square
they must have gone home by another way
the paper of his cigarette broke and he flung it into the road with a curse
suddenly he saw them coming towards him
he started with delight and keeping close to his lamppost tried to read the result in their walk
they were walking quickly the young woman taking quick short steps while corley kept beside her with his long stride
they did not seem to be speaking
an intimation of the result pricked him like the point of a sharp instrument
he knew corley would fail he knew it was no go
they turned down baggot street and he followed them at once taking the other footpath
when they stopped he stopped too
they talked for a few moments and then the young woman went down the steps into the area of a house
corley remained standing at the edge of the path a little distance from the front steps
some minutes passed
then the halldoor was opened slowly and cautiously
a woman came running down the front steps and coughed
corley turned and went towards her
his broad figure hid hers from view for a few seconds and then she reappeared running up the steps
the door closed on her and corley began to walk swiftly towards stephens green
lenehan hurried on in the same direction
some drops of light rain fell
he took them as a warning and glancing back towards the house which the young woman had entered to see that he was not observed he ran eagerly across the road
anxiety and his swift run made him pant
he called out  hallo corley  corley turned his head to see who had called him and then continued walking as before
lenehan ran after him settling the waterproof on his shoulders with one hand
hallo corley he cried again
he came level with his friend and looked keenly in his face
he could see nothing there
well he said
did it come off  they had reached the corner of ely place
still without answering corley swerved to the left and went up the side street
his features were composed in stern calm
lenehan kept up with his friend breathing uneasily
he was baffled and a note of menace pierced through his voice
cant you tell us he said
did you try her  corley halted at the first lamp and stared grimly before him
then with a grave gesture he extended a hand towards the light and smiling opened it slowly to the gaze of his disciple
a small gold coin shone in the palm
the boarding house   mrs mooney was a butchers daughter
she was a woman who was quite able to keep things to herself a determined woman
she had married her fathers foreman and opened a butchers shop near spring gardens
but as soon as his fatherinlaw was dead mr mooney began to go to the devil
he drank plundered the till ran headlong into debt
it was no use making him take the pledge he was sure to break out again a few days after
by fighting his wife in the presence of customers and by buying bad meat he ruined his business
one night he went for his wife with the cleaver and she had to sleep in a neighbours house
after that they lived apart
she went to the priest and got a separation from him with care of the children
she would give him neither money nor food nor houseroom and so he was obliged to enlist himself as a sheriffs man
he was a shabby stooped little drunkard with a white face and a white moustache and white eyebrows pencilled above his little eyes which were pinkveined and raw and all day long he sat in the bailiffs room waiting to be put on a job
mrs mooney who had taken what remained of her money out of the butcher business and set up a boarding house in hardwicke street was a big imposing woman
her house had a floating population made up of tourists from liverpool and the isle of man and occasionally artistes from the musichalls
its resident population was made up of clerks from the city
she governed her house cunningly and firmly knew when to give credit when to be stern and when to let things pass
all the resident young men spoke of her as the madam
mrs mooneys young men paid fifteen shillings a week for board and lodgings beer or stout at dinner excluded
they shared in common tastes and occupations and for this reason they were very chummy with one another
they discussed with one another the chances of favourites and outsiders
jack mooney the madams son who was clerk to a commission agent in fleet street had the reputation of being a hard case
he was fond of using soldiers obscenities usually he came home in the small hours
when he met his friends he had always a good one to tell them and he was always sure to be on to a good thingthat is to say a likely horse or a likely artiste
he was also handy with the mits and sang comic songs
on sunday nights there would often be a reunion in mrs mooneys front drawingroom
the musichall artistes would oblige and sheridan played waltzes and polkas and vamped accompaniments
polly mooney the madams daughter would also sing
she sang       im a  naughty girl
you neednt sham          you know i am  polly was a slim girl of nineteen she had light soft hair and a small full mouth
her eyes which were grey with a shade of green through them had a habit of glancing upwards when she spoke with anyone which made her look like a little perverse madonna
mrs mooney had first sent her daughter to be a typist in a cornfactors office but as a disreputable sheriffs man used to come every other day to the office asking to be allowed to say a word to his daughter she had taken her daughter home again and set her to do housework
as polly was very lively the intention was to give her the run of the young men
besides young men like to feel that there is a young woman not very far away
polly of course flirted with the young men but mrs mooney who was a shrewd judge knew that the young men were only passing the time away none of them meant business
things went on so for a long time and mrs mooney began to think of sending polly back to typewriting when she noticed that something was going on between polly and one of the young men
she watched the pair and kept her own counsel
polly knew that she was being watched but still her mothers persistent silence could not be misunderstood
there had been no open complicity between mother and daughter no open understanding but though people in the house began to talk of the affair still mrs mooney did not intervene
polly began to grow a little strange in her manner and the young man was evidently perturbed
at last when she judged it to be the right moment mrs mooney intervened
she dealt with moral problems as a cleaver deals with meat and in this case she had made up her mind
it was a bright sunday morning of early summer promising heat but with a fresh breeze blowing
all the windows of the boarding house were open and the lace curtains ballooned gently towards the street beneath the raised sashes
the belfry of georges church sent out constant peals and worshippers singly or in groups traversed the little circus before the church revealing their purpose by their selfcontained demeanour no less than by the little volumes in their gloved hands
breakfast was over in the boarding house and the table of the breakfastroom was covered with plates on which lay yellow streaks of eggs with morsels of baconfat and baconrind
mrs mooney sat in the straw armchair and watched the servant mary remove the breakfast things
she made mary collect the crusts and pieces of broken bread to help to make tuesdays breadpudding
when the table was cleared the broken bread collected the sugar and butter safe under lock and key she began to reconstruct the interview which she had had the night before with polly
things were as she had suspected she had been frank in her questions and polly had been frank in her answers
both had been somewhat awkward of course
she had been made awkward by her not wishing to receive the news in too cavalier a fashion or to seem to have connived and polly had been made awkward not merely because allusions of that kind always made her awkward but also because she did not wish it to be thought that in her wise innocence she had divined the intention behind her mothers tolerance
mrs mooney glanced instinctively at the little gilt clock on the mantelpiece as soon as she had become aware through her revery that the bells of georges church had stopped ringing
it was seventeen minutes past eleven she would have lots of time to have the matter out with mr doran and then catch short twelve at marlborough street
she was sure she would win
to begin with she had all the weight of social opinion on her side she was an outraged mother
she had allowed him to live beneath her roof assuming that he was a man of honour and he had simply abused her hospitality
he was thirtyfour or thirtyfive years of age so that youth could not be pleaded as his excuse nor could ignorance be his excuse since he was a man who had seen something of the world
he had simply taken advantage of pollys youth and inexperience that was evident
the question was what reparation would he make
there must be reparation made in such cases
it is all very well for the man he can go his ways as if nothing had happened having had his moment of pleasure but the girl has to bear the brunt
some mothers would be content to patch up such an affair for a sum of money she had known cases of it
but she would not do so
for her only one reparation could make up for the loss of her daughters honour marriage
she counted all her cards again before sending mary up to mr dorans room to say that she wished to speak with him
she felt sure she would win
he was a serious young man not rakish or loudvoiced like the others
if it had been mr sheridan or mr meade or bantam lyons her task would have been much harder
she did not think he would face publicity
all the lodgers in the house knew something of the affair details had been invented by some
besides he had been employed for thirteen years in a great catholic winemerchants office and publicity would mean for him perhaps the loss of his job
whereas if he agreed all might be well
she knew he had a good screw for one thing and she suspected he had a bit of stuff put by
nearly the halfhour
she stood up and surveyed herself in the pierglass
the decisive expression of her great florid face satisfied her and she thought of some mothers she knew who could not get their daughters off their hands
mr doran was very anxious indeed this sunday morning
he had made two attempts to shave but his hand had been so unsteady that he had been obliged to desist
three days reddish beard fringed his jaws and every two or three minutes a mist gathered on his glasses so that he had to take them off and polish them with his pockethandkerchief
the recollection of his confession of the night before was a cause of acute pain to him the priest had drawn out every ridiculous detail of the affair and in the end had so magnified his sin that he was almost thankful at being afforded a loophole of reparation
the harm was done
what could he do now but marry her or run away
he could not brazen it out
the affair would be sure to be talked of and his employer would be certain to hear of it
dublin is such a small city everyone knows everyone elses business
he felt his heart leap warmly in his throat as he heard in his excited imagination old mr leonard calling out in his rasping voice send mr doran here please  all his long years of service gone for nothing
all his industry and diligence thrown away
as a young man he had sown his wild oats of course he had boasted of his freethinking and denied the existence of god to his companions in publichouses
but that was all passed and done with  nearly
he still bought a copy of reynoldss newspaper every week but he attended to his religious duties and for ninetenths of the year lived a regular life
he had money enough to settle down on it was not that
but the family would look down on her
first of all there was her disreputable father and then her mothers boarding house was beginning to get a certain fame
he had a notion that he was being had
he could imagine his friends talking of the affair and laughing
she was a little vulgar sometimes she said i seen and if i hadve known but what would grammar matter if he really loved her
he could not make up his mind whether to like her or despise her for what she had done
of course he had done it too
his instinct urged him to remain free not to marry
once you are married you are done for it said
while he was sitting helplessly on the side of the bed in shirt and trousers she tapped lightly at his door and entered
she told him all that she had made a clean breast of it to her mother and that her mother would speak with him that morning
she cried and threw her arms round his neck saying  o bob
bob
what am i to do
what am i to do at all  she would put an end to herself she said
he comforted her feebly telling her not to cry that it would be all right never fear
he felt against his shirt the agitation of her bosom
it was not altogether his fault that it had happened
he remembered well with the curious patient memory of the celibate the first casual caresses her dress her breath her fingers had given him
then late one night as he was undressing for bed she had tapped at his door timidly
she wanted to relight her candle at his for hers had been blown out by a gust
it was her bath night
she wore a loose open combingjacket of printed flannel
her white instep shone in the opening of her furry slippers and the blood glowed warmly behind her perfumed skin
from her hands and wrists too as she lit and steadied her candle a faint perfume arose
on nights when he came in very late it was she who warmed up his dinner
he scarcely knew what he was eating feeling her beside him alone at night in the sleeping house
and her thoughtfulness
if the night was anyway cold or wet or windy there was sure to be a little tumbler of punch ready for him
perhaps they could be happy together
they used to go upstairs together on tiptoe each with a candle and on the third landing exchange reluctant goodnights
they used to kiss
he remembered well her eyes the touch of her hand and his delirium
but delirium passes
he echoed her phrase applying it to himself what am i to do the instinct of the celibate warned him to hold back
but the sin was there even his sense of honour told him that reparation must be made for such a sin
while he was sitting with her on the side of the bed mary came to the door and said that the missus wanted to see him in the parlour
he stood up to put on his coat and waistcoat more helpless than ever
when he was dressed he went over to her to comfort her
it would be all right never fear
he left her crying on the bed and moaning softly o my god  going down the stairs his glasses became so dimmed with moisture that he had to take them off and polish them
he longed to ascend through the roof and fly away to another country where he would never hear again of his trouble and yet a force pushed him downstairs step by step
the implacable faces of his employer and of the madam stared upon his discomfiture
on the last flight of stairs he passed jack mooney who was coming up from the pantry nursing two bottles of bass
they saluted coldly and the lovers eyes rested for a second or two on a thick bulldog face and a pair of thick short arms
when he reached the foot of the staircase he glanced up and saw jack regarding him from the door of the returnroom
suddenly he remembered the night when one of the musichall artistes a little blond londoner had made a rather free allusion to polly
the reunion had been almost broken up on account of jacks violence
everyone tried to quiet him
the musichall artiste a little paler than usual kept smiling and saying that there was no harm meant but jack kept shouting at him that if any fellow tried that sort of a game on with his sister hed bloody well put his teeth down his throat so he would
polly sat for a little time on the side of the bed crying
then she dried her eyes and went over to the lookingglass
she dipped the end of the towel in the waterjug and refreshed her eyes with the cool water
she looked at herself in profile and readjusted a hairpin above her ear
then she went back to the bed again and sat at the foot
she regarded the pillows for a long time and the sight of them awakened in her mind secret amiable memories
she rested the nape of her neck against the cool iron bedrail and fell into a revery
there was no longer any perturbation visible on her face
she waited on patiently almost cheerfully without alarm her memories gradually giving place to hopes and visions of the future
her hopes and visions were so intricate that she no longer saw the white pillows on which her gaze was fixed or remembered that she was waiting for anything
at last she heard her mother calling
she started to her feet and ran to the banisters
polly
polly  yes mamma  come down dear
mr doran wants to speak to you  then she remembered what she had been waiting for
a little cloud   eight years before he had seen his friend off at the north wall and wished him godspeed
gallaher had got on
you could tell that at once by his travelled air his wellcut tweed suit and fearless accent
few fellows had talents like his and fewer still could remain unspoiled by such success
gallahers heart was in the right place and he had deserved to win
it was something to have a friend like that
little chandlers thoughts ever since lunchtime had been of his meeting with gallaher of gallahers invitation and of the great city london where gallaher lived
he was called little chandler because though he was but slightly under the average stature he gave one the idea of being a little man
his hands were white and small his frame was fragile his voice was quiet and his manners were refined
he took the greatest care of his fair silken hair and moustache and used perfume discreetly on his handkerchief
the halfmoons of his nails were perfect and when he smiled you caught a glimpse of a row of childish white teeth
as he sat at his desk in the kings inns he thought what changes those eight years had brought
the friend whom he had known under a shabby and necessitous guise had become a brilliant figure on the london press
he turned often from his tiresome writing to gaze out of the office window
the glow of a late autumn sunset covered the grass plots and walks
it cast a shower of kindly golden dust on the untidy nurses and decrepit old men who drowsed on the benches it flickered upon all the moving figureson the children who ran screaming along the gravel paths and on everyone who passed through the gardens
he watched the scene and thought of life and as always happened when he thought of life he became sad
a gentle melancholy took possession of him
he felt how useless it was to struggle against fortune this being the burden of wisdom which the ages had bequeathed to him
he remembered the books of poetry upon his shelves at home
he had bought them in his bachelor days and many an evening as he sat in the little room off the hall he had been tempted to take one down from the bookshelf and read out something to his wife
but shyness had always held him back and so the books had remained on their shelves
at times he repeated lines to himself and this consoled him
when his hour had struck he stood up and took leave of his desk and of his fellowclerks punctiliously
he emerged from under the feudal arch of the kings inns a neat modest figure and walked swiftly down henrietta street
the golden sunset was waning and the air had grown sharp
a horde of grimy children populated the street
they stood or ran in the roadway or crawled up the steps before the gaping doors or squatted like mice upon the thresholds
little chandler gave them no thought
he picked his way deftly through all that minute verminlike life and under the shadow of the gaunt spectral mansions in which the old nobility of dublin had roystered
no memory of the past touched him for his mind was full of a present joy
he had never been in corlesss but he knew the value of the name
he knew that people went there after the theatre to eat oysters and drink liqueurs and he had heard that the waiters there spoke french and german
walking swiftly by at night he had seen cabs drawn up before the door and richly dressed ladies escorted by cavaliers alight and enter quickly
they wore noisy dresses and many wraps
their faces were powdered and they caught up their dresses when they touched earth like alarmed atalantas
he had always passed without turning his head to look
it was his habit to walk swiftly in the street even by day and whenever he found himself in the city late at night he hurried on his way apprehensively and excitedly
sometimes however he courted the causes of his fear
he chose the darkest and narrowest streets and as he walked boldly forward the silence that was spread about his footsteps troubled him the wandering silent figures troubled him and at times a sound of low fugitive laughter made him tremble like a leaf
he turned to the right towards capel street
ignatius gallaher on the london press
who would have thought it possible eight years before
still now that he reviewed the past little chandler could remember many signs of future greatness in his friend
people used to say that ignatius gallaher was wild
of course he did mix with a rakish set of fellows at that time drank freely and borrowed money on all sides
in the end he had got mixed up in some shady affair some money transaction at least that was one version of his flight
but nobody denied him talent
there was always a certain  something in ignatius gallaher that impressed you in spite of yourself
even when he was out at elbows and at his wits end for money he kept up a bold face
little chandler remembered and the remembrance brought a slight flush of pride to his cheek one of ignatius gallahers sayings when he was in a tight corner  half time now boys he used to say lightheartedly
wheres my considering cap  that was ignatius gallaher all out and damn it you couldnt but admire him for it
little chandler quickened his pace
for the first time in his life he felt himself superior to the people he passed
for the first time his soul revolted against the dull inelegance of capel street
there was no doubt about it if you wanted to succeed you had to go away
you could do nothing in dublin
as he crossed grattan bridge he looked down the river towards the lower quays and pitied the poor stunted houses
they seemed to him a band of tramps huddled together along the riverbanks their old coats covered with dust and soot stupefied by the panorama of sunset and waiting for the first chill of night bid them arise shake themselves and begone
he wondered whether he could write a poem to express his idea
perhaps gallaher might be able to get it into some london paper for him
could he write something original
he was not sure what idea he wished to express but the thought that a poetic moment had touched him took life within him like an infant hope
he stepped onward bravely
every step brought him nearer to london farther from his own sober inartistic life
a light began to tremble on the horizon of his mind
he was not so oldthirtytwo
his temperament might be said to be just at the point of maturity
there were so many different moods and impressions that he wished to express in verse
he felt them within him
he tried to weigh his soul to see if it was a poets soul
melancholy was the dominant note of his temperament he thought but it was a melancholy tempered by recurrences of faith and resignation and simple joy
if he could give expression to it in a book of poems perhaps men would listen
he would never be popular he saw that
he could not sway the crowd but he might appeal to a little circle of kindred minds
the english critics perhaps would recognise him as one of the celtic school by reason of the melancholy tone of his poems besides that he would put in allusions
he began to invent sentences and phrases from the notice which his book would get
mr chandler has the gift of easy and graceful verse  a wistful sadness pervades these poems  the celtic note it was a pity his name was not more irishlooking
perhaps it would be better to insert his mothers name before the surname thomas malone chandler or better still t malone chandler
he would speak to gallaher about it
he pursued his revery so ardently that he passed his street and had to turn back
as he came near corlesss his former agitation began to overmaster him and he halted before the door in indecision
finally he opened the door and entered
the light and noise of the bar held him at the doorways for a few moments
he looked about him but his sight was confused by the shining of many red and green wineglasses
the bar seemed to him to be full of people and he felt that the people were observing him curiously
he glanced quickly to right and left frowning slightly to make his errand appear serious but when his sight cleared a little he saw that nobody had turned to look at him and there sure enough was ignatius gallaher leaning with his back against the counter and his feet planted far apart
hallo tommy old hero here you are
what is it to be
what will you have
im taking whisky better stuff than we get across the water
soda
lithia
no mineral
im the same
spoils the flavour
here garon bring us two halves of malt whisky like a good fellow well and how have you been pulling along since i saw you last
dear god how old were getting
do you see any signs of aging in meeh what
a little grey and thin on the topwhat  ignatius gallaher took off his hat and displayed a large closely cropped head
his face was heavy pale and cleanshaven
his eyes which were of bluish slatecolour relieved his unhealthy pallor and shone out plainly above the vivid orange tie he wore
between these rival features the lips appeared very long and shapeless and colourless
he bent his head and felt with two sympathetic fingers the thin hair at the crown
little chandler shook his head as a denial
ignatius galaher put on his hat again
it pulls you down he said
press life
always hurry and scurry looking for copy and sometimes not finding it and then always to have something new in your stuff
damn proofs and printers i say for a few days
im deuced glad i can tell you to get back to the old country
does a fellow good a bit of a holiday
i feel a ton better since i landed again in dear dirty dublin
here you are tommy
water
say when  little chandler allowed his whisky to be very much diluted
you dont know whats good for you my boy said ignatius gallaher
i drink mine neat  i drink very little as a rule said little chandler modestly
an odd halfone or so when i meet any of the old crowd thats all  ah well said ignatius gallaher cheerfully heres to us and to old times and old acquaintance  they clinked glasses and drank the toast
i met some of the old gang today said ignatius gallaher
ohara seems to be in a bad way
whats he doing  nothing said little chandler
hes gone to the dogs  but hogan has a good sit hasnt he  yes hes in the land commission  i met him one night in london and he seemed to be very flush poor ohara
boose i suppose  other things too said little chandler shortly
ignatius gallaher laughed
tommy he said i see you havent changed an atom
youre the very same serious person that used to lecture me on sunday mornings when i had a sore head and a fur on my tongue
youd want to knock about a bit in the world
have you never been anywhere even for a trip  ive been to the isle of man said little chandler
ignatius gallaher laughed
the isle of man he said
go to london or paris paris for choice
thatd do you good  have you seen paris  i should think i have
ive knocked about there a little  and is it really so beautiful as they say asked little chandler
he sipped a little of his drink while ignatius gallaher finished his boldly
beautiful said ignatius gallaher pausing on the word and on the flavour of his drink
its not so beautiful you know
of course it is beautiful
but its the life of paris thats the thing
ah theres no city like paris for gaiety movement excitement  little chandler finished his whisky and after some trouble succeeded in catching the barmans eye
he ordered the same again
ive been to the moulin rouge ignatius gallaher continued when the barman had removed their glasses and ive been to all the bohemian cafs
hot stuff
not for a pious chap like you tommy  little chandler said nothing until the barman returned with two glasses then he touched his friends glass lightly and reciprocated the former toast
he was beginning to feel somewhat disillusioned
gallahers accent and way of expressing himself did not please him
there was something vulgar in his friend which he had not observed before
but perhaps it was only the result of living in london amid the bustle and competition of the press
the old personal charm was still there under this new gaudy manner
and after all gallaher had lived he had seen the world
little chandler looked at his friend enviously
everything in paris is gay said ignatius gallaher
they believe in enjoying lifeand dont you think theyre right
if you want to enjoy yourself properly you must go to paris
and mind you theyve a great feeling for the irish there
when they heard i was from ireland they were ready to eat me man  little chandler took four or five sips from his glass
tell me he said is it true that paris is so  immoral as they say  ignatius gallaher made a catholic gesture with his right arm
every place is immoral he said
of course you do find spicy bits in paris
go to one of the students balls for instance
thats lively if you like when the cocottes begin to let themselves loose
you know what they are i suppose  ive heard of them said little chandler
ignatius gallaher drank off his whisky and shook his head
ah he said you may say what you like
theres no woman like the parisiennefor style for go  then it is an immoral city said little chandler with timid insistencei mean compared with london or dublin  london said ignatius gallaher
its six of one and halfadozen of the other
you ask hogan my boy
i showed him a bit about london when he was over there
hed open your eye
i say tommy dont make punch of that whisky liquor up  no really  o come on another one wont do you any harm
what is it
the same again i suppose  well  all right  franois the same again will you smoke tommy  ignatius gallaher produced his cigarcase
the two friends lit their cigars and puffed at them in silence until their drinks were served
ill tell you my opinion said ignatius gallaher emerging after some time from the clouds of smoke in which he had taken refuge its a rum world
talk of immorality
ive heard of caseswhat am i sayingive known them cases of  immorality  ignatius gallaher puffed thoughtfully at his cigar and then in a calm historians tone he proceeded to sketch for his friend some pictures of the corruption which was rife abroad
he summarised the vices of many capitals and seemed inclined to award the palm to berlin
some things he could not vouch for his friends had told him but of others he had had personal experience
he spared neither rank nor caste
he revealed many of the secrets of religious houses on the continent and described some of the practices which were fashionable in high society and ended by telling with details a story about an english duchessa story which he knew to be true
little chandler was astonished
ah well said ignatius gallaher here we are in old jogalong dublin where nothing is known of such things  how dull you must find it said little chandler after all the other places youve seen  well said ignatius gallaher its a relaxation to come over here you know
and after all its the old country as they say isnt it
you cant help having a certain feeling for it
thats human nature
but tell me something about yourself
hogan told me you had  tasted the joys of connubial bliss
two years ago wasnt it  little chandler blushed and smiled
yes he said
i was married last may twelve months  i hope its not too late in the day to offer my best wishes said ignatius gallaher
i didnt know your address or id have done so at the time  he extended his hand which little chandler took
well tommy he said i wish you and yours every joy in life old chap and tons of money and may you never die till i shoot you
and thats the wish of a sincere friend an old friend
you know that  i know that said little chandler
any youngsters said ignatius gallaher
little chandler blushed again
we have one child he said
son or daughter  a little boy  ignatius gallaher slapped his friend sonorously on the back
bravo he said i wouldnt doubt you tommy  little chandler smiled looked confusedly at his glass and bit his lower lip with three childishly white front teeth
i hope youll spend an evening with us he said before you go back
my wife will be delighted to meet you
we can have a little music and  thanks awfully old chap said ignatius gallaher im sorry we didnt meet earlier
but i must leave tomorrow night  tonight perhaps  im awfully sorry old man
you see im over here with another fellow clever young chap he is too and we arranged to go to a little cardparty
only for that  o in that case  but who knows said ignatius gallaher considerately
next year i may take a little skip over here now that ive broken the ice
its only a pleasure deferred  very well said little chandler the next time you come we must have an evening together
thats agreed now isnt it  yes thats agreed said ignatius gallaher
next year if i come parole dhonneur  and to clinch the bargain said little chandler well just have one more now  ignatius gallaher took out a large gold watch and looked at it
is it to be the last he said
because you know i have an ap  o yes positively said little chandler
very well then said ignatius gallaher let us have another one as a deoc an doruisthats good vernacular for a small whisky i believe  little chandler ordered the drinks
the blush which had risen to his face a few moments before was establishing itself
a trifle made him blush at any time and now he felt warm and excited
three small whiskies had gone to his head and gallahers strong cigar had confused his mind for he was a delicate and abstinent person
the adventure of meeting gallaher after eight years of finding himself with gallaher in corlesss surrounded by lights and noise of listening to gallahers stories and of sharing for a brief space gallahers vagrant and triumphant life upset the equipoise of his sensitive nature
he felt acutely the contrast between his own life and his friends and it seemed to him unjust
gallaher was his inferior in birth and education
he was sure that he could do something better than his friend had ever done or could ever do something higher than mere tawdry journalism if he only got the chance
what was it that stood in his way
his unfortunate timidity
he wished to vindicate himself in some way to assert his manhood
he saw behind gallahers refusal of his invitation
gallaher was only patronising him by his friendliness just as he was patronising ireland by his visit
the barman brought their drinks
little chandler pushed one glass towards his friend and took up the other boldly
who knows he said as they lifted their glasses
when you come next year i may have the pleasure of wishing long life and happiness to mr and mrs ignatius gallaher  ignatius gallaher in the act of drinking closed one eye expressively over the rim of his glass
when he had drunk he smacked his lips decisively set down his glass and said  no blooming fear of that my boy
im going to have my fling first and see a bit of life and the world before i put my head in the sackif i ever do  some day you will said little chandler calmly
ignatius gallaher turned his orange tie and slateblue eyes full upon his friend
you think so he said
youll put your head in the sack repeated little chandler stoutly like everyone else if you can find the girl  he had slightly emphasised his tone and he was aware that he had betrayed himself but though the colour had heightened in his cheek he did not flinch from his friends gaze
ignatius gallaher watched him for a few moments and then said  if ever it occurs you may bet your bottom dollar therell be no mooning and spooning about it
i mean to marry money
shell have a good fat account at the bank or she wont do for me  little chandler shook his head
why man alive said ignatius gallaher vehemently do you know what it is
ive only to say the word and tomorrow i can have the woman and the cash
you dont believe it
well i know it
there are hundredswhat am i sayingthousands of rich germans and jews rotten with money thatd only be too glad you wait a while my boy
see if i dont play my cards properly
when i go about a thing i mean business i tell you
you just wait  he tossed his glass to his mouth finished his drink and laughed loudly
then he looked thoughtfully before him and said in a calmer tone  but im in no hurry
they can wait
i dont fancy tying myself up to one woman you know  he imitated with his mouth the act of tasting and made a wry face
must get a bit stale i should think he said
little chandler sat in the room off the hall holding a child in his arms
to save money they kept no servant but annies young sister monica came for an hour or so in the morning and an hour or so in the evening to help
but monica had gone home long ago
it was a quarter to nine
little chandler had come home late for tea and moreover he had forgotten to bring annie home the parcel of coffee from bewleys
of course she was in a bad humour and gave him short answers
she said she would do without any tea but when it came near the time at which the shop at the corner closed she decided to go out herself for a quarter of a pound of tea and two pounds of sugar
she put the sleeping child deftly in his arms and said  here
dont waken him  a little lamp with a white china shade stood upon the table and its light fell over a photograph which was enclosed in a frame of crumpled horn
it was annies photograph
little chandler looked at it pausing at the thin tight lips
she wore the pale blue summer blouse which he had brought her home as a present one saturday
it had cost him ten and elevenpence but what an agony of nervousness it had cost him
how he had suffered that day waiting at the shop door until the shop was empty standing at the counter and trying to appear at his ease while the girl piled ladies blouses before him paying at the desk and forgetting to take up the odd penny of his change being called back by the cashier and finally striving to hide his blushes as he left the shop by examining the parcel to see if it was securely tied
when he brought the blouse home annie kissed him and said it was very pretty and stylish but when she heard the price she threw the blouse on the table and said it was a regular swindle to charge ten and elevenpence for it
at first she wanted to take it back but when she tried it on she was delighted with it especially with the make of the sleeves and kissed him and said he was very good to think of her
hm
he looked coldly into the eyes of the photograph and they answered coldly
certainly they were pretty and the face itself was pretty
but he found something mean in it
why was it so unconscious and ladylike
the composure of the eyes irritated him
they repelled him and defied him there was no passion in them no rapture
he thought of what gallaher had said about rich jewesses
those dark oriental eyes he thought how full they are of passion of voluptuous longing
why had he married the eyes in the photograph
he caught himself up at the question and glanced nervously round the room
he found something mean in the pretty furniture which he had bought for his house on the hire system
annie had chosen it herself and it reminded him of her
it too was prim and pretty
a dull resentment against his life awoke within him
could he not escape from his little house
was it too late for him to try to live bravely like gallaher
could he go to london
there was the furniture still to be paid for
if he could only write a book and get it published that might open the way for him
a volume of byrons poems lay before him on the table
he opened it cautiously with his left hand lest he should waken the child and began to read the first poem in the book       hushed are the winds and still the evening gloom          not een a zephyr wanders through the grove      whilst i return to view my margarets tomb          and scatter flowers on the dust i love  he paused
he felt the rhythm of the verse about him in the room
how melancholy it was
could he too write like that express the melancholy of his soul in verse
there were so many things he wanted to describe his sensation of a few hours before on grattan bridge for example
if he could get back again into that mood
the child awoke and began to cry
he turned from the page and tried to hush it but it would not be hushed
he began to rock it to and fro in his arms but its wailing cry grew keener
he rocked it faster while his eyes began to read the second stanza       within this narrow cell reclines her clay          that clay where once  it was useless
he couldnt read
he couldnt do anything
the wailing of the child pierced the drum of his ear
it was useless useless
he was a prisoner for life
his arms trembled with anger and suddenly bending to the childs face he shouted  stop  the child stopped for an instant had a spasm of fright and began to scream
he jumped up from his chair and walked hastily up and down the room with the child in his arms
it began to sob piteously losing its breath for four or five seconds and then bursting out anew
the thin walls of the room echoed the sound
he tried to soothe it but it sobbed more convulsively
he looked at the contracted and quivering face of the child and began to be alarmed
he counted seven sobs without a break between them and caught the child to his breast in fright
if it died
the door was burst open and a young woman ran in panting
what is it
what is it she cried
the child hearing its mothers voice broke out into a paroxysm of sobbing
its nothing annie  its nothing
he began to cry  she flung her parcels on the floor and snatched the child from him
what have you done to him she cried glaring into his face
little chandler sustained for one moment the gaze of her eyes and his heart closed together as he met the hatred in them
he began to stammer  its nothing
he  he began to cry
i couldnt 
i didnt do anything what  giving no heed to him she began to walk up and down the room clasping the child tightly in her arms and murmuring  my little man
my little mannie
was ou frightened love
there now love
there now
lambabaun
mammas little lamb of the world
there now  little chandler felt his cheeks suffused with shame and he stood back out of the lamplight
he listened while the paroxysm of the childs sobbing grew less and less and tears of remorse started to his eyes
counterparts   the bell rang furiously and when miss parker went to the tube a furious voice called out in a piercing north of ireland accent  send farrington here  miss parker returned to her machine saying to a man who was writing at a desk  mr alleyne wants you upstairs  the man muttered blast him under his breath and pushed back his chair to stand up
when he stood up he was tall and of great bulk
he had a hanging face dark winecoloured with fair eyebrows and moustache his eyes bulged forward slightly and the whites of them were dirty
he lifted up the counter and passing by the clients went out of the office with a heavy step
he went heavily upstairs until he came to the second landing where a door bore a brass plate with the inscription mr alleyne
here he halted puffing with labour and vexation and knocked
the shrill voice cried  come in  the man entered mr alleynes room
simultaneously mr alleyne a little man wearing goldrimmed glasses on a cleanshaven face shot his head up over a pile of documents
the head itself was so pink and hairless it seemed like a large egg reposing on the papers
mr alleyne did not lose a moment  farrington
what is the meaning of this
why have i always to complain of you
may i ask you why you havent made a copy of that contract between bodley and kirwan
i told you it must be ready by four oclock  but mr shelley said sir  mr shelley said sir kindly attend to what i say and not to what mr shelley says sir
you have always some excuse or another for shirking work
let me tell you that if the contract is not copied before this evening ill lay the matter before mr crosbie do you hear me now  yes sir  do you hear me now
ay and another little matter
i might as well be talking to the wall as talking to you
understand once for all that you get a half an hour for your lunch and not an hour and a half
how many courses do you want id like to know do you mind me now  yes sir  mr alleyne bent his head again upon his pile of papers
the man stared fixedly at the polished skull which directed the affairs of crosbie  alleyne gauging its fragility
a spasm of rage gripped his throat for a few moments and then passed leaving after it a sharp sensation of thirst
the man recognised the sensation and felt that he must have a good nights drinking
the middle of the month was passed and if he could get the copy done in time mr alleyne might give him an order on the cashier
he stood still gazing fixedly at the head upon the pile of papers
suddenly mr alleyne began to upset all the papers searching for something
then as if he had been unaware of the mans presence till that moment he shot up his head again saying  eh
are you going to stand there all day
upon my word farrington you take things easy  i was waiting to see  very good you neednt wait to see
go downstairs and do your work  the man walked heavily towards the door and as he went out of the room he heard mr alleyne cry after him that if the contract was not copied by evening mr crosbie would hear of the matter
he returned to his desk in the lower office and counted the sheets which remained to be copied
he took up his pen and dipped it in the ink but he continued to stare stupidly at the last words he had written in no case shall the said bernard bodley be the evening was falling and in a few minutes they would be lighting the gas then he could write
he felt that he must slake the thirst in his throat
he stood up from his desk and lifting the counter as before passed out of the office
as he was passing out the chief clerk looked at him inquiringly
its all right mr shelley said the man pointing with his finger to indicate the objective of his journey
the chief clerk glanced at the hatrack but seeing the row complete offered no remark
as soon as he was on the landing the man pulled a shepherds plaid cap out of his pocket put it on his head and ran quickly down the rickety stairs
from the street door he walked on furtively on the inner side of the path towards the corner and all at once dived into a doorway
he was now safe in the dark snug of oneills shop and filling up the little window that looked into the bar with his inflamed face the colour of dark wine or dark meat he called out  here pat give us a gp like a good fellow  the curate brought him a glass of plain porter
the man drank it at a gulp and asked for a caraway seed
he put his penny on the counter and leaving the curate to grope for it in the gloom retreated out of the snug as furtively as he had entered it
darkness accompanied by a thick fog was gaining upon the dusk of february and the lamps in eustace street had been lit
the man went up by the houses until he reached the door of the office wondering whether he could finish his copy in time
on the stairs a moist pungent odour of perfumes saluted his nose evidently miss delacour had come while he was out in oneills
he crammed his cap back again into his pocket and reentered the office assuming an air of absentmindedness
mr alleyne has been calling for you said the chief clerk severely
where were you  the man glanced at the two clients who were standing at the counter as if to intimate that their presence prevented him from answering
as the clients were both male the chief clerk allowed himself a laugh
i know that game he said
five times in one day is a little bit well you better look sharp and get a copy of our correspondence in the delacour case for mr alleyne  this address in the presence of the public his run upstairs and the porter he had gulped down so hastily confused the man and as he sat down at his desk to get what was required he realised how hopeless was the task of finishing his copy of the contract before half past five
the dark damp night was coming and he longed to spend it in the bars drinking with his friends amid the glare of gas and the clatter of glasses
he got out the delacour correspondence and passed out of the office
he hoped mr alleyne would not discover that the last two letters were missing
the moist pungent perfume lay all the way up to mr alleynes room
miss delacour was a middleaged woman of jewish appearance
mr alleyne was said to be sweet on her or on her money
she came to the office often and stayed a long time when she came
she was sitting beside his desk now in an aroma of perfumes smoothing the handle of her umbrella and nodding the great black feather in her hat
mr alleyne had swivelled his chair round to face her and thrown his right foot jauntily upon his left knee
the man put the correspondence on the desk and bowed respectfully but neither mr alleyne nor miss delacour took any notice of his bow
mr alleyne tapped a finger on the correspondence and then flicked it towards him as if to say thats all right you can go  the man returned to the lower office and sat down again at his desk
he stared intently at the incomplete phrase in no case shall the said bernard bodley be  and thought how strange it was that the last three words began with the same letter
the chief clerk began to hurry miss parker saying she would never have the letters typed in time for post
the man listened to the clicking of the machine for a few minutes and then set to work to finish his copy
but his head was not clear and his mind wandered away to the glare and rattle of the publichouse
it was a night for hot punches
he struggled on with his copy but when the clock struck five he had still fourteen pages to write
blast it
he couldnt finish it in time
he longed to execrate aloud to bring his fist down on something violently
he was so enraged that he wrote bernard bernard instead of bernard bodley and had to begin again on a clean sheet
he felt strong enough to clear out the whole office singlehanded
his body ached to do something to rush out and revel in violence
all the indignities of his life enraged him could he ask the cashier privately for an advance
no the cashier was no good no damn good he wouldnt give an advance
he knew where he would meet the boys leonard and ohalloran and nosey flynn
the barometer of his emotional nature was set for a spell of riot
his imagination had so abstracted him that his name was called twice before he answered
mr alleyne and miss delacour were standing outside the counter and all the clerks had turned round in anticipation of something
the man got up from his desk
mr alleyne began a tirade of abuse saying that two letters were missing
the man answered that he knew nothing about them that he had made a faithful copy
the tirade continued it was so bitter and violent that the man could hardly restrain his fist from descending upon the head of the manikin before him  i know nothing about any other two letters he said stupidly
youknownothing
of course you know nothing said mr alleyne
tell me he added glancing first for approval to the lady beside him do you take me for a fool
do you think me an utter fool  the man glanced from the ladys face to the little eggshaped head and back again and almost before he was aware of it his tongue had found a felicitous moment  i dont think sir he said that thats a fair question to put to me  there was a pause in the very breathing of the clerks
everyone was astounded the author of the witticism no less than his neighbours and miss delacour who was a stout amiable person began to smile broadly
mr alleyne flushed to the hue of a wild rose and his mouth twitched with a dwarfs passion
he shook his fist in the mans face till it seemed to vibrate like the knob of some electric machine  you impertinent ruffian
you impertinent ruffian
ill make short work of you
wait till you see
youll apologise to me for your impertinence or youll quit the office instanter
youll quit this im telling you or youll apologise to me   he stood in a doorway opposite the office watching to see if the cashier would come out alone
all the clerks passed out and finally the cashier came out with the chief clerk
it was no use trying to say a word to him when he was with the chief clerk
the man felt that his position was bad enough
he had been obliged to offer an abject apology to mr alleyne for his impertinence but he knew what a hornets nest the office would be for him
he could remember the way in which mr alleyne had hounded little peake out of the office in order to make room for his own nephew
he felt savage and thirsty and revengeful annoyed with himself and with everyone else
mr alleyne would never give him an hours rest his life would be a hell to him
he had made a proper fool of himself this time
could he not keep his tongue in his cheek
but they had never pulled together from the first he and mr alleyne ever since the day mr alleyne had overheard him mimicking his north of ireland accent to amuse higgins and miss parker that had been the beginning of it
he might have tried higgins for the money but sure higgins never had anything for himself
a man with two establishments to keep up of course he couldnt
he felt his great body again aching for the comfort of the publichouse
the fog had begun to chill him and he wondered could he touch pat in oneills
he could not touch him for more than a boband a bob was no use
yet he must get money somewhere or other he had spent his last penny for the gp
and soon it would be too late for getting money anywhere
suddenly as he was fingering his watchchain he thought of terry kellys pawnoffice in fleet street
that was the dart
why didnt he think of it sooner
he went through the narrow alley of temple bar quickly muttering to himself that they could all go to hell because he was going to have a good night of it
the clerk in terry kellys said a crown but the consignor held out for six shillings and in the end the six shillings was allowed him literally
he came out of the pawnoffice joyfully making a little cylinder of the coins between his thumb and fingers
in westmoreland street the footpaths were crowded with young men and women returning from business and ragged urchins ran here and there yelling out the names of the evening editions
the man passed through the crowd looking on the spectacle generally with proud satisfaction and staring masterfully at the officegirls
his head was full of the noises of tramgongs and swishing trolleys and his nose already sniffed the curling fumes of punch
as he walked on he preconsidered the terms in which he would narrate the incident to the boys  so i just looked at himcoolly you know and looked at her
then i looked back at him againtaking my time you know
i dont think that thats a fair question to put to me says i  nosey flynn was sitting up in his usual corner of davy byrnes and when he heard the story he stood farrington a halfone saying it was as smart a thing as ever he heard
farrington stood a drink in his turn
after a while ohalloran and paddy leonard came in and the story was repeated to them
ohalloran stood tailors of malt hot all round and told the story of the retort he had made to the chief clerk when he was in callans of fowness street but as the retort was after the manner of the liberal shepherds in the eclogues he had to admit that it was not as clever as farringtons retort
at this farrington told the boys to polish off that and have another
just as they were naming their poisons who should come in but higgins
of course he had to join in with the others
the men asked him to give his version of it and he did so with great vivacity for the sight of five small hot whiskies was very exhilarating
everyone roared laughing when he showed the way in which mr alleyne shook his fist in farringtons face
then he imitated farrington saying and here was my nabs as cool as you please while farrington looked at the company out of his heavy dirty eyes smiling and at times drawing forth stray drops of liquor from his moustache with the aid of his lower lip
when that round was over there was a pause
ohalloran had money but neither of the other two seemed to have any so the whole party left the shop somewhat regretfully
at the corner of duke street higgins and nosey flynn bevelled off to the left while the other three turned back towards the city
rain was drizzling down on the cold streets and when they reached the ballast office farrington suggested the scotch house
the bar was full of men and loud with the noise of tongues and glasses
the three men pushed past the whining matchsellers at the door and formed a little party at the corner of the counter
they began to exchange stories
leonard introduced them to a young fellow named weathers who was performing at the tivoli as an acrobat and knockabout artiste
farrington stood a drink all round
weathers said he would take a small irish and apollinaris
farrington who had definite notions of what was what asked the boys would they have an apollinaris too but the boys told tim to make theirs hot
the talk became theatrical
ohalloran stood a round and then farrington stood another round weathers protesting that the hospitality was too irish
he promised to get them in behind the scenes and introduce them to some nice girls
ohalloran said that he and leonard would go but that farrington wouldnt go because he was a married man and farringtons heavy dirty eyes leered at the company in token that he understood he was being chaffed
weathers made them all have just one little tincture at his expense and promised to meet them later on at mulligans in poolbeg street
when the scotch house closed they went round to mulligans
they went into the parlour at the back and ohalloran ordered small hot specials all round
they were all beginning to feel mellow
farrington was just standing another round when weathers came back
much to farringtons relief he drank a glass of bitter this time
funds were getting low but they had enough to keep them going
presently two young women with big hats and a young man in a check suit came in and sat at a table close by
weathers saluted them and told the company that they were out of the tivoli
farringtons eyes wandered at every moment in the direction of one of the young women
there was something striking in her appearance
an immense scarf of peacockblue muslin was wound round her hat and knotted in a great bow under her chin and she wore bright yellow gloves reaching to the elbow
farrington gazed admiringly at the plump arm which she moved very often and with much grace and when after a little time she answered his gaze he admired still more her large dark brown eyes
the oblique staring expression in them fascinated him
she glanced at him once or twice and when the party was leaving the room she brushed against his chair and said o pardon in a london accent
he watched her leave the room in the hope that she would look back at him but he was disappointed
he cursed his want of money and cursed all the rounds he had stood particularly all the whiskies and apollinaris which he had stood to weathers
if there was one thing that he hated it was a sponge
he was so angry that he lost count of the conversation of his friends
when paddy leonard called him he found that they were talking about feats of strength
weathers was showing his biceps muscle to the company and boasting so much that the other two had called on farrington to uphold the national honour
farrington pulled up his sleeve accordingly and showed his biceps muscle to the company
the two arms were examined and compared and finally it was agreed to have a trial of strength
the table was cleared and the two men rested their elbows on it clasping hands
when paddy leonard said go each was to try to bring down the others hand on to the table
farrington looked very serious and determined
the trial began
after about thirty seconds weathers brought his opponents hand slowly down on to the table
farringtons dark winecoloured face flushed darker still with anger and humiliation at having been defeated by such a stripling
youre not to put the weight of your body behind it
play fair he said
whos not playing fair said the other
come on again
the two best out of three  the trial began again
the veins stood out on farringtons forehead and the pallor of weathers complexion changed to peony
their hands and arms trembled under the stress
after a long struggle weathers again brought his opponents hand slowly on to the table
there was a murmur of applause from the spectators
the curate who was standing beside the table nodded his red head towards the victor and said with stupid familiarity  ah
thats the knack  what the hell do you know about it said farrington fiercely turning on the man
what do you put in your gab for  sh sh said ohalloran observing the violent expression of farringtons face
pony up boys
well have just one little smahan more and then well be off   a very sullenfaced man stood at the corner of oconnell bridge waiting for the little sandymount tram to take him home
he was full of smouldering anger and revengefulness
he felt humiliated and discontented he did not even feel drunk and he had only twopence in his pocket
he cursed everything
he had done for himself in the office pawned his watch spent all his money and he had not even got drunk
he began to feel thirsty again and he longed to be back again in the hot reeking publichouse
he had lost his reputation as a strong man having been defeated twice by a mere boy
his heart swelled with fury and when he thought of the woman in the big hat who had brushed against him and said pardon his fury nearly choked him
his tram let him down at shelbourne road and he steered his great body along in the shadow of the wall of the barracks
he loathed returning to his home
when he went in by the sidedoor he found the kitchen empty and the kitchen fire nearly out
he bawled upstairs  ada
ada  his wife was a little sharpfaced woman who bullied her husband when he was sober and was bullied by him when he was drunk
they had five children
a little boy came running down the stairs
who is that said the man peering through the darkness
me pa  who are you
charlie  no pa tom  wheres your mother  shes out at the chapel  thats right did she think of leaving any dinner for me  yes pa i  light the lamp
what do you mean by having the place in darkness
are the other children in bed  the man sat down heavily on one of the chairs while the little boy lit the lamp
he began to mimic his sons flat accent saying half to himself at the chapel
at the chapel if you please when the lamp was lit he banged his fist on the table and shouted  whats for my dinner  im going  to cook it pa said the little boy
the man jumped up furiously and pointed to the fire
on that fire
you let the fire out
by god ill teach you to do that again  he took a step to the door and seized the walkingstick which was standing behind it
ill teach you to let the fire out he said rolling up his sleeve in order to give his arm free play
the little boy cried o pa and ran whimpering round the table but the man followed him and caught him by the coat
the little boy looked about him wildly but seeing no way of escape fell upon his knees
now youll let the fire out the next time said the man striking at him vigorously with the stick
take that you little whelp  the boy uttered a squeal of pain as the stick cut his thigh
he clasped his hands together in the air and his voice shook with fright
o pa he cried
dont beat me pa
and ill  ill say a hail mary for you ill say a hail mary for you pa if you dont beat me ill say a hail mary     clay   the matron had given her leave to go out as soon as the womens tea was over and maria looked forward to her evening out
the kitchen was spick and span the cook said you could see yourself in the big copper boilers
the fire was nice and bright and on one of the sidetables were four very big barmbracks
these barmbracks seemed uncut but if you went closer you would see that they had been cut into long thick even slices and were ready to be handed round at tea
maria had cut them herself
maria was a very very small person indeed but she had a very long nose and a very long chin
she talked a little through her nose always soothingly yes my dear and no my dear she was always sent for when the women quarrelled over their tubs and always succeeded in making peace
one day the matron had said to her  maria you are a veritable peacemaker  and the submatron and two of the board ladies had heard the compliment
and ginger mooney was always saying what she wouldnt do to the dummy who had charge of the irons if it wasnt for maria
everyone was so fond of maria
the women would have their tea at six oclock and she would be able to get away before seven
from ballsbridge to the pillar twenty minutes from the pillar to drumcondra twenty minutes and twenty minutes to buy the things
she would be there before eight
she took out her purse with the silver clasps and read again the words a present from belfast
she was very fond of that purse because joe had brought it to her five years before when he and alphy had gone to belfast on a whitmonday trip
in the purse were two halfcrowns and some coppers
she would have five shillings clear after paying tram fare
what a nice evening they would have all the children singing
only she hoped that joe wouldnt come in drunk
he was so different when he took any drink
often he had wanted her to go and live with them but she would have felt herself in the way though joes wife was ever so nice with her and she had become accustomed to the life of the laundry
joe was a good fellow
she had nursed him and alphy too and joe used often say  mamma is mamma but maria is my proper mother  after the breakup at home the boys had got her that position in the dublin by lamplight laundry and she liked it
she used to have such a bad opinion of protestants but now she thought they were very nice people a little quiet and serious but still very nice people to live with
then she had her plants in the conservatory and she liked looking after them
she had lovely ferns and waxplants and whenever anyone came to visit her she always gave the visitor one or two slips from her conservatory
there was one thing she didnt like and that was the tracts on the walks but the matron was such a nice person to deal with so genteel
when the cook told her everything was ready she went into the womens room and began to pull the big bell
in a few minutes the women began to come in by twos and threes wiping their steaming hands in their petticoats and pulling down the sleeves of their blouses over their red steaming arms
they settled down before their huge mugs which the cook and the dummy filled up with hot tea already mixed with milk and sugar in huge tin cans
maria superintended the distribution of the barmbrack and saw that every woman got her four slices
there was a great deal of laughing and joking during the meal
lizzie fleming said maria was sure to get the ring and though fleming had said that for so many hallow eves maria had to laugh and say she didnt want any ring or man either and when she laughed her greygreen eyes sparkled with disappointed shyness and the tip of her nose nearly met the tip of her chin
then ginger mooney lifted up her mug of tea and proposed marias health while all the other women clattered with their mugs on the table and said she was sorry she hadnt a sup of porter to drink it in
and maria laughed again till the tip of her nose nearly met the tip of her chin and till her minute body nearly shook itself asunder because she knew that mooney meant well though of course she had the notions of a common woman
but wasnt maria glad when the women had finished their tea and the cook and the dummy had begun to clear away the teathings
she went into her little bedroom and remembering that the next morning was a mass morning changed the hand of the alarm from seven to six
then she took off her working skirt and her houseboots and laid her best skirt out on the bed and her tiny dressboots beside the foot of the bed
she changed her blouse too and as she stood before the mirror she thought of how she used to dress for mass on sunday morning when she was a young girl and she looked with quaint affection at the diminutive body which she had so often adorned
in spite of its years she found it a nice tidy little body
when she got outside the streets were shining with rain and she was glad of her old brown waterproof
the tram was full and she had to sit on the little stool at the end of the car facing all the people with her toes barely touching the floor
she arranged in her mind all she was going to do and thought how much better it was to be independent and to have your own money in your pocket
she hoped they would have a nice evening
she was sure they would but she could not help thinking what a pity it was alphy and joe were not speaking
they were always falling out now but when they were boys together they used to be the best of friends but such was life
she got out of her tram at the pillar and ferreted her way quickly among the crowds
she went into downess cakeshop but the shop was so full of people that it was a long time before she could get herself attended to
she bought a dozen of mixed penny cakes and at last came out of the shop laden with a big bag
then she thought what else would she buy she wanted to buy something really nice
they would be sure to have plenty of apples and nuts
it was hard to know what to buy and all she could think of was cake
she decided to buy some plumcake but downess plumcake had not enough almond icing on top of it so she went over to a shop in henry street
here she was a long time in suiting herself and the stylish young lady behind the counter who was evidently a little annoyed by her asked her was it weddingcake she wanted to buy
that made maria blush and smile at the young lady but the young lady took it all very seriously and finally cut a thick slice of plumcake parcelled it up and said  twoandfour please  she thought she would have to stand in the drumcondra tram because none of the young men seemed to notice her but an elderly gentleman made room for her
he was a stout gentleman and he wore a brown hard hat he had a square red face and a greyish moustache
maria thought he was a colonellooking gentleman and she reflected how much more polite he was than the young men who simply stared straight before them
the gentleman began to chat with her about hallow eve and the rainy weather
he supposed the bag was full of good things for the little ones and said it was only right that the youngsters should enjoy themselves while they were young
maria agreed with him and favoured him with demure nods and hems
he was very nice with her and when she was getting out at the canal bridge she thanked him and bowed and he bowed to her and raised his hat and smiled agreeably and while she was going up along the terrace bending her tiny head under the rain she thought how easy it was to know a gentleman even when he has a drop taken
everybody said o heres maria when she came to joes house
joe was there having come home from business and all the children had their sunday dresses on
there were two big girls in from next door and games were going on
maria gave the bag of cakes to the eldest boy alphy to divide and mrs donnelly said it was too good of her to bring such a big bag of cakes and made all the children say  thanks maria  but maria said she had brought something special for papa and mamma something they would be sure to like and she began to look for her plumcake
she tried in downess bag and then in the pockets of her waterproof and then on the hallstand but nowhere could she find it
then she asked all the children had any of them eaten itby mistake of coursebut the children all said no and looked as if they did not like to eat cakes if they were to be accused of stealing
everybody had a solution for the mystery and mrs donnelly said it was plain that maria had left it behind her in the tram
maria remembering how confused the gentleman with the greyish moustache had made her coloured with shame and vexation and disappointment
at the thought of the failure of her little surprise and of the two and fourpence she had thrown away for nothing she nearly cried outright
but joe said it didnt matter and made her sit down by the fire
he was very nice with her
he told her all that went on in his office repeating for her a smart answer which he had made to the manager
maria did not understand why joe laughed so much over the answer he had made but she said that the manager must have been a very overbearing person to deal with
joe said he wasnt so bad when you knew how to take him that he was a decent sort so long as you didnt rub him the wrong way
mrs donnelly played the piano for the children and they danced and sang
then the two nextdoor girls handed round the nuts
nobody could find the nutcrackers and joe was nearly getting cross over it and asked how did they expect maria to crack nuts without a nutcracker
but maria said she didnt like nuts and that they werent to bother about her
then joe asked would she take a bottle of stout and mrs donnelly said there was port wine too in the house if she would prefer that
maria said she would rather they didnt ask her to take anything but joe insisted
so maria let him have his way and they sat by the fire talking over old times and maria thought she would put in a good word for alphy
but joe cried that god might strike him stone dead if ever he spoke a word to his brother again and maria said she was sorry she had mentioned the matter
mrs donnelly told her husband it was a great shame for him to speak that way of his own flesh and blood but joe said that alphy was no brother of his and there was nearly being a row on the head of it
but joe said he would not lose his temper on account of the night it was and asked his wife to open some more stout
the two nextdoor girls had arranged some hallow eve games and soon everything was merry again
maria was delighted to see the children so merry and joe and his wife in such good spirits
the nextdoor girls put some saucers on the table and then led the children up to the table blindfold
one got the prayerbook and the other three got the water and when one of the nextdoor girls got the ring mrs donnelly shook her finger at the blushing girl as much as to say o i know all about it they insisted then on blindfolding maria and leading her up to the table to see what she would get and while they were putting on the bandage maria laughed and laughed again till the tip of her nose nearly met the tip of her chin
they led her up to the table amid laughing and joking and she put her hand out in the air as she was told to do
she moved her hand about here and there in the air and descended on one of the saucers
she felt a soft wet substance with her fingers and was surprised that nobody spoke or took off her bandage
there was a pause for a few seconds and then a great deal of scuffling and whispering
somebody said something about the garden and at last mrs donnelly said something very cross to one of the nextdoor girls and told her to throw it out at once that was no play
maria understood that it was wrong that time and so she had to do it over again and this time she got the prayerbook
after that mrs donnelly played miss mcclouds reel for the children and joe made maria take a glass of wine
soon they were all quite merry again and mrs donnelly said maria would enter a convent before the year was out because she had got the prayerbook
maria had never seen joe so nice to her as he was that night so full of pleasant talk and reminiscences
she said they were all very good to her
at last the children grew tired and sleepy and joe asked maria would she not sing some little song before she went one of the old songs
mrs donnelly said do please maria and so maria had to get up and stand beside the piano
mrs donnelly bade the children be quiet and listen to marias song
then she played the prelude and said now maria and maria blushing very much began to sing in a tiny quavering voice
she sang i dreamt that i dwelt and when she came to the second verse she sang again       i dreamt that i dwelt in marble halls          with vassals and serfs at my side      and of all who assembled within those walls          that i was the hope and the pride
i had riches too great to count could boast          of a high ancestral name      but i also dreamt which pleased me most          that you loved me still the same  but no one tried to show her her mistake and when she had ended her song joe was very much moved
he said that there was no time like the long ago and no music for him like poor old balfe whatever other people might say and his eyes filled up so much with tears that he could not find what he was looking for and in the end he had to ask his wife to tell him where the corkscrew was
a painful case   mr james duffy lived in chapelizod because he wished to live as far as possible from the city of which he was a citizen and because he found all the other suburbs of dublin mean modern and pretentious
he lived in an old sombre house and from his windows he could look into the disused distillery or upwards along the shallow river on which dublin is built
the lofty walls of his uncarpeted room were free from pictures
he had himself bought every article of furniture in the room a black iron bedstead an iron washstand four cane chairs a clothesrack a coalscuttle a fender and irons and a square table on which lay a double desk
a bookcase had been made in an alcove by means of shelves of white wood
the bed was clothed with white bedclothes and a black and scarlet rug covered the foot
a little handmirror hung above the washstand and during the day a whiteshaded lamp stood as the sole ornament of the mantelpiece
the books on the white wooden shelves were arranged from below upwards according to bulk
a complete wordsworth stood at one end of the lowest shelf and a copy of the maynooth catechism sewn into the cloth cover of a notebook stood at one end of the top shelf
writing materials were always on the desk
in the desk lay a manuscript translation of hauptmanns michael kramer the stage directions of which were written in purple ink and a little sheaf of papers held together by a brass pin
in these sheets a sentence was inscribed from time to time and in an ironical moment the headline of an advertisement for bile beans had been pasted on to the first sheet
on lifting the lid of the desk a faint fragrance escapedthe fragrance of new cedarwood pencils or of a bottle of gum or of an overripe apple which might have been left there and forgotten
mr duffy abhorred anything which betokened physical or mental disorder
a medival doctor would have called him saturnine
his face which carried the entire tale of his years was of the brown tint of dublin streets
on his long and rather large head grew dry black hair and a tawny moustache did not quite cover an unamiable mouth
his cheekbones also gave his face a harsh character but there was no harshness in the eyes which looking at the world from under their tawny eyebrows gave the impression of a man ever alert to greet a redeeming instinct in others but often disappointed
he lived at a little distance from his body regarding his own acts with doubtful sideglances
he had an odd autobiographical habit which led him to compose in his mind from time to time a short sentence about himself containing a subject in the third person and a predicate in the past tense
he never gave alms to beggars and walked firmly carrying a stout hazel
he had been for many years cashier of a private bank in baggot street
every morning he came in from chapelizod by tram
at midday he went to dan burkes and took his luncha bottle of lager beer and a small trayful of arrowroot biscuits
at four oclock he was set free
he dined in an eatinghouse in georges street where he felt himself safe from the society of dublins gilded youth and where there was a certain plain honesty in the bill of fare
his evenings were spent either before his landladys piano or roaming about the outskirts of the city
his liking for mozarts music brought him sometimes to an opera or a concert these were the only dissipations of his life
he had neither companions nor friends church nor creed
he lived his spiritual life without any communion with others visiting his relatives at christmas and escorting them to the cemetery when they died
he performed these two social duties for old dignitys sake but conceded nothing further to the conventions which regulate the civic life
he allowed himself to think that in certain circumstances he would rob his bank but as these circumstances never arose his life rolled out evenlyan adventureless tale
one evening he found himself sitting beside two ladies in the rotunda
the house thinly peopled and silent gave distressing prophecy of failure
the lady who sat next him looked round at the deserted house once or twice and then said  what a pity there is such a poor house tonight
its so hard on people to have to sing to empty benches  he took the remark as an invitation to talk
he was surprised that she seemed so little awkward
while they talked he tried to fix her permanently in his memory
when he learned that the young girl beside her was her daughter he judged her to be a year or so younger than himself
her face which must have been handsome had remained intelligent
it was an oval face with strongly marked features
the eyes were very dark blue and steady
their gaze began with a defiant note but was confused by what seemed a deliberate swoon of the pupil into the iris revealing for an instant a temperament of great sensibility
the pupil reasserted itself quickly this halfdisclosed nature fell again under the reign of prudence and her astrakhan jacket moulding a bosom of a certain fullness struck the note of defiance more definitely
he met her again a few weeks afterwards at a concert in earlsfort terrace and seized the moments when her daughters attention was diverted to become intimate
she alluded once or twice to her husband but her tone was not such as to make the allusion a warning
her name was mrs sinico
her husbands greatgreatgrandfather had come from leghorn
her husband was captain of a mercantile boat plying between dublin and holland and they had one child
meeting her a third time by accident he found courage to make an appointment
she came
this was the first of many meetings they met always in the evening and chose the most quiet quarters for their walks together
mr duffy however had a distaste for underhand ways and finding that they were compelled to meet stealthily he forced her to ask him to her house
captain sinico encouraged his visits thinking that his daughters hand was in question
he had dismissed his wife so sincerely from his gallery of pleasures that he did not suspect that anyone else would take an interest in her
as the husband was often away and the daughter out giving music lessons mr duffy had many opportunities of enjoying the ladys society
neither he nor she had had any such adventure before and neither was conscious of any incongruity
little by little he entangled his thoughts with hers
he lent her books provided her with ideas shared his intellectual life with her
she listened to all
sometimes in return for his theories she gave out some fact of her own life
with almost maternal solicitude she urged him to let his nature open to the full she became his confessor
he told her that for some time he had assisted at the meetings of an irish socialist party where he had felt himself a unique figure amidst a score of sober workmen in a garret lit by an inefficient oillamp
when the party had divided into three sections each under its own leader and in its own garret he had discontinued his attendances
the workmens discussions he said were too timorous the interest they took in the question of wages was inordinate
he felt that they were hardfeatured realists and that they resented an exactitude which was the produce of a leisure not within their reach
no social revolution he told her would be likely to strike dublin for some centuries
she asked him why did he not write out his thoughts
for what he asked her with careful scorn
to compete with phrasemongers incapable of thinking consecutively for sixty seconds
to submit himself to the criticisms of an obtuse middle class which entrusted its morality to policemen and its fine arts to impresarios
he went often to her little cottage outside dublin often they spent their evenings alone
little by little as their thoughts entangled they spoke of subjects less remote
her companionship was like a warm soil about an exotic
many times she allowed the dark to fall upon them refraining from lighting the lamp
the dark discreet room their isolation the music that still vibrated in their ears united them
this union exalted him wore away the rough edges of his character emotionalised his mental life
sometimes he caught himself listening to the sound of his own voice
he thought that in her eyes he would ascend to an angelical stature and as he attached the fervent nature of his companion more and more closely to him he heard the strange impersonal voice which he recognised as his own insisting on the souls incurable loneliness
we cannot give ourselves it said we are our own
the end of these discourses was that one night during which she had shown every sign of unusual excitement mrs sinico caught up his hand passionately and pressed it to her cheek
mr duffy was very much surprised
her interpretation of his words disillusioned him
he did not visit her for a week then he wrote to her asking her to meet him
as he did not wish their last interview to be troubled by the influence of their ruined confessional they met in a little cakeshop near the parkgate
it was cold autumn weather but in spite of the cold they wandered up and down the roads of the park for nearly three hours
they agreed to break off their intercourse every bond he said is a bond to sorrow
when they came out of the park they walked in silence towards the tram but here she began to tremble so violently that fearing another collapse on her part he bade her goodbye quickly and left her
a few days later he received a parcel containing his books and music
four years passed
mr duffy returned to his even way of life
his room still bore witness of the orderliness of his mind
some new pieces of music encumbered the musicstand in the lower room and on his shelves stood two volumes by nietzsche thus spake zarathustra and the gay science
he wrote seldom in the sheaf of papers which lay in his desk
one of his sentences written two months after his last interview with mrs sinico read love between man and man is impossible because there must not be sexual intercourse and friendship between man and woman is impossible because there must be sexual intercourse
he kept away from concerts lest he should meet her
his father died the junior partner of the bank retired
and still every morning he went into the city by tram and every evening walked home from the city after having dined moderately in georges street and read the evening paper for dessert
one evening as he was about to put a morsel of corned beef and cabbage into his mouth his hand stopped
his eyes fixed themselves on a paragraph in the evening paper which he had propped against the watercarafe
he replaced the morsel of food on his plate and read the paragraph attentively
then he drank a glass of water pushed his plate to one side doubled the paper down before him between his elbows and read the paragraph over and over again
the cabbage began to deposit a cold white grease on his plate
the girl came over to him to ask was his dinner not properly cooked
he said it was very good and ate a few mouthfuls of it with difficulty
then he paid his bill and went out
he walked along quickly through the november twilight his stout hazel stick striking the ground regularly the fringe of the buff mail peeping out of a sidepocket of his tight reefer overcoat
on the lonely road which leads from the parkgate to chapelizod he slackened his pace
his stick struck the ground less emphatically and his breath issuing irregularly almost with a sighing sound condensed in the wintry air
when he reached his house he went up at once to his bedroom and taking the paper from his pocket read the paragraph again by the failing light of the window
he read it not aloud but moving his lips as a priest does when he reads the prayers secreto
this was the paragraph       death of a lady at sydney parade       a painful case  today at the city of dublin hospital the deputy coroner in the absence of mr leverett held an inquest on the body of mrs emily sinico aged fortythree years who was killed at sydney parade station yesterday evening
the evidence showed that the deceased lady while attempting to cross the line was knocked down by the engine of the ten oclock slow train from kingstown thereby sustaining injuries of the head and right side which led to her death
james lennon driver of the engine stated that he had been in the employment of the railway company for fifteen years
on hearing the guards whistle he set the train in motion and a second or two afterwards brought it to rest in response to loud cries
the train was going slowly
p dunne railway porter stated that as the train was about to start he observed a woman attempting to cross the lines
he ran towards her and shouted but before he could reach her she was caught by the buffer of the engine and fell to the ground
a juror
you saw the lady fall  witness
yes  police sergeant croly deposed that when he arrived he found the deceased lying on the platform apparently dead
he had the body taken to the waitingroom pending the arrival of the ambulance
constable e corroborated
dr halpin assistant house surgeon of the city of dublin hospital stated that the deceased had two lower ribs fractured and had sustained severe contusions of the right shoulder
the right side of the head had been injured in the fall
the injuries were not sufficient to have caused death in a normal person
death in his opinion had been probably due to shock and sudden failure of the hearts action
mr h b patterson finlay on behalf of the railway company expressed his deep regret at the accident
the company had always taken every precaution to prevent people crossing the lines except by the bridges both by placing notices in every station and by the use of patent spring gates at level crossings
the deceased had been in the habit of crossing the lines late at night from platform to platform and in view of certain other circumstances of the case he did not think the railway officials were to blame
captain sinico of leoville sydney parade husband of the deceased also gave evidence
he stated that the deceased was his wife
he was not in dublin at the time of the accident as he had arrived only that morning from rotterdam
they had been married for twentytwo years and had lived happily until about two years ago when his wife began to be rather intemperate in her habits
miss mary sinico said that of late her mother had been in the habit of going out at night to buy spirits
she witness had often tried to reason with her mother and had induced her to join a league
she was not at home until an hour after the accident
the jury returned a verdict in accordance with the medical evidence and exonerated lennon from all blame
the deputy coroner said it was a most painful case and expressed great sympathy with captain sinico and his daughter
he urged on the railway company to take strong measures to prevent the possibility of similar accidents in the future
no blame attached to anyone
mr duffy raised his eyes from the paper and gazed out of his window on the cheerless evening landscape
the river lay quiet beside the empty distillery and from time to time a light appeared in some house on the lucan road
what an end
the whole narrative of her death revolted him and it revolted him to think that he had ever spoken to her of what he held sacred
the threadbare phrases the inane expressions of sympathy the cautious words of a reporter won over to conceal the details of a commonplace vulgar death attacked his stomach
not merely had she degraded herself she had degraded him
he saw the squalid tract of her vice miserable and malodorous
his souls companion
he thought of the hobbling wretches whom he had seen carrying cans and bottles to be filled by the barman
just god what an end
evidently she had been unfit to live without any strength of purpose an easy prey to habits one of the wrecks on which civilisation has been reared
but that she could have sunk so low
was it possible he had deceived himself so utterly about her
he remembered her outburst of that night and interpreted it in a harsher sense than he had ever done
he had no difficulty now in approving of the course he had taken
as the light failed and his memory began to wander he thought her hand touched his
the shock which had first attacked his stomach was now attacking his nerves
he put on his overcoat and hat quickly and went out
the cold air met him on the threshold it crept into the sleeves of his coat
when he came to the publichouse at chapelizod bridge he went in and ordered a hot punch
the proprietor served him obsequiously but did not venture to talk
there were five or six workingmen in the shop discussing the value of a gentlemans estate in county kildare
they drank at intervals from their huge pint tumblers and smoked spitting often on the floor and sometimes dragging the sawdust over their spits with their heavy boots
mr duffy sat on his stool and gazed at them without seeing or hearing them
after a while they went out and he called for another punch
he sat a long time over it
the shop was very quiet
the proprietor sprawled on the counter reading the herald and yawning
now and again a tram was heard swishing along the lonely road outside
as he sat there living over his life with her and evoking alternately the two images in which he now conceived her he realised that she was dead that she had ceased to exist that she had become a memory
he began to feel ill at ease
he asked himself what else could he have done
he could not have carried on a comedy of deception with her he could not have lived with her openly
he had done what seemed to him best
how was he to blame
now that she was gone he understood how lonely her life must have been sitting night after night alone in that room
his life would be lonely too until he too died ceased to exist became a memoryif anyone remembered him
it was after nine oclock when he left the shop
the night was cold and gloomy
he entered the park by the first gate and walked along under the gaunt trees
he walked through the bleak alleys where they had walked four years before
she seemed to be near him in the darkness
at moments he seemed to feel her voice touch his ear her hand touch his
he stood still to listen
why had he withheld life from her
why had he sentenced her to death
he felt his moral nature falling to pieces
when he gained the crest of the magazine hill he halted and looked along the river towards dublin the lights of which burned redly and hospitably in the cold night
he looked down the slope and at the base in the shadow of the wall of the park he saw some human figures lying
those venal and furtive loves filled him with despair
he gnawed the rectitude of his life he felt that he had been outcast from lifes feast
one human being had seemed to love him and he had denied her life and happiness he had sentenced her to ignominy a death of shame
he knew that the prostrate creatures down by the wall were watching him and wished him gone
no one wanted him he was outcast from lifes feast
he turned his eyes to the grey gleaming river winding along towards dublin
beyond the river he saw a goods train winding out of kingsbridge station like a worm with a fiery head winding through the darkness obstinately and laboriously
it passed slowly out of sight but still he heard in his ears the laborious drone of the engine reiterating the syllables of her name
he turned back the way he had come the rhythm of the engine pounding in his ears
he began to doubt the reality of what memory told him
he halted under a tree and allowed the rhythm to die away
he could not feel her near him in the darkness nor her voice touch his ear
he waited for some minutes listening
he could hear nothing the night was perfectly silent
he listened again perfectly silent
he felt that he was alone
ivy day in the committee room   old jack raked the cinders together with a piece of cardboard and spread them judiciously over the whitening dome of coals
when the dome was thinly covered his face lapsed into darkness but as he set himself to fan the fire again his crouching shadow ascended the opposite wall and his face slowly reemerged into light
it was an old mans face very bony and hairy
the moist blue eyes blinked at the fire and the moist mouth fell open at times munching once or twice mechanically when it closed
when the cinders had caught he laid the piece of cardboard against the wall sighed and said  thats better now mr oconnor  mr oconnor a greyhaired young man whose face was disfigured by many blotches and pimples had just brought the tobacco for a cigarette into a shapely cylinder but when spoken to he undid his handiwork meditatively
then he began to roll the tobacco again meditatively and after a moments thought decided to lick the paper
did mr tierney say when hed be back he asked in a husky falsetto
he didnt say  mr oconnor put his cigarette into his mouth and began to search his pockets
he took out a pack of thin pasteboard cards
ill get you a match said the old man
never mind thisll do said mr oconnor
he selected one of the cards and read what was printed on it       municipal elections       royal exchange ward  mr richard j tierney plg respectfully solicits the favour of your vote and influence at the coming election in the royal exchange ward
mr oconnor had been engaged by tierneys agent to canvass one part of the ward but as the weather was inclement and his boots let in the wet he spent a great part of the day sitting by the fire in the committee room in wicklow street with jack the old caretaker
they had been sitting thus since the short day had grown dark
it was the sixth of october dismal and cold out of doors
mr oconnor tore a strip off the card and lighting it lit his cigarette
as he did so the flame lit up a leaf of dark glossy ivy in the lapel of his coat
the old man watched him attentively and then taking up the piece of cardboard again began to fan the fire slowly while his companion smoked
ah yes he said continuing its hard to know what way to bring up children
now whod think hed turn out like that
i sent him to the christian brothers and i done what i could for him and there he goes boosing about
i tried to make him someway decent  he replaced the cardboard wearily
only im an old man now id change his tune for him
id take the stick to his back and beat him while i could stand over himas i done many a time before
the mother you know she cocks him up with this and that  thats what ruins children said mr oconnor
to be sure it is said the old man
and little thanks you get for it only impudence
he takes thupper hand of me whenever he sees ive a sup taken
whats the world coming to when sons speaks that way to their father  what age is he said mr oconnor
nineteen said the old man
why dont you put him to something  sure amnt i never done at the drunken bowsy ever since he left school
i wont keep you i says
you must get a job for yourself but sure its worse whenever he gets a job he drinks it all  mr oconnor shook his head in sympathy and the old man fell silent gazing into the fire
someone opened the door of the room and called out  hello
is this a freemasons meeting  whos that said the old man
what are you doing in the dark asked a voice
is that you hynes asked mr oconnor
yes
what are you doing in the dark said mr hynes advancing into the light of the fire
he was a tall slender young man with a light brown moustache
imminent little drops of rain hung at the brim of his hat and the collar of his jacketcoat was turned up
well mat he said to mr oconnor how goes it  mr oconnor shook his head
the old man left the hearth and after stumbling about the room returned with two candlesticks which he thrust one after the other into the fire and carried to the table
a denuded room came into view and the fire lost all its cheerful colour
the walls of the room were bare except for a copy of an election address
in the middle of the room was a small table on which papers were heaped
mr hynes leaned against the mantelpiece and asked  has he paid you yet  not yet said mr oconnor
i hope to god hell not leave us in the lurch tonight  mr hynes laughed
o hell pay you
never fear he said
i hope hell look smart about it if he means business said mr oconnor
what do you think jack said mr hynes satirically to the old man
the old man returned to his seat by the fire saying  it isnt but he has it anyway
not like the other tinker  what other tinker said mr hynes
colgan said the old man scornfully
it is because colgans a workingman you say that
whats the difference between a good honest bricklayer and a publicaneh
hasnt the workingman as good a right to be in the corporation as anyone elseay and a better right than those shoneens that are always hat in hand before any fellow with a handle to his name
isnt that so mat said mr hynes addressing mr oconnor
i think youre right said mr oconnor
one man is a plain honest man with no hunkersliding about him
he goes in to represent the labour classes
this fellow youre working for only wants to get some job or other  of course the workingclasses should be represented said the old man
the workingman said mr hynes gets all kicks and no halfpence
but its labour produces everything
the workingman is not looking for fat jobs for his sons and nephews and cousins
the workingman is not going to drag the honour of dublin in the mud to please a german monarch  hows that said the old man
dont you know they want to present an address of welcome to edward rex if he comes here next year
what do we want kowtowing to a foreign king  our man wont vote for the address said mr oconnor
he goes in on the nationalist ticket  wont he said mr hynes
wait till you see whether he will or not
i know him
is it tricky dicky tierney  by god
perhaps youre right joe said mr oconnor
anyway i wish hed turn up with the spondulics  the three men fell silent
the old man began to rake more cinders together
mr hynes took off his hat shook it and then turned down the collar of his coat displaying as he did so an ivy leaf in the lapel
if this man was alive he said pointing to the leaf wed have no talk of an address of welcome  thats true said mr oconnor
musha god be with them times said the old man
there was some life in it then  the room was silent again
then a bustling little man with a snuffling nose and very cold ears pushed in the door
he walked over quickly to the fire rubbing his hands as if he intended to produce a spark from them
no money boys he said
sit down here mr henchy said the old man offering him his chair
o dont stir jack dont stir said mr henchy
he nodded curtly to mr hynes and sat down on the chair which the old man vacated
did you serve aungier street he asked mr oconnor
yes said mr oconnor beginning to search his pockets for memoranda
did you call on grimes  i did  well
how does he stand  he wouldnt promise
he said i wont tell anyone what way im going to vote but i think hell be all right  why so  he asked me who the nominators were and i told him
i mentioned father burkes name
i think itll be all right  mr henchy began to snuffle and to rub his hands over the fire at a terrific speed
then he said  for the love of god jack bring us a bit of coal
there must be some left  the old man went out of the room
its no go said mr henchy shaking his head
i asked the little shoeboy but he said oh now mr henchy when i see the work going on properly i wont forget you you may be sure mean little tinker
usha how could he be anything else  what did i tell you mat said mr hynes
tricky dicky tierney  o hes as tricky as they make em said mr henchy
he hasnt got those little pigs eyes for nothing
blast his soul
couldnt he pay up like a man instead of o now mr henchy i must speak to mr fanning ive spent a lot of money
mean little shoeboy of hell
i suppose he forgets the time his little old father kept the handmedown shop in marys lane  but is that a fact asked mr oconnor
god yes said mr henchy
did you never hear that
and the men used to go in on sunday morning before the houses were open to buy a waistcoat or a trousersmoya
but tricky dickys little old father always had a tricky little black bottle up in a corner
do you mind now
thats that
thats where he first saw the light  the old man returned with a few lumps of coal which he placed here and there on the fire
thats a nice howdoyoudo said mr oconnor
how does he expect us to work for him if he wont stump up  i cant help it said mr henchy
i expect to find the bailiffs in the hall when i go home  mr hynes laughed and shoving himself away from the mantelpiece with the aid of his shoulders made ready to leave
itll be all right when king eddie comes he said
well boys im off for the present
see you later
bye bye  he went out of the room slowly
neither mr henchy nor the old man said anything but just as the door was closing mr oconnor who had been staring moodily into the fire called out suddenly  bye joe  mr henchy waited a few moments and then nodded in the direction of the door
tell me he said across the fire what brings our friend in here
what does he want  usha poor joe said mr oconnor throwing the end of his cigarette into the fire hes hard up like the rest of us  mr henchy snuffled vigorously and spat so copiously that he nearly put out the fire which uttered a hissing protest
to tell you my private and candid opinion he said i think hes a man from the other camp
hes a spy of colgans if you ask me
just go round and try and find out how theyre getting on
they wont suspect you
do you twig  ah poor joe is a decent skin said mr oconnor
his father was a decent respectable man mr henchy admitted
poor old larry hynes
many a good turn he did in his day
but im greatly afraid our friend is not nineteen carat
damn it i can understand a fellow being hard up but what i cant understand is a fellow sponging
couldnt he have some spark of manhood about him  he doesnt get a warm welcome from me when he comes said the old man
let him work for his own side and not come spying around here  i dont know said mr oconnor dubiously as he took out cigarettepapers and tobacco
i think joe hynes is a straight man
hes a clever chap too with the pen
do you remember that thing he wrote  some of these hillsiders and fenians are a bit too clever if you ask me said mr henchy
do you know what my private and candid opinion is about some of those little jokers
i believe half of them are in the pay of the castle  theres no knowing said the old man
o but i know it for a fact said mr henchy
theyre castle hacks
i dont say hynes no damn it i think hes a stroke above that
but theres a certain little nobleman with a cockeyeyou know the patriot im alluding to  mr oconnor nodded
theres a lineal descendant of major sirr for you if you like
o the hearts blood of a patriot
thats a fellow now thatd sell his country for fourpenceayand go down on his bended knees and thank the almighty christ he had a country to sell  there was a knock at the door
come in said mr henchy
a person resembling a poor clergyman or a poor actor appeared in the doorway
his black clothes were tightly buttoned on his short body and it was impossible to say whether he wore a clergymans collar or a laymans because the collar of his shabby frockcoat the uncovered buttons of which reflected the candlelight was turned up about his neck
he wore a round hat of hard black felt
his face shining with raindrops had the appearance of damp yellow cheese save where two rosy spots indicated the cheekbones
he opened his very long mouth suddenly to express disappointment and at the same time opened wide his very bright blue eyes to express pleasure and surprise
o father keon said mr henchy jumping up from his chair
is that you
come in  o no no no said father keon quickly pursing his lips as if he were addressing a child
wont you come in and sit down  no no no said father keon speaking in a discreet indulgent velvety voice
dont let me disturb you now
im just looking for mr fanning  hes round at the black eagle said mr henchy
but wont you come in and sit down a minute  no no thank you
it was just a little business matter said father keon
thank you indeed  he retreated from the doorway and mr henchy seizing one of the candlesticks went to the door to light him downstairs
o dont trouble i beg  no but the stairs is so dark  no no i can see
thank you indeed  are you right now  all right thanks thanks  mr henchy returned with the candlestick and put it on the table
he sat down again at the fire
there was silence for a few moments
tell me john said mr oconnor lighting his cigarette with another pasteboard card
hm  what he is exactly  ask me an easier one said mr henchy
fanning and himself seem to me very thick
theyre often in kavanaghs together
is he a priest at all  mmmyes i believe so
i think hes what you call a black sheep
we havent many of them thank god
but we have a few hes an unfortunate man of some kind  and how does he knock it out asked mr oconnor
thats another mystery  is he attached to any chapel or church or institution or  no said mr henchy i think hes travelling on his own account god forgive me he added i thought he was the dozen of stout  is there any chance of a drink itself asked mr oconnor
im dry too said the old man
i asked that little shoeboy three times said mr henchy would he send up a dozen of stout
i asked him again now but he was leaning on the counter in his shirtsleeves having a deep goster with alderman cowley  why didnt you remind him said mr oconnor
well i couldnt go over while he was talking to alderman cowley
i just waited till i caught his eye and said about that little matter i was speaking to you about thatll be all right mr h he said
yerra sure the little hopomythumb has forgotten all about it  theres some deal on in that quarter said mr oconnor thoughtfully
i saw the three of them hard at it yesterday at suffolk street corner  i think i know the little game theyre at said mr henchy
you must owe the city fathers money nowadays if you want to be made lord mayor
then theyll make you lord mayor

im thinking seriously of becoming a city father myself

hows that for high living says he
wisha
wisha says i
a pound of chops says he coming into the mansion house wisha says i what kind of people is going at all now  at this point there was a knock at the door and a boy put in his head
what is it said the old man
from the black eagle said the boy walking in sideways and depositing a basket on the floor with a noise of shaken bottles
the old man helped the boy to transfer the bottles from the basket to the table and counted the full tally
after the transfer the boy put his basket on his arm and asked  any bottles  what bottles said the old man
wont you let us drink them first said mr henchy
i was told to ask for the bottles  come back tomorrow said the old man
here boy said mr henchy will you run over to ofarrells and ask him to lend us a corkscrewfor mr henchy say
tell him we wont keep it a minute
leave the basket there  the boy went out and mr henchy began to rub his hands cheerfully saying  ah well hes not so bad after all
hes as good as his word anyhow  theres no tumblers said the old man
o dont let that trouble you jack said mr henchy
manys the good man before now drank out of the bottle  anyway its better than nothing said mr oconnor
hes not a bad sort said mr henchy only fanning has such a loan of him
he means well you know in his own tinpot way  the boy came back with the corkscrew
the old man opened three bottles and was handing back the corkscrew when mr henchy said to the boy  would you like a drink boy  if you please sir said the boy
the old man opened another bottle grudgingly and handed it to the boy
what age are you he asked
seventeen said the boy
as the old man said nothing further the boy took the bottle and said heres my best respects sir to mr henchy drank the contents put the bottle back on the table and wiped his mouth with his sleeve
then he took up the corkscrew and went out of the door sideways muttering some form of salutation
thats the way it begins said the old man
the thin edge of the wedge said mr henchy
the old man distributed the three bottles which he had opened and the men drank from them simultaneously
after having drunk each placed his bottle on the mantelpiece within hands reach and drew in a long breath of satisfaction
well i did a good days work today said mr henchy after a pause
that so john  yes
i got him one or two sure things in dawson street crofton and myself
between ourselves you know crofton hes a decent chap of course but hes not worth a damn as a canvasser
he hasnt a word to throw to a dog
he stands and looks at the people while i do the talking  here two men entered the room
one of them was a very fat man whose blue serge clothes seemed to be in danger of falling from his sloping figure
he had a big face which resembled a young oxs face in expression staring blue eyes and a grizzled moustache
the other man who was much younger and frailer had a thin cleanshaven face
he wore a very high double collar and a widebrimmed bowler hat
hello crofton said mr henchy to the fat man
talk of the devil  where did the boose come from asked the young man
did the cow calve  o of course lyons spots the drink first thing said mr oconnor laughing
is that the way you chaps canvass said mr lyons and crofton and i out in the cold and rain looking for votes  why blast your soul said mr henchy id get more votes in five minutes than you twod get in a week  open two bottles of stout jack said mr oconnor
how can i said the old man when theres no corkscrew  wait now wait now said mr henchy getting up quickly
did you ever see this little trick  he took two bottles from the table and carrying them to the fire put them on the hob
then he sat down again by the fire and took another drink from his bottle
mr lyons sat on the edge of the table pushed his hat towards the nape of his neck and began to swing his legs
which is my bottle he asked
this lad said mr henchy
mr crofton sat down on a box and looked fixedly at the other bottle on the hob
he was silent for two reasons
the first reason sufficient in itself was that he had nothing to say the second reason was that he considered his companions beneath him
he had been a canvasser for wilkins the conservative but when the conservatives had withdrawn their man and choosing the lesser of two evils given their support to the nationalist candidate he had been engaged to work for mr tierney
in a few minutes an apologetic pok was heard as the cork flew out of mr lyons bottle
mr lyons jumped off the table went to the fire took his bottle and carried it back to the table
i was just telling them crofton said mr henchy that we got a good few votes today  who did you get asked mr lyons
well i got parkes for one and i got atkinson for two and got ward of dawson street
fine old chap he is tooregular old toff old conservative
but isnt your candidate a nationalist said he
hes a respectable man said i
hes in favour of whatever will benefit this country
hes a big ratepayer i said
he has extensive house property in the city and three places of business and isnt it to his own advantage to keep down the rates
hes a prominent and respected citizen said i and a poor law guardian and he doesnt belong to any party good bad or indifferent thats the way to talk to em  and what about the address to the king said mr lyons after drinking and smacking his lips
listen to me said mr henchy
what we want in this country as i said to old ward is capital
the kings coming here will mean an influx of money into this country
the citizens of dublin will benefit by it
look at all the factories down by the quays there idle
look at all the money there is in the country if we only worked the old industries the mills the shipbuilding yards and factories
its capital we want  but look here john said mr oconnor
why should we welcome the king of england
didnt parnell himself  parnell said mr henchy is dead
now heres the way i look at it
heres this chap come to the throne after his old mother keeping him out of it till the man was grey
hes a man of the world and he means well by us
hes a jolly fine decent fellow if you ask me and no damn nonsense about him
he just says to himself the old one never went to see these wild irish
by christ ill go myself and see what theyre like and are we going to insult the man when he comes over here on a friendly visit
eh
isnt that right crofton  mr crofton nodded his head
but after all now said mr lyons argumentatively king edwards life you know is not the very  let bygones be bygones said mr henchy
i admire the man personally
hes just an ordinary knockabout like you and me
hes fond of his glass of grog and hes a bit of a rake perhaps and hes a good sportsman
damn it cant we irish play fair  thats all very fine said mr lyons
but look at the case of parnell now  in the name of god said mr henchy wheres the analogy between the two cases  what i mean said mr lyons is we have our ideals
why now would we welcome a man like that
do you think now after what he did parnell was a fit man to lead us
and why then would we do it for edward the seventh  this is parnells anniversary said mr oconnor and dont let us stir up any bad blood
we all respect him now that hes dead and goneeven the conservatives he added turning to mr crofton
pok
the tardy cork flew out of mr croftons bottle
mr crofton got up from his box and went to the fire
as he returned with his capture he said in a deep voice  our side of the house respects him because he was a gentleman  right you are crofton said mr henchy fiercely
he was the only man that could keep that bag of cats in order
down ye dogs
lie down ye curs thats the way he treated them
come in joe
come in he called out catching sight of mr hynes in the doorway
mr hynes came in slowly
open another bottle of stout jack said mr henchy
o i forgot theres no corkscrew
here show me one here and ill put it at the fire  the old man handed him another bottle and he placed it on the hob
sit down joe said mr oconnor were just talking about the chief  ay ay said mr henchy
mr hynes sat on the side of the table near mr lyons but said nothing
theres one of them anyhow said mr henchy that didnt renege him
by god ill say for you joe
no by god you stuck to him like a man  o joe said mr oconnor suddenly
give us that thing you wrotedo you remember
have you got it on you  o ay said mr henchy
give us that
did you ever hear that crofton
listen to this now splendid thing  go on said mr oconnor
fire away joe  mr hynes did not seem to remember at once the piece to which they were alluding but after reflecting a while he said  o that thing is it sure thats old now  out with it man said mr oconnor
sh sh said mr henchy
now joe  mr hynes hesitated a little longer
then amid the silence he took off his hat laid it on the table and stood up
he seemed to be rehearsing the piece in his mind
after a rather long pause he announced       the death of parnell      th october    he cleared his throat once or twice and then began to recite       he is dead
our uncrowned king is dead
o erin mourn with grief and woe      for he lies dead whom the fell gang          of modern hypocrites laid low
he lies slain by the coward hounds          he raised to glory from the mire      and erins hopes and erins dreams          perish upon her monarchs pyre
in palace cabin or in cot          the irish heart whereer it be      is bowed with woefor he is gone          who would have wrought her destiny
he would have had his erin famed          the green flag gloriously unfurled      her statesmen bards and warriors raised          before the nations of the world
he dreamed alas twas but a dream
of liberty but as he strove      to clutch that idol treachery          sundered him from the thing he loved
shame on the coward caitiff hands          that smote their lord or with a kiss      betrayed him to the rabblerout          of fawning priestsno friends of his
may everlasting shame consume          the memory of those who tried      to befoul and smear the exalted name          of one who spurned them in his pride
he fell as fall the mighty ones          nobly undaunted to the last      and death has now united him          with erins heroes of the past
no sound of strife disturb his sleep
calmly he rests no human pain      or high ambition spurs him now          the peaks of glory to attain
they had their way they laid him low
but erin list his spirit may      rise like the phnix from the flames          when breaks the dawning of the day       the day that brings us freedoms reign
and on that day may erin well      pledge in the cup she lifts to joy          one griefthe memory of parnell
mr hynes sat down again on the table
when he had finished his recitation there was a silence and then a burst of clapping even mr lyons clapped
the applause continued for a little time
when it had ceased all the auditors drank from their bottles in silence
pok
the cork flew out of mr hynes bottle but mr hynes remained sitting flushed and bareheaded on the table
he did not seem to have heard the invitation
good man joe said mr oconnor taking out his cigarette papers and pouch the better to hide his emotion
what do you think of that crofton cried mr henchy
isnt that fine
what  mr crofton said that it was a very fine piece of writing
a mother   mr holohan assistant secretary of the eire abu society had been walking up and down dublin for nearly a month with his hands and pockets full of dirty pieces of paper arranging about the series of concerts
he had a game leg and for this his friends called him hoppy holohan
he walked up and down constantly stood by the hour at street corners arguing the point and made notes but in the end it was mrs kearney who arranged everything
miss devlin had become mrs kearney out of spite
she had been educated in a highclass convent where she had learned french and music
as she was naturally pale and unbending in manner she made few friends at school
when she came to the age of marriage she was sent out to many houses where her playing and ivory manners were much admired
she sat amid the chilly circle of her accomplishments waiting for some suitor to brave it and offer her a brilliant life
but the young men whom she met were ordinary and she gave them no encouragement trying to console her romantic desires by eating a great deal of turkish delight in secret
however when she drew near the limit and her friends began to loosen their tongues about her she silenced them by marrying mr kearney who was a bootmaker on ormond quay
he was much older than she
his conversation which was serious took place at intervals in his great brown beard
after the first year of married life mrs kearney perceived that such a man would wear better than a romantic person but she never put her own romantic ideas away
he was sober thrifty and pious he went to the altar every first friday sometimes with her oftener by himself
but she never weakened in her religion and was a good wife to him
at some party in a strange house when she lifted her eyebrow ever so slightly he stood up to take his leave and when his cough troubled him she put the eiderdown quilt over his feet and made a strong rum punch
for his part he was a model father
by paying a small sum every week into a society he ensured for both his daughters a dowry of one hundred pounds each when they came to the age of twentyfour
he sent the elder daughter kathleen to a good convent where she learned french and music and afterward paid her fees at the academy
every year in the month of july mrs kearney found occasion to say to some friend  my good man is packing us off to skerries for a few weeks  if it was not skerries it was howth or greystones
when the irish revival began to be appreciable mrs kearney determined to take advantage of her daughters name and brought an irish teacher to the house
kathleen and her sister sent irish picture postcards to their friends and these friends sent back other irish picture postcards
on special sundays when mr kearney went with his family to the procathedral a little crowd of people would assemble after mass at the corner of cathedral street
they were all friends of the kearneysmusical friends or nationalist friends and when they had played every little counter of gossip they shook hands with one another all together laughing at the crossing of so many hands and said goodbye to one another in irish
soon the name of miss kathleen kearney began to be heard often on peoples lips
people said that she was very clever at music and a very nice girl and moreover that she was a believer in the language movement
mrs kearney was well content at this
therefore she was not surprised when one day mr holohan came to her and proposed that her daughter should be the accompanist at a series of four grand concerts which his society was going to give in the antient concert rooms
she brought him into the drawingroom made him sit down and brought out the decanter and the silver biscuitbarrel
she entered heart and soul into the details of the enterprise advised and dissuaded and finally a contract was drawn up by which kathleen was to receive eight guineas for her services as accompanist at the four grand concerts
as mr holohan was a novice in such delicate matters as the wording of bills and the disposing of items for a programme mrs kearney helped him
she had tact
she knew what artistes should go into capitals and what artistes should go into small type
she knew that the first tenor would not like to come on after mr meades comic turn
to keep the audience continually diverted she slipped the doubtful items in between the old favourites
mr holohan called to see her every day to have her advice on some point
she was invariably friendly and advisinghomely in fact
she pushed the decanter towards him saying  now help yourself mr holohan  and while he was helping himself she said  dont be afraid
dont be afraid of it  everything went on smoothly
mrs kearney bought some lovely blushpink charmeuse in brown thomass to let into the front of kathleens dress
it cost a pretty penny but there are occasions when a little expense is justifiable
she took a dozen of twoshilling tickets for the final concert and sent them to those friends who could not be trusted to come otherwise
she forgot nothing and thanks to her everything that was to be done was done
the concerts were to be on wednesday thursday friday and saturday
when mrs kearney arrived with her daughter at the antient concert rooms on wednesday night she did not like the look of things
a few young men wearing bright blue badges in their coats stood idle in the vestibule none of them wore evening dress
she passed by with her daughter and a quick glance through the open door of the hall showed her the cause of the stewards idleness
at first she wondered had she mistaken the hour
no it was twenty minutes to eight
in the dressingroom behind the stage she was introduced to the secretary of the society mr fitzpatrick
she smiled and shook his hand
he was a little man with a white vacant face
she noticed that he wore his soft brown hat carelessly on the side of his head and that his accent was flat
he held a programme in his hand and while he was talking to her he chewed one end of it into a moist pulp
he seemed to bear disappointments lightly
mr holohan came into the dressingroom every few minutes with reports from the boxoffice
the artistes talked among themselves nervously glanced from time to time at the mirror and rolled and unrolled their music
when it was nearly halfpast eight the few people in the hall began to express their desire to be entertained
mr fitzpatrick came in smiled vacantly at the room and said  well now ladies and gentlemen
i suppose wed better open the ball  mrs kearney rewarded his very flat final syllable with a quick stare of contempt and then said to her daughter encouragingly  are you ready dear  when she had an opportunity she called mr holohan aside and asked him to tell her what it meant
mr holohan did not know what it meant
he said that the committee had made a mistake in arranging for four concerts four was too many
and the artistes said mrs kearney
of course they are doing their best but really they are not good  mr holohan admitted that the artistes were no good but the committee he said had decided to let the first three concerts go as they pleased and reserve all the talent for saturday night
mrs kearney said nothing but as the mediocre items followed one another on the platform and the few people in the hall grew fewer and fewer she began to regret that she had put herself to any expense for such a concert
there was something she didnt like in the look of things and mr fitzpatricks vacant smile irritated her very much
however she said nothing and waited to see how it would end
the concert expired shortly before ten and everyone went home quickly
the concert on thursday night was better attended but mrs kearney saw at once that the house was filled with paper
the audience behaved indecorously as if the concert were an informal dress rehearsal
mr fitzpatrick seemed to enjoy himself he was quite unconscious that mrs kearney was taking angry note of his conduct
he stood at the edge of the screen from time to time jutting out his head and exchanging a laugh with two friends in the corner of the balcony
in the course of the evening mrs kearney learned that the friday concert was to be abandoned and that the committee was going to move heaven and earth to secure a bumper house on saturday night
when she heard this she sought out mr holohan
she buttonholed him as he was limping out quickly with a glass of lemonade for a young lady and asked him was it true
yes it was true
but of course that doesnt alter the contract she said
the contract was for four concerts  mr holohan seemed to be in a hurry he advised her to speak to mr fitzpatrick
mrs kearney was now beginning to be alarmed
she called mr fitzpatrick away from his screen and told him that her daughter had signed for four concerts and that of course according to the terms of the contract she should receive the sum originally stipulated for whether the society gave the four concerts or not
mr fitzpatrick who did not catch the point at issue very quickly seemed unable to resolve the difficulty and said that he would bring the matter before the committee
mrs kearneys anger began to flutter in her cheek and she had all she could do to keep from asking  and who is the cometty pray  but she knew that it would not be ladylike to do that so she was silent
little boys were sent out into the principal streets of dublin early on friday morning with bundles of handbills
special puffs appeared in all the evening papers reminding the musicloving public of the treat which was in store for it on the following evening
mrs kearney was somewhat reassured but she thought well to tell her husband part of her suspicions
he listened carefully and said that perhaps it would be better if he went with her on saturday night
she agreed
she respected her husband in the same way as she respected the general post office as something large secure and fixed and though she knew the small number of his talents she appreciated his abstract value as a male
she was glad that he had suggested coming with her
she thought her plans over
the night of the grand concert came
mrs kearney with her husband and daughter arrived at the antient concert rooms threequarters of an hour before the time at which the concert was to begin
by ill luck it was a rainy evening
mrs kearney placed her daughters clothes and music in charge of her husband and went all over the building looking for mr holohan or mr fitzpatrick
she could find neither
she asked the stewards was any member of the committee in the hall and after a great deal of trouble a steward brought out a little woman named miss beirne to whom mrs kearney explained that she wanted to see one of the secretaries
miss beirne expected them any minute and asked could she do anything
mrs kearney looked searchingly at the oldish face which was screwed into an expression of trustfulness and enthusiasm and answered  no thank you  the little woman hoped they would have a good house
she looked out at the rain until the melancholy of the wet street effaced all the trustfulness and enthusiasm from her twisted features
then she gave a little sigh and said  ah well
we did our best the dear knows  mrs kearney had to go back to the dressingroom
the artistes were arriving
the bass and the second tenor had already come
the bass mr duggan was a slender young man with a scattered black moustache
he was the son of a hall porter in an office in the city and as a boy he had sung prolonged bass notes in the resounding hall
from this humble state he had raised himself until he had become a firstrate artiste
he had appeared in grand opera
one night when an operatic artiste had fallen ill he had undertaken the part of the king in the opera of maritana at the queens theatre
he sang his music with great feeling and volume and was warmly welcomed by the gallery but unfortunately he marred the good impression by wiping his nose in his gloved hand once or twice out of thoughtlessness
he was unassuming and spoke little
he said yous so softly that it passed unnoticed and he never drank anything stronger than milk for his voices sake
mr bell the second tenor was a fairhaired little man who competed every year for prizes at the feis ceoil
on his fourth trial he had been awarded a bronze medal
he was extremely nervous and extremely jealous of other tenors and he covered his nervous jealousy with an ebullient friendliness
it was his humour to have people know what an ordeal a concert was to him
therefore when he saw mr duggan he went over to him and asked  are you in it too  yes said mr duggan
mr bell laughed at his fellowsufferer held out his hand and said  shake  mrs kearney passed by these two young men and went to the edge of the screen to view the house
the seats were being filled up rapidly and a pleasant noise circulated in the auditorium
she came back and spoke to her husband privately
their conversation was evidently about kathleen for they both glanced at her often as she stood chatting to one of her nationalist friends miss healy the contralto
an unknown solitary woman with a pale face walked through the room
the women followed with keen eyes the faded blue dress which was stretched upon a meagre body
someone said that she was madam glynn the soprano
i wonder where did they dig her up said kathleen to miss healy
im sure i never heard of her  miss healy had to smile
mr holohan limped into the dressingroom at that moment and the two young ladies asked him who was the unknown woman
mr holohan said that she was madam glynn from london
madam glynn took her stand in a corner of the room holding a roll of music stiffly before her and from time to time changing the direction of her startled gaze
the shadow took her faded dress into shelter but fell revengefully into the little cup behind her collarbone
the noise of the hall became more audible
the first tenor and the baritone arrived together
they were both well dressed stout and complacent and they brought a breath of opulence among the company
mrs kearney brought her daughter over to them and talked to them amiably
she wanted to be on good terms with them but while she strove to be polite her eyes followed mr holohan in his limping and devious courses
as soon as she could she excused herself and went out after him
mr holohan i want to speak to you for a moment she said
they went down to a discreet part of the corridor
mrs kearney asked him when was her daughter going to be paid
mr holohan said that mr fitzpatrick had charge of that
mrs kearney said that she didnt know anything about mr fitzpatrick
her daughter had signed a contract for eight guineas and she would have to be paid
mr holohan said that it wasnt his business
why isnt it your business asked mrs kearney
didnt you yourself bring her the contract
anyway if its not your business its my business and i mean to see to it  youd better speak to mr fitzpatrick said mr holohan distantly
i dont know anything about mr fitzpatrick repeated mrs kearney
i have my contract and i intend to see that it is carried out  when she came back to the dressingroom her cheeks were slightly suffused
the room was lively
two men in outdoor dress had taken possession of the fireplace and were chatting familiarly with miss healy and the baritone
they were the freeman man and mr omadden burke
the freeman man had come in to say that he could not wait for the concert as he had to report the lecture which an american priest was giving in the mansion house
he said they were to leave the report for him at the freeman office and he would see that it went in
he was a greyhaired man with a plausible voice and careful manners
he held an extinguished cigar in his hand and the aroma of cigar smoke floated near him
he had not intended to stay a moment because concerts and artistes bored him considerably but he remained leaning against the mantelpiece
miss healy stood in front of him talking and laughing
he was old enough to suspect one reason for her politeness but young enough in spirit to turn the moment to account
the warmth fragrance and colour of her body appealed to his senses
he was pleasantly conscious that the bosom which he saw rise and fall slowly beneath him rose and fell at that moment for him that the laughter and fragrance and wilful glances were his tribute
when he could stay no longer he took leave of her regretfully
omadden burke will write the notice he explained to mr holohan and ill see it in  thank you very much mr hendrick said mr holohan youll see it in i know
now wont you have a little something before you go  i dont mind said mr hendrick
the two men went along some tortuous passages and up a dark staircase and came to a secluded room where one of the stewards was uncorking bottles for a few gentlemen
one of these gentlemen was mr omadden burke who had found out the room by instinct
he was a suave elderly man who balanced his imposing body when at rest upon a large silk umbrella
his magniloquent western name was the moral umbrella upon which he balanced the fine problem of his finances
he was widely respected
while mr holohan was entertaining the freeman man mrs kearney was speaking so animatedly to her husband that he had to ask her to lower her voice
the conversation of the others in the dressingroom had become strained
mr bell the first item stood ready with his music but the accompanist made no sign
evidently something was wrong
mr kearney looked straight before him stroking his beard while mrs kearney spoke into kathleens ear with subdued emphasis
from the hall came sounds of encouragement clapping and stamping of feet
the first tenor and the baritone and miss healy stood together waiting tranquilly but mr bells nerves were greatly agitated because he was afraid the audience would think that he had come late
mr holohan and mr omadden burke came into the room
in a moment mr holohan perceived the hush
he went over to mrs kearney and spoke with her earnestly
while they were speaking the noise in the hall grew louder
mr holohan became very red and excited
he spoke volubly but mrs kearney said curtly at intervals  she wont go on
she must get her eight guineas  mr holohan pointed desperately towards the hall where the audience was clapping and stamping
he appealed to mr kearney and to kathleen
but mr kearney continued to stroke his beard and kathleen looked down moving the point of her new shoe it was not her fault
mrs kearney repeated  she wont go on without her money  after a swift struggle of tongues mr holohan hobbled out in haste
the room was silent
when the strain of the silence had become somewhat painful miss healy said to the baritone  have you seen mrs pat campbell this week  the baritone had not seen her but he had been told that she was very fine
the conversation went no further
the first tenor bent his head and began to count the links of the gold chain which was extended across his waist smiling and humming random notes to observe the effect on the frontal sinus
from time to time everyone glanced at mrs kearney
the noise in the auditorium had risen to a clamour when mr fitzpatrick burst into the room followed by mr holohan who was panting
the clapping and stamping in the hall were punctuated by whistling
mr fitzpatrick held a few banknotes in his hand
he counted out four into mrs kearneys hand and said she would get the other half at the interval
mrs kearney said  this is four shillings short  but kathleen gathered in her skirt and said now mr bell to the first item who was shaking like an aspen
the singer and the accompanist went out together
the noise in hall died away
there was a pause of a few seconds and then the piano was heard
the first part of the concert was very successful except for madam glynns item
the poor lady sang killarney in a bodiless gasping voice with all the oldfashioned mannerisms of intonation and pronunciation which she believed lent elegance to her singing
she looked as if she had been resurrected from an old stagewardrobe and the cheaper parts of the hall made fun of her high wailing notes
the first tenor and the contralto however brought down the house
kathleen played a selection of irish airs which was generously applauded
the first part closed with a stirring patriotic recitation delivered by a young lady who arranged amateur theatricals
it was deservedly applauded and when it was ended the men went out for the interval content
all this time the dressingroom was a hive of excitement
in one corner were mr holohan mr fitzpatrick miss beirne two of the stewards the baritone the bass and mr omadden burke
mr omadden burke said it was the most scandalous exhibition he had ever witnessed
miss kathleen kearneys musical career was ended in dublin after that he said
the baritone was asked what did he think of mrs kearneys conduct
he did not like to say anything
he had been paid his money and wished to be at peace with men
however he said that mrs kearney might have taken the artistes into consideration
the stewards and the secretaries debated hotly as to what should be done when the interval came
i agree with miss beirne said mr omadden burke
pay her nothing  in another corner of the room were mrs kearney and her husband mr bell miss healy and the young lady who had to recite the patriotic piece
mrs kearney said that the committee had treated her scandalously
she had spared neither trouble nor expense and this was how she was repaid
they thought they had only a girl to deal with and that therefore they could ride roughshod over her
but she would show them their mistake
they wouldnt have dared to have treated her like that if she had been a man
but she would see that her daughter got her rights she wouldnt be fooled
if they didnt pay her to the last farthing she would make dublin ring
of course she was sorry for the sake of the artistes
but what else could she do
she appealed to the second tenor who said he thought she had not been well treated
then she appealed to miss healy
miss healy wanted to join the other group but she did not like to do so because she was a great friend of kathleens and the kearneys had often invited her to their house
as soon as the first part was ended mr fitzpatrick and mr holohan went over to mrs kearney and told her that the other four guineas would be paid after the committee meeting on the following tuesday and that in case her daughter did not play for the second part the committee would consider the contract broken and would pay nothing
i havent seen any committee said mrs kearney angrily
my daughter has her contract
she will get four pounds eight into her hand or a foot she wont put on that platform  im surprised at you mrs kearney said mr holohan
i never thought you would treat us this way  and what way did you treat me asked mrs kearney
her face was inundated with an angry colour and she looked as if she would attack someone with her hands
im asking for my rights she said
you might have some sense of decency said mr holohan
might i indeed
and when i ask when my daughter is going to be paid i cant get a civil answer  she tossed her head and assumed a haughty voice  you must speak to the secretary
its not my business
im a great fellow folthediddleido  i thought you were a lady said mr holohan walking away from her abruptly
after that mrs kearneys conduct was condemned on all hands everyone approved of what the committee had done
she stood at the door haggard with rage arguing with her husband and daughter gesticulating with them
she waited until it was time for the second part to begin in the hope that the secretaries would approach her
but miss healy had kindly consented to play one or two accompaniments
mrs kearney had to stand aside to allow the baritone and his accompanist to pass up to the platform
she stood still for an instant like an angry stone image and when the first notes of the song struck her ear she caught up her daughters cloak and said to her husband  get a cab  he went out at once
mrs kearney wrapped the cloak round her daughter and followed him
as she passed through the doorway she stopped and glared into mr holohans face
im not done with you yet she said
but im done with you said mr holohan
kathleen followed her mother meekly
mr holohan began to pace up and down the room in order to cool himself for he felt his skin on fire
thats a nice lady he said
o shes a nice lady  you did the proper thing holohan said mr omadden burke poised upon his umbrella in approval
grace   two gentlemen who were in the lavatory at the time tried to lift him up but he was quite helpless
he lay curled up at the foot of the stairs down which he had fallen
they succeeded in turning him over
his hat had rolled a few yards away and his clothes were smeared with the filth and ooze of the floor on which he had lain face downwards
his eyes were closed and he breathed with a grunting noise
a thin stream of blood trickled from the corner of his mouth
these two gentlemen and one of the curates carried him up the stairs and laid him down again on the floor of the bar
in two minutes he was surrounded by a ring of men
the manager of the bar asked everyone who he was and who was with him
no one knew who he was but one of the curates said he had served the gentleman with a small rum
was he by himself asked the manager
no sir
there was two gentlemen with him  and where are they  no one knew a voice said  give him air
hes fainted  the ring of onlookers distended and closed again elastically
a dark medal of blood had formed itself near the mans head on the tessellated floor
the manager alarmed by the grey pallor of the mans face sent for a policeman
his collar was unfastened and his necktie undone
he opened his eyes for an instant sighed and closed them again
one of gentlemen who had carried him upstairs held a dinged silk hat in his hand
the manager asked repeatedly did no one know who the injured man was or where had his friends gone
the door of the bar opened and an immense constable entered
a crowd which had followed him down the laneway collected outside the door struggling to look in through the glass panels
the manager at once began to narrate what he knew
the constable a young man with thick immobile features listened
he moved his head slowly to right and left and from the manager to the person on the floor as if he feared to be the victim of some delusion
then he drew off his glove produced a small book from his waist licked the lead of his pencil and made ready to indite
he asked in a suspicious provincial accent  who is the man
whats his name and address  a young man in a cyclingsuit cleared his way through the ring of bystanders
he knelt down promptly beside the injured man and called for water
the constable knelt down also to help
the young man washed the blood from the injured mans mouth and then called for some brandy
the constable repeated the order in an authoritative voice until a curate came running with the glass
the brandy was forced down the mans throat
in a few seconds he opened his eyes and looked about him
he looked at the circle of faces and then understanding strove to rise to his feet
youre all right now asked the young man in the cyclingsuit
sha s nothing said the injured man trying to stand up
he was helped to his feet
the manager said something about a hospital and some of the bystanders gave advice
the battered silk hat was placed on the mans head
the constable asked  where do you live  the man without answering began to twirl the ends of his moustache
he made light of his accident
it was nothing he said only a little accident
he spoke very thickly
where do you live repeated the constable
the man said they were to get a cab for him
while the point was being debated a tall agile gentleman of fair complexion wearing a long yellow ulster came from the far end of the bar
seeing the spectacle he called out  hallo tom old man
whats the trouble  sha s nothing said the man
the newcomer surveyed the deplorable figure before him and then turned to the constable saying  its all right constable
ill see him home  the constable touched his helmet and answered  all right mr power  come now tom said mr power taking his friend by the arm
no bones broken
what
can you walk  the young man in the cyclingsuit took the man by the other arm and the crowd divided
how did you get yourself into this mess asked mr power
the gentleman fell down the stairs said the young man
i ery uch oliged to you sir said the injured man
not at all  ant we have a little  not now
not now  the three men left the bar and the crowd sifted through the doors into the laneway
the manager brought the constable to the stairs to inspect the scene of the accident
they agreed that the gentleman must have missed his footing
the customers returned to the counter and a curate set about removing the traces of blood from the floor
when they came out into grafton street mr power whistled for an outsider
the injured man said again as well as he could  i ery uch oliged to you sir
i hope well eet again
y nae is kernan  the shock and the incipient pain had partly sobered him
dont mention it said the young man
they shook hands
mr kernan was hoisted on to the car and while mr power was giving directions to the carman he expressed his gratitude to the young man and regretted that they could not have a little drink together
another time said the young man
the car drove off towards westmoreland street
as it passed ballast office the clock showed halfpast nine
a keen east wind hit them blowing from the mouth of the river
mr kernan was huddled together with cold
his friend asked him to tell how the accident had happened
i ant an he answered y ongue is hurt  show  the other leaned over the well of the car and peered into mr kernans mouth but he could not see
he struck a match and sheltering it in the shell of his hands peered again into the mouth which mr kernan opened obediently
the swaying movement of the car brought the match to and from the opened mouth
the lower teeth and gums were covered with clotted blood and a minute piece of the tongue seemed to have been bitten off
the match was blown out
thats ugly said mr power
sha s nothing said mr kernan closing his mouth and pulling the collar of his filthy coat across his neck
mr kernan was a commercial traveller of the old school which believed in the dignity of its calling
he had never been seen in the city without a silk hat of some decency and a pair of gaiters
by grace of these two articles of clothing he said a man could always pass muster
he carried on the tradition of his napoleon the great blackwhite whose memory he evoked at times by legend and mimicry
modern business methods had spared him only so far as to allow him a little office in crowe street on the window blind of which was written the name of his firm with the addresslondon ec
on the mantelpiece of this little office a little leaden battalion of canisters was drawn up and on the table before the window stood four or five china bowls which were usually half full of a black liquid
from these bowls mr kernan tasted tea
he took a mouthful drew it up saturated his palate with it and then spat it forth into the grate
then he paused to judge
mr power a much younger man was employed in the royal irish constabulary office in dublin castle
the arc of his social rise intersected the arc of his friends decline but mr kernans decline was mitigated by the fact that certain of those friends who had known him at his highest point of success still esteemed him as a character
mr power was one of these friends
his inexplicable debts were a byword in his circle he was a debonair young man
the car halted before a small house on the glasnevin road and mr kernan was helped into the house
his wife put him to bed while mr power sat downstairs in the kitchen asking the children where they went to school and what book they were in
the childrentwo girls and a boy conscious of their fathers helplessness and of their mothers absence began some horseplay with him
he was surprised at their manners and at their accents and his brow grew thoughtful
after a while mrs kernan entered the kitchen exclaiming  such a sight
o hell do for himself one day and thats the holy alls of it
hes been drinking since friday  mr power was careful to explain to her that he was not responsible that he had come on the scene by the merest accident
mrs kernan remembering mr powers good offices during domestic quarrels as well as many small but opportune loans said  o you neednt tell me that mr power
i know youre a friend of his not like some of the others he does be with
theyre all right so long as he has money in his pocket to keep him out from his wife and family
nice friends
who was he with tonight id like to know  mr power shook his head but said nothing
im so sorry she continued that ive nothing in the house to offer you
but if you wait a minute ill send round to fogartys at the corner  mr power stood up
we were waiting for him to come home with the money
he never seems to think he has a home at all  o now mrs kernan said mr power well make him turn over a new leaf
ill talk to martin
hes the man
well come here one of these nights and talk it over  she saw him to the door
the carman was stamping up and down the footpath and swinging his arms to warm himself
its very kind of you to bring him home she said
not at all said mr power
he got up on the car
as it drove off he raised his hat to her gaily
well make a new man of him he said
goodnight mrs kernan   mrs kernans puzzled eyes watched the car till it was out of sight
then she withdrew them went into the house and emptied her husbands pockets
she was an active practical woman of middle age
not long before she had celebrated her silver wedding and renewed her intimacy with her husband by waltzing with him to mr powers accompaniment
in her days of courtship mr kernan had seemed to her a not ungallant figure and she still hurried to the chapel door whenever a wedding was reported and seeing the bridal pair recalled with vivid pleasure how she had passed out of the star of the sea church in sandymount leaning on the arm of a jovial wellfed man who was dressed smartly in a frockcoat and lavender trousers and carried a silk hat gracefully balanced upon his other arm
after three weeks she had found a wifes life irksome and later on when she was beginning to find it unbearable she had become a mother
the part of mother presented to her no insuperable difficulties and for twentyfive years she had kept house shrewdly for her husband
her two eldest sons were launched
one was in a drapers shop in glasgow and the other was clerk to a teamerchant in belfast
they were good sons wrote regularly and sometimes sent home money
the other children were still at school
mr kernan sent a letter to his office next day and remained in bed
she made beeftea for him and scolded him roundly
she accepted his frequent intemperance as part of the climate healed him dutifully whenever he was sick and always tried to make him eat a breakfast
there were worse husbands
he had never been violent since the boys had grown up and she knew that he would walk to the end of thomas street and back again to book even a small order
two nights after his friends came to see him
she brought them up to his bedroom the air of which was impregnated with a personal odour and gave them chairs at the fire
mr kernans tongue the occasional stinging pain of which had made him somewhat irritable during the day became more polite
he sat propped up in the bed by pillows and the little colour in his puffy cheeks made them resemble warm cinders
he apologised to his guests for the disorder of the room but at the same time looked at them a little proudly with a veterans pride
he was quite unconscious that he was the victim of a plot which his friends mr cunningham mr mcoy and mr power had disclosed to mrs kernan in the parlour
the idea had been mr powers but its development was entrusted to mr cunningham
mr kernan came of protestant stock and though he had been converted to the catholic faith at the time of his marriage he had not been in the pale of the church for twenty years
he was fond moreover of giving sidethrusts at catholicism
mr cunningham was the very man for such a case
he was an elder colleague of mr power
his own domestic life was not very happy
people had great sympathy with him for it was known that he had married an unpresentable woman who was an incurable drunkard
he had set up house for her six times and each time she had pawned the furniture on him
everyone had respect for poor martin cunningham
he was a thoroughly sensible man influential and intelligent
his blade of human knowledge natural astuteness particularised by long association with cases in the police courts had been tempered by brief immersions in the waters of general philosophy
he was well informed
his friends bowed to his opinions and considered that his face was like shakespeares
when the plot had been disclosed to her mrs kernan had said  i leave it all in your hands mr cunningham  after a quarter of a century of married life she had very few illusions left
religion for her was a habit and she suspected that a man of her husbands age would not change greatly before death
she was tempted to see a curious appropriateness in his accident and but that she did not wish to seem bloodyminded she would have told the gentlemen that mr kernans tongue would not suffer by being shortened
however mr cunningham was a capable man and religion was religion
the scheme might do good and at least it could do no harm
her beliefs were not extravagant
she believed steadily in the sacred heart as the most generally useful of all catholic devotions and approved of the sacraments
her faith was bounded by her kitchen but if she was put to it she could believe also in the banshee and in the holy ghost
the gentlemen began to talk of the accident
mr cunningham said that he had once known a similar case
a man of seventy had bitten off a piece of his tongue during an epileptic fit and the tongue had filled in again so that no one could see a trace of the bite
well im not seventy said the invalid
god forbid said mr cunningham
it doesnt pain you now asked mr mcoy
mr mcoy had been at one time a tenor of some reputation
his wife who had been a soprano still taught young children to play the piano at low terms
his line of life had not been the shortest distance between two points and for short periods he had been driven to live by his wits
he had been a clerk in the midland railway a canvasser for advertisements for the irish times and for the freemans journal a town traveller for a coal firm on commission a private inquiry agent a clerk in the office of the subsheriff and he had recently become secretary to the city coroner
his new office made him professionally interested in mr kernans case
pain
not much answered mr kernan
but its so sickening
i feel as if i wanted to retch off  thats the boose said mr cunningham firmly
no said mr kernan
i think i caught a cold on the car
theres something keeps coming into my throat phlegm or  mucus said mr mcoy
it keeps coming like from down in my throat sickening thing  yes yes said mr mcoy thats the thorax  he looked at mr cunningham and mr power at the same time with an air of challenge
mr cunningham nodded his head rapidly and mr power said  ah well alls well that ends well  im very much obliged to you old man said the invalid
mr power waved his hand
those other two fellows i was with  who were you with asked mr cunningham
a chap
i dont know his name
damn it now whats his name
little chap with sandy hair  and who else  harford  hm said mr cunningham
when mr cunningham made that remark people were silent
it was known that the speaker had secret sources of information
in this case the monosyllable had a moral intention
mr harford sometimes formed one of a little detachment which left the city shortly after noon on sunday with the purpose of arriving as soon as possible at some publichouse on the outskirts of the city where its members duly qualified themselves as bona fide travellers
but his fellowtravellers had never consented to overlook his origin
he had begun life as an obscure financier by lending small sums of money to workmen at usurious interest
later on he had become the partner of a very fat short gentleman mr goldberg in the liffey loan bank
though he had never embraced more than the jewish ethical code his fellowcatholics whenever they had smarted in person or by proxy under his exactions spoke of him bitterly as an irish jew and an illiterate and saw divine disapproval of usury made manifest through the person of his idiot son
at other times they remembered his good points
i wonder where did he go to said mr kernan
he wished the details of the incident to remain vague
he wished his friends to think there had been some mistake that mr harford and he had missed each other
his friends who knew quite well mr harfords manners in drinking were silent
mr power said again  alls well that ends well  mr kernan changed the subject at once
that was a decent young chap that medical fellow he said
only for him  o only for him said mr power it might have been a case of seven days without the option of a fine  yes yes said mr kernan trying to remember
i remember now there was a policeman
decent young fellow he seemed
how did it happen at all  it happened that you were peloothered tom said mr cunningham gravely
true bill said mr kernan equally gravely
i suppose you squared the constable jack said mr mcoy
mr power did not relish the use of his christian name
he was not straightlaced but he could not forget that mr mcoy had recently made a crusade in search of valises and portmanteaus to enable mrs mcoy to fulfil imaginary engagements in the country
more than he resented the fact that he had been victimised he resented such low playing of the game
he answered the question therefore as if mr kernan had asked it
the narrative made mr kernan indignant
he was keenly conscious of his citizenship wished to live with his city on terms mutually honourable and resented any affront put upon him by those whom he called country bumpkins
is this what we pay rates for he asked
to feed and clothe these ignorant bostooms  and theyre nothing else  mr cunningham laughed
he was a castle official only during office hours
how could they be anything else tom he said
he assumed a thick provincial accent and said in a tone of command   catch your cabbage  everyone laughed
mr mcoy who wanted to enter the conversation by any door pretended that he had never heard the story
mr cunningham said  it is supposedthey say you knowto take place in the depot where they get these thundering big country fellows omadhauns you know to drill
the sergeant makes them stand in a row against the wall and hold up their plates  he illustrated the story by grotesque gestures
at dinner you know
then he has a bloody big bowl of cabbage before him on the table and a bloody big spoon like a shovel
he takes up a wad of cabbage on the spoon and pegs it across the room and the poor devils have to try and catch it on their plates  catch your cabbage  everyone laughed again but mr kernan was somewhat indignant still
he talked of writing a letter to the papers
these yahoos coming up here he said think they can boss the people
i neednt tell you martin what kind of men they are  mr cunningham gave a qualified assent
its like everything else in this world he said
you get some bad ones and you get some good ones  o yes you get some good ones i admit said mr kernan satisfied
its better to have nothing to say to them said mr mcoy
thats my opinion  mrs kernan entered the room and placing a tray on the table said  help yourselves gentlemen  mr power stood up to officiate offering her his chair
she declined it saying she was ironing downstairs and after having exchanged a nod with mr cunningham behind mr powers back prepared to leave the room
her husband called out to her  and have you nothing for me duckie  o you
the back of my hand to you said mrs kernan tartly
her husband called after her  nothing for poor little hubby  he assumed such a comical face and voice that the distribution of the bottles of stout took place amid general merriment
the gentlemen drank from their glasses set the glasses again on the table and paused
then mr cunningham turned towards mr power and said casually  on thursday night you said jack  thursday yes said mr power
righto said mr cunningham promptly
we can meet in mauleys said mr mcoy
thatll be the most convenient place  but we mustnt be late said mr power earnestly because it is sure to be crammed to the doors  we can meet at halfseven said mr mcoy
righto said mr cunningham
halfseven at mauleys be it  there was a short silence
mr kernan waited to see whether he would be taken into his friends confidence
then he asked  whats in the wind  o its nothing said mr cunningham
its only a little matter that were arranging about for thursday  the opera is it said mr kernan
no no said mr cunningham in an evasive tone its just a little  spiritual matter  o said mr kernan
there was silence again
then mr power said point blank  to tell you the truth tom were going to make a retreat  yes thats it said mr cunningham jack and i and mcoy herewere all going to wash the pot  he uttered the metaphor with a certain homely energy and encouraged by his own voice proceeded  you see we may as well all admit were a nice collection of scoundrels one and all
i say one and all he added with gruff charity and turning to mr power
own up now  i own up said mr power
and i own up said mr mcoy
so were going to wash the pot together said mr cunningham
a thought seemed to strike him
he turned suddenly to the invalid and said  dye know what tom has just occurred to me
you might join in and wed have a fourhanded reel  good idea said mr power
the four of us together  mr kernan was silent
the proposal conveyed very little meaning to his mind but understanding that some spiritual agencies were about to concern themselves on his behalf he thought he owed it to his dignity to show a stiff neck
he took no part in the conversation for a long while but listened with an air of calm enmity while his friends discussed the jesuits
i havent such a bad opinion of the jesuits he said intervening at length
theyre an educated order
i believe they mean well too  theyre the grandest order in the church tom said mr cunningham with enthusiasm
the general of the jesuits stands next to the pope  theres no mistake about it said mr mcoy if you want a thing well done and no flies about it you go to a jesuit
theyre the boyos have influence
ill tell you a case in point  the jesuits are a fine body of men said mr power
its a curious thing said mr cunningham about the jesuit order
every other order of the church had to be reformed at some time or other but the jesuit order was never once reformed
it never fell away  is that so asked mr mcoy
thats a fact said mr cunningham
thats history  look at their church too said mr power
look at the congregation they have  the jesuits cater for the upper classes said mr mcoy
of course said mr power
yes said mr kernan
thats why i have a feeling for them
its some of those secular priests ignorant bumptious  theyre all good men said mr cunningham each in his own way
the irish priesthood is honoured all the world over  o yes said mr power
not like some of the other priesthoods on the continent said mr mcoy unworthy of the name  perhaps youre right said mr kernan relenting
of course im right said mr cunningham
i havent been in the world all this time and seen most sides of it without being a judge of character  the gentlemen drank again one following anothers example
mr kernan seemed to be weighing something in his mind
he was impressed
he had a high opinion of mr cunningham as a judge of character and as a reader of faces
he asked for particulars
o its just a retreat you know said mr cunningham
father purdon is giving it
its for business men you know  he wont be too hard on us tom said mr power persuasively
father purdon
father purdon said the invalid
o you must know him tom said mr cunningham stoutly
fine jolly fellow
hes a man of the world like ourselves  ah  yes
i think i know him
rather red face tall  thats the man  and tell me martin is he a good preacher  munno its not exactly a sermon you know
its just kind of a friendly talk you know in a commonsense way  mr kernan deliberated
mr mcoy said  father tom burke that was the boy  o father tom burke said mr cunningham that was a born orator
did you ever hear him tom  did i ever hear him said the invalid nettled
rather
i heard him  and yet they say he wasnt much of a theologian said mr cunningham
is that so said mr mcoy
o of course nothing wrong you know
only sometimes they say he didnt preach what was quite orthodox  ah
 he was a splendid man said mr mcoy
i heard him once mr kernan continued
i forget the subject of his discourse now
crofton and i were in the back of the  pit you know  the  the body said mr cunningham
yes in the back near the door
i forget now what o yes it was on the pope the late pope
i remember it well
upon my word it was magnificent the style of the oratory
and his voice
god
hadnt he a voice
the prisoner of the vatican he called him
i remember crofton saying to me when we came out  but hes an orangeman crofton isnt he said mr power
course he is said mr kernan and a damned decent orangeman too
we went into butlers in moore streetfaith i was genuinely moved tell you the gods truthand i remember well his very words
kernan he said we worship at different altars he said but our belief is the same
struck me as very well put  theres a good deal in that said mr power
there used always to be crowds of protestants in the chapel where father tom was preaching  theres not much difference between us said mr mcoy
we both believe in  he hesitated for a moment
 in the redeemer
only they dont believe in the pope and in the mother of god  but of course said mr cunningham quietly and effectively our religion is the religion the old original faith  not a doubt of it said mr kernan warmly
mrs kernan came to the door of the bedroom and announced  heres a visitor for you  who is it  mr fogarty  o come in
come in  a pale oval face came forward into the light
the arch of its fair trailing moustache was repeated in the fair eyebrows looped above pleasantly astonished eyes
mr fogarty was a modest grocer
he had failed in business in a licensed house in the city because his financial condition had constrained him to tie himself to secondclass distillers and brewers
he had opened a small shop on glasnevin road where he flattered himself his manners would ingratiate him with the housewives of the district
he bore himself with a certain grace complimented little children and spoke with a neat enunciation
he was not without culture
mr fogarty brought a gift with him a halfpint of special whisky
he inquired politely for mr kernan placed his gift on the table and sat down with the company on equal terms
mr kernan appreciated the gift all the more since he was aware that there was a small account for groceries unsettled between him and mr fogarty
he said  i wouldnt doubt you old man
open that jack will you  mr power again officiated
glasses were rinsed and five small measures of whisky were poured out
this new influence enlivened the conversation
mr fogarty sitting on a small area of the chair was specially interested
pope leo xiii said mr cunningham was one of the lights of the age
his great idea you know was the union of the latin and greek churches
that was the aim of his life  i often heard he was one of the most intellectual men in europe said mr power
i mean apart from his being pope  so he was said mr cunningham if not the most so
his motto you know as pope was lux upon luxlight upon light  no no said mr fogarty eagerly
i think youre wrong there
it was lux in tenebris i thinklight in darkness  o yes said mr mcoy tenebrae  allow me said mr cunningham positively it was lux upon lux
and pius ix
his predecessors motto was crux upon cruxthat is cross upon crossto show the difference between their two pontificates  the inference was allowed
mr cunningham continued
pope leo you know was a great scholar and a poet  he had a strong face said mr kernan
yes said mr cunningham
he wrote latin poetry  is that so said mr fogarty
mr mcoy tasted his whisky contentedly and shook his head with a double intention saying  thats no joke i can tell you  we didnt learn that tom said mr power following mr mcoys example when we went to the pennyaweek school  there was many a good man went to the pennyaweek school with a sod of turf under his oxter said mr kernan sententiously
the old system was the best plain honest education
none of your modern trumpery  quite right said mr power
no superfluities said mr fogarty
he enunciated the word and then drank gravely
i remember reading said mr cunningham that one of pope leos poems was on the invention of the photographin latin of course  on the photograph exclaimed mr kernan
yes said mr cunningham
he also drank from his glass
well you know said mr mcoy isnt the photograph wonderful when you come to think of it  o of course said mr power great minds can see things  as the poet says great minds are very near to madness said mr fogarty
mr kernan seemed to be troubled in mind
he made an effort to recall the protestant theology on some thorny points and in the end addressed mr cunningham
tell me martin he said
werent some of the popesof course not our present man or his predecessor but some of the old popesnot exactly  you know  up to the knocker  there was a silence
mr cunningham said  o of course there were some bad lots
but the astonishing thing is this
not one of them not the biggest drunkard not the most  outandout ruffian not one of them ever preached ex cathedra a word of false doctrine
now isnt that an astonishing thing  that is said mr kernan
yes because when the pope speaks ex cathedra mr fogarty explained he is infallible  yes said mr cunningham
o i know about the infallibility of the pope
i remember i was younger then or was it that  mr fogarty interrupted
he took up the bottle and helped the others to a little more
mr mcoy seeing that there was not enough to go round pleaded that he had not finished his first measure
the others accepted under protest
the light music of whisky falling into glasses made an agreeable interlude
whats that you were saying tom asked mr mcoy
papal infallibility said mr cunningham that was the greatest scene in the whole history of the church  how was that martin asked mr power
mr cunningham held up two thick fingers
in the sacred college you know of cardinals and archbishops and bishops there were two men who held out against it while the others were all for it
the whole conclave except these two was unanimous
no
they wouldnt have it  ha said mr mcoy
and they were a german cardinal by the name of dolling  or dowling  or  dowling was no german and thats a sure five said mr power laughing
well this great german cardinal whatever his name was was one and the other was john machale  what cried mr kernan
is it john of tuam  are you sure of that now asked mr fogarty dubiously
i thought it was some italian or american  john of tuam repeated mr cunningham was the man  he drank and the other gentlemen followed his lead
then he resumed  there they were at it all the cardinals and bishops and archbishops from all the ends of the earth and these two fighting dog and devil until at last the pope himself stood up and declared infallibility a dogma of the church ex cathedra
on the very moment john machale who had been arguing and arguing against it stood up and shouted out with the voice of a lion credo  i believe said mr fogarty
credo said mr cunningham
that showed the faith he had
he submitted the moment the pope spoke  and what about dowling asked mr mcoy
the german cardinal wouldnt submit
he left the church  mr cunninghams words had built up the vast image of the church in the minds of his hearers
his deep raucous voice had thrilled them as it uttered the word of belief and submission
when mrs kernan came into the room drying her hands she came into a solemn company
she did not disturb the silence but leaned over the rail at the foot of the bed
i once saw john machale said mr kernan and ill never forget it as long as i live  he turned towards his wife to be confirmed
i often told you that  mrs kernan nodded
it was at the unveiling of sir john grays statue
edmund dwyer gray was speaking blathering away and here was this old fellow crabbedlooking old chap looking at him from under his bushy eyebrows  mr kernan knitted his brows and lowering his head like an angry bull glared at his wife
god he exclaimed resuming his natural face i never saw such an eye in a mans head
it was as much as to say i have you properly taped my lad
he had an eye like a hawk  none of the grays was any good said mr power
there was a pause again
mr power turned to mrs kernan and said with abrupt joviality  well mrs kernan were going to make your man here a good holy pious and godfearing roman catholic  he swept his arm round the company inclusively
were all going to make a retreat together and confess our sinsand god knows we want it badly  i dont mind said mr kernan smiling a little nervously
mrs kernan thought it would be wiser to conceal her satisfaction
so she said  i pity the poor priest that has to listen to your tale  mr kernans expression changed
if he doesnt like it he said bluntly he can  do the other thing
ill just tell him my little tale of woe
im not such a bad fellow  mr cunningham intervened promptly
well all renounce the devil he said together not forgetting his works and pomps  get behind me satan said mr fogarty laughing and looking at the others
mr power said nothing
he felt completely outgeneralled
but a pleased expression flickered across his face
all we have to do said mr cunningham is to stand up with lighted candles in our hands and renew our baptismal vows  o dont forget the candle tom said mr mcoy whatever you do  what said mr kernan
must i have a candle  o yes said mr cunningham
no damn it all said mr kernan sensibly i draw the line there
ill do the job right enough
ill do the retreat business and confession and  all that business
but  no candles
no damn it all i bar the candles  he shook his head with farcical gravity
listen to that said his wife
i bar the candles said mr kernan conscious of having created an effect on his audience and continuing to shake his head to and fro
i bar the magiclantern business  everyone laughed heartily
theres a nice catholic for you said his wife
no candles repeated mr kernan obdurately
thats off   the transept of the jesuit church in gardiner street was almost full and still at every moment gentlemen entered from the side door and directed by the laybrother walked on tiptoe along the aisles until they found seating accommodation
the gentlemen were all well dressed and orderly
the light of the lamps of the church fell upon an assembly of black clothes and white collars relieved here and there by tweeds on dark mottled pillars of green marble and on lugubrious canvases
the gentlemen sat in the benches having hitched their trousers slightly above their knees and laid their hats in security
they sat well back and gazed formally at the distant speck of red light which was suspended before the high altar
in one of the benches near the pulpit sat mr cunningham and mr kernan
in the bench behind sat mr mcoy alone and in the bench behind him sat mr power and mr fogarty
mr mcoy had tried unsuccessfully to find a place in the bench with the others and when the party had settled down in the form of a quincunx he had tried unsuccessfully to make comic remarks
as these had not been well received he had desisted
even he was sensible of the decorous atmosphere and even he began to respond to the religious stimulus
in a whisper mr cunningham drew mr kernans attention to mr harford the moneylender who sat some distance off and to mr fanning the registration agent and mayor maker of the city who was sitting immediately under the pulpit beside one of the newly elected councillors of the ward
to the right sat old michael grimes the owner of three pawnbrokers shops and dan hogans nephew who was up for the job in the town clerks office
farther in front sat mr hendrick the chief reporter of the freemans journal and poor ocarroll an old friend of mr kernans who had been at one time a considerable commercial figure
gradually as he recognised familiar faces mr kernan began to feel more at home
his hat which had been rehabilitated by his wife rested upon his knees
once or twice he pulled down his cuffs with one hand while he held the brim of his hat lightly but firmly with the other hand
a powerfullooking figure the upper part of which was draped with a white surplice was observed to be struggling up into the pulpit
simultaneously the congregation unsettled produced handkerchiefs and knelt upon them with care
mr kernan followed the general example
the priests figure now stood upright in the pulpit twothirds of its bulk crowned by a massive red face appearing above the balustrade
father purdon knelt down turned towards the red speck of light and covering his face with his hands prayed
after an interval he uncovered his face and rose
the congregation rose also and settled again on its benches
mr kernan restored his hat to its original position on his knee and presented an attentive face to the preacher
the preacher turned back each wide sleeve of his surplice with an elaborate large gesture and slowly surveyed the array of faces
then he said   for the children of this world are wiser in their generation than the children of light
wherefore make unto yourselves friends out of the mammon of iniquity so that when you die they may receive you into everlasting dwellings   father purdon developed the text with resonant assurance
it was one of the most difficult texts in all the scriptures he said to interpret properly
it was a text which might seem to the casual observer at variance with the lofty morality elsewhere preached by jesus christ
but he told his hearers the text had seemed to him specially adapted for the guidance of those whose lot it was to lead the life of the world and who yet wished to lead that life not in the manner of worldlings
it was a text for business men and professional men
jesus christ with his divine understanding of every cranny of our human nature understood that all men were not called to the religious life that by far the vast majority were forced to live in the world and to a certain extent for the world and in this sentence he designed to give them a word of counsel setting before them as exemplars in the religious life those very worshippers of mammon who were of all men the least solicitous in matters religious
he told his hearers that he was there that evening for no terrifying no extravagant purpose but as a man of the world speaking to his fellowmen
he came to speak to business men and he would speak to them in a businesslike way
if he might use the metaphor he said he was their spiritual accountant and he wished each and every one of his hearers to open his books the books of his spiritual life and see if they tallied accurately with conscience
jesus christ was not a hard taskmaster
he understood our little failings understood the weakness of our poor fallen nature understood the temptations of this life
we might have had we all had from time to time our temptations we might have we all had our failings
but one thing only he said he would ask of his hearers
and that was to be straight and manly with god
if their accounts tallied in every point to say  well i have verified my accounts
i find all well  but if as might happen there were some discrepancies to admit the truth to be frank and say like a man  well i have looked into my accounts
i find this wrong and this wrong
but with gods grace i will rectify this and this
i will set right my accounts     the dead   lily the caretakers daughter was literally run off her feet
hardly had she brought one gentleman into the little pantry behind the office on the ground floor and helped him off with his overcoat than the wheezy halldoor bell clanged again and she had to scamper along the bare hallway to let in another guest
it was well for her she had not to attend to the ladies also
but miss kate and miss julia had thought of that and had converted the bathroom upstairs into a ladies dressingroom
miss kate and miss julia were there gossiping and laughing and fussing walking after each other to the head of the stairs peering down over the banisters and calling down to lily to ask her who had come
it was always a great affair the misses morkans annual dance
everybody who knew them came to it members of the family old friends of the family the members of julias choir any of kates pupils that were grown up enough and even some of mary janes pupils too
never once had it fallen flat
for years and years it had gone off in splendid style as long as anyone could remember ever since kate and julia after the death of their brother pat had left the house in stoney batter and taken mary jane their only niece to live with them in the dark gaunt house on ushers island the upper part of which they had rented from mr fulham the cornfactor on the ground floor
that was a good thirty years ago if it was a day
mary jane who was then a little girl in short clothes was now the main prop of the household for she had the organ in haddington road
she had been through the academy and gave a pupils concert every year in the upper room of the antient concert rooms
many of her pupils belonged to the betterclass families on the kingstown and dalkey line
old as they were her aunts also did their share
julia though she was quite grey was still the leading soprano in adam and eves and kate being too feeble to go about much gave music lessons to beginners on the old square piano in the back room
lily the caretakers daughter did housemaids work for them
though their life was modest they believed in eating well the best of everything diamondbone sirloins threeshilling tea and the best bottled stout
but lily seldom made a mistake in the orders so that she got on well with her three mistresses
they were fussy that was all
but the only thing they would not stand was back answers
of course they had good reason to be fussy on such a night
and then it was long after ten oclock and yet there was no sign of gabriel and his wife
besides they were dreadfully afraid that freddy malins might turn up screwed
they would not wish for worlds that any of mary janes pupils should see him under the influence and when he was like that it was sometimes very hard to manage him
freddy malins always came late but they wondered what could be keeping gabriel and that was what brought them every two minutes to the banisters to ask lily had gabriel or freddy come
o mr conroy said lily to gabriel when she opened the door for him miss kate and miss julia thought you were never coming
goodnight mrs conroy  ill engage they did said gabriel but they forget that my wife here takes three mortal hours to dress herself  he stood on the mat scraping the snow from his goloshes while lily led his wife to the foot of the stairs and called out  miss kate heres mrs conroy  kate and julia came toddling down the dark stairs at once
both of them kissed gabriels wife said she must be perished alive and asked was gabriel with her
here i am as right as the mail aunt kate
go on up
ill follow called out gabriel from the dark
he continued scraping his feet vigorously while the three women went upstairs laughing to the ladies dressingroom
a light fringe of snow lay like a cape on the shoulders of his overcoat and like toecaps on the toes of his goloshes and as the buttons of his overcoat slipped with a squeaking noise through the snowstiffened frieze a cold fragrant air from outofdoors escaped from crevices and folds
is it snowing again mr conroy asked lily
she had preceded him into the pantry to help him off with his overcoat
gabriel smiled at the three syllables she had given his surname and glanced at her
she was a slim growing girl pale in complexion and with haycoloured hair
the gas in the pantry made her look still paler
gabriel had known her when she was a child and used to sit on the lowest step nursing a rag doll
yes lily he answered and i think were in for a night of it  he looked up at the pantry ceiling which was shaking with the stamping and shuffling of feet on the floor above listened for a moment to the piano and then glanced at the girl who was folding his overcoat carefully at the end of a shelf
tell me lily he said in a friendly tone do you still go to school  o no sir she answered
im done schooling this year and more  o then said gabriel gaily i suppose well be going to your wedding one of these fine days with your young man eh  the girl glanced back at him over her shoulder and said with great bitterness  the men that is now is only all palaver and what they can get out of you  gabriel coloured as if he felt he had made a mistake and without looking at her kicked off his goloshes and flicked actively with his muffler at his patentleather shoes
he was a stout tallish young man
the high colour of his cheeks pushed upwards even to his forehead where it scattered itself in a few formless patches of pale red and on his hairless face there scintillated restlessly the polished lenses and the bright gilt rims of the glasses which screened his delicate and restless eyes
his glossy black hair was parted in the middle and brushed in a long curve behind his ears where it curled slightly beneath the groove left by his hat
when he had flicked lustre into his shoes he stood up and pulled his waistcoat down more tightly on his plump body
then he took a coin rapidly from his pocket
o lily he said thrusting it into her hands its christmastime isnt it
just  heres a little  he walked rapidly towards the door
o no sir cried the girl following him
really sir i wouldnt take it  christmastime
christmastime said gabriel almost trotting to the stairs and waving his hand to her in deprecation
the girl seeing that he had gained the stairs called out after him  well thank you sir  he waited outside the drawingroom door until the waltz should finish listening to the skirts that swept against it and to the shuffling of feet
he was still discomposed by the girls bitter and sudden retort
it had cast a gloom over him which he tried to dispel by arranging his cuffs and the bows of his tie
he then took from his waistcoat pocket a little paper and glanced at the headings he had made for his speech
he was undecided about the lines from robert browning for he feared they would be above the heads of his hearers
some quotation that they would recognise from shakespeare or from the melodies would be better
the indelicate clacking of the mens heels and the shuffling of their soles reminded him that their grade of culture differed from his
he would only make himself ridiculous by quoting poetry to them which they could not understand
they would think that he was airing his superior education
he would fail with them just as he had failed with the girl in the pantry
he had taken up a wrong tone
his whole speech was a mistake from first to last an utter failure
just then his aunts and his wife came out of the ladies dressingroom
his aunts were two small plainly dressed old women
aunt julia was an inch or so the taller
her hair drawn low over the tops of her ears was grey and grey also with darker shadows was her large flaccid face
though she was stout in build and stood erect her slow eyes and parted lips gave her the appearance of a woman who did not know where she was or where she was going
aunt kate was more vivacious
her face healthier than her sisters was all puckers and creases like a shrivelled red apple and her hair braided in the same oldfashioned way had not lost its ripe nut colour
they both kissed gabriel frankly
he was their favourite nephew the son of their dead elder sister ellen who had married t j conroy of the port and docks
gretta tells me youre not going to take a cab back to monkstown tonight gabriel said aunt kate
no said gabriel turning to his wife we had quite enough of that last year hadnt we
dont you remember aunt kate what a cold gretta got out of it
cab windows rattling all the way and the east wind blowing in after we passed merrion
very jolly it was
gretta caught a dreadful cold  aunt kate frowned severely and nodded her head at every word
quite right gabriel quite right she said
you cant be too careful  but as for gretta there said gabriel shed walk home in the snow if she were let  mrs conroy laughed
dont mind him aunt kate she said
hes really an awful bother what with green shades for toms eyes at night and making him do the dumbbells and forcing eva to eat the stirabout
the poor child
and she simply hates the sight of it
o but youll never guess what he makes me wear now  she broke out into a peal of laughter and glanced at her husband whose admiring and happy eyes had been wandering from her dress to her face and hair
the two aunts laughed heartily too for gabriels solicitude was a standing joke with them
goloshes said mrs conroy
thats the latest
whenever its wet underfoot i must put on my goloshes
tonight even he wanted me to put them on but i wouldnt
the next thing hell buy me will be a diving suit  gabriel laughed nervously and patted his tie reassuringly while aunt kate nearly doubled herself so heartily did she enjoy the joke
the smile soon faded from aunt julias face and her mirthless eyes were directed towards her nephews face
after a pause she asked  and what are goloshes gabriel  goloshes julia exclaimed her sister
goodness me dont you know what goloshes are
you wear them over your  over your boots gretta isnt it  yes said mrs conroy
guttapercha things
we both have a pair now
gabriel says everyone wears them on the continent  o on the continent murmured aunt julia nodding her head slowly
gabriel knitted his brows and said as if he were slightly angered  its nothing very wonderful but gretta thinks it very funny because she says the word reminds her of christy minstrels  but tell me gabriel said aunt kate with brisk tact
of course youve seen about the room
gretta was saying  o the room is all right replied gabriel
ive taken one in the gresham  to be sure said aunt kate by far the best thing to do
and the children gretta youre not anxious about them  o for one night said mrs conroy
besides bessie will look after them  to be sure said aunt kate again
what a comfort it is to have a girl like that one you can depend on
theres that lily im sure i dont know what has come over her lately
shes not the girl she was at all  gabriel was about to ask his aunt some questions on this point but she broke off suddenly to gaze after her sister who had wandered down the stairs and was craning her neck over the banisters
now i ask you she said almost testily where is julia going
julia
julia
where are you going  julia who had gone half way down one flight came back and announced blandly  heres freddy  at the same moment a clapping of hands and a final flourish of the pianist told that the waltz had ended
the drawingroom door was opened from within and some couples came out
aunt kate drew gabriel aside hurriedly and whispered into his ear  slip down gabriel like a good fellow and see if hes all right and dont let him up if hes screwed
im sure hes screwed
im sure he is  gabriel went to the stairs and listened over the banisters
he could hear two persons talking in the pantry
then he recognised freddy malins laugh
he went down the stairs noisily
its such a relief said aunt kate to mrs conroy that gabriel is here
i always feel easier in my mind when hes here julia theres miss daly and miss power will take some refreshment
thanks for your beautiful waltz miss daly
it made lovely time  a tall wizenfaced man with a stiff grizzled moustache and swarthy skin who was passing out with his partner said  and may we have some refreshment too miss morkan  julia said aunt kate summarily and heres mr browne and miss furlong
take them in julia with miss daly and miss power  im the man for the ladies said mr browne pursing his lips until his moustache bristled and smiling in all his wrinkles
you know miss morkan the reason they are so fond of me is  he did not finish his sentence but seeing that aunt kate was out of earshot at once led the three young ladies into the back room
the middle of the room was occupied by two square tables placed end to end and on these aunt julia and the caretaker were straightening and smoothing a large cloth
on the sideboard were arrayed dishes and plates and glasses and bundles of knives and forks and spoons
the top of the closed square piano served also as a sideboard for viands and sweets
at a smaller sideboard in one corner two young men were standing drinking hopbitters
mr browne led his charges thither and invited them all in jest to some ladies punch hot strong and sweet
as they said they never took anything strong he opened three bottles of lemonade for them
then he asked one of the young men to move aside and taking hold of the decanter filled out for himself a goodly measure of whisky
the young men eyed him respectfully while he took a trial sip
god help me he said smiling its the doctors orders  his wizened face broke into a broader smile and the three young ladies laughed in musical echo to his pleasantry swaying their bodies to and fro with nervous jerks of their shoulders
the boldest said  o now mr browne im sure the doctor never ordered anything of the kind  mr browne took another sip of his whisky and said with sidling mimicry  well you see im like the famous mrs cassidy who is reported to have said now mary grimes if i dont take it make me take it for i feel i want it  his hot face had leaned forward a little too confidentially and he had assumed a very low dublin accent so that the young ladies with one instinct received his speech in silence
miss furlong who was one of mary janes pupils asked miss daly what was the name of the pretty waltz she had played and mr browne seeing that he was ignored turned promptly to the two young men who were more appreciative
a redfaced young woman dressed in pansy came into the room excitedly clapping her hands and crying  quadrilles
quadrilles  close on her heels came aunt kate crying  two gentlemen and three ladies mary jane  o heres mr bergin and mr kerrigan said mary jane
mr kerrigan will you take miss power
miss furlong may i get you a partner mr bergin
o thatll just do now  three ladies mary jane said aunt kate
the two young gentlemen asked the ladies if they might have the pleasure and mary jane turned to miss daly
o miss daly youre really awfully good after playing for the last two dances but really were so short of ladies tonight  i dont mind in the least miss morkan  but ive a nice partner for you mr bartell darcy the tenor
ill get him to sing later on
all dublin is raving about him  lovely voice lovely voice said aunt kate
as the piano had twice begun the prelude to the first figure mary jane led her recruits quickly from the room
they had hardly gone when aunt julia wandered slowly into the room looking behind her at something
what is the matter julia asked aunt kate anxiously
who is it  julia who was carrying in a column of tablenapkins turned to her sister and said simply as if the question had surprised her  its only freddy kate and gabriel with him  in fact right behind her gabriel could be seen piloting freddy malins across the landing
the latter a young man of about forty was of gabriels size and build with very round shoulders
his face was fleshy and pallid touched with colour only at the thick hanging lobes of his ears and at the wide wings of his nose
he had coarse features a blunt nose a convex and receding brow tumid and protruded lips
his heavylidded eyes and the disorder of his scanty hair made him look sleepy
he was laughing heartily in a high key at a story which he had been telling gabriel on the stairs and at the same time rubbing the knuckles of his left fist backwards and forwards into his left eye
goodevening freddy said aunt julia
freddy malins bade the misses morkan goodevening in what seemed an offhand fashion by reason of the habitual catch in his voice and then seeing that mr browne was grinning at him from the sideboard crossed the room on rather shaky legs and began to repeat in an undertone the story he had just told to gabriel
hes not so bad is he said aunt kate to gabriel
gabriels brows were dark but he raised them quickly and answered  o no hardly noticeable  now isnt he a terrible fellow she said
and his poor mother made him take the pledge on new years eve
but come on gabriel into the drawingroom  before leaving the room with gabriel she signalled to mr browne by frowning and shaking her forefinger in warning to and fro
mr browne nodded in answer and when she had gone said to freddy malins  now then teddy im going to fill you out a good glass of lemonade just to buck you up  freddy malins who was nearing the climax of his story waved the offer aside impatiently but mr browne having first called freddy malins attention to a disarray in his dress filled out and handed him a full glass of lemonade
freddy malins left hand accepted the glass mechanically his right hand being engaged in the mechanical readjustment of his dress
mr browne whose face was once more wrinkling with mirth poured out for himself a glass of whisky while freddy malins exploded before he had well reached the climax of his story in a kink of highpitched bronchitic laughter and setting down his untasted and overflowing glass began to rub the knuckles of his left fist backwards and forwards into his left eye repeating words of his last phrase as well as his fit of laughter would allow him
gabriel could not listen while mary jane was playing her academy piece full of runs and difficult passages to the hushed drawingroom
he liked music but the piece she was playing had no melody for him and he doubted whether it had any melody for the other listeners though they had begged mary jane to play something
four young men who had come from the refreshmentroom to stand in the doorway at the sound of the piano had gone away quietly in couples after a few minutes
the only persons who seemed to follow the music were mary jane herself her hands racing along the keyboard or lifted from it at the pauses like those of a priestess in momentary imprecation and aunt kate standing at her elbow to turn the page
gabriels eyes irritated by the floor which glittered with beeswax under the heavy chandelier wandered to the wall above the piano
a picture of the balcony scene in romeo and juliet hung there and beside it was a picture of the two murdered princes in the tower which aunt julia had worked in red blue and brown wools when she was a girl
probably in the school they had gone to as girls that kind of work had been taught for one year
his mother had worked for him as a birthday present a waistcoat of purple tabinet with little foxes heads upon it lined with brown satin and having round mulberry buttons
it was strange that his mother had had no musical talent though aunt kate used to call her the brains carrier of the morkan family
both she and julia had always seemed a little proud of their serious and matronly sister
her photograph stood before the pierglass
she held an open book on her knees and was pointing out something in it to constantine who dressed in a manowar suit lay at her feet
it was she who had chosen the name of her sons for she was very sensible of the dignity of family life
thanks to her constantine was now senior curate in balbrigan and thanks to her gabriel himself had taken his degree in the royal university
a shadow passed over his face as he remembered her sullen opposition to his marriage
some slighting phrases she had used still rankled in his memory she had once spoken of gretta as being country cute and that was not true of gretta at all
it was gretta who had nursed her during all her last long illness in their house at monkstown
he knew that mary jane must be near the end of her piece for she was playing again the opening melody with runs of scales after every bar and while he waited for the end the resentment died down in his heart
the piece ended with a trill of octaves in the treble and a final deep octave in the bass
great applause greeted mary jane as blushing and rolling up her music nervously she escaped from the room
the most vigorous clapping came from the four young men in the doorway who had gone away to the refreshmentroom at the beginning of the piece but had come back when the piano had stopped
lancers were arranged
gabriel found himself partnered with miss ivors
she was a frankmannered talkative young lady with a freckled face and prominent brown eyes
she did not wear a lowcut bodice and the large brooch which was fixed in the front of her collar bore on it an irish device and motto
when they had taken their places she said abruptly  i have a crow to pluck with you  with me said gabriel
she nodded her head gravely
what is it asked gabriel smiling at her solemn manner
who is g c answered miss ivors turning her eyes upon him
gabriel coloured and was about to knit his brows as if he did not understand when she said bluntly  o innocent amy
i have found out that you write for the daily express
now arent you ashamed of yourself  why should i be ashamed of myself asked gabriel blinking his eyes and trying to smile
well im ashamed of you said miss ivors frankly
to say youd write for a paper like that
i didnt think you were a west briton  a look of perplexity appeared on gabriels face
it was true that he wrote a literary column every wednesday in the daily express for which he was paid fifteen shillings
but that did not make him a west briton surely
the books he received for review were almost more welcome than the paltry cheque
he loved to feel the covers and turn over the pages of newly printed books
nearly every day when his teaching in the college was ended he used to wander down the quays to the secondhand booksellers to hickeys on bachelors walk to webbs or masseys on astons quay or to oclohisseys in the bystreet
he did not know how to meet her charge
he wanted to say that literature was above politics
but they were friends of many years standing and their careers had been parallel first at the university and then as teachers he could not risk a grandiose phrase with her
he continued blinking his eyes and trying to smile and murmured lamely that he saw nothing political in writing reviews of books
when their turn to cross had come he was still perplexed and inattentive
miss ivors promptly took his hand in a warm grasp and said in a soft friendly tone  of course i was only joking
come we cross now  when they were together again she spoke of the university question and gabriel felt more at ease
a friend of hers had shown her his review of brownings poems
that was how she had found out the secret but she liked the review immensely
then she said suddenly  o mr conroy will you come for an excursion to the aran isles this summer
were going to stay there a whole month
it will be splendid out in the atlantic
you ought to come
mr clancy is coming and mr kilkelly and kathleen kearney
it would be splendid for gretta too if shed come
shes from connacht isnt she  her people are said gabriel shortly
but you will come wont you said miss ivors laying her warm hand eagerly on his arm
the fact is said gabriel i have just arranged to go  go where asked miss ivors
well you know every year i go for a cycling tour with some fellows and so  but where asked miss ivors
well we usually go to france or belgium or perhaps germany said gabriel awkwardly
and why do you go to france and belgium said miss ivors instead of visiting your own land  well said gabriel its partly to keep in touch with the languages and partly for a change  and havent you your own language to keep in touch withirish asked miss ivors
well said gabriel if it comes to that you know irish is not my language  their neighbours had turned to listen to the crossexamination
gabriel glanced right and left nervously and tried to keep his good humour under the ordeal which was making a blush invade his forehead
and havent you your own land to visit continued miss ivors that you know nothing of your own people and your own country  o to tell you the truth retorted gabriel suddenly im sick of my own country sick of it  why asked miss ivors
gabriel did not answer for his retort had heated him
why repeated miss ivors
they had to go visiting together and as he had not answered her miss ivors said warmly  of course youve no answer  gabriel tried to cover his agitation by taking part in the dance with great energy
he avoided her eyes for he had seen a sour expression on her face
but when they met in the long chain he was surprised to feel his hand firmly pressed
she looked at him from under her brows for a moment quizzically until he smiled
then just as the chain was about to start again she stood on tiptoe and whispered into his ear  west briton  when the lancers were over gabriel went away to a remote corner of the room where freddy malins mother was sitting
she was a stout feeble old woman with white hair
her voice had a catch in it like her sons and she stuttered slightly
she had been told that freddy had come and that he was nearly all right
gabriel asked her whether she had had a good crossing
she lived with her married daughter in glasgow and came to dublin on a visit once a year
she answered placidly that she had had a beautiful crossing and that the captain had been most attentive to her
she spoke also of the beautiful house her daughter kept in glasgow and of all the friends they had there
while her tongue rambled on gabriel tried to banish from his mind all memory of the unpleasant incident with miss ivors
of course the girl or woman or whatever she was was an enthusiast but there was a time for all things
perhaps he ought not to have answered her like that
but she had no right to call him a west briton before people even in joke
she had tried to make him ridiculous before people heckling him and staring at him with her rabbits eyes
he saw his wife making her way towards him through the waltzing couples
when she reached him she said into his ear  gabriel aunt kate wants to know wont you carve the goose as usual
miss daly will carve the ham and ill do the pudding  all right said gabriel
shes sending in the younger ones first as soon as this waltz is over so that well have the table to ourselves  were you dancing asked gabriel
of course i was
didnt you see me
what row had you with molly ivors  no row
why
did she say so  something like that
im trying to get that mr darcy to sing
hes full of conceit i think  there was no row said gabriel moodily only she wanted me to go for a trip to the west of ireland and i said i wouldnt  his wife clasped her hands excitedly and gave a little jump
o do go gabriel she cried
id love to see galway again  you can go if you like said gabriel coldly
she looked at him for a moment then turned to mrs malins and said  theres a nice husband for you mrs malins  while she was threading her way back across the room mrs malins without adverting to the interruption went on to tell gabriel what beautiful places there were in scotland and beautiful scenery
her soninlaw brought them every year to the lakes and they used to go fishing
her soninlaw was a splendid fisher
one day he caught a beautiful big fish and the man in the hotel cooked it for their dinner
gabriel hardly heard what she said
now that supper was coming near he began to think again about his speech and about the quotation
when he saw freddy malins coming across the room to visit his mother gabriel left the chair free for him and retired into the embrasure of the window
the room had already cleared and from the back room came the clatter of plates and knives
those who still remained in the drawingroom seemed tired of dancing and were conversing quietly in little groups
gabriels warm trembling fingers tapped the cold pane of the window
how cool it must be outside
how pleasant it would be to walk out alone first along by the river and then through the park
the snow would be lying on the branches of the trees and forming a bright cap on the top of the wellington monument
how much more pleasant it would be there than at the suppertable
he ran over the headings of his speech irish hospitality sad memories the three graces paris the quotation from browning
he repeated to himself a phrase he had written in his review one feels that one is listening to a thoughttormented music miss ivors had praised the review
was she sincere
had she really any life of her own behind all her propagandism
there had never been any illfeeling between them until that night
it unnerved him to think that she would be at the suppertable looking up at him while he spoke with her critical quizzing eyes
perhaps she would not be sorry to see him fail in his speech
an idea came into his mind and gave him courage
he would say alluding to aunt kate and aunt julia ladies and gentlemen the generation which is now on the wane among us may have had its faults but for my part i think it had certain qualities of hospitality of humour of humanity which the new and very serious and hypereducated generation that is growing up around us seems to me to lack very good that was one for miss ivors
what did he care that his aunts were only two ignorant old women
a murmur in the room attracted his attention
mr browne was advancing from the door gallantly escorting aunt julia who leaned upon his arm smiling and hanging her head
an irregular musketry of applause escorted her also as far as the piano and then as mary jane seated herself on the stool and aunt julia no longer smiling half turned so as to pitch her voice fairly into the room gradually ceased
gabriel recognised the prelude
it was that of an old song of aunt juliasarrayed for the bridal
her voice strong and clear in tone attacked with great spirit the runs which embellish the air and though she sang very rapidly she did not miss even the smallest of the grace notes
to follow the voice without looking at the singers face was to feel and share the excitement of swift and secure flight
gabriel applauded loudly with all the others at the close of the song and loud applause was borne in from the invisible suppertable
it sounded so genuine that a little colour struggled into aunt julias face as she bent to replace in the musicstand the old leatherbound songbook that had her initials on the cover
freddy malins who had listened with his head perched sideways to hear her better was still applauding when everyone else had ceased and talking animatedly to his mother who nodded her head gravely and slowly in acquiescence
at last when he could clap no more he stood up suddenly and hurried across the room to aunt julia whose hand he seized and held in both his hands shaking it when words failed him or the catch in his voice proved too much for him
i was just telling my mother he said i never heard you sing so well never
no i never heard your voice so good as it is tonight
now
would you believe that now
thats the truth
upon my word and honour thats the truth
i never heard your voice sound so fresh and so  so clear and fresh never  aunt julia smiled broadly and murmured something about compliments as she released her hand from his grasp
mr browne extended his open hand towards her and said to those who were near him in the manner of a showman introducing a prodigy to an audience  miss julia morkan my latest discovery  he was laughing very heartily at this himself when freddy malins turned to him and said  well browne if youre serious you might make a worse discovery
all i can say is i never heard her sing half so well as long as i am coming here
and thats the honest truth  neither did i said mr browne
i think her voice has greatly improved  aunt julia shrugged her shoulders and said with meek pride  thirty years ago i hadnt a bad voice as voices go  i often told julia said aunt kate emphatically that she was simply thrown away in that choir
but she never would be said by me  she turned as if to appeal to the good sense of the others against a refractory child while aunt julia gazed in front of her a vague smile of reminiscence playing on her face
no continued aunt kate she wouldnt be said or led by anyone slaving there in that choir night and day night and day
six oclock on christmas morning
and all for what  well isnt it for the honour of god aunt kate asked mary jane twisting round on the pianostool and smiling
aunt kate turned fiercely on her niece and said  i know all about the honour of god mary jane but i think its not at all honourable for the pope to turn out the women out of the choirs that have slaved there all their lives and put little whippersnappers of boys over their heads
i suppose it is for the good of the church if the pope does it
but its not just mary jane and its not right  she had worked herself into a passion and would have continued in defence of her sister for it was a sore subject with her but mary jane seeing that all the dancers had come back intervened pacifically  now aunt kate youre giving scandal to mr browne who is of the other persuasion  aunt kate turned to mr browne who was grinning at this allusion to his religion and said hastily  o i dont question the popes being right
im only a stupid old woman and i wouldnt presume to do such a thing
but theres such a thing as common everyday politeness and gratitude
and if i were in julias place id tell that father healey straight up to his face  and besides aunt kate said mary jane we really are all hungry and when we are hungry we are all very quarrelsome  and when we are thirsty we are also quarrelsome added mr browne
so that we had better go to supper said mary jane and finish the discussion afterwards  on the landing outside the drawingroom gabriel found his wife and mary jane trying to persuade miss ivors to stay for supper
but miss ivors who had put on her hat and was buttoning her cloak would not stay
she did not feel in the least hungry and she had already overstayed her time
but only for ten minutes molly said mrs conroy
that wont delay you  to take a pick itself said mary jane after all your dancing  i really couldnt said miss ivors
i am afraid you didnt enjoy yourself at all said mary jane hopelessly
ever so much i assure you said miss ivors but you really must let me run off now  but how can you get home asked mrs conroy
o its only two steps up the quay  gabriel hesitated a moment and said  if you will allow me miss ivors ill see you home if you are really obliged to go  but miss ivors broke away from them
i wont hear of it she cried
for goodness sake go in to your suppers and dont mind me
im quite well able to take care of myself  well youre the comical girl molly said mrs conroy frankly
beannacht libh cried miss ivors with a laugh as she ran down the staircase
mary jane gazed after her a moody puzzled expression on her face while mrs conroy leaned over the banisters to listen for the halldoor
gabriel asked himself was he the cause of her abrupt departure
but she did not seem to be in ill humour she had gone away laughing
he stared blankly down the staircase
at the moment aunt kate came toddling out of the supperroom almost wringing her hands in despair
where is gabriel she cried
where on earth is gabriel
theres everyone waiting in there stage to let and nobody to carve the goose  here i am aunt kate cried gabriel with sudden animation ready to carve a flock of geese if necessary  a fat brown goose lay at one end of the table and at the other end on a bed of creased paper strewn with sprigs of parsley lay a great ham stripped of its outer skin and peppered over with crust crumbs a neat paper frill round its shin and beside this was a round of spiced beef
between these rival ends ran parallel lines of sidedishes two little minsters of jelly red and yellow a shallow dish full of blocks of blancmange and red jam a large green leafshaped dish with a stalkshaped handle on which lay bunches of purple raisins and peeled almonds a companion dish on which lay a solid rectangle of smyrna figs a dish of custard topped with grated nutmeg a small bowl full of chocolates and sweets wrapped in gold and silver papers and a glass vase in which stood some tall celery stalks
in the centre of the table there stood as sentries to a fruitstand which upheld a pyramid of oranges and american apples two squat oldfashioned decanters of cut glass one containing port and the other dark sherry
on the closed square piano a pudding in a huge yellow dish lay in waiting and behind it were three squads of bottles of stout and ale and minerals drawn up according to the colours of their uniforms the first two black with brown and red labels the third and smallest squad white with transverse green sashes
gabriel took his seat boldly at the head of the table and having looked to the edge of the carver plunged his fork firmly into the goose
he felt quite at ease now for he was an expert carver and liked nothing better than to find himself at the head of a wellladen table
miss furlong what shall i send you he asked
a wing or a slice of the breast  just a small slice of the breast  miss higgins what for you  o anything at all mr conroy  while gabriel and miss daly exchanged plates of goose and plates of ham and spiced beef lily went from guest to guest with a dish of hot floury potatoes wrapped in a white napkin
this was mary janes idea and she had also suggested apple sauce for the goose but aunt kate had said that plain roast goose without any apple sauce had always been good enough for her and she hoped she might never eat worse
mary jane waited on her pupils and saw that they got the best slices and aunt kate and aunt julia opened and carried across from the piano bottles of stout and ale for the gentlemen and bottles of minerals for the ladies
there was a great deal of confusion and laughter and noise the noise of orders and counterorders of knives and forks of corks and glassstoppers
gabriel began to carve second helpings as soon as he had finished the first round without serving himself
everyone protested loudly so that he compromised by taking a long draught of stout for he had found the carving hot work
mary jane settled down quietly to her supper but aunt kate and aunt julia were still toddling round the table walking on each others heels getting in each others way and giving each other unheeded orders
mr browne begged of them to sit down and eat their suppers and so did gabriel but they said they were time enough so that at last freddy malins stood up and capturing aunt kate plumped her down on her chair amid general laughter
when everyone had been well served gabriel said smiling  now if anyone wants a little more of what vulgar people call stuffing let him or her speak  a chorus of voices invited him to begin his own supper and lily came forward with three potatoes which she had reserved for him
very well said gabriel amiably as he took another preparatory draught kindly forget my existence ladies and gentlemen for a few minutes  he set to his supper and took no part in the conversation with which the table covered lilys removal of the plates
the subject of talk was the opera company which was then at the theatre royal
mr bartell darcy the tenor a darkcomplexioned young man with a smart moustache praised very highly the leading contralto of the company but miss furlong thought she had a rather vulgar style of production
freddy malins said there was a negro chieftain singing in the second part of the gaiety pantomime who had one of the finest tenor voices he had ever heard
have you heard him he asked mr bartell darcy across the table
no answered mr bartell darcy carelessly
because freddy malins explained now id be curious to hear your opinion of him
i think he has a grand voice  it takes teddy to find out the really good things said mr browne familiarly to the table
and why couldnt he have a voice too asked freddy malins sharply
is it because hes only a black  nobody answered this question and mary jane led the table back to the legitimate opera
one of her pupils had given her a pass for mignon
of course it was very fine she said but it made her think of poor georgina burns
mr browne could go back farther still to the old italian companies that used to come to dublintietjens ilma de murzka campanini the great trebelli giuglini ravelli aramburo
those were the days he said when there was something like singing to be heard in dublin
he told too of how the top gallery of the old royal used to be packed night after night of how one night an italian tenor had sung five encores to let me like a soldier fall introducing a high c every time and of how the gallery boys would sometimes in their enthusiasm unyoke the horses from the carriage of some great prima donna and pull her themselves through the streets to her hotel
why did they never play the grand old operas now he asked dinorah lucrezia borgia because they could not get the voices to sing them that was why
oh well said mr bartell darcy i presume there are as good singers today as there were then  where are they asked mr browne defiantly
in london paris milan said mr bartell darcy warmly
i suppose caruso for example is quite as good if not better than any of the men you have mentioned  maybe so said mr browne
but i may tell you i doubt it strongly  o id give anything to hear caruso sing said mary jane
for me said aunt kate who had been picking a bone there was only one tenor
to please me i mean
but i suppose none of you ever heard of him  who was he miss morkan asked mr bartell darcy politely
his name said aunt kate was parkinson
i heard him when he was in his prime and i think he had then the purest tenor voice that was ever put into a mans throat  strange said mr bartell darcy
i never even heard of him  yes yes miss morkan is right said mr browne
i remember hearing of old parkinson but hes too far back for me  a beautiful pure sweet mellow english tenor said aunt kate with enthusiasm
gabriel having finished the huge pudding was transferred to the table
the clatter of forks and spoons began again
gabriels wife served out spoonfuls of the pudding and passed the plates down the table
midway down they were held up by mary jane who replenished them with raspberry or orange jelly or with blancmange and jam
the pudding was of aunt julias making and she received praises for it from all quarters
she herself said that it was not quite brown enough
well i hope miss morkan said mr browne that im brown enough for you because you know im all brown  all the gentlemen except gabriel ate some of the pudding out of compliment to aunt julia
as gabriel never ate sweets the celery had been left for him
freddy malins also took a stalk of celery and ate it with his pudding
he had been told that celery was a capital thing for the blood and he was just then under doctors care
mrs malins who had been silent all through the supper said that her son was going down to mount melleray in a week or so
the table then spoke of mount melleray how bracing the air was down there how hospitable the monks were and how they never asked for a pennypiece from their guests
and do you mean to say asked mr browne incredulously that a chap can go down there and put up there as if it were a hotel and live on the fat of the land and then come away without paying anything  o most people give some donation to the monastery when they leave said mary jane
i wish we had an institution like that in our church said mr browne candidly
he was astonished to hear that the monks never spoke got up at two in the morning and slept in their coffins
he asked what they did it for
thats the rule of the order said aunt kate firmly
yes but why asked mr browne
aunt kate repeated that it was the rule that was all
mr browne still seemed not to understand
freddy malins explained to him as best he could that the monks were trying to make up for the sins committed by all the sinners in the outside world
the explanation was not very clear for mr browne grinned and said  i like that idea very much but wouldnt a comfortable spring bed do them as well as a coffin  the coffin said mary jane is to remind them of their last end  as the subject had grown lugubrious it was buried in a silence of the table during which mrs malins could be heard saying to her neighbour in an indistinct undertone  they are very good men the monks very pious men  the raisins and almonds and figs and apples and oranges and chocolates and sweets were now passed about the table and aunt julia invited all the guests to have either port or sherry
at first mr bartell darcy refused to take either but one of his neighbours nudged him and whispered something to him upon which he allowed his glass to be filled
gradually as the last glasses were being filled the conversation ceased
a pause followed broken only by the noise of the wine and by unsettlings of chairs
the misses morkan all three looked down at the tablecloth
someone coughed once or twice and then a few gentlemen patted the table gently as a signal for silence
the silence came and gabriel pushed back his chair
the patting at once grew louder in encouragement and then ceased altogether
gabriel leaned his ten trembling fingers on the tablecloth and smiled nervously at the company
meeting a row of upturned faces he raised his eyes to the chandelier
the piano was playing a waltz tune and he could hear the skirts sweeping against the drawingroom door
people perhaps were standing in the snow on the quay outside gazing up at the lighted windows and listening to the waltz music
the air was pure there
in the distance lay the park where the trees were weighted with snow
the wellington monument wore a gleaming cap of snow that flashed westward over the white field of fifteen acres
he began  ladies and gentlemen  it has fallen to my lot this evening as in years past to perform a very pleasing task but a task for which i am afraid my poor powers as a speaker are all too inadequate  no no said mr browne
but however that may be i can only ask you tonight to take the will for the deed and to lend me your attention for a few moments while i endeavour to express to you in words what my feelings are on this occasion
ladies and gentlemen it is not the first time that we have gathered together under this hospitable roof around this hospitable board
it is not the first time that we have been the recipientsor perhaps i had better say the victimsof the hospitality of certain good ladies  he made a circle in the air with his arm and paused
everyone laughed or smiled at aunt kate and aunt julia and mary jane who all turned crimson with pleasure
gabriel went on more boldly  i feel more strongly with every recurring year that our country has no tradition which does it so much honour and which it should guard so jealously as that of its hospitality
it is a tradition that is unique as far as my experience goes and i have visited not a few places abroad among the modern nations
some would say perhaps that with us it is rather a failing than anything to be boasted of
but granted even that it is to my mind a princely failing and one that i trust will long be cultivated among us
of one thing at least i am sure
as long as this one roof shelters the good ladies aforesaidand i wish from my heart it may do so for many and many a long year to comethe tradition of genuine warmhearted courteous irish hospitality which our forefathers have handed down to us and which we in turn must hand down to our descendants is still alive among us  a hearty murmur of assent ran round the table
it shot through gabriels mind that miss ivors was not there and that she had gone away discourteously and he said with confidence in himself  ladies and gentlemen  a new generation is growing up in our midst a generation actuated by new ideas and new principles
it is serious and enthusiastic for these new ideas and its enthusiasm even when it is misdirected is i believe in the main sincere
but we are living in a sceptical and if i may use the phrase a thoughttormented age and sometimes i fear that this new generation educated or hypereducated as it is will lack those qualities of humanity of hospitality of kindly humour which belonged to an older day
listening tonight to the names of all those great singers of the past it seemed to me i must confess that we were living in a less spacious age
those days might without exaggeration be called spacious days and if they are gone beyond recall let us hope at least that in gatherings such as this we shall still speak of them with pride and affection still cherish in our hearts the memory of those dead and gone great ones whose fame the world will not willingly let die  hear hear said mr browne loudly
but yet continued gabriel his voice falling into a softer inflection there are always in gatherings such as this sadder thoughts that will recur to our minds thoughts of the past of youth of changes of absent faces that we miss here tonight
our path through life is strewn with many such sad memories and were we to brood upon them always we could not find the heart to go on bravely with our work among the living
we have all of us living duties and living affections which claim and rightly claim our strenuous endeavours
therefore i will not linger on the past
i will not let any gloomy moralising intrude upon us here tonight
here we are gathered together for a brief moment from the bustle and rush of our everyday routine
we are met here as friends in the spirit of goodfellowship as colleagues also to a certain extent in the true spirit of camaraderie and as the guests ofwhat shall i call themthe three graces of the dublin musical world  the table burst into applause and laughter at this allusion
aunt julia vainly asked each of her neighbours in turn to tell her what gabriel had said
he says we are the three graces aunt julia said mary jane
aunt julia did not understand but she looked up smiling at gabriel who continued in the same vein  ladies and gentlemen  i will not attempt to play tonight the part that paris played on another occasion
i will not attempt to choose between them
the task would be an invidious one and one beyond my poor powers
for when i view them in turn whether it be our chief hostess herself whose good heart whose too good heart has become a byword with all who know her or her sister who seems to be gifted with perennial youth and whose singing must have been a surprise and a revelation to us all tonight or last but not least when i consider our youngest hostess talented cheerful hardworking and the best of nieces i confess ladies and gentlemen that i do not know to which of them i should award the prize  gabriel glanced down at his aunts and seeing the large smile on aunt julias face and the tears which had risen to aunt kates eyes hastened to his close
he raised his glass of port gallantly while every member of the company fingered a glass expectantly and said loudly  let us toast them all three together
let us drink to their health wealth long life happiness and prosperity and may they long continue to hold the proud and selfwon position which they hold in their profession and the position of honour and affection which they hold in our hearts  all the guests stood up glass in hand and turning towards the three seated ladies sang in unison with mr browne as leader       for they are jolly gay fellows      for they are jolly gay fellows      for they are jolly gay fellows      which nobody can deny
aunt kate was making frank use of her handkerchief and even aunt julia seemed moved
freddy malins beat time with his puddingfork and the singers turned towards one another as if in melodious conference while they sang with emphasis       unless he tells a lie      unless he tells a lie
then turning once more towards their hostesses they sang       for they are jolly gay fellows      for they are jolly gay fellows      for they are jolly gay fellows      which nobody can deny
the acclamation which followed was taken up beyond the door of the supperroom by many of the other guests and renewed time after time freddy malins acting as officer with his fork on high
the piercing morning air came into the hall where they were standing so that aunt kate said  close the door somebody
mrs malins will get her death of cold  browne is out there aunt kate said mary jane
browne is everywhere said aunt kate lowering her voice
mary jane laughed at her tone
really she said archly he is very attentive  he has been laid on here like the gas said aunt kate in the same tone all during the christmas  she laughed herself this time goodhumouredly and then added quickly  but tell him to come in mary jane and close the door
i hope to goodness he didnt hear me  at that moment the halldoor was opened and mr browne came in from the doorstep laughing as if his heart would break
he was dressed in a long green overcoat with mock astrakhan cuffs and collar and wore on his head an oval fur cap
he pointed down the snowcovered quay from where the sound of shrill prolonged whistling was borne in
teddy will have all the cabs in dublin out he said
gabriel advanced from the little pantry behind the office struggling into his overcoat and looking round the hall said  gretta not down yet  shes getting on her things gabriel said aunt kate
whos playing up there asked gabriel
nobody
theyre all gone  o no aunt kate said mary jane
bartell darcy and miss ocallaghan arent gone yet  someone is fooling at the piano anyhow said gabriel
mary jane glanced at gabriel and mr browne and said with a shiver  it makes me feel cold to look at you two gentlemen muffled up like that
i wouldnt like to face your journey home at this hour  id like nothing better this minute said mr browne stoutly than a rattling fine walk in the country or a fast drive with a good spanking goer between the shafts  we used to have a very good horse and trap at home said aunt julia sadly
the nevertobeforgotten johnny said mary jane laughing
aunt kate and gabriel laughed too
why what was wonderful about johnny asked mr browne
the late lamented patrick morkan our grandfather that is explained gabriel commonly known in his later years as the old gentleman was a glueboiler  o now gabriel said aunt kate laughing he had a starch mill  well glue or starch said gabriel the old gentleman had a horse by the name of johnny
and johnny used to work in the old gentlemans mill walking round and round in order to drive the mill
that was all very well but now comes the tragic part about johnny
one fine day the old gentleman thought hed like to drive out with the quality to a military review in the park  the lord have mercy on his soul said aunt kate compassionately
amen said gabriel
so the old gentleman as i said harnessed johnny and put on his very best tall hat and his very best stock collar and drove out in grand style from his ancestral mansion somewhere near back lane i think  everyone laughed even mrs malins at gabriels manner and aunt kate said  o now gabriel he didnt live in back lane really
only the mill was there  out from the mansion of his forefathers continued gabriel he drove with johnny
and everything went on beautifully until johnny came in sight of king billys statue and whether he fell in love with the horse king billy sits on or whether he thought he was back again in the mill anyhow he began to walk round the statue  gabriel paced in a circle round the hall in his goloshes amid the laughter of the others
round and round he went said gabriel and the old gentleman who was a very pompous old gentleman was highly indignant
go on sir
what do you mean sir
johnny
johnny
most extraordinary conduct
cant understand the horse  the peal of laughter which followed gabriels imitation of the incident was interrupted by a resounding knock at the hall door
mary jane ran to open it and let in freddy malins
freddy malins with his hat well back on his head and his shoulders humped with cold was puffing and steaming after his exertions
i could only get one cab he said
o well find another along the quay said gabriel
yes said aunt kate
better not keep mrs malins standing in the draught  mrs malins was helped down the front steps by her son and mr browne and after many manuvres hoisted into the cab
freddy malins clambered in after her and spent a long time settling her on the seat mr browne helping him with advice
at last she was settled comfortably and freddy malins invited mr browne into the cab
there was a good deal of confused talk and then mr browne got into the cab
the cabman settled his rug over his knees and bent down for the address
the confusion grew greater and the cabman was directed differently by freddy malins and mr browne each of whom had his head out through a window of the cab
the difficulty was to know where to drop mr browne along the route and aunt kate aunt julia and mary jane helped the discussion from the doorstep with crossdirections and contradictions and abundance of laughter
as for freddy malins he was speechless with laughter
he popped his head in and out of the window every moment to the great danger of his hat and told his mother how the discussion was progressing till at last mr browne shouted to the bewildered cabman above the din of everybodys laughter  do you know trinity college  yes sir said the cabman
well drive bang up against trinity college gates said mr browne and then well tell you where to go
you understand now  yes sir said the cabman
make like a bird for trinity college  right sir said the cabman
the horse was whipped up and the cab rattled off along the quay amid a chorus of laughter and adieus
gabriel had not gone to the door with the others
he was in a dark part of the hall gazing up the staircase
a woman was standing near the top of the first flight in the shadow also
he could not see her face but he could see the terracotta and salmonpink panels of her skirt which the shadow made appear black and white
it was his wife
she was leaning on the banisters listening to something
gabriel was surprised at her stillness and strained his ear to listen also
but he could hear little save the noise of laughter and dispute on the front steps a few chords struck on the piano and a few notes of a mans voice singing
he stood still in the gloom of the hall trying to catch the air that the voice was singing and gazing up at his wife
there was grace and mystery in her attitude as if she were a symbol of something
he asked himself what is a woman standing on the stairs in the shadow listening to distant music a symbol of
if he were a painter he would paint her in that attitude
her blue felt hat would show off the bronze of her hair against the darkness and the dark panels of her skirt would show off the light ones
distant music he would call the picture if he were a painter
the halldoor was closed and aunt kate aunt julia and mary jane came down the hall still laughing
well isnt freddy terrible said mary jane
hes really terrible  gabriel said nothing but pointed up the stairs towards where his wife was standing
now that the halldoor was closed the voice and the piano could be heard more clearly
gabriel held up his hand for them to be silent
the song seemed to be in the old irish tonality and the singer seemed uncertain both of his words and of his voice
the voice made plaintive by distance and by the singers hoarseness faintly illuminated the cadence of the air with words expressing grief       o the rain falls on my heavy locks      and the dew wets my skin      my babe lies cold  o exclaimed mary jane
its bartell darcy singing and he wouldnt sing all the night
o ill get him to sing a song before he goes  o do mary jane said aunt kate
mary jane brushed past the others and ran to the staircase but before she reached it the singing stopped and the piano was closed abruptly
o what a pity she cried
is he coming down gretta  gabriel heard his wife answer yes and saw her come down towards them
a few steps behind her were mr bartell darcy and miss ocallaghan
o mr darcy cried mary jane its downright mean of you to break off like that when we were all in raptures listening to you  i have been at him all the evening said miss ocallaghan and mrs conroy too and he told us he had a dreadful cold and couldnt sing  o mr darcy said aunt kate now that was a great fib to tell  cant you see that im as hoarse as a crow said mr darcy roughly
he went into the pantry hastily and put on his overcoat
the others taken aback by his rude speech could find nothing to say
aunt kate wrinkled her brows and made signs to the others to drop the subject
mr darcy stood swathing his neck carefully and frowning
its the weather said aunt julia after a pause
yes everybody has colds said aunt kate readily everybody  they say said mary jane we havent had snow like it for thirty years and i read this morning in the newspapers that the snow is general all over ireland  i love the look of snow said aunt julia sadly
so do i said miss ocallaghan
i think christmas is never really christmas unless we have the snow on the ground  but poor mr darcy doesnt like the snow said aunt kate smiling
mr darcy came from the pantry fully swathed and buttoned and in a repentant tone told them the history of his cold
everyone gave him advice and said it was a great pity and urged him to be very careful of his throat in the night air
gabriel watched his wife who did not join in the conversation
she was standing right under the dusty fanlight and the flame of the gas lit up the rich bronze of her hair which he had seen her drying at the fire a few days before
she was in the same attitude and seemed unaware of the talk about her
at last she turned towards them and gabriel saw that there was colour on her cheeks and that her eyes were shining
a sudden tide of joy went leaping out of his heart
mr darcy she said what is the name of that song you were singing  its called the lass of aughrim said mr darcy but i couldnt remember it properly
why
do you know it  the lass of aughrim she repeated
i couldnt think of the name  its a very nice air said mary jane
im sorry you were not in voice tonight  now mary jane said aunt kate dont annoy mr darcy
i wont have him annoyed  seeing that all were ready to start she shepherded them to the door where goodnight was said  well goodnight aunt kate and thanks for the pleasant evening  goodnight gabriel
goodnight gretta  goodnight aunt kate and thanks ever so much
goodnight aunt julia  o goodnight gretta i didnt see you  goodnight mr darcy
goodnight miss ocallaghan  goodnight miss morkan  goodnight again  goodnight all
safe home  goodnight
goodnight  the morning was still dark
a dull yellow light brooded over the houses and the river and the sky seemed to be descending
it was slushy underfoot and only streaks and patches of snow lay on the roofs on the parapets of the quay and on the area railings
the lamps were still burning redly in the murky air and across the river the palace of the four courts stood out menacingly against the heavy sky
she was walking on before him with mr bartell darcy her shoes in a brown parcel tucked under one arm and her hands holding her skirt up from the slush
she had no longer any grace of attitude but gabriels eyes were still bright with happiness
the blood went bounding along his veins and the thoughts went rioting through his brain proud joyful tender valorous
she was walking on before him so lightly and so erect that he longed to run after her noiselessly catch her by the shoulders and say something foolish and affectionate into her ear
she seemed to him so frail that he longed to defend her against something and then to be alone with her
moments of their secret life together burst like stars upon his memory
a heliotrope envelope was lying beside his breakfastcup and he was caressing it with his hand
birds were twittering in the ivy and the sunny web of the curtain was shimmering along the floor he could not eat for happiness
they were standing on the crowded platform and he was placing a ticket inside the warm palm of her glove
he was standing with her in the cold looking in through a grated window at a man making bottles in a roaring furnace
it was very cold
her face fragrant in the cold air was quite close to his and suddenly he called out to the man at the furnace  is the fire hot sir  but the man could not hear with the noise of the furnace
it was just as well
he might have answered rudely
a wave of yet more tender joy escaped from his heart and went coursing in warm flood along his arteries
like the tender fire of stars moments of their life together that no one knew of or would ever know of broke upon and illumined his memory
he longed to recall to her those moments to make her forget the years of their dull existence together and remember only their moments of ecstasy
for the years he felt had not quenched his soul or hers
their children his writing her household cares had not quenched all their souls tender fire
in one letter that he had written to her then he had said why is it that words like these seem to me so dull and cold
is it because there is no word tender enough to be your name  like distant music these words that he had written years before were borne towards him from the past
he longed to be alone with her
when the others had gone away when he and she were in their room in the hotel then they would be alone together
he would call her softly  gretta  perhaps she would not hear at once she would be undressing
then something in his voice would strike her
she would turn and look at him  at the corner of winetavern street they met a cab
he was glad of its rattling noise as it saved him from conversation
she was looking out of the window and seemed tired
the others spoke only a few words pointing out some building or street
the horse galloped along wearily under the murky morning sky dragging his old rattling box after his heels and gabriel was again in a cab with her galloping to catch the boat galloping to their honeymoon
as the cab drove across oconnell bridge miss ocallaghan said  they say you never cross oconnell bridge without seeing a white horse  i see a white man this time said gabriel
where asked mr bartell darcy
gabriel pointed to the statue on which lay patches of snow
then he nodded familiarly to it and waved his hand
goodnight dan he said gaily
when the cab drew up before the hotel gabriel jumped out and in spite of mr bartell darcys protest paid the driver
he gave the man a shilling over his fare
the man saluted and said  a prosperous new year to you sir  the same to you said gabriel cordially
she leaned for a moment on his arm in getting out of the cab and while standing at the curbstone bidding the others goodnight
she leaned lightly on his arm as lightly as when she had danced with him a few hours before
he had felt proud and happy then happy that she was his proud of her grace and wifely carriage
but now after the kindling again of so many memories the first touch of her body musical and strange and perfumed sent through him a keen pang of lust
under cover of her silence he pressed her arm closely to his side and as they stood at the hotel door he felt that they had escaped from their lives and duties escaped from home and friends and run away together with wild and radiant hearts to a new adventure
an old man was dozing in a great hooded chair in the hall
he lit a candle in the office and went before them to the stairs
they followed him in silence their feet falling in soft thuds on the thickly carpeted stairs
she mounted the stairs behind the porter her head bowed in the ascent her frail shoulders curved as with a burden her skirt girt tightly about her
he could have flung his arms about her hips and held her still for his arms were trembling with desire to seize her and only the stress of his nails against the palms of his hands held the wild impulse of his body in check
the porter halted on the stairs to settle his guttering candle
they halted too on the steps below him
in the silence gabriel could hear the falling of the molten wax into the tray and the thumping of his own heart against his ribs
the porter led them along a corridor and opened a door
then he set his unstable candle down on a toilettable and asked at what hour they were to be called in the morning
eight said gabriel
the porter pointed to the tap of the electriclight and began a muttered apology but gabriel cut him short
we dont want any light
we have light enough from the street
and i say he added pointing to the candle you might remove that handsome article like a good man  the porter took up his candle again but slowly for he was surprised by such a novel idea
then he mumbled goodnight and went out
gabriel shot the lock to
a ghostly light from the street lamp lay in a long shaft from one window to the door
gabriel threw his overcoat and hat on a couch and crossed the room towards the window
he looked down into the street in order that his emotion might calm a little
then he turned and leaned against a chest of drawers with his back to the light
she had taken off her hat and cloak and was standing before a large swinging mirror unhooking her waist
gabriel paused for a few moments watching her and then said  gretta  she turned away from the mirror slowly and walked along the shaft of light towards him
her face looked so serious and weary that the words would not pass gabriels lips
no it was not the moment yet
you looked tired he said
i am a little she answered
you dont feel ill or weak  no tired thats all  she went on to the window and stood there looking out
gabriel waited again and then fearing that diffidence was about to conquer him he said abruptly  by the way gretta  what is it  you know that poor fellow malins he said quickly
yes
what about him  well poor fellow hes a decent sort of chap after all continued gabriel in a false voice
he gave me back that sovereign i lent him and i didnt expect it really
its a pity he wouldnt keep away from that browne because hes not a bad fellow really  he was trembling now with annoyance
why did she seem so abstracted
he did not know how he could begin
was she annoyed too about something
if she would only turn to him or come to him of her own accord
to take her as she was would be brutal
no he must see some ardour in her eyes first
he longed to be master of her strange mood
when did you lend him the pound she asked after a pause
gabriel strove to restrain himself from breaking out into brutal language about the sottish malins and his pound
he longed to cry to her from his soul to crush her body against his to overmaster her
but he said  o at christmas when he opened that little christmascard shop in henry street  he was in such a fever of rage and desire that he did not hear her come from the window
she stood before him for an instant looking at him strangely
then suddenly raising herself on tiptoe and resting her hands lightly on his shoulders she kissed him
you are a very generous person gabriel she said
gabriel trembling with delight at her sudden kiss and at the quaintness of her phrase put his hands on her hair and began smoothing it back scarcely touching it with his fingers
the washing had made it fine and brilliant
his heart was brimming over with happiness
just when he was wishing for it she had come to him of her own accord
perhaps her thoughts had been running with his
perhaps she had felt the impetuous desire that was in him and then the yielding mood had come upon her
now that she had fallen to him so easily he wondered why he had been so diffident
he stood holding her head between his hands
then slipping one arm swiftly about her body and drawing her towards him he said softly  gretta dear what are you thinking about  she did not answer nor yield wholly to his arm
he said again softly  tell me what it is gretta
i think i know what is the matter
do i know  she did not answer at once
then she said in an outburst of tears  o i am thinking about that song the lass of aughrim  she broke loose from him and ran to the bed and throwing her arms across the bedrail hid her face
gabriel stood stockstill for a moment in astonishment and then followed her
as he passed in the way of the chevalglass he caught sight of himself in full length his broad wellfilled shirtfront the face whose expression always puzzled him when he saw it in a mirror and his glimmering giltrimmed eyeglasses
he halted a few paces from her and said  what about the song
why does that make you cry  she raised her head from her arms and dried her eyes with the back of her hand like a child
a kinder note than he had intended went into his voice
why gretta he asked
i am thinking about a person long ago who used to sing that song  and who was the person long ago asked gabriel smiling
it was a person i used to know in galway when i was living with my grandmother she said
the smile passed away from gabriels face
a dull anger began to gather again at the back of his mind and the dull fires of his lust began to glow angrily in his veins
someone you were in love with he asked ironically
it was a young boy i used to know she answered named michael furey
he used to sing that song the lass of aughrim
he was very delicate  gabriel was silent
he did not wish her to think that he was interested in this delicate boy
i can see him so plainly she said after a moment
such eyes as he had big dark eyes
and such an expression in theman expression  o then you were in love with him said gabriel
i used to go out walking with him she said when i was in galway  a thought flew across gabriels mind
perhaps that was why you wanted to go to galway with that ivors girl he said coldly
she looked at him and asked in surprise  what for  her eyes made gabriel feel awkward
he shrugged his shoulders and said  how do i know
to see him perhaps  she looked away from him along the shaft of light towards the window in silence
he is dead she said at length
he died when he was only seventeen
isnt it a terrible thing to die so young as that  what was he asked gabriel still ironically
he was in the gasworks she said
gabriel felt humiliated by the failure of his irony and by the evocation of this figure from the dead a boy in the gasworks
while he had been full of memories of their secret life together full of tenderness and joy and desire she had been comparing him in her mind with another
a shameful consciousness of his own person assailed him
he saw himself as a ludicrous figure acting as a pennyboy for his aunts a nervous wellmeaning sentimentalist orating to vulgarians and idealising his own clownish lusts the pitiable fatuous fellow he had caught a glimpse of in the mirror
instinctively he turned his back more to the light lest she might see the shame that burned upon his forehead
he tried to keep up his tone of cold interrogation but his voice when he spoke was humble and indifferent
i suppose you were in love with this michael furey gretta he said
i was great with him at that time she said
her voice was veiled and sad
gabriel feeling now how vain it would be to try to lead her whither he had purposed caressed one of her hands and said also sadly  and what did he die of so young gretta
consumption was it  i think he died for me she answered
a vague terror seized gabriel at this answer as if at that hour when he had hoped to triumph some impalpable and vindictive being was coming against him gathering forces against him in its vague world
but he shook himself free of it with an effort of reason and continued to caress her hand
he did not question her again for he felt that she would tell him of herself
her hand was warm and moist it did not respond to his touch but he continued to caress it just as he had caressed her first letter to him that spring morning
it was in the winter she said about the beginning of the winter when i was going to leave my grandmothers and come up here to the convent
and he was ill at the time in his lodgings in galway and wouldnt be let out and his people in oughterard were written to
he was in decline they said or something like that
i never knew rightly  she paused for a moment and sighed
poor fellow she said
he was very fond of me and he was such a gentle boy
we used to go out together walking you know gabriel like the way they do in the country
he was going to study singing only for his health
he had a very good voice poor michael furey  well and then asked gabriel
and then when it came to the time for me to leave galway and come up to the convent he was much worse and i wouldnt be let see him so i wrote him a letter saying i was going up to dublin and would be back in the summer and hoping he would be better then  she paused for a moment to get her voice under control and then went on  then the night before i left i was in my grandmothers house in nuns island packing up and i heard gravel thrown up against the window
the window was so wet i couldnt see so i ran downstairs as i was and slipped out the back into the garden and there was the poor fellow at the end of the garden shivering  and did you not tell him to go back asked gabriel
i implored of him to go home at once and told him he would get his death in the rain
but he said he did not want to live
i can see his eyes as well as well
he was standing at the end of the wall where there was a tree  and did he go home asked gabriel
yes he went home
and when i was only a week in the convent he died and he was buried in oughterard where his people came from
o the day i heard that that he was dead  she stopped choking with sobs and overcome by emotion flung herself face downward on the bed sobbing in the quilt
gabriel held her hand for a moment longer irresolutely and then shy of intruding on her grief let it fall gently and walked quietly to the window
she was fast asleep
gabriel leaning on his elbow looked for a few moments unresentfully on her tangled hair and halfopen mouth listening to her deepdrawn breath
so she had had that romance in her life a man had died for her sake
it hardly pained him now to think how poor a part he her husband had played in her life
he watched her while she slept as though he and she had never lived together as man and wife
his curious eyes rested long upon her face and on her hair and as he thought of what she must have been then in that time of her first girlish beauty a strange friendly pity for her entered his soul
he did not like to say even to himself that her face was no longer beautiful but he knew that it was no longer the face for which michael furey had braved death
perhaps she had not told him all the story
his eyes moved to the chair over which she had thrown some of her clothes
a petticoat string dangled to the floor
one boot stood upright its limp upper fallen down the fellow of it lay upon its side
he wondered at his riot of emotions of an hour before
from what had it proceeded
from his aunts supper from his own foolish speech from the wine and dancing the merrymaking when saying goodnight in the hall the pleasure of the walk along the river in the snow
poor aunt julia
she too would soon be a shade with the shade of patrick morkan and his horse
he had caught that haggard look upon her face for a moment when she was singing arrayed for the bridal
soon perhaps he would be sitting in that same drawingroom dressed in black his silk hat on his knees
the blinds would be drawn down and aunt kate would be sitting beside him crying and blowing her nose and telling him how julia had died
he would cast about in his mind for some words that might console her and would find only lame and useless ones
yes yes that would happen very soon
the air of the room chilled his shoulders
he stretched himself cautiously along under the sheets and lay down beside his wife
one by one they were all becoming shades
better pass boldly into that other world in the full glory of some passion than fade and wither dismally with age
he thought of how she who lay beside him had locked in her heart for so many years that image of her lovers eyes when he had told her that he did not wish to live
generous tears filled gabriels eyes
he had never felt like that himself towards any woman but he knew that such a feeling must be love
the tears gathered more thickly in his eyes and in the partial darkness he imagined he saw the form of a young man standing under a dripping tree
other forms were near
his soul had approached that region where dwell the vast hosts of the dead
he was conscious of but could not apprehend their wayward and flickering existence
his own identity was fading out into a grey impalpable world the solid world itself which these dead had one time reared and lived in was dissolving and dwindling
a few light taps upon the pane made him turn to the window
it had begun to snow again
he watched sleepily the flakes silver and dark falling obliquely against the lamplight
the time had come for him to set out on his journey westward
yes the newspapers were right snow was general all over ireland
it was falling on every part of the dark central plain on the treeless hills falling softly upon the bog of allen and farther westward softly falling into the dark mutinous shannon waves
it was falling too upon every part of the lonely churchyard on the hill where michael furey lay buried
it lay thickly drifted on the crooked crosses and headstones on the spears of the little gate on the barren thorns
his soul swooned slowly as he heard the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling like the descent of their last end upon all the living and the dead
 illustration     ulysses   by james joyce   contents    i                  ii                                                      iii                    i        stately plump buck mulligan came from the stairhead bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed
a yellow dressinggown ungirdled was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air
he held the bowl aloft and intoned  introibo ad altare dei
halted he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely  come up kinch
come up you fearful jesuit
solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest
he faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower the surrounding land and the awaking mountains
then catching sight of stephen dedalus he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air gurgling in his throat and shaking his head
stephen dedalus displeased and sleepy leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him equine in its length and at the light untonsured hair grained and hued like pale oak
buck mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl smartly
back to barracks
he said sternly
he added in a preachers tone  for this o dearly beloved is the genuine christine body and soul and blood and ouns
slow music please
shut your eyes gents
one moment
a little trouble about those white corpuscles
silence all
he peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call then paused awhile in rapt attention his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points
chrysostomos
two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm
thanks old chap he cried briskly
that will do nicely
switch off the current will you
he skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown
the plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate patron of arts in the middle ages
a pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips
the mockery of it
he said gaily
your absurd name an ancient greek
he pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet laughing to himself
stephen dedalus stepped up followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck
buck mulligans gay voice went on
my name is absurd too malachi mulligan two dactyls
but it has a hellenic ring hasnt it
tripping and sunny like the buck himself
we must go to athens
will you come if i can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid
he laid the brush aside and laughing with delight cried  will he come
the jejune jesuit
ceasing he began to shave with care
tell me mulligan stephen said quietly
yes my love
how long is haines going to stay in this tower
buck mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder
god isnt he dreadful
he said frankly
a ponderous saxon
he thinks youre not a gentleman
god these bloody english
bursting with money and indigestion
because he comes from oxford
you know dedalus you have the real oxford manner
he cant make you out
o my name for you is the best kinch the knifeblade
he shaved warily over his chin
he was raving all night about a black panther stephen said
where is his guncase
a woful lunatic
mulligan said
were you in a funk
i was stephen said with energy and growing fear
out here in the dark with a man i dont know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a black panther
you saved men from drowning
im not a hero however
if he stays on here i am off
buck mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade
he hopped down from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily
scutter
he cried thickly
he came over to the gunrest and thrusting a hand into stephens upper pocket said  lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor
stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a dirty crumpled handkerchief
buck mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly
then gazing over the handkerchief he said  the bards noserag
a new art colour for our irish poets snotgreen
you can almost taste it cant you
he mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over dublin bay his fair oakpale hair stirring slightly
god
he said quietly
isnt the sea what algy calls it a great sweet mother
the snotgreen sea
the scrotumtightening sea
epi oinopa ponton
ah dedalus the greeks
i must teach you
you must read them in the original
thalatta
thalatta she is our great sweet mother
come and look
stephen stood up and went over to the parapet
leaning on it he looked down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of kingstown
our mighty mother
buck mulligan said
he turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to stephens face
the aunt thinks you killed your mother he said
thats why she wont let me have anything to do with you
someone killed her stephen said gloomily
you could have knelt down damn it kinch when your dying mother asked you buck mulligan said
im hyperborean as much as you
but to think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for her
and you refused
there is something sinister in you
he broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek
a tolerant smile curled his lips
but a lovely mummer
he murmured to himself
kinch the loveliest mummer of them all
he shaved evenly and with care in silence seriously
stephen an elbow rested on the jagged granite leaned his palm against his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coatsleeve
pain that was not yet the pain of love fretted his heart
silently in a dream she had come to him after her death her wasted body within its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood her breath that had bent upon him mute reproachful a faint odour of wetted ashes
across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him
the ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid
a bowl of white china had stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting
buck mulligan wiped again his razorblade
ah poor dogsbody
he said in a kind voice
i must give you a shirt and a few noserags
how are the secondhand breeks
they fit well enough stephen answered
buck mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip
the mockery of it he said contentedly
secondleg they should be
god knows what poxy bowsy left them off
i have a lovely pair with a hair stripe grey
youll look spiffing in them
im not joking kinch
you look damn well when youre dressed
thanks stephen said
i cant wear them if they are grey
he cant wear them buck mulligan told his face in the mirror
etiquette is etiquette
he kills his mother but he cant wear grey trousers
he folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the smooth skin
stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its smokeblue mobile eyes
that fellow i was with in the ship last night said buck mulligan says you have g p i hes up in dottyville with connolly norman
general paralysis of the insane
he swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea
his curling shaven lips laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth
laughter seized all his strong wellknit trunk
look at yourself he said you dreadful bard
stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him cleft by a crooked crack
hair on end
as he and others see me
who chose this face for me
this dogsbody to rid of vermin
it asks me too
i pinched it out of the skivvys room buck mulligan said
it does her all right
the aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for malachi
lead him not into temptation
and her name is ursula
laughing again he brought the mirror away from stephens peering eyes
the rage of caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror he said
if wilde were only alive to see you
drawing back and pointing stephen said with bitterness  it is a symbol of irish art
the cracked lookingglass of a servant
buck mulligan suddenly linked his arm in stephens and walked with him round the tower his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he had thrust them
its not fair to tease you like that kinch is it
he said kindly
god knows you have more spirit than any of them
parried again
he fears the lancet of my art as i fear that of his
the cold steel pen
cracked lookingglass of a servant
tell that to the oxy chap downstairs and touch him for a guinea
hes stinking with money and thinks youre not a gentleman
his old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to zulus or some bloody swindle or other
god kinch if you and i could only work together we might do something for the island
hellenise it
cranlys arm
his arm
and to think of your having to beg from these swine
im the only one that knows what you are
why dont you trust me more
what have you up your nose against me
is it haines
if he makes any noise here ill bring down seymour and well give him a ragging worse than they gave clive kempthorpe
young shouts of moneyed voices in clive kempthorpes rooms
palefaces they hold their ribs with laughter one clasping another
o i shall expire
break the news to her gently aubrey
i shall die
with slit ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the table with trousers down at heels chased by ades of magdalen with the tailors shears
a scared calfs face gilded with marmalade
i dont want to be debagged
dont you play the giddy ox with me
shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle
a deaf gardener aproned masked with matthew arnolds face pushes his mower on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms
to ourselves new paganism omphalos
let him stay stephen said
theres nothing wrong with him except at night
then what is it
buck mulligan asked impatiently
cough it up
im quite frank with you
what have you against me now
they halted looking towards the blunt cape of bray head that lay on the water like the snout of a sleeping whale
stephen freed his arm quietly
do you wish me to tell you
he asked
yes what is it
buck mulligan answered
i dont remember anything
he looked in stephens face as he spoke
a light wind passed his brow fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of anxiety in his eyes
stephen depressed by his own voice said  do you remember the first day i went to your house after my mothers death
buck mulligan frowned quickly and said  what
where
i cant remember anything
i remember only ideas and sensations
why
what happened in the name of god
you were making tea stephen said and went across the landing to get more hot water
your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom
she asked you who was in your room
yes
buck mulligan said
what did i say
i forget
you said stephen answered o its only dedalus whose mother is beastly dead  a flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to buck mulligans cheek
did i say that
he asked
well
what harm is that
he shook his constraint from him nervously
and what is death he asked your mothers or yours or my own
you saw only your mother die
i see them pop off every day in the mater and richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom
its a beastly thing and nothing else
it simply doesnt matter
you wouldnt kneel down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you
why
because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you only its injected the wrong way
to me its all a mockery and beastly
her cerebral lobes are not functioning
she calls the doctor sir peter teazle and picks buttercups off the quilt
humour her till its over
you crossed her last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because i dont whinge like some hired mute from lalouettes
absurd
i suppose i did say it
i didnt mean to offend the memory of your mother
he had spoken himself into boldness
stephen shielding the gaping wounds which the words had left in his heart said very coldly  i am not thinking of the offence to my mother
of what then
buck mulligan asked
of the offence to me stephen answered
buck mulligan swung round on his heel
o an impossible person
he exclaimed
he walked off quickly round the parapet
stephen stood at his post gazing over the calm sea towards the headland
sea and headland now grew dim
pulses were beating in his eyes veiling their sight and he felt the fever of his cheeks
a voice within the tower called loudly  are you up there mulligan
im coming buck mulligan answered
he turned towards stephen and said  look at the sea
what does it care about offences
chuck loyola kinch and come on down
the sassenach wants his morning rashers
his head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase level with the roof  dont mope over it all day he said
im inconsequent
give up the moody brooding
his head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of the stairhead       and no more turn aside and brood      upon loves bitter mystery      for fergus rules the brazen cars
woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the stairhead seaward where he gazed
inshore and farther out the mirror of water whitened spurned by lightshod hurrying feet
white breast of the dim sea
the twining stresses two by two
a hand plucking the harpstrings merging their twining chords
wavewhite wedded words shimmering on the dim tide
a cloud began to cover the sun slowly wholly shadowing the bay in deeper green
it lay beneath him a bowl of bitter waters
fergus song i sang it alone in the house holding down the long dark chords
her door was open she wanted to hear my music
silent with awe and pity i went to her bedside
she was crying in her wretched bed
for those words stephen loves bitter mystery
where now
her secrets old featherfans tasselled dancecards powdered with musk a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer
a birdcage hung in the sunny window of her house when she was a girl
she heard old royce sing in the pantomime of turko the terrible and laughed with others when he sang       i am the boy      that can enjoy      invisibility
phantasmal mirth folded away muskperfumed
and no more turn aside and brood
folded away in the memory of nature with her toys
memories beset his brooding brain
her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had approached the sacrament
a cored apple filled with brown sugar roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening
her shapely fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the childrens shirts
in a dream silently she had come to him her wasted body within its loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood her breath bent over him with mute secret words a faint odour of wetted ashes
her glazing eyes staring out of death to shake and bend my soul
on me alone
the ghostcandle to light her agony
ghostly light on the tortured face
her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror while all prayed on their knees
her eyes on me to strike me down
liliata rutilantium te confessorum turma circumdet iubilantium te virginum chorus excipiat  ghoul
chewer of corpses
no mother
let me be and let me live
kinch ahoy
buck mulligans voice sang from within the tower
it came nearer up the staircase calling again
stephen still trembling at his souls cry heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words
dedalus come down like a good mosey
breakfast is ready
haines is apologising for waking us last night
its all right
im coming stephen said turning
do for jesus sake buck mulligan said
for my sake and for all our sakes
his head disappeared and reappeared
i told him your symbol of irish art
he says its very clever
touch him for a quid will you
a guinea i mean
i get paid this morning stephen said
the school kip
buck mulligan said
how much
four quid
lend us one
if you want it stephen said
four shining sovereigns buck mulligan cried with delight
well have a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids
four omnipotent sovereigns
he flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs singing out of tune with a cockney accent       o wont we have a merry time      drinking whisky beer and wine
on coronation      coronation day
o wont we have a merry time      on coronation day
warm sunshine merrying over the sea
the nickel shavingbowl shone forgotten on the parapet
why should i bring it down
or leave it there all day forgotten friendship
he went over to it held it in his hands awhile feeling its coolness smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck
so i carried the boat of incense then at clongowes
i am another now and yet the same
a servant too
a server of a servant
in the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower buck mulligans gowned form moved briskly to and fro about the hearth hiding and revealing its yellow glow
two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor from the high barbacans and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated turning
well be choked buck mulligan said
haines open that door will you
stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker
a tall figure rose from the hammock where it had been sitting went to the doorway and pulled open the inner doors
have you the key
a voice asked
dedalus has it buck mulligan said
janey mack im choked
he howled without looking up from the fire  kinch
its in the lock stephen said coming forward
the key scraped round harshly twice and when the heavy door had been set ajar welcome light and bright air entered
haines stood at the doorway looking out
stephen haled his upended valise to the table and sat down to wait
buck mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him
then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table set them down heavily and sighed with relief
im melting he said as the candle remarked when
but hush
not a word more on that subject
kinch wake up
bread butter honey
haines come in
the grub is ready
bless us o lord and these thy gifts
wheres the sugar
o jay theres no milk
stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from the locker
buck mulligan sat down in a sudden pet
what sort of a kip is this
he said
i told her to come after eight
we can drink it black stephen said thirstily
theres a lemon in the locker
o damn you and your paris fads
buck mulligan said
i want sandycove milk
haines came in from the doorway and said quietly  that woman is coming up with the milk
the blessings of god on you
buck mulligan cried jumping up from his chair
sit down
pour out the tea there
the sugar is in the bag
here i cant go fumbling at the damned eggs
he hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three plates saying  in nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti  haines sat down to pour out the tea
im giving you two lumps each he said
but i say mulligan you do make strong tea dont you
buck mulligan hewing thick slices from the loaf said in an old womans wheedling voice  when i makes tea i makes tea as old mother grogan said
and when i makes water i makes water
by jove it is tea haines said
buck mulligan went on hewing and wheedling  so i do mrs cahill says she
begob maam says mrs cahill god send you dont make them in the one pot  he lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread impaled on his knife
thats folk he said very earnestly for your book haines
five lines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of dundrum
printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind
he turned to stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice lifting his brows  can you recall brother is mother grogans tea and water pot spoken of in the mabinogion or is it in the upanishads
i doubt it said stephen gravely
do you now
buck mulligan said in the same tone
your reasons pray
i fancy stephen said as he ate it did not exist in or out of the mabinogion
mother grogan was one imagines a kinswoman of mary ann
buck mulligans face smiled with delight
charming
he said in a finical sweet voice showing his white teeth and blinking his eyes pleasantly
do you think she was
quite charming
then suddenly overclouding all his features he growled in a hoarsened rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf  for old mary ann  she doesnt care a damn
but hising up her petticoats  he crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned
the doorway was darkened by an entering form
the milk sir
come in maam mulligan said
kinch get the jug
an old woman came forward and stood by stephens elbow
thats a lovely morning sir she said
glory be to god
to whom
mulligan said glancing at her
ah to be sure
stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker
the islanders mulligan said to haines casually speak frequently of the collector of prepuces
how much sir
asked the old woman
a quart stephen said
he watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white milk not hers
old shrunken paps
she poured again a measureful and a tilly
old and secret she had entered from a morning world maybe a messenger
she praised the goodness of the milk pouring it out
crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field a witch on her toadstool her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs
they lowed about her whom they knew dewsilky cattle
silk of the kine and poor old woman names given her in old times
a wandering crone lowly form of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer their common cuckquean a messenger from the secret morning
to serve or to upbraid whether he could not tell but scorned to beg her favour
it is indeed maam buck mulligan said pouring milk into their cups
taste it sir she said
he drank at her bidding
if we could live on good food like that he said to her somewhat loudly we wouldnt have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten guts
living in a bogswamp eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust horsedung and consumptives spits
are you a medical student sir
the old woman asked
i am maam buck mulligan answered
look at that now she said
stephen listened in scornful silence
she bows her old head to a voice that speaks to her loudly her bonesetter her medicineman me she slights
to the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there is of her but her womans unclean loins of mans flesh made not in gods likeness the serpents prey
and to the loud voice that now bids her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes
do you understand what he says
stephen asked her
is it french you are talking sir
the old woman said to haines
haines spoke to her again a longer speech confidently
irish buck mulligan said
is there gaelic on you
i thought it was irish she said by the sound of it
are you from the west sir
i am an englishman haines answered
hes english buck mulligan said and he thinks we ought to speak irish in ireland
sure we ought to the old woman said and im ashamed i dont speak the language myself
im told its a grand language by them that knows
grand is no name for it said buck mulligan
wonderful entirely
fill us out some more tea kinch
would you like a cup maam
no thank you sir the old woman said slipping the ring of the milkcan on her forearm and about to go
haines said to her  have you your bill
we had better pay her mulligan hadnt we
stephen filled again the three cups
bill sir
she said halting
well its seven mornings a pint at twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling
thats a shilling and one and two is two and two sir
buck mulligan sighed and having filled his mouth with a crust thickly buttered on both sides stretched forth his legs and began to search his trouser pockets
pay up and look pleasant haines said to him smiling
stephen filled a third cup a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thick rich milk
buck mulligan brought up a florin twisted it round in his fingers and cried  a miracle
he passed it along the table towards the old woman saying  ask nothing more of me sweet
all i can give you i give
stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand
well owe twopence he said
time enough sir she said taking the coin
time enough
good morning sir
she curtseyed and went out followed by buck mulligans tender chant  heart of my heart were it more  more would be laid at your feet  he turned to stephen and said  seriously dedalus
im stony
hurry out to your school kip and bring us back some money
today the bards must drink and junket
ireland expects that every man this day will do his duty
that reminds me haines said rising that i have to visit your national library today
our swim first buck mulligan said
he turned to stephen and asked blandly  is this the day for your monthly wash kinch
then he said to haines  the unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month
all ireland is washed by the gulfstream stephen said as he let honey trickle over a slice of the loaf
haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke  i intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me
speaking to me
they wash and tub and scrub
agenbite of inwit
conscience
yet heres a spot
that one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol of irish art is deuced good
buck mulligan kicked stephens foot under the table and said with warmth of tone  wait till you hear him on hamlet haines
well i mean it haines said still speaking to stephen
i was just thinking of it when that poor old creature came in
would i make any money by it
stephen asked
haines laughed and as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of the hammock said  i dont know im sure
he strolled out to the doorway
buck mulligan bent across to stephen and said with coarse vigour  you put your hoof in it now
what did you say that for
well
stephen said
the problem is to get money
from whom
from the milkwoman or from him
its a toss up i think
i blow him out about you buck mulligan said and then you come along with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes
i see little hope stephen said from her or from him
buck mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on stephens arm
from me kinch he said
in a suddenly changed tone he added  to tell you the gods truth i think youre right
damn all else they are good for
why dont you play them as i do
to hell with them all
let us get out of the kip
he stood up gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown saying resignedly  mulligan is stripped of his garments
he emptied his pockets on to the table
theres your snotrag he said
and putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them chiding them and to his dangling watchchain
his hands plunged and rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief
god well simply have to dress the character
i want puce gloves and green boots
contradiction
do i contradict myself
very well then i contradict myself
mercurial malachi
a limp black missile flew out of his talking hands
and theres your latin quarter hat he said
stephen picked it up and put it on
haines called to them from the doorway  are you coming you fellows
im ready buck mulligan answered going towards the door
come out kinch
you have eaten all we left i suppose
resigned he passed out with grave words and gait saying wellnigh with sorrow  and going forth he met butterly
stephen taking his ashplant from its leaningplace followed them out and as they went down the ladder pulled to the slow iron door and locked it
he put the huge key in his inner pocket
at the foot of the ladder buck mulligan asked  did you bring the key
i have it stephen said preceding them
he walked on
behind him he heard buck mulligan club with his heavy bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses
down sir
how dare you sir
haines asked  do you pay rent for this tower
twelve quid buck mulligan said
to the secretary of state for war stephen added over his shoulder
they halted while haines surveyed the tower and said at last  rather bleak in wintertime i should say
martello you call it
billy pitt had them built buck mulligan said when the french were on the sea
but ours is the omphalos
what is your idea of hamlet
haines asked stephen
no no buck mulligan shouted in pain
im not equal to thomas aquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up
wait till i have a few pints in me first
he turned to stephen saying as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his primrose waistcoat  you couldnt manage it under three pints kinch could you
it has waited so long stephen said listlessly it can wait longer
you pique my curiosity haines said amiably
is it some paradox
pooh
buck mulligan said
we have grown out of wilde and paradoxes
its quite simple
he proves by algebra that hamlets grandson is shakespeares grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father
what
haines said beginning to point at stephen
he himself
buck mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and bending in loose laughter said to stephens ear  o shade of kinch the elder
japhet in search of a father
were always tired in the morning stephen said to haines
and it is rather long to tell
buck mulligan walking forward again raised his hands
the sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of dedalus he said
i mean to say haines explained to stephen as they followed this tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of elsinore
that beetles oer his base into the sea isnt it
buck mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards stephen but did not speak
in the bright silent instant stephen saw his own image in cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires
its a wonderful tale haines said bringing them to halt again
eyes pale as the sea the wind had freshened paler firm and prudent
the seas ruler he gazed southward over the bay empty save for the smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tacking by the muglins
i read a theological interpretation of it somewhere he said bemused
the father and the son idea
the son striving to be atoned with the father
buck mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face
he looked at them his wellshaped mouth open happily his eyes from which he had suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense blinking with mad gaiety
he moved a dolls head to and fro the brims of his panama hat quivering and began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice  im the queerest young fellow that ever you heard
my mothers a jew my fathers a bird
with joseph the joiner i cannot agree
so heres to disciples and calvary  he held up a forefinger of warning
if anyone thinks that i amnt divine hell get no free drinks when im making the wine but have to drink water and wish it were plain that i make when the wine becomes water again  he tugged swiftly at stephens ashplant in farewell and running forward to a brow of the cliff fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or wings of one about to rise in the air and chanted  goodbye now goodbye
write down all i said and tell tom dick and harry i rose from the dead
whats bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly and olivets breezy goodbye now goodbye  he capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole fluttering his winglike hands leaping nimbly mercurys hat quivering in the fresh wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries
haines who had been laughing guardedly walked on beside stephen and said  we oughtnt to laugh i suppose
hes rather blasphemous
im not a believer myself that is to say
still his gaiety takes the harm out of it somehow doesnt it
what did he call it
joseph the joiner
the ballad of joking jesus stephen answered
o haines said you have heard it before
three times a day after meals stephen said drily
youre not a believer are you
haines asked
i mean a believer in the narrow sense of the word
creation from nothing and miracles and a personal god
theres only one sense of the word it seems to me stephen said
haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a green stone
he sprang it open with his thumb and offered it
thank you stephen said taking a cigarette
haines helped himself and snapped the case to
he put it back in his sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox sprang it open too and having lit his cigarette held the flaming spunk towards stephen in the shell of his hands
yes of course he said as they went on again
either you believe or you dont isnt it
personally i couldnt stomach that idea of a personal god
you dont stand for that i suppose
you behold in me stephen said with grim displeasure a horrible example of free thought
he walked on waiting to be spoken to trailing his ashplant by his side
its ferrule followed lightly on the path squealing at his heels
my familiar after me calling steeeeeeeeeeeephen
a wavering line along the path
they will walk on it tonight coming here in the dark
he wants that key
it is mine
i paid the rent
now i eat his salt bread
give him the key too
all
he will ask for it
that was in his eyes
after all haines began  stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not all unkind
after all i should think you are able to free yourself
you are your own master it seems to me
i am a servant of two masters stephen said an english and an italian
italian
haines said
a crazy queen old and jealous
kneel down before me
and a third stephen said there is who wants me for odd jobs
italian
haines said again
what do you mean
the imperial british state stephen answered his colour rising and the holy roman catholic and apostolic church
haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he spoke
i can quite understand that he said calmly
an irishman must think like that i daresay
we feel in england that we have treated you rather unfairly
it seems history is to blame
the proud potent titles clanged over stephens memory the triumph of their brazen bells et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts a chemistry of stars
symbol of the apostles in the mass for pope marcellus the voices blended singing alone loud in affirmation and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs
a horde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry photius and the brood of mockers of whom mulligan was one and arius warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the son with the father and valentine spurning christs terrene body and the subtle african heresiarch sabellius who held that the father was himself his own son
words mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the stranger
idle mockery
the void awaits surely all them that weave the wind a menace a disarming and a worsting from those embattled angels of the church michaels host who defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their shields
hear hear
prolonged applause
zut
nom de dieu  of course im a britisher hainess voice said and i feel as one
i dont want to see my country fall into the hands of german jews either
thats our national problem im afraid just now
two men stood at the verge of the cliff watching businessman boatman
shes making for bullock harbour
the boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain
theres five fathoms out there he said
itll be swept up that way when the tide comes in about one
its nine days today
the man that was drowned
a sail veering about the blank bay waiting for a swollen bundle to bob up roll over to the sun a puffy face saltwhite
here i am
they followed the winding path down to the creek
buck mulligan stood on a stone in shirtsleeves his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder
a young man clinging to a spur of rock near him moved slowly frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water
is the brother with you malachi
down in westmeath
with the bannons
still there
i got a card from bannon
says he found a sweet young thing down there
photo girl he calls her
snapshot eh
brief exposure
buck mulligan sat down to unlace his boots
an elderly man shot up near the spur of rock a blowing red face
he scrambled up by the stones water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair water rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black sagging loincloth
buck mulligan made way for him to scramble past and glancing at haines and stephen crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips and breastbone
seymours back in town the young man said grasping again his spur of rock
chucked medicine and going in for the army
ah go to god
buck mulligan said
going over next week to stew
you know that red carlisle girl lily
yes
spooning with him last night on the pier
the father is rotto with money
is she up the pole
better ask seymour that
seymour a bleeding officer
buck mulligan said
he nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up saying tritely  redheaded women buck like goats
he broke off in alarm feeling his side under his flapping shirt
my twelfth rib is gone he cried
im the bermensch toothless kinch and i the supermen
he struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his clothes lay
are you going in here malachi
yes
make room in the bed
the young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the middle of the creek in two long clean strokes
haines sat down on a stone smoking
are you not coming in
buck mulligan asked
later on haines said
not on my breakfast
stephen turned away
im going mulligan he said
give us that key kinch buck mulligan said to keep my chemise flat
stephen handed him the key
buck mulligan laid it across his heaped clothes
and twopence he said for a pint
throw it there
stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap
dressing undressing
buck mulligan erect with joined hands before him said solemnly  he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the lord
thus spake zarathustra
his plump body plunged
well see you again haines said turning as stephen walked up the path and smiling at wild irish
horn of a bull hoof of a horse smile of a saxon
the ship buck mulligan cried
half twelve
good stephen said
he walked along the upwardcurving path
liliata rutilantium
turma circumdet
iubilantium te virginum
the priests grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly
i will not sleep here tonight
home also i cannot go
a voice sweettoned and sustained called to him from the sea
turning the curve he waved his hand
it called again
a sleek brown head a seals far out on the water round
usurper
     you cochrane what city sent for him
tarentum sir
very good
well
there was a battle sir
very good
where
the boys blank face asked the blank window
fabled by the daughters of memory
and yet it was in some way if not as memory fabled it
a phrase then of impatience thud of blakes wings of excess
i hear the ruin of all space shattered glass and toppling masonry and time one livid final flame
whats left us then
i forget the place sir
 b c  asculum stephen said glancing at the name and date in the gorescarred book
yes sir
and he said another victory like that and we are done for  that phrase the world had remembered
a dull ease of the mind
from a hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers leaned upon his spear
any general to any officers
they lend ear
you armstrong stephen said
what was the end of pyrrhus
end of pyrrhus sir
i know sir
ask me sir comyn said
wait
you armstrong
do you know anything about pyrrhus
a bag of figrolls lay snugly in armstrongs satchel
he curled them between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly
crumbs adhered to the tissue of his lips
a sweetened boys breath
welloff people proud that their eldest son was in the navy
vico road dalkey
pyrrhus sir
pyrrhus a pier
all laughed
mirthless high malicious laughter
armstrong looked round at his classmates silly glee in profile
in a moment they will laugh more loudly aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay
tell me now stephen said poking the boys shoulder with the book what is a pier
a pier sir armstrong said
a thing out in the water
a kind of a bridge
kingstown pier sir
some laughed again mirthless but with meaning
two in the back bench whispered
yes
they knew had never learned nor ever been innocent
all
with envy he watched their faces edith ethel gerty lily
their likes their breaths too sweetened with tea and jam their bracelets tittering in the struggle
kingstown pier stephen said
yes a disappointed bridge
the words troubled their gaze
how sir
comyn asked
a bridge is across a river
for hainess chapbook
noone here to hear
tonight deftly amid wild drink and talk to pierce the polished mail of his mind
what then
a jester at the court of his master indulged and disesteemed winning a clement masters praise
why had they chosen all that part
not wholly for the smooth caress
for them too history was a tale like any other too often heard their land a pawnshop
had pyrrhus not fallen by a beldams hand in argos or julius caesar not been knifed to death
they are not to be thought away
time has branded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite possibilities they have ousted
but can those have been possible seeing that they never were
or was that only possible which came to pass
weave weaver of the wind
tell us a story sir
o do sir
a ghoststory
where do you begin in this
stephen asked opening another book
weep no more comyn said
go on then talbot
and the story sir
after stephen said
go on talbot
a swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork of his satchel
he recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text  weep no more woful shepherds weep no more for lycidas your sorrow is not dead sunk though he be beneath the watery floor  it must be a movement then an actuality of the possible as possible
aristotles phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated out into the studious silence of the library of saint genevieve where he had read sheltered from the sin of paris night by night
by his elbow a delicate siamese conned a handbook of strategy
fed and feeding brains about me under glowlamps impaled with faintly beating feelers and in my minds darkness a sloth of the underworld reluctant shy of brightness shifting her dragon scaly folds
thought is the thought of thought
tranquil brightness
the soul is in a manner all that is the soul is the form of forms
tranquility sudden vast candescent form of forms
talbot repeated  through the dear might of him that walked the waves  through the dear might  turn over stephen said quietly
i dont see anything
what sir
talbot asked simply bending forward
his hand turned the page over
he leaned back and went on again having just remembered
of him that walked the waves
here also over these craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffers heart and lips and on mine
it lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the tribute
to caesar what is caesars to god what is gods
a long look from dark eyes a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the churchs looms
ay
riddle me riddle me randy ro
my father gave me seeds to sow
talbot slid his closed book into his satchel
have i heard all
stephen asked
yes sir
hockey at ten sir
half day sir
thursday
who can answer a riddle
stephen asked
they bundled their books away pencils clacking pages rustling
crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels all gabbling gaily  a riddle sir
ask me sir
o ask me sir
a hard one sir
this is the riddle stephen said       the cock crew      the sky was blue      the bells in heaven      were striking eleven
tis time for this poor soul      to go to heaven
what is that
what sir
again sir
we didnt hear
their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated
after a silence cochrane said  what is it sir
we give it up
stephen his throat itching answered  the fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush
he stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries echoed dismay
a stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called  hockey
they broke asunder sidling out of their benches leaping them
quickly they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and clamour of their boots and tongues
sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly showing an open copybook
his tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading
on his cheek dull and bloodless a soft stain of ink lay dateshaped recent and damp as a snails bed
he held out his copybook
the word sums was written on the headline
beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with blind loops and a blot
cyril sargent his name and seal
mr deasy told me to write them out all again he said and show them to you sir
stephen touched the edges of the book
futility
do you understand how to do them now
he asked
numbers eleven to fifteen sargent answered
mr deasy said i was to copy them off the board sir
can you do them yourself
stephen asked
no sir
ugly and futile lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink a snails bed
yet someone had loved him borne him in her arms and in her heart
but for her the race of the world would have trampled him underfoot a squashed boneless snail
she had loved his weak watery blood drained from her own
was that then real
the only true thing in life
his mothers prostrate body the fiery columbanus in holy zeal bestrode
she was no more the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the fire an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes
she had saved him from being trampled underfoot and had gone scarcely having been
a poor soul gone to heaven and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox red reek of rapine in his fur with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth listened scraped up the earth listened scraped and scraped
sitting at his side stephen solved out the problem
he proves by algebra that shakespeares ghost is hamlets grandfather
sargent peered askance through his slanted glasses
hockeysticks rattled in the lumberroom the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field
across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice in the mummery of their letters wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes
give hands traverse bow to partner so imps of fancy of the moors
gone too from the world averroes and moses maimonides dark men in mien and movement flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the world a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not comprehend
do you understand now
can you work the second for yourself
yes sir
in long shaky strokes sargent copied the data
waiting always for a word of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols a faint hue of shame flickering behind his dull skin
amor matris subjective and objective genitive
with her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands
like him was i these sloping shoulders this gracelessness
my childhood bends beside me
too far for me to lay a hand there once or lightly
mine is far and his secret as our eyes
secrets silent stony sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts secrets weary of their tyranny tyrants willing to be dethroned
the sum was done
it is very simple stephen said as he stood up
yes sir
thanks sargent answered
he dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his copybook back to his bench
you had better get your stick and go out to the others stephen said as he followed towards the door the boys graceless form
yes sir
in the corridor his name was heard called from the playfield
sargent
run on stephen said
mr deasy is calling you
he stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy field where sharp voices were in strife
they were sorted in teams and mr deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet
when he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to him
he turned his angry white moustache
what is it now
he cried continually without listening
cochrane and halliday are on the same side sir stephen said
will you wait in my study for a moment mr deasy said till i restore order here
and as he stepped fussily back across the field his old mans voice cried sternly  what is the matter
what is it now
their sharp voices cried about him on all sides their many forms closed round him the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed head
stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded leather of its chairs
as on the first day he bargained with me here
as it was in the beginning is now
on the sideboard the tray of stuart coins base treasure of a bog and ever shall be
and snug in their spooncase of purple plush faded the twelve apostles having preached to all the gentiles world without end
a hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor
blowing out his rare moustache mr deasy halted at the table
first our little financial settlement he said
he brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong
it slapped open and he took from it two notes one of joined halves and laid them carefully on the table
two he said strapping and stowing his pocketbook away
and now his strongroom for the gold
stephens embarrassed hand moved over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar whelks and money cowries and leopard shells and this whorled as an emirs turban and this the scallop of saint james
an old pilgrims hoard dead treasure hollow shells
a sovereign fell bright and new on the soft pile of the tablecloth
three mr deasy said turning his little savingsbox about in his hand
these are handy things to have
see
this is for sovereigns
this is for shillings
sixpences halfcrowns
and here crowns
see
he shot from it two crowns and two shillings
three twelve he said
i think youll find thats right
thank you sir stephen said gathering the money together with shy haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers
no thanks at all mr deasy said
you have earned it
stephens hand free again went back to the hollow shells
symbols too of beauty and of power
a lump in my pocket symbols soiled by greed and misery
dont carry it like that mr deasy said
youll pull it out somewhere and lose it
you just buy one of these machines
youll find them very handy
answer something
mine would be often empty stephen said
the same room and hour the same wisdom and i the same
three times now
three nooses round me here
well
i can break them in this instant if i will
because you dont save mr deasy said pointing his finger
you dont know yet what money is
money is power
when you have lived as long as i have
i know i know
if youth but knew
but what does shakespeare say
put but money in thy purse  iago stephen murmured
he lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old mans stare
he knew what money was mr deasy said
he made money
a poet yes but an englishman too
do you know what is the pride of the english
do you know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an englishmans mouth
the seas ruler
his seacold eyes looked on the empty bay it seems history is to blame on me and on my words unhating
that on his empire stephen said the sun never sets
ba
mr deasy cried
thats not english
a french celt said that
he tapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail
i will tell you he said solemnly what is his proudest boast
i paid my way  good man good man
i paid my way
i never borrowed a shilling in my life can you feel that
i owe nothing can you
mulligan nine pounds three pairs of socks one pair brogues ties
curran ten guineas
mccann one guinea
fred ryan two shillings
temple two lunches
russell one guinea cousins ten shillings bob reynolds half a guinea koehler three guineas mrs mackernan five weeks board
the lump i have is useless
for the moment no stephen answered
mr deasy laughed with rich delight putting back his savingsbox
i knew you couldnt he said joyously
but one day you must feel it
we are a generous people but we must also be just
i fear those big words stephen said which make us so unhappy
mr deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the shapely bulk of a man in tartan fillibegs albert edward prince of wales
you think me an old fogey and an old tory his thoughtful voice said
i saw three generations since oconnells time
i remember the famine in 
do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the union twenty years before oconnell did or before the prelates of your communion denounced him as a demagogue
you fenians forget some things
glorious pious and immortal memory
the lodge of diamond in armagh the splendid behung with corpses of papishes
hoarse masked and armed the planters covenant
the black north and true blue bible
croppies lie down
stephen sketched a brief gesture
i have rebel blood in me too mr deasy said
on the spindle side
but i am descended from sir john blackwood who voted for the union
we are all irish all kings sons
alas stephen said
per vias rectas mr deasy said firmly was his motto
he voted for it and put on his topboots to ride to dublin from the ards of down to do so
lal the ral the ra      the rocky road to dublin
a gruff squire on horseback with shiny topboots
soft day sir john
soft day your honour
day
day
two topboots jog dangling on to dublin
lal the ral the ra
lal the ral the raddy
that reminds me mr deasy said
you can do me a favour mr dedalus with some of your literary friends
i have a letter here for the press
sit down a moment
i have just to copy the end
he went to the desk near the window pulled in his chair twice and read off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter
sit down
excuse me he said over his shoulder the dictates of common sense just a moment
he peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow and muttering began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error
stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence
framed around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage their meek heads poised in air lord hastings repulse the duke of westminsters shotover the duke of beauforts ceylon prix de paris 
elfin riders sat them watchful of a sign
he saw their speeds backing kings colours and shouted with the shouts of vanished crowds
full stop mr deasy bade his keys
but prompt ventilation of this allimportant question  where cranly led me to get rich quick hunting his winners among the mudsplashed brakes amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek of the canteen over the motley slush
even money fair rebel ten to one the field
dicers and thimbleriggers we hurried by after the hoofs the vying caps and jackets and past the meatfaced woman a butchers dame nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange
shouts rang shrill from the boys playfield and a whirring whistle
again a goal
i am among them among their battling bodies in a medley the joust of life
you mean that knockkneed mothers darling who seems to be slightly crawsick
jousts
time shocked rebounds shock by shock
jousts slush and uproar of battles the frozen deathspew of the slain a shout of spearspikes baited with mens bloodied guts
now then mr deasy said rising
he came to the table pinning together his sheets
stephen stood up
i have put the matter into a nutshell mr deasy said
its about the foot and mouth disease
just look through it
there can be no two opinions on the matter
may i trespass on your valuable space
that doctrine of laissez faire which so often in our history
our cattle trade
the way of all our old industries
liverpool ring which jockeyed the galway harbour scheme
european conflagration
grain supplies through the narrow waters of the channel
the pluterperfect imperturbability of the department of agriculture
pardoned a classical allusion
cassandra
by a woman who was no better than she should be
to come to the point at issue
i dont mince words do i
mr deasy asked as stephen read on
foot and mouth disease
known as kochs preparation
serum and virus
percentage of salted horses
rinderpest
emperors horses at mrzsteg lower austria
veterinary surgeons
mr henry blackwood price
courteous offer a fair trial
dictates of common sense
allimportant question
in every sense of the word take the bull by the horns
thanking you for the hospitality of your columns
i want that to be printed and read mr deasy said
you will see at the next outbreak they will put an embargo on irish cattle
and it can be cured
it is cured
my cousin blackwood price writes to me it is regularly treated and cured in austria by cattledoctors there
they offer to come over here
i am trying to work up influence with the department
now im going to try publicity
i am surrounded by difficulties by intrigues by backstairs influence by
he raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke
mark my words mr dedalus he said
england is in the hands of the jews
in all the highest places her finance her press
and they are the signs of a nations decay
wherever they gather they eat up the nations vital strength
i have seen it coming these years
as sure as we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of destruction
old england is dying
he stepped swiftly off his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a broad sunbeam
he faced about and back again
dying he said again if not dead by now
the harlots cry from street to street      shall weave old englands windingsheet
his eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which he halted
a merchant stephen said is one who buys cheap and sells dear jew or gentile is he not
they sinned against the light mr deasy said gravely
and you can see the darkness in their eyes
and that is why they are wanderers on the earth to this day
on the steps of the paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting prices on their gemmed fingers
gabble of geese
they swarmed loud uncouth about the temple their heads thickplotting under maladroit silk hats
not theirs these clothes this speech these gestures
their full slow eyes belied the words the gestures eager and unoffending but knew the rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain
vain patience to heap and hoard
time surely would scatter all
a hoard heaped by the roadside plundered and passing on
their eyes knew their years of wandering and patient knew the dishonours of their flesh
who has not
stephen said
what do you mean
mr deasy asked
he came forward a pace and stood by the table
his underjaw fell sideways open uncertainly
is this old wisdom
he waits to hear from me
history stephen said is a nightmare from which i am trying to awake
from the playfield the boys raised a shout
a whirring whistle goal
what if that nightmare gave you a back kick
the ways of the creator are not our ways mr deasy said
all human history moves towards one great goal the manifestation of god
stephen jerked his thumb towards the window saying  that is god
hooray
ay
whrrwhee
what
mr deasy asked
a shout in the street stephen answered shrugging his shoulders
mr deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked between his fingers
looking up again he set them free
i am happier than you are he said
we have committed many errors and many sins
a woman brought sin into the world
for a woman who was no better than she should be helen the runaway wife of menelaus ten years the greeks made war on troy
a faithless wife first brought the strangers to our shore here macmurroughs wife and her leman orourke prince of breffni
a woman too brought parnell low
many errors many failures but not the one sin
i am a struggler now at the end of my days
but i will fight for the right till the end
for ulster will fight      and ulster will be right
stephen raised the sheets in his hand
well sir he began
i foresee mr deasy said that you will not remain here very long at this work
you were not born to be a teacher i think
perhaps i am wrong
a learner rather stephen said
and here what will you learn more
mr deasy shook his head
who knows
he said
to learn one must be humble
but life is the great teacher
stephen rustled the sheets again
as regards these he began
yes mr deasy said
you have two copies there
if you can have them published at once
 telegraph
irish homestead  i will try stephen said and let you know tomorrow
i know two editors slightly
that will do mr deasy said briskly
i wrote last night to mr field mp
there is a meeting of the cattletraders association today at the city arms hotel
i asked him to lay my letter before the meeting
you see if you can get it into your two papers
what are they
the evening telegraph  that will do mr deasy said
there is no time to lose
now i have to answer that letter from my cousin
good morning sir stephen said putting the sheets in his pocket
thank you
not at all mr deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk
i like to break a lance with you old as i am
good morning sir stephen said again bowing to his bent back
he went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield
the lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate toothless terrors
still i will help him in his fight
mulligan will dub me a new name the bullockbefriending bard
mr dedalus
running after me
no more letters i hope
just one moment
yes sir stephen said turning back at the gate
mr deasy halted breathing hard and swallowing his breath
i just wanted to say he said
ireland they say has the honour of being the only country which never persecuted the jews
do you know that
no
and do you know why
he frowned sternly on the bright air
why sir
stephen asked beginning to smile
because she never let them in mr deasy said solemnly
a coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a rattling chain of phlegm
he turned back quickly coughing laughing his lifted arms waving to the air
she never let them in he cried again through his laughter as he stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path
thats why
on his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung spangles dancing coins
     ineluctable modality of the visible at least that if no more thought through my eyes
signatures of all things i am here to read seaspawn and seawrack the nearing tide that rusty boot

limit of the diaphane in

diaphane adiaphane
if you can put your five fingers through it it is a gate if not a door
shut your eyes and see
stephen closed his eyes to hear his boots crush crackling wrack and shells
you are walking through it howsomever
i am a stride at a time
a very short space of time through very short times of space
five six the nacheinander
exactly and that is the ineluctable modality of the audible
open your eyes

they came down the steps from leahys terrace prudently frauenzimmer and down the shelving shore flabbily their splayed feet sinking in the silted sand

they waded a little way in the water and stooping soused their bags and lifting them again waded out
the dog yelped running to them reared up and pawed them dropping on all fours again reared up at them with mute bearish fawning
unheeded he kept by them as they came towards the drier sand a rag of wolfs tongue redpanting from his jaws
his speckled body ambled ahead of them and then loped off at a calfs gallop
the carcass lay on his path
he stopped sniffed stalked round it brother nosing closer went round it sniffling rapidly like a dog all over the dead dogs bedraggled fell
dogskull dogsniff eyes on the ground moves to one great goal
ah poor dogsbody
here lies poor dogsbodys body
tatters
out of that you mongrel
the cry brought him skulking back to his master and a blunt bootless kick sent him unscathed across a spit of sand crouched in flight
he slunk back in a curve
doesnt see me
along by the edge of the mole he lolloped dawdled smelt a rock and from under a cocked hindleg pissed against it
he trotted forward and lifting again his hindleg pissed quick short at an unsmelt rock
the simple pleasures of the poor
his hindpaws then scattered the sand then his forepaws dabbled and delved
something he buried there his grandmother
he rooted in the sand dabbling delving and stopped to listen to the air scraped up the sand again with a fury of his claws soon ceasing a pard a panther got in spousebreach vulturing the dead
after he woke me last night same dream or was it
wait
open hallway

red carpet spread
you will see who
shouldering their bags they trudged the red egyptians
his blued feet out of turnedup trousers slapped the clammy sand a dull brick muffler strangling his unshaven neck
with woman steps she followed the ruffian and his strolling mort
spoils slung at her back
loose sand and shellgrit crusted her bare feet
about her windraw face hair trailed
behind her lord his helpmate bing awast to romeville
when night hides her bodys flaws calling under her brown shawl from an archway where dogs have mired
her fancyman is treating two royal dublins in oloughlins of blackpitts
buss her wap in rogues rum lingo for o my dimber wapping dell
a shefiends whiteness under her rancid rags
fumballys lane that night the tanyard smells
white thy fambles red thy gan      and thy quarrons dainty is
couch a hogshead with me then

morose delectation aquinas tunbelly calls this frate porcospino
unfallen adam rode and not rutted

passing now
a side eye at my hamlet hat
if i were suddenly naked here as i sit
i am not
across the sands of all the world followed by the suns flaming sword to the west trekking to evening lands
she trudges schlepps trains drags trascines her load
a tide westering moondrawn in her wake
tides myriadislanded within her blood not mine oinopa ponton a winedark sea
behold the handmaid of the moon
in sleep the wet sign calls her hour bids her rise
bridebed childbed bed of death ghostcandled

old deasys letter
here
thanking you for the hospitality tear the blank end off
turning his back to the sun he bent over far to a table of rock and scribbled words
thats twice i forgot to take slips from the library counter
his shadow lay over the rocks as he bent ending
why not endless till the farthest star
darkly they are there behind this light darkness shining in the brightness delta of cassiopeia worlds
me sits there with his augurs rod of ash in borrowed sandals by day beside a livid sea unbeheld in violet night walking beneath a reign of uncouth stars
i throw this ended shadow from me manshape ineluctable call it back
endless would it be mine form of my form
who watches me here
who ever anywhere will read these written words
signs on a white field
somewhere to someone in your flutiest voice
the good bishop of cloyne took the veil of the temple out of his shovel hat veil of space with coloured emblems hatched on its field
hold hard
coloured on a flat yes thats right
flat i see then think distance near far flat i see east back
ah see now
falls back suddenly frozen in stereoscope
click does the trick
you find my words dark
darkness is in our souls do you not think
flutier
our souls shamewounded by our sins cling to us yet more a woman to her lover clinging the more the more
she trusts me her hand gentle the longlashed eyes
now where the blue hell am i bringing her beyond the veil
into the ineluctable modality of the ineluctable visuality
she she she
what she
the virgin at hodges figgis window on monday looking in for one of the alphabet books you were going to write
keen glance you gave her
wrist through the braided jesse of her sunshade
she lives in leeson park with a grief and kickshaws a lady of letters
talk that to someone else stevie a pickmeup
bet she wears those curse of god stays suspenders and yellow stockings darned with lumpy wool
talk about apple dumplings piuttosto
where are your wits
touch me
soft eyes
soft soft soft hand
i am lonely here
o touch me soon now
what is that word known to all men
i am quiet here alone
sad too
touch touch me
he lay back at full stretch over the sharp rocks cramming the scribbled note and pencil into a pocket his hat tilted down on his eyes
that is kevin egans movement i made nodding for his nap sabbath sleep
et vidit deus
et erant valde bona

bonjour
welcome as the flowers in may
under its leaf he watched through peacocktwittering lashes the southing sun
i am caught in this burning scene
pans hour the faunal noon
among gumheavy serpentplants milkoozing fruits where on the tawny waters leaves lie wide
pain is far
and no more turn aside and brood
his gaze brooded on his broadtoed boots a bucks castoffs nebeneinander
he counted the creases of rucked leather wherein anothers foot had nested warm
the foot that beat the ground in tripudium foot i dislove
but you were delighted when esther osvalts shoe went on you girl i knew in paris
tiens quel petit pied staunch friend a brother soul wildes love that dare not speak its name
his arm cranlys arm
he now will leave me

in long lassoes from the cock lake the water flowed full covering greengoldenly lagoons of sand rising flowing
my ashplant will float away

vehement breath of waters amid seasnakes rearing horses rocks
in cups of rocks it slops flop slop slap bounded in barrels
and spent its speech ceases
it flows purling widely flowing floating foampool flower unfurling
under the upswelling tide he saw the writhing weeds lift languidly and sway reluctant arms hising up their petticoats in whispering water swaying and upturning coy silver fronds
day by day night by night lifted flooded and let fall
lord they are weary and whispered to they sigh
saint ambrose heard it sigh of leaves and waves waiting awaiting the fullness of their times diebus ac noctibus iniurias patiens ingemiscit
to no end gathered vainly then released forthflowing wending back loom of the moon
weary too in sight of lovers lascivious men a naked woman shining in her courts she draws a toil of waters
five fathoms out there
full fathom five thy father lies
at one he said
found drowned
high water at dublin bar
driving before it a loose drift of rubble fanshoals of fishes silly shells
a corpse rising saltwhite from the undertow bobbing a pace a pace a porpoise landward
there he is
hook it quick
pull
sunk though he be beneath the watery floor
we have him
easy now
bag of corpsegas sopping in foul brine
a quiver of minnows fat of a spongy titbit flash through the slits of his buttoned trouserfly
god becomes man becomes fish becomes barnacle goose becomes featherbed mountain
dead breaths i living breathe tread dead dust devour a urinous offal from all dead
hauled stark over the gunwale he breathes upward the stench of his green grave his leprous nosehole snoring to the sun

toothless kinch the superman
why is that i wonder or does it mean something perhaps
my handkerchief
he threw it
i remember
did i not take it up
his hand groped vainly in his pockets
no i didnt
better buy one
he laid the dry snot picked from his nostril on a ledge of rock carefully
for the rest let look who will
behind
perhaps there is someone
he turned his face over a shoulder rere regardant
moving through the air high spars of a threemaster her sails brailed up on the crosstrees homing upstream silently moving a silent ship
 ii        mr leopold bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls
he liked thick giblet soup nutty gizzards a stuffed roast heart liverslices fried with crustcrumbs fried hencods roes
most of all he liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of faintly scented urine
kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly righting her breakfast things on the humpy tray
gelid light and air were in the kitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere
made him feel a bit peckish
the coals were reddening
another slice of bread and butter three four right
she didnt like her plate full
right
he turned from the tray lifted the kettle off the hob and set it sideways on the fire
it sat there dull and squat its spout stuck out
cup of tea soon
good
mouth dry
the cat walked stiffly round a leg of the table with tail on high
mkgnao
o there you are mr bloom said turning from the fire
the cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the table mewing
just how she stalks over my writingtable
prr
scratch my head
prr
mr bloom watched curiously kindly the lithe black form
clean to see the gloss of her sleek hide the white button under the butt of her tail the green flashing eyes
he bent down to her his hands on his knees
milk for the pussens he said
mrkgnao
the cat cried
they call them stupid
they understand what we say better than we understand them
she understands all she wants to
vindictive too
cruel
her nature
curious mice never squeal
seem to like it
wonder what i look like to her
height of a tower
no she can jump me
afraid of the chickens she is he said mockingly
afraid of the chookchooks
i never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens
mrkrgnao
the cat said loudly
she blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes mewing plaintively and long showing him her milkwhite teeth
he watched the dark eyeslits narrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones
then he went to the dresser took the jug hanlons milkman had just filled for him poured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor
gurrhr
she cried running to lap
he watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped three times and licked lightly
wonder is it true if you clip them they cant mouse after
why
they shine in the dark perhaps the tips
or kind of feelers in the dark perhaps
he listened to her licking lap
ham and eggs no
no good eggs with this drouth
want pure fresh water
thursday not a good day either for a mutton kidney at buckleys
fried with butter a shake of pepper
better a pork kidney at dlugaczs
while the kettle is boiling
she lapped slower then licking the saucer clean
why are their tongues so rough
to lap better all porous holes
nothing she can eat
he glanced round him
no
on quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall paused by the bedroom door
she might like something tasty
thin bread and butter she likes in the morning
still perhaps once in a way
he said softly in the bare hall  im going round the corner
be back in a minute
and when he had heard his voice say it he added  you dont want anything for breakfast
a sleepy soft grunt answered  mn
no
she didnt want anything
he heard then a warm heavy sigh softer as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled
must get those settled really
pity
all the way from gibraltar
forgotten any little spanish she knew
wonder what her father gave for it
old style
ah yes
of course
bought it at the governors auction
got a short knock
hard as nails at a bargain old tweedy
yes sir
at plevna that was
i rose from the ranks sir and im proud of it
still he had brains enough to make that corner in stamps
now that was farseeing
his hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoat and his lost property office secondhand waterproof
stamps stickyback pictures
daresay lots of officers are in the swim too
course they do
the sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely plastos high grade ha
he peeped quickly inside the leather headband
white slip of paper
quite safe
on the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey
not there
in the trousers i left off
must get it
potato i have
creaky wardrobe
no use disturbing her
she turned over sleepily that time
he pulled the halldoor to after him very quietly more till the footleaf dropped gently over the threshold a limp lid
looked shut
all right till i come back anyhow
he crossed to the bright side avoiding the loose cellarflap of number seventyfive
the sun was nearing the steeple of georges church
be a warm day i fancy
specially in these black clothes feel it more
black conducts reflects refracts is it
 the heat
but i couldnt go in that light suit
make a picnic of it
his eyelids sank quietly often as he walked in happy warmth
bolands breadvan delivering with trays our daily but she prefers yesterdays loaves turnovers crisp crowns hot
makes you feel young
somewhere in the east early morning set off at dawn
travel round in front of the sun steal a days march on him
keep it up for ever never grow a day older technically
walk along a strand strange land come to a city gate sentry there old ranker too old tweedys big moustaches leaning on a long kind of a spear
wander through awned streets
turbaned faces going by
dark caves of carpet shops big man turko the terrible seated crosslegged smoking a coiled pipe
cries of sellers in the streets
drink water scented with fennel sherbet
dander along all day
might meet a robber or two
well meet him
getting on to sundown
the shadows of the mosques among the pillars priest with a scroll rolled up
a shiver of the trees signal the evening wind
i pass on
fading gold sky
a mother watches me from her doorway
she calls her children home in their dark language
high wall beyond strings twanged
night sky moon violet colour of mollys new garters
strings
listen
a girl playing one of those instruments what do you call them dulcimers
i pass
probably not a bit like it really
kind of stuff you read in the track of the sun
sunburst on the titlepage
he smiled pleasing himself
what arthur griffith said about the headpiece over the freeman leader a homerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway behind the bank of ireland
he prolonged his pleased smile
ikey touch that homerule sun rising up in the northwest
he approached larry orourkes
from the cellar grating floated up the flabby gush of porter
through the open doorway the bar squirted out whiffs of ginger teadust biscuitmush
good house however just the end of the city traffic
for instance mauleys down there n g as position
of course if they ran a tramline along the north circular from the cattlemarket to the quays value would go up like a shot
baldhead over the blind
cute old codger
no use canvassing him for an ad
still he knows his own business best
there he is sure enough my bold larry leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching the aproned curate swab up with mop and bucket
simon dedalus takes him off to a tee with his eyes screwed up
do you know what im going to tell you
whats that mr orourke
do you know what
the russians theyd only be an eight oclock breakfast for the japanese
stop and say a word about the funeral perhaps
sad thing about poor dignam mr orourke
turning into dorset street he said freshly in greeting through the doorway  good day mr orourke
good day to you
lovely weather sir
tis all that
where do they get the money
coming up redheaded curates from the county leitrim rinsing empties and old man in the cellar
then lo and behold they blossom out as adam findlaters or dan tallons
then think of the competition
general thirst
good puzzle would be cross dublin without passing a pub
save it they cant
off the drunks perhaps
put down three and carry five
what is that a bob here and there dribs and drabs
on the wholesale orders perhaps
doing a double shuffle with the town travellers
square it you with the boss and well split the job see
how much would that tot to off the porter in the month
say ten barrels of stuff
say he got ten per cent off
o more

he halted before dlugaczs window staring at the hanks of sausages polonies black and white
fifteen multiplied by
the figures whitened in his mind unsolved displeased he let them fade
the shiny links packed with forcemeat fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the lukewarm breath of cooked spicy pigs blood
a kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willowpatterned dish the last
he stood by the nextdoor girl at the counter
would she buy it too calling the items from a slip in her hand
chapped washingsoda
and a pound and a half of dennys sausages
his eyes rested on her vigorous hips
woods his name is
wonder what he does
wife is oldish
new blood
no followers allowed
strong pair of arms
whacking a carpet on the clothesline
she does whack it by george
the way her crooked skirt swings at each whack
the ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with blotchy fingers sausagepink
sound meat there like a stallfed heifer
he took a page up from the pile of cut sheets the model farm at kinnereth on the lakeshore of tiberias
can become ideal winter sanatorium
moses montefiore
i thought he was
farmhouse wall round it blurred cattle cropping
he held the page from him interesting read it nearer the title the blurred cropping cattle the page rustling
a young white heifer
those mornings in the cattlemarket the beasts lowing in their pens branded sheep flop and fall of dung the breeders in hobnailed boots trudging through the litter slapping a palm on a ripemeated hindquarter theres a prime one unpeeled switches in their hands
he held the page aslant patiently bending his senses and his will his soft subject gaze at rest
the crooked skirt swinging whack by whack by whack
the porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile wrapped up her prime sausages and made a red grimace
now my miss he said
she tendered a coin smiling boldly holding her thick wrist out
thank you my miss
and one shilling threepence change
for you please
mr bloom pointed quickly
to catch up and walk behind her if she went slowly behind her moving hams
pleasant to see first thing in the morning
hurry up damn it
make hay while the sun shines
she stood outside the shop in sunlight and sauntered lazily to the right
he sighed down his nose they never understand
sodachapped hands
crusted toenails too
brown scapulars in tatters defending her both ways
the sting of disregard glowed to weak pleasure within his breast
for another a constable off duty cuddling her in eccles lane
they like them sizeable
prime sausage
o please mr policeman im lost in the wood
threepence please
his hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a sidepocket
then it fetched up three coins from his trousers pocket and laid them on the rubber prickles
they lay were read quickly and quickly slid disc by disc into the till
thank you sir
another time
a speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him
he withdrew his gaze after an instant
no better not another time
good morning he said moving away
good morning sir
no sign
gone
what matter
he walked back along dorset street reading gravely
agendath netaim planters company
to purchase waste sandy tracts from turkish government and plant with eucalyptus trees
excellent for shade fuel and construction
orangegroves and immense melonfields north of jaffa
you pay eighty marks and they plant a dunam of land for you with olives oranges almonds or citrons
olives cheaper oranges need artificial irrigation
every year you get a sending of the crop
your name entered for life as owner in the book of the union
can pay ten down and the balance in yearly instalments
bleibtreustrasse  berlin w 
nothing doing
still an idea behind it
he looked at the cattle blurred in silver heat
silverpowdered olivetrees
quiet long days pruning ripening
olives are packed in jars eh
i have a few left from andrews
molly spitting them out
knows the taste of them now
oranges in tissue paper packed in crates
citrons too
wonder is poor citron still in saint kevins parade
and mastiansky with the old cither
pleasant evenings we had then
molly in citrons basketchair
nice to hold cool waxen fruit hold in the hand lift it to the nostrils and smell the perfume
like that heavy sweet wild perfume
always the same year after year
they fetched high prices too moisel told me
arbutus place pleasants street pleasant old times
must be without a flaw he said
coming all that way spain gibraltar mediterranean the levant
crates lined up on the quayside at jaffa chap ticking them off in a book navvies handling them barefoot in soiled dungarees

how do you
doesnt see
chap you know just to salute bit of a bore
his back is like that norwegian captains
wonder if ill meet him today
watering cart
to provoke the rain
on earth as it is in heaven
a cloud began to cover the sun slowly wholly
grey
far
no not like that
a barren land bare waste
vulcanic lake the dead sea no fish weedless sunk deep in the earth
no wind could lift those waves grey metal poisonous foggy waters
brimstone they called it raining down the cities of the plain sodom gomorrah edom
all dead names
a dead sea in a dead land grey and old
old now
it bore the oldest the first race
a bent hag crossed from cassidys clutching a naggin bottle by the neck
the oldest people
wandered far away over all the earth captivity to captivity multiplying dying being born everywhere
it lay there now
now it could bear no more
dead an old womans the grey sunken cunt of the world
desolation
grey horror seared his flesh
folding the page into his pocket he turned into eccles street hurrying homeward
cold oils slid along his veins chilling his blood age crusting him with a salt cloak
well i am here now
yes i am here now
morning mouth bad images
got up wrong side of the bed
must begin again those sandows exercises
on the hands down
blotchy brown brick houses
number eighty still unlet
why is that
valuation is only twentyeight
towers battersby north macarthur parlour windows plastered with bills
plasters on a sore eye
to smell the gentle smoke of tea fume of the pan sizzling butter
be near her ample bedwarmed flesh
yes yes
quick warm sunlight came running from berkeley road swiftly in slim sandals along the brightening footpath
runs she runs to meet me a girl with gold hair on the wind
two letters and a card lay on the hallfloor
he stooped and gathered them
mrs marion bloom
his quickened heart slowed at once
bold hand
mrs marion
poldy
entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm yellow twilight towards her tousled head
who are the letters for
he looked at them
mullingar
milly
a letter for me from milly he said carefully and a card to you
and a letter for you
he laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of her knees
do you want the blind up
letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her glance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow
that do
he asked turning
she was reading the card propped on her elbow
she got the things she said
he waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back slowly with a snug sigh
hurry up with that tea she said
im parched
the kettle is boiling he said
but he delayed to clear the chair her striped petticoat tossed soiled linen and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed
as he went down the kitchen stairs she called  poldy
what
scald the teapot
on the boil sure enough a plume of steam from the spout
he scalded and rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea tilting the kettle then to let the water flow in
having set it to draw he took off the kettle crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the lump of butter slide and melt
while he unwrapped the kidney the cat mewed hungrily against him
give her too much meat she wont mouse
say they wont eat pork
kosher
here
he let the bloodsmeared paper fall to her and dropped the kidney amid the sizzling butter sauce
pepper
he sprinkled it through his fingers ringwise from the chipped eggcup
then he slit open his letter glancing down the page and over
thanks new tam mr coghlan lough owel picnic young student blazes boylans seaside girls
the tea was drawn
he filled his own moustachecup sham crown derby smiling
silly millys birthday gift
only five she was then
no wait four
i gave her the amberoid necklace she broke
putting pieces of folded brown paper in the letterbox for her
he smiled pouring
o milly bloom you are my darling
you are my lookingglass from night to morning
id rather have you without a farthing      than katey keogh with her ass and garden
poor old professor goodwin
dreadful old case
still he was a courteous old chap
oldfashioned way he used to bow molly off the platform
and the little mirror in his silk hat
the night milly brought it into the parlour
o look what i found in professor goodwins hat
all we laughed
sex breaking out even then
pert little piece she was
he prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over then fitted the teapot on the tray
its hump bumped as he took it up
everything on it
bread and butter four sugar spoon her cream
yes
he carried it upstairs his thumb hooked in the teapot handle
nudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it on the chair by the bedhead
what a time you were
she said
she set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly an elbow on the pillow
he looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large soft bubs sloping within her nightdress like a shegoats udder
the warmth of her couched body rose on the air mingling with the fragrance of the tea she poured
a strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow
in the act of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread
who was the letter from
he asked
bold hand
marion
o boylan she said
hes bringing the programme
what are you singing
l ci darem with j c doyle she said and loves old sweet song
her full lips drinking smiled
rather stale smell that incense leaves next day
like foul flowerwater
would you like the window open a little
she doubled a slice of bread into her mouth asking  what time is the funeral
eleven i think he answered
i didnt see the paper
following the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soiled drawers from the bed
no
then a twisted grey garter looped round a stocking rumpled shiny sole
no that book
other stocking
her petticoat
it must have fell down she said
he felt here and there
voglio e non vorrei
wonder if she pronounces that right voglio
not in the bed
must have slid down
he stooped and lifted the valance
the book fallen sprawled against the bulge of the orangekeyed chamberpot
show here she said
i put a mark in it
theres a word i wanted to ask you
she swallowed a draught of tea from her cup held by nothandle and having wiped her fingertips smartly on the blanket began to search the text with the hairpin till she reached the word
met him what
he asked
here she said
what does that mean
he leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail
metempsychosis
yes
whos he when hes at home
metempsychosis he said frowning
its greek from the greek
that means the transmigration of souls
o rocks
she said
tell us in plain words
he smiled glancing askance at her mocking eyes
the same young eyes
the first night after the charades
dolphins barn
he turned over the smudged pages
ruby the pride of the ring
hello
illustration
fierce italian with carriagewhip
must be ruby pride of the on the floor naked
sheet kindly lent
the monster maffei desisted and flung his victim from him with an oath
cruelty behind it all

mob gaping
break your neck and well break our sides
families of them
bone them young so they metamspychosis
that we live after death
our souls
that a mans soul after he dies
dignams soul  did you finish it
he asked
yes she said
theres nothing smutty in it
is she in love with the first fellow all the time
never read it
do you want another
yes
get another of paul de kocks
nice name he has
she poured more tea into her cup watching it flow sideways
must get that capel street library book renewed or theyll write to kearney my guarantor
reincarnation thats the word
some people believe he said that we go on living in another body after death that we lived before
they call it reincarnation
that we all lived before on the earth thousands of years ago or some other planet
they say we have forgotten it
some say they remember their past lives
the sluggish cream wound curdling spirals through her tea
better remind her of the word metempsychosis
an example would be better
an example

he turned the pages back
metempsychosis he said is what the ancient greeks called it
they used to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree for instance
what they called nymphs for example
her spoon ceased to stir up the sugar
she gazed straight before her inhaling through her arched nostrils
theres a smell of burn she said
did you leave anything on the fire
the kidney
he cried suddenly
he fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and stubbing his toes against the broken commode hurried out towards the smell stepping hastily down the stairs with a flurried storks legs
pungent smoke shot up in an angry jet from a side of the pan
by prodding a prong of the fork under the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its back
only a little burnt
he tossed it off the pan on to a plate and let the scanty brown gravy trickle over it
cup of tea now
he sat down cut and buttered a slice of the loaf
he shore away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat
then he put a forkful into his mouth chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant meat
done to a turn
a mouthful of tea
then he cut away dies of bread sopped one in the gravy and put it in his mouth
what was that about some young student and a picnic
he creased out the letter at his side reading it slowly as he chewed sopping another die of bread in the gravy and raising it to his mouth

byby
m   fifteen yesterday
curious fifteenth of the month too
her first birthday away from home
separation
remember the summer morning she was born running to knock up mrs thornton in denzille street
jolly old woman
lot of babies she must have helped into the world
she knew from the first poor little rudy wouldnt live
well god is good sir
she knew at once
he would be eleven now if he had lived
his vacant face stared pityingly at the postscript
excuse bad writing
hurry
piano downstairs
coming out of her shell
row with her in the xl caf about the bracelet
wouldnt eat her cakes or speak or look
saucebox
he sopped other dies of bread in the gravy and ate piece after piece of kidney
twelve and six a week
not much
still she might do worse
music hall stage
young student
he drank a draught of cooler tea to wash down his meal
then he read the letter again twice
o well she knows how to mind herself
but if not
no nothing has happened
of course it might
wait in any case till it does
a wild piece of goods
her slim legs running up the staircase
destiny
ripening now
vain very
he smiled with troubled affection at the kitchen window
day i caught her in the street pinching her cheeks to make them red
anemic a little
was given milk too long
on the erins king that day round the kish
damned old tub pitching about
not a bit funky
her pale blue scarf loose in the wind with her hair
all dimpled cheeks and curls      your head it simply swirls
seaside girls
torn envelope
hands stuck in his trousers pockets jarvey off for the day singing
friend of the family
swurls he says
pier with lamps summer evening band
those girls those girls      those lovely seaside girls
milly too
young kisses the first
far away now past
mrs marion
reading lying back now counting the strands of her hair smiling braiding
a soft qualm regret flowed down his backbone increasing
will happen yes
prevent
useless cant move
girls sweet light lips
will happen too
he felt the flowing qualm spread over him
useless to move now
lips kissed kissing kissed
full gluey womans lips
better where she is down there away
occupy her
wanted a dog to pass the time
might take a trip down there
august bank holiday only two and six return
six weeks off however
might work a press pass
or through mcoy
the cat having cleaned all her fur returned to the meatstained paper nosed at it and stalked to the door
she looked back at him mewing
wants to go out
wait before a door sometime it will open
let her wait
has the fidgets
electric
thunder in the air
was washing at her ear with her back to the fire too
he felt heavy full then a gentle loosening of his bowels
he stood up undoing the waistband of his trousers
the cat mewed to him
miaow
he said in answer
wait till im ready
heaviness hot day coming
too much trouble to fag up the stairs to the landing
a paper
he liked to read at stool
hope no ape comes knocking just as im
in the tabledrawer he found an old number of titbits
he folded it under his armpit went to the door and opened it
the cat went up in soft bounds
ah wanted to go upstairs curl up in a ball on the bed
listening he heard her voice  come come pussy
come
he went out through the backdoor into the garden stood to listen towards the next garden
no sound
perhaps hanging clothes out to dry
the maid was in the garden
fine morning
he bent down to regard a lean file of spearmint growing by the wall
make a summerhouse here
scarlet runners
virginia creepers
want to manure the whole place over scabby soil
a coat of liver of sulphur
all soil like that without dung
household slops
loam what is this that is
the hens in the next garden their droppings are very good top dressing
best of all though are the cattle especially when they are fed on those oilcakes
mulch of dung
best thing to clean ladies kid gloves
dirty cleans
ashes too
reclaim the whole place
grow peas in that corner there
lettuce
always have fresh greens then
still gardens have their drawbacks
that bee or bluebottle here whitmonday
he walked on
where is my hat by the way
must have put it back on the peg
or hanging up on the floor
funny i dont remember that
hallstand too full
four umbrellas her raincloak
picking up the letters
dragos shopbell ringing
queer i was just thinking that moment
brown brillantined hair over his collar
just had a wash and brushup
wonder have i time for a bath this morning
tara street
chap in the paybox there got away james stephens they say
obrien
deep voice that fellow dlugacz has
agendath what is it
now my miss
enthusiast
he kicked open the crazy door of the jakes
better be careful not to get these trousers dirty for the funeral
he went in bowing his head under the low lintel
leaving the door ajar amid the stench of mouldy limewash and stale cobwebs he undid his braces
before sitting down he peered through a chink up at the nextdoor windows
the king was in his countinghouse
nobody
asquat on the cuckstool he folded out his paper turning its pages over on his bared knees
something new and easy
no great hurry
keep it a bit
our prize titbit matchams masterstroke
written by mr philip beaufoy playgoers club london
payment at the rate of one guinea a column has been made to the writer
three and a half
three pounds three
three pounds thirteen and six
quietly he read restraining himself the first column and yielding but resisting began the second
midway his last resistance yielding he allowed his bowels to ease themselves quietly as he read reading still patiently that slight constipation of yesterday quite gone
hope its not too big bring on piles again
no just right
so
ah
costive
one tabloid of cascara sagrada
life might be so
it did not move or touch him but it was something quick and neat
print anything now
silly season
he read on seated calm above his own rising smell
neat certainly
matcham often thinks of the masterstroke by which he won the laughing witch who now
begins and ends morally
hand in hand
smart
he glanced back through what he had read and while feeling his water flow quietly he envied kindly mr beaufoy who had written it and received payment of three pounds thirteen and six
might manage a sketch
by mr and mrs l m bloom
invent a story for some proverb
which
time i used to try jotting down on my cuff what she said dressing
dislike dressing together
nicked myself shaving
biting her nether lip hooking the placket of her skirt
timing her

did roberts pay you yet

what had gretta conroy on

what possessed me to buy this comb

im swelled after that cabbage
a speck of dust on the patent leather of her boot
rubbing smartly in turn each welt against her stockinged calf
morning after the bazaar dance when mays band played ponchiellis dance of the hours
explain that morning hours noon then evening coming on then night hours
washing her teeth
that was the first night
her head dancing
her fansticks clicking
is that boylan well off
he has money
why
i noticed he had a good rich smell off his breath dancing
no use humming then
allude to it
strange kind of music that last night
the mirror was in shadow
she rubbed her handglass briskly on her woollen vest against her full wagging bub
peering into it
lines in her eyes
it wouldnt pan out somehow
evening hours girls in grey gauze
night hours then black with daggers and eyemasks
poetical idea pink then golden then grey then black
still true to life also
day then the night
he tore away half the prize story sharply and wiped himself with it
then he girded up his trousers braced and buttoned himself
he pulled back the jerky shaky door of the jakes and came forth from the gloom into the air
in the bright light lightened and cooled in limb he eyed carefully his black trousers the ends the knees the houghs of the knees
what time is the funeral
better find out in the paper
a creak and a dark whirr in the air high up
the bells of georges church
they tolled the hour loud dark iron
heigho
heigho
heigho
heigho
heigho
heigho
quarter to
there again the overtone following through the air
a third
poor dignam
     by lorries along sir john rogersons quay mr bloom walked soberly past windmill lane leasks the linseed crusher the postal telegraph office
could have given that address too
and past the sailors home
he turned from the morning noises of the quayside and walked through lime street
by bradys cottages a boy for the skins lolled his bucket of offal linked smoking a chewed fagbutt
a smaller girl with scars of eczema on her forehead eyed him listlessly holding her battered caskhoop
tell him if he smokes he wont grow
o let him
his life isnt such a bed of roses
waiting outside pubs to bring da home
come home to ma da
slack hour wont be many there
he crossed townsend street passed the frowning face of bethel
el yes house of aleph beth
and past nichols the undertaker
at eleven it is
time enough
daresay corny kelleher bagged the job for oneills
singing with his eyes shut
corny
met her once in the park
in the dark
what a lark
police tout
her name and address she then told with my tooraloom tooraloom tay
o surely he bagged it
bury him cheap in a whatyoumaycall
with my tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom
in westland row he halted before the window of the belfast and oriental tea company and read the legends of leadpapered packets choice blend finest quality family tea
rather warm
tea
must get some from tom kernan
couldnt ask him at a funeral though
while his eyes still read blandly he took off his hat quietly inhaling his hairoil and sent his right hand with slow grace over his brow and hair
very warm morning
under their dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow of the leather headband inside his high grade ha
just there
his right hand came down into the bowl of his hat
his fingers found quickly a card behind the headband and transferred it to his waistcoat pocket
so warm
his right hand once more more slowly went over his brow and hair
then he put on his hat again relieved and read again choice blend made of the finest ceylon brands
the far east
lovely spot it must be the garden of the world big lazy leaves to float about on cactuses flowery meads snaky lianas they call them
wonder is it like that
those cinghalese lobbing about in the sun in dolce far niente not doing a hands turn all day
sleep six months out of twelve
too hot to quarrel
influence of the climate
lethargy
flowers of idleness
the air feeds most
azotes
hothouse in botanic gardens
sensitive plants
waterlilies
petals too tired to
sleeping sickness in the air
walk on roseleaves
imagine trying to eat tripe and cowheel
where was the chap i saw in that picture somewhere
ah yes in the dead sea floating on his back reading a book with a parasol open
couldnt sink if you tried so thick with salt
because the weight of the water no the weight of the body in the water is equal to the weight of the what
or is it the volume is equal to the weight
its a law something like that
vance in high school cracking his fingerjoints teaching
the college curriculum
cracking curriculum
what is weight really when you say the weight
thirtytwo feet per second per second
law of falling bodies per second per second
they all fall to the ground
the earth
its the force of gravity of the earth is the weight
he turned away and sauntered across the road
how did she walk with her sausages
like that something
as he walked he took the folded freeman from his sidepocket unfolded it rolled it lengthwise in a baton and tapped it at each sauntering step against his trouserleg
careless air just drop in to see
per second per second
per second for every second it means
from the curbstone he darted a keen glance through the door of the postoffice
too late box
post here
noone
in
he handed the card through the brass grill
are there any letters for me
he asked
while the postmistress searched a pigeonhole he gazed at the recruiting poster with soldiers of all arms on parade and held the tip of his baton against his nostrils smelling freshprinted rag paper
no answer probably
went too far last time
the postmistress handed him back through the grill his card with a letter
he thanked her and glanced rapidly at the typed envelope
henry flower esq co p o westland row             city
answered anyhow
he slipped card and letter into his sidepocket reviewing again the soldiers on parade
wheres old tweedys regiment
castoff soldier
there bearskin cap and hackle plume
no hes a grenadier
pointed cuffs
there he is royal dublin fusiliers
redcoats
too showy
that must be why the women go after them
uniform
easier to enlist and drill
maud gonnes letter about taking them off oconnell street at night disgrace to our irish capital
griffiths paper is on the same tack now an army rotten with venereal disease overseas or halfseasover empire
half baked they look hypnotised like
eyes front
mark time
table able
bed ed
the kings own
never see him dressed up as a fireman or a bobby
a mason yes
he strolled out of the postoffice and turned to the right
talk as if that would mend matters
his hand went into his pocket and a forefinger felt its way under the flap of the envelope ripping it open in jerks
women will pay a lot of heed i dont think
his fingers drew forth the letter the letter and crumpled the envelope in his pocket
something pinned on photo perhaps
hair
no
mcoy
get rid of him quickly
take me out of my way
hate company when you
hello bloom
where are you off to
hello mcoy
nowhere in particular
hows the body
fine

just keeping alive mcoy said
his eyes on the black tie and clothes he asked with low respect  is there any no trouble i hope
i see youre  o no mr bloom said
poor dignam you know
the funeral is today
to be sure poor fellow
so it is

a photo it isnt
a badge maybe
eeleven mr bloom answered
i must try to get out there mcoy said
eleven is it
i only heard it last night
who was telling me
holohan
you know hoppy
i know
mr bloom gazed across the road at the outsider drawn up before the door of the grosvenor
the porter hoisted the valise up on the well
she stood still waiting while the man husband brother like her searched his pockets for change
stylish kind of coat with that roll collar warm for a day like this looks like blanketcloth
careless stand of her with her hands in those patch pockets
like that haughty creature at the polo match
women all for caste till you touch the spot
handsome is and handsome does
reserved about to yield
the honourable mrs and brutus is an honourable man
possess her once take the starch out of her
i was with bob doran hes on one of his periodical bends and what do you call him bantam lyons
just down there in conways we were
doran lyons in conways
she raised a gloved hand to her hair
in came hoppy
having a wet
drawing back his head and gazing far from beneath his vailed eyelids he saw the bright fawn skin shine in the glare the braided drums
clearly i can see today
moisture about gives long sight perhaps
talking of one thing or another
ladys hand
which side will she get up
and he said sad thing about our poor friend paddy
what paddy i said
poor little paddy dignam he said
off to the country broadstone probably
high brown boots with laces dangling
wellturned foot
what is he foostering over that change for
sees me looking
eye out for other fellow always
good fallback
two strings to her bow
why i said
whats wrong with him i said
proud rich silk stockings
yes mr bloom said
he moved a little to the side of mcoys talking head
getting up in a minute
whats wrong with him
he said
hes dead he said
and faith he filled up
is it paddy dignam
i said
i couldnt believe it when i heard it
i was with him no later than friday last or thursday was it in the arch
yes he said
hes gone
he died on monday poor fellow
watch
watch
silk flash rich stockings white
watch
a heavy tramcar honking its gong slewed between
lost it
curse your noisy pugnose
feels locked out of it
paradise and the peri
always happening like that
the very moment
girl in eustace street hallway monday was it settling her garter
her friend covering the display of
esprit de corps
well what are you gaping at
yes yes mr bloom said after a dull sigh
another gone
one of the best mcoy said
the tram passed
they drove off towards the loop line bridge her rich gloved hand on the steel grip
flicker flicker the laceflare of her hat in the sun flicker flick
wife well i suppose
mcoys changed voice said
o yes mr bloom said
tiptop thanks
he unrolled the newspaper baton idly and read idly       what is home without      plumtrees potted meat
incomplete
with it an abode of bliss
my missus has just got an engagement
at least its not settled yet
valise tack again
by the way no harm
im off that thanks
mr bloom turned his largelidded eyes with unhasty friendliness
my wife too he said
shes going to sing at a swagger affair in the ulster hall belfast on the twentyfifth
that so
mcoy said
glad to hear that old man
whos getting it up
mrs marion bloom
not up yet
queen was in her bedroom eating bread and
no book
blackened court cards laid along her thigh by sevens
dark lady and fair man
letter
cat furry black ball
torn strip of envelope
loves      old      sweet      song      comes looves old  its a kind of a tour dont you see mr bloom said thoughtfully
sweeeet song
theres a committee formed
part shares and part profits
mcoy nodded picking at his moustache stubble
o well he said

he moved to go
well glad to see you looking fit he said

yes mr bloom said
tell you what mcoy said
you might put down my name at the funeral will you

didnt catch me napping that wheeze
the quick touch
soft mark
id like my job
valise i have a particular fancy for
leather
capped corners rivetted edges double action lever lock
bob cowley lent him his for the wicklow regatta concert last year and never heard tidings of it from that good day to this
mr bloom strolling towards brunswick street smiled
my missus has just got an
reedy freckled soprano
cheeseparing nose
nice enough in its way for a little ballad
no guts in it
you and me dont you know in the same boat
softsoaping
give you the needle that would
cant he hear the difference
think hes that way inclined a bit
against my grain somehow
thought that belfast would fetch him
i hope that smallpox up there doesnt get worse
suppose she wouldnt let herself be vaccinated again
your wife and my wife
wonder is he pimping after me
mr bloom stood at the corner his eyes wandering over the multicoloured hoardings
cantrell and cochranes ginger ale aromatic
clerys summer sale
no hes going on straight
hello
leah tonight
mrs bandmann palmer
like to see her again in that
hamlet she played last night
male impersonator
perhaps he was a woman
why ophelia committed suicide
poor papa
how he used to talk of kate bateman in that
outside the adelphi in london waited all the afternoon to get in
year before i was born that was sixtyfive
and ristori in vienna
what is this the right name is
by mosenthal it is
rachel is it
no
the scene he was always talking about where the old blind abraham recognises the voice and puts his fingers on his face
nathans voice
his sons voice
i hear the voice of nathan who left his father to die of grief and misery in my arms who left the house of his father and left the god of his father
every word is so deep leopold
poor papa
poor man
im glad i didnt go into the room to look at his face
that day
o dear
o dear
ffoo
well perhaps it was best for him
mr bloom went round the corner and passed the drooping nags of the hazard
no use thinking of it any more
nosebag time
wish i hadnt met that mcoy fellow
he came nearer and heard a crunching of gilded oats the gently champing teeth
their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by amid the sweet oaten reek of horsepiss
their eldorado
poor jugginses
damn all they know or care about anything with their long noses stuck in nosebags
too full for words
still they get their feed all right and their doss
gelded too a stump of black guttapercha wagging limp between their haunches
might be happy all the same that way
good poor brutes they look
still their neigh can be very irritating
he drew the letter from his pocket and folded it into the newspaper he carried
might just walk into her here
the lane is safer
he passed the cabmans shelter
curious the life of drifting cabbies
all weathers all places time or setdown no will of their own
voglio e non
like to give them an odd cigarette
sociable
shout a few flying syllables as they pass
he hummed       l ci darem la mano      la la lala la la
he turned into cumberland street and going on some paces halted in the lee of the station wall
noone
meades timberyard
piled balks
ruins and tenements
with careful tread he passed over a hopscotch court with its forgotten pickeystone
not a sinner
near the timberyard a squatted child at marbles alone shooting the taw with a cunnythumb
a wise tabby a blinking sphinx watched from her warm sill
pity to disturb them
mohammed cut a piece out of his mantle not to wake her
open it
and once i played marbles when i went to that old dames school
she liked mignonette
mrs elliss
and mr
he opened the letter within the newspaper
a flower
i think its a
a yellow flower with flattened petals
not annoyed then
what does she say
dear henry  i got your last letter to me and thank you very much for it
i am sorry you did not like my last letter
why did you enclose the stamps
i am awfully angry with you
i do wish i could punish you for that
i called you naughty boy because i do not like that other world
please tell me what is the real meaning of that word
are you not happy in your home you poor little naughty boy
i do wish i could do something for you
please tell me what you think of poor me
i often think of the beautiful name you have
dear henry when will we meet
i think of you so often you have no idea
i have never felt myself so much drawn to a man as you
i feel so bad about
please write me a long letter and tell me more
remember if you do not i will punish you
so now you know what i will do to you you naughty boy if you do not wrote
o how i long to meet you
henry dear do not deny my request before my patience are exhausted
then i will tell you all
goodbye now naughty darling i have such a bad headache
today
and write by return to your longing  martha   p s do tell me what kind of perfume does your wife use
i want to know
he tore the flower gravely from its pinhold smelt its almost no smell and placed it in his heart pocket
language of flowers
they like it because noone can hear
or a poison bouquet to strike him down
then walking slowly forward he read the letter again murmuring here and there a word
angry tulips with you darling manflower punish your cactus if you dont please poor forgetmenot how i long violets to dear roses when we soon anemone meet all naughty nightstalk wife marthas perfume
having read it all he took it from the newspaper and put it back in his sidepocket
weak joy opened his lips
changed since the first letter
wonder did she wrote it herself
doing the indignant a girl of good family like me respectable character
could meet one sunday after the rosary
thank you not having any
usual love scrimmage
then running round corners
bad as a row with molly
cigar has a cooling effect
narcotic
go further next time
naughty boy punish afraid of words of course
brutal why not
try it anyhow
a bit at a time
fingering still the letter in his pocket he drew the pin out of it
common pin eh
he threw it on the road
out of her clothes somewhere pinned together
queer the number of pins they always have
no roses without thorns
flat dublin voices bawled in his head
those two sluts that night in the coombe linked together in the rain
o mairy lost the pin of her drawers
she didnt know what to do      to keep it up      to keep it up
it
them
such a bad headache
has her roses probably
or sitting all day typing
eyefocus bad for stomach nerves
what perfume does your wife use
now could you make out a thing like that
to keep it up
martha mary
i saw that picture somewhere i forget now old master or faked for money
he is sitting in their house talking
mysterious
also the two sluts in the coombe would listen
to keep it up
nice kind of evening feeling
no more wandering about
just loll there quiet dusk let everything rip
forget
tell about places you have been strange customs
the other one jar on her head was getting the supper fruit olives lovely cool water out of a well stonecold like the hole in the wall at ashtown
must carry a paper goblet next time i go to the trottingmatches
she listens with big dark soft eyes
tell her more and more all
then a sigh silence
long long long rest
going under the railway arch he took out the envelope tore it swiftly in shreds and scattered them towards the road
the shreds fluttered away sank in the dank air a white flutter then all sank
henry flower
you could tear up a cheque for a hundred pounds in the same way
simple bit of paper
lord iveagh once cashed a sevenfigure cheque for a million in the bank of ireland
shows you the money to be made out of porter
still the other brother lord ardilaun has to change his shirt four times a day they say
skin breeds lice or vermin
a million pounds wait a moment
twopence a pint fourpence a quart eightpence a gallon of porter no one and fourpence a gallon of porter
one and four into twenty fifteen about
yes exactly
fifteen millions of barrels of porter
what am i saying barrels
gallons
about a million barrels all the same
an incoming train clanked heavily above his head coach after coach
barrels bumped in his head dull porter slopped and churned inside
the bungholes sprang open and a huge dull flood leaked out flowing together winding through mudflats all over the level land a lazy pooling swirl of liquor bearing along wideleaved flowers of its froth
he had reached the open backdoor of all hallows
stepping into the porch he doffed his hat took the card from his pocket and tucked it again behind the leather headband
damn it
i might have tried to work mcoy for a pass to mullingar
same notice on the door
sermon by the very reverend john conmee s j on saint peter claver s j and the african mission
prayers for the conversion of gladstone they had too when he was almost unconscious
the protestants are the same
convert dr william j walsh dd
to the true religion
save chinas millions
wonder how they explain it to the heathen chinee
prefer an ounce of opium
celestials
rank heresy for them
buddha their god lying on his side in the museum
taking it easy with hand under his cheek
josssticks burning
not like ecce homo
crown of thorns and cross
clever idea saint patrick the shamrock
chopsticks
conmee martin cunningham knows him distinguishedlooking
sorry i didnt work him about getting molly into the choir instead of that father farley who looked a fool but wasnt
theyre taught that
hes not going out in bluey specs with the sweat rolling off him to baptise blacks is he
the glasses would take their fancy flashing
like to see them sitting round in a ring with blub lips entranced listening
still life
lap it up like milk i suppose
the cold smell of sacred stone called him
he trod the worn steps pushed the swingdoor and entered softly by the rere
something going on some sodality
pity so empty
nice discreet place to be next some girl
who is my neighbour
jammed by the hour to slow music
that woman at midnight mass
seventh heaven
women knelt in the benches with crimson halters round their necks heads bowed
a batch knelt at the altarrails
the priest went along by them murmuring holding the thing in his hands
he stopped at each took out a communion shook a drop or two are they in water
off it and put it neatly into her mouth
her hat and head sank
then the next one
her hat sank at once
then the next one a small old woman
the priest bent down to put it into her mouth murmuring all the time
latin
the next one
shut your eyes and open your mouth
what
corpus body
corpse
good idea the latin
stupefies them first
hospice for the dying
they dont seem to chew it only swallow it down
rum idea eating bits of a corpse
why the cannibals cotton to it
he stood aside watching their blind masks pass down the aisle one by one and seek their places
he approached a bench and seated himself in its corner nursing his hat and newspaper
these pots we have to wear
we ought to have hats modelled on our heads
they were about him here and there with heads still bowed in their crimson halters waiting for it to melt in their stomachs
something like those mazzoth its that sort of bread unleavened shewbread
look at them
now i bet it makes them feel happy
lollipop
it does
yes bread of angels its called
theres a big idea behind it kind of kingdom of god is within you feel
first communicants
hokypoky penny a lump
then feel all like one family party same in the theatre all in the same swim
they do
im sure of that
not so lonely
in our confraternity
then come out a bit spreeish
let off steam
thing is if you really believe in it
lourdes cure waters of oblivion and the knock apparition statues bleeding
old fellow asleep near that confessionbox
hence those snores
blind faith
safe in the arms of kingdom come
lulls all pain
wake this time next year
he saw the priest stow the communion cup away well in and kneel an instant before it showing a large grey bootsole from under the lace affair he had on
suppose he lost the pin of his
he wouldnt know what to do to
bald spot behind
letters on his back inri
no ihs
molly told me one time i asked her
i have sinned or no i have suffered it is
and the other one
iron nails ran in
meet one sunday after the rosary
do not deny my request
turn up with a veil and black bag
dusk and the light behind her
she might be here with a ribbon round her neck and do the other thing all the same on the sly
their character
that fellow that turned queens evidence on the invincibles he used to receive the carey was his name the communion every morning
this very church
peter carey yes
no peter claver i am thinking of
denis carey
and just imagine that
wife and six children at home
and plotting that murder all the time
those crawthumpers now thats a good name for them theres always something shiftylooking about them
theyre not straight men of business either
o no shes not here the flower no no
by the way did i tear up that envelope
yes under the bridge
the priest was rinsing out the chalice then he tossed off the dregs smartly
wine
makes it more aristocratic than for example if he drank what they are used to guinnesss porter or some temperance beverage wheatleys dublin hop bitters or cantrell and cochranes ginger ale aromatic
doesnt give them any of it shew wine only the other
cold comfort
pious fraud but quite right otherwise theyd have one old booser worse than another coming along cadging for a drink
queer the whole atmosphere of the
quite right
perfectly right that is
mr bloom looked back towards the choir
not going to be any music
pity
who has the organ here i wonder
old glynn he knew how to make that instrument talk the vibrato fifty pounds a year they say he had in gardiner street
molly was in fine voice that day the stabat mater of rossini
father bernard vaughans sermon first
christ or pilate
christ but dont keep us all night over it
music they wanted
footdrill stopped
could hear a pin drop
i told her to pitch her voice against that corner
i could feel the thrill in the air the full the people looking up  quis est homo  some of that old sacred music splendid
mercadante seven last words
mozarts twelfth mass gloria in that
those old popes keen on music on art and statues and pictures of all kinds
palestrina for example too
they had a gay old time while it lasted
healthy too chanting regular hours then brew liqueurs
benedictine
green chartreuse
still having eunuchs in their choir that was coming it a bit thick
what kind of voice is it
must be curious to hear after their own strong basses
connoisseurs
suppose they wouldnt feel anything after
kind of a placid
no worry
fall into flesh dont they
gluttons tall long legs
who knows
eunuch
one way out of it
he saw the priest bend down and kiss the altar and then face about and bless all the people
all crossed themselves and stood up
mr bloom glanced about him and then stood up looking over the risen hats
stand up at the gospel of course
then all settled down on their knees again and he sat back quietly in his bench
the priest came down from the altar holding the thing out from him and he and the massboy answered each other in latin
then the priest knelt down and began to read off a card  o god our refuge and our strength  mr bloom put his face forward to catch the words
english
throw them the bone
i remember slightly
how long since your last mass
glorious and immaculate virgin
joseph her spouse
peter and paul
more interesting if you understood what it was all about
wonderful organisation certainly goes like clockwork

great weapon in their hands
more than doctor or solicitor
woman dying to

look down at her ring to find an excuse
whispering gallery walls have ears
husband learn to his surprise
gods little joke
then out she comes
repentance skindeep
lovely shame
pray at an altar
hail mary and holy mary
flowers incense candles melting
hide her blushes
salvation army blatant imitation
reformed prostitute will address the meeting
how i found the lord
squareheaded chaps those must be in rome they work the whole show
and dont they rake in the money too
bequests also to the pp
for the time being in his absolute discretion
masses for the repose of my soul to be said publicly with open doors
monasteries and convents
the priest in that fermanagh will case in the witnessbox
no browbeating him
he had his answer pat for everything
liberty and exaltation of our holy mother the church
the doctors of the church they mapped out the whole theology of it
the priest prayed  blessed michael archangel defend us in the hour of conflict
be our safeguard against the wickedness and snares of the devil may god restrain him we humbly pray
 and do thou o prince of the heavenly host by the power of god thrust satan down to hell and with him those other wicked spirits who wander through the world for the ruin of souls
the priest and the massboy stood up and walked off
all over
the women remained behind thanksgiving
better be shoving along
brother buzz
come around with the plate perhaps
pay your easter duty
he stood up
hello

or their skirt behind placket unhooked
glimpses of the moon
annoyed if you dont
why didnt you tell me before
still like you better untidy
good job it wasnt farther south
he passed discreetly buttoning down the aisle and out through the main door into the light
he stood a moment unseeing by the cold black marble bowl while before him and behind two worshippers dipped furtive hands in the low tide of holy water
trams a car of prescotts dyeworks a widow in her weeds
notice because im in mourning myself
he covered himself
how goes the time

he waited by the counter inhaling slowly the keen reek of drugs the dusty dry smell of sponges and loofahs
lot of time taken up telling your aches and pains
sweet almond oil and tincture of benzoin mr bloom said and then orangeflower water
it certainly did make her skin so delicate white like wax
and white wax also he said
brings out the darkness of her eyes
looking at me the sheet up to her eyes spanish smelling herself when i was fixing the links in my cuffs
those homely recipes are often the best strawberries for the teeth nettles and rainwater oatmeal they say steeped in buttermilk

mr bloom raised a cake to his nostrils

he strolled out of the shop the newspaper baton under his armpit the coolwrappered soap in his left hand

bantam lyons raised his eyes suddenly and leered weakly

his sharp voice said

i was going to throw it away that moment
bantam lyons doubted an instant leering then thrust the outspread sheets back on mr blooms arms
ill risk it he said

he sped off towards conways corner
god speed scut
mr bloom folded the sheets again to a neat square and lodged the soap in it smiling
silly lips of that chap

messenger boys stealing to put on sixpence

he eyed the horseshoe poster over the gate of college park cyclist doubled up like a cod in a pot
damn bad ad

then the spokes sports sports sports and the hub big college
something to catch the eye
theres hornblower standing at the porters lodge

heavenly weather really
if life was always like that
cricket weather
sit around under sunshades
over after over
out
they cant play it here
duck for six wickets
still captain culler broke a window in the kildare street club with a slog to square leg
donnybrook fair more in their line
and the skulls we were acracking when mcarthy took the floor
heatwave
wont last
always passing the stream of life which in the stream of life we trace is dearer than them all
enjoy a bath now clean trough of water cool enamel the gentle tepid stream
this is my body
he foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full naked in a womb of warmth oiled by scented melting soap softly laved
he saw his trunk and limbs riprippled over and sustained buoyed lightly upward lemonyellow his navel bud of flesh and saw the dark tangled curls of his bush floating floating hair of the stream around the limp father of thousands a languid floating flower
     martin cunningham first poked his silkhatted head into the creaking carriage and entering deftly seated himself
mr power stepped in after him curving his height with care
come on simon
after you mr bloom said
mr dedalus covered himself quickly and got in saying  yes yes
are we all here now
martin cunningham asked
come along bloom
mr bloom entered and sat in the vacant place
he pulled the door to after him and slammed it twice till it shut tight
he passed an arm through the armstrap and looked seriously from the open carriagewindow at the lowered blinds of the avenue
one dragged aside an old woman peeping
nose whiteflattened against the pane
thanking her stars she was passed over
extraordinary the interest they take in a corpse
glad to see us go we give them such trouble coming
job seems to suit them
huggermugger in corners
slop about in slipperslappers for fear hed wake
then getting it ready
laying it out
molly and mrs fleming making the bed
pull it more to your side
our windingsheet
never know who will touch you dead
wash and shampoo
i believe they clip the nails and the hair
keep a bit in an envelope
grows all the same after
unclean job
all waited
nothing was said
stowing in the wreaths probably
i am sitting on something hard
ah that soap in my hip pocket
better shift it out of that
wait for an opportunity
all waited
then wheels were heard from in front turning then nearer then horses hoofs
a jolt
their carriage began to move creaking and swaying
other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind
the blinds of the avenue passed and number nine with its craped knocker door ajar
at walking pace
they waited still their knees jogging till they had turned and were passing along the tramtracks
tritonville road
quicker
the wheels rattled rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook rattling in the doorframes
what way is he taking us
mr power asked through both windows
irishtown martin cunningham said
ringsend
brunswick street
mr dedalus nodded looking out
thats a fine old custom he said
i am glad to see it has not died out
all watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by passers
respect
the carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the smoother road past watery lane
mr bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man clad in mourning a wide hat
theres a friend of yours gone by dedalus he said
who is that
your son and heir
where is he
mr dedalus said stretching over across
the carriage passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway before the tenement houses lurched round the corner and swerving back to the tramtrack rolled on noisily with chattering wheels
mr dedalus fell back saying  was that mulligan cad with him
his fidus achates
no mr bloom said
he was alone
down with his aunt sally i suppose mr dedalus said the goulding faction the drunken little costdrawer and crissie papas little lump of dung the wise child that knows her own father
mr bloom smiled joylessly on ringsend road
wallace bros the bottleworks dodder bridge
richie goulding and the legal bag
goulding collis and ward he calls the firm
his jokes are getting a bit damp
great card he was
waltzing in stamer street with ignatius gallaher on a sunday morning the landladys two hats pinned on his head
out on the rampage all night
beginning to tell on him now that backache of his i fear
wife ironing his back
thinks hell cure it with pills
all breadcrumbs they are
about six hundred per cent profit
hes in with a lowdown crowd mr dedalus snarled
that mulligan is a contaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts
his name stinks all over dublin
but with the help of god and his blessed mother ill make it my business to write a letter one of those days to his mother or his aunt or whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a gate
ill tickle his catastrophe believe you me
he cried above the clatter of the wheels  i wont have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son
a counterjumpers son
selling tapes in my cousin peter paul mswineys
not likely
he ceased
mr bloom glanced from his angry moustache to mr powers mild face and martin cunninghams eyes and beard gravely shaking
noisy selfwilled man
full of his son
he is right
something to hand on
if little rudy had lived
see him grow up
hear his voice in the house
walking beside molly in an eton suit
my son
me in his eyes
strange feeling it would be
from me
just a chance
must have been that morning in raymond terrace she was at the window watching the two dogs at it by the wall of the cease to do evil
and the sergeant grinning up
she had that cream gown on with the rip she never stitched
give us a touch poldy
god im dying for it
how life begins
got big then
had to refuse the greystones concert
my son inside her
i could have helped him on in life
i could
make him independent
learn german too

mr power asked
ten minutes martin cunningham said looking at his watch
molly
milly
same thing watered down
her tomboy oaths
o jumping jupiter
ye gods and little fishes
still shes a dear girl
soon be a woman
mullingar
dearest papli
young student
yes yes a woman too
life life
the carriage heeled over and back their four trunks swaying
corny might have given us a more commodious yoke mr power said
he might mr dedalus said if he hadnt that squint troubling him
do you follow me
he closed his left eye
martin cunningham began to brush away crustcrumbs from under his thighs
what is this he said in the name of god
crumbs
someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately mr power said
all raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewed buttonless leather of the seats
mr dedalus twisting his nose frowned downward and said  unless im greatly mistaken
what do you think martin
it struck me too martin cunningham said
mr bloom set his thigh down
glad i took that bath
feel my feet quite clean
but i wish mrs fleming had darned these socks better
mr dedalus sighed resignedly
after all he said its the most natural thing in the world
did tom kernan turn up
martin cunningham asked twirling the peak of his beard gently
yes mr bloom answered
hes behind with ned lambert and hynes
and corny kelleher himself
mr power asked
at the cemetery martin cunningham said
i met mcoy this morning mr bloom said
he said hed try to come
the carriage halted short
whats wrong
were stopped
where are we
mr bloom put his head out of the window
the grand canal he said
gasworks
whooping cough they say it cures
good job milly never got it
poor children
doubles them up black and blue in convulsions
shame really
got off lightly with illnesses compared
only measles
flaxseed tea
scarlatina influenza epidemics
canvassing for death
dont miss this chance
dogs home over there
poor old athos
be good to athos leopold is my last wish
thy will be done
we obey them in the grave
a dying scrawl
he took it to heart pined away
quiet brute
old mens dogs usually are
a raindrop spat on his hat
he drew back and saw an instant of shower spray dots over the grey flags
apart
curious
like through a colander
i thought it would
my boots were creaking i remember now
the weather is changing he said quietly
a pity it did not keep up fine martin cunningham said
wanted for the country mr power said
theres the sun again coming out
mr dedalus peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun hurled a mute curse at the sky
its as uncertain as a childs bottom he said
were off again
the carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed gently
martin cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard
tom kernan was immense last night he said
and paddy leonard taking him off to his face
o draw him out martin mr power said eagerly
wait till you hear him simon on ben dollards singing of the croppy boy
immense martin cunningham said pompously
his singing of that simple ballad martin is the most trenchant rendering i ever heard in the whole course of my experience  trenchant mr power said laughing
hes dead nuts on that
and the retrospective arrangement
did you read dan dawsons speech
martin cunningham asked
i did not then mr dedalus said
where is it
in the paper this morning
mr bloom took the paper from his inside pocket
that book i must change for her
no no mr dedalus said quickly
later on please
mr blooms glance travelled down the edge of the paper scanning the deaths callan coleman dignam fawcett lowry naumann peake what peake is that
is it the chap was in crosbie and alleynes
no sexton urbright
inked characters fast fading on the frayed breaking paper
thanks to the little flower
sadly missed
to the inexpressible grief of his
aged  after a long and tedious illness
months mind quinlan
on whose soul sweet jesus have mercy
it is now a month since dear henry fled      to his home up above in the sky      while his family weeps and mourns his loss      hoping some day to meet him on high
i tore up the envelope
yes
where did i put her letter after i read it in the bath
he patted his waistcoatpocket
there all right
dear henry fled
before my patience are exhausted
national school
meades yard
the hazard
only two there now
nodding
full as a tick
too much bone in their skulls
the other trotting round with a fare
an hour ago i was passing there
the jarvies raised their hats
a pointsmans back straightened itself upright suddenly against a tramway standard by mr blooms window
couldnt they invent something automatic so that the wheel itself much handier
well but that fellow would lose his job then
well but then another fellow would get a job making the new invention
antient concert rooms
nothing on there
a man in a buff suit with a crape armlet
not much grief there
quarter mourning
people in law perhaps
they went past the bleak pulpit of saint marks under the railway bridge past the queens theatre in silence
hoardings eugene stratton mrs bandmann palmer
could i go to see leah tonight i wonder
i said i
or the lily of killarney
elster grimes opera company
big powerful change
wet bright bills for next week
fun on the bristol
martin cunningham could work a pass for the gaiety
have to stand a drink or two
as broad as its long
hes coming in the afternoon
her songs
plastos
sir philip cramptons memorial fountain bust
who was he
how do you do
martin cunningham said raising his palm to his brow in salute
he doesnt see us mr power said
yes he does
how do you do
who
mr dedalus asked
blazes boylan mr power said
there he is airing his quiff
just that moment i was thinking
mr dedalus bent across to salute
from the door of the red bank the white disc of a straw hat flashed reply spruce figure passed
mr bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand then those of his right hand
the nails yes
is there anything more in him that they she sees
fascination
worst man in dublin
that keeps him alive
they sometimes feel what a person is
instinct
but a type like that
my nails
i am just looking at them well pared
and after thinking alone
body getting a bit softy
i would notice that from remembering
what causes that
i suppose the skin cant contract quickly enough when the flesh falls off
but the shape is there
the shape is there still
shoulders
hips
plump
night of the dance dressing
shift stuck between the cheeks behind
he clasped his hands between his knees and satisfied sent his vacant glance over their faces
mr power asked  how is the concert tour getting on bloom
o very well mr bloom said
i hear great accounts of it
its a good idea you see  are you going yourself
well no mr bloom said
in point of fact i have to go down to the county clare on some private business
you see the idea is to tour the chief towns
what you lose on one you can make up on the other
quite so martin cunningham said
mary anderson is up there now
have you good artists
louis werner is touring her mr bloom said
o yes well have all topnobbers
j c doyle and john maccormack i hope and
the best in fact
and madame mr power said smiling
last but not least
mr bloom unclasped his hands in a gesture of soft politeness and clasped them
smith obrien
someone has laid a bunch of flowers there
woman
must be his deathday
for many happy returns
the carriage wheeling by farrells statue united noiselessly their unresisting knees
oot a dullgarbed old man from the curbstone tendered his wares his mouth opening oot
four bootlaces for a penny
wonder why he was struck off the rolls
had his office in hume street
same house as mollys namesake tweedy crown solicitor for waterford
has that silk hat ever since
relics of old decency
mourning too
terrible comedown poor wretch
kicked about like snuff at a wake
ocallaghan on his last legs
and madame
twenty past eleven
up
mrs fleming is in to clean
doing her hair humming voglio e non vorrei
no vorrei e non
looking at the tips of her hairs to see if they are split
mi trema un poco il
beautiful on that tre her voice is weeping tone
a thrush
a throstle
there is a word throstle that expresses that
his eyes passed lightly over mr powers goodlooking face
greyish over the ears
madame smiling
i smiled back
a smile goes a long way
only politeness perhaps
nice fellow
who knows is that true about the woman he keeps
not pleasant for the wife
yet they say who was it told me there is no carnal
you would imagine that would get played out pretty quick
yes it was crofton met him one evening bringing her a pound of rumpsteak
what is this she was
barmaid in jurys
or the moira was it
they passed under the hugecloaked liberators form
martin cunningham nudged mr power
of the tribe of reuben he said
a tall blackbearded figure bent on a stick stumping round the corner of elverys elephant house showed them a curved hand open on his spine
in all his pristine beauty mr power said
mr dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly  the devil break the hasp of your back
mr power collapsing in laughter shaded his face from the window as the carriage passed grays statue
we have all been there martin cunningham said broadly
his eyes met mr blooms eyes
he caressed his beard adding  well nearly all of us
mr bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions faces
thats an awfully good one thats going the rounds about reuben j and the son
about the boatman
mr power asked
yes
isnt it awfully good
what is that
mr dedalus asked
i didnt hear it
there was a girl in the case mr bloom began and he determined to send him to the isle of man out of harms way but when they were both  what
mr dedalus asked
that confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it
yes mr bloom said
they were both on the way to the boat and he tried to drown  drown barabbas
mr dedalus cried
i wish to christ he did
mr power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils
no mr bloom said the son himself  martin cunningham thwarted his speech rudely  reuben j and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on their way to the isle of man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got loose and over the wall with him into the liffey
for gods sake
mr dedalus exclaimed in fright
is he dead
dead
martin cunningham cried
not he
a boatman got a pole and fished him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father on the quay more dead than alive
half the town was there
yes mr bloom said
but the funny part is  and reuben j martin cunningham said gave the boatman a florin for saving his sons life
a stifled sigh came from under mr powers hand
o he did martin cunningham affirmed
like a hero
a silver florin
isnt it awfully good
mr bloom said eagerly
one and eightpence too much mr dedalus said drily
mr powers choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage
nelsons pillar
eight plums a penny
eight for a penny
we had better look a little serious martin cunningham said
mr dedalus sighed
ah then indeed he said poor little paddy wouldnt grudge us a laugh
many a good one he told himself
the lord forgive me
mr power said wiping his wet eyes with his fingers
poor paddy
i little thought a week ago when i saw him last and he was in his usual health that id be driving after him like this
hes gone from us
as decent a little man as ever wore a hat mr dedalus said
he went very suddenly
breakdown martin cunningham said
heart
he tapped his chest sadly
blazing face redhot
too much john barleycorn
cure for a red nose
drink like the devil till it turns adelite
a lot of money he spent colouring it
mr power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension
he had a sudden death poor fellow he said
the best death mr bloom said
their wide open eyes looked at him
no suffering he said
a moment and all is over
like dying in sleep
noone spoke
dead side of the street this
dull business by day land agents temperance hotel falconers railway guide civil service college gills catholic club the industrious blind
why
some reason
sun or wind
at night too
chummies and slaveys
under the patronage of the late father mathew
foundation stone for parnell
breakdown
heart
white horses with white frontlet plumes came round the rotunda corner galloping
a tiny coffin flashed by
in a hurry to bury
a mourning coach
unmarried
black for the married
piebald for bachelors
dun for a nun
sad martin cunningham said
a child
a dwarfs face mauve and wrinkled like little rudys was
dwarfs body weak as putty in a whitelined deal box
burial friendly society pays
penny a week for a sod of turf
our
little
beggar
baby
meant nothing
mistake of nature
if its healthy its from the mother
if not from the man
better luck next time
poor little thing mr dedalus said
its well out of it
the carriage climbed more slowly the hill of rutland square
rattle his bones
over the stones
only a pauper
nobody owns
in the midst of life martin cunningham said
but the worst of all mr power said is the man who takes his own life
martin cunningham drew out his watch briskly coughed and put it back
the greatest disgrace to have in the family mr power added
temporary insanity of course martin cunningham said decisively
we must take a charitable view of it
they say a man who does it is a coward mr dedalus said
it is not for us to judge martin cunningham said
mr bloom about to speak closed his lips again
martin cunninghams large eyes
looking away now
sympathetic human man he is
intelligent
like shakespeares face
always a good word to say
they have no mercy on that here or infanticide
refuse christian burial
they used to drive a stake of wood through his heart in the grave
as if it wasnt broken already
yet sometimes they repent too late
found in the riverbed clutching rushes
he looked at me
and that awful drunkard of a wife of his
setting up house for her time after time and then pawning the furniture on him every saturday almost
leading him the life of the damned
wear the heart out of a stone that
monday morning
start afresh
shoulder to the wheel
lord she must have looked a sight that night dedalus told me he was in there
drunk about the place and capering with martins umbrella
and they call me the jewel of asia      of asia      the geisha
he looked away from me
he knows
rattle his bones
that afternoon of the inquest
the redlabelled bottle on the table
the room in the hotel with hunting pictures
stuffy it was
sunlight through the slats of the venetian blind
the coroners sunlit ears big and hairy
boots giving evidence
thought he was asleep first
then saw like yellow streaks on his face
had slipped down to the foot of the bed
verdict overdose
death by misadventure
the letter
for my son leopold
no more pain
wake no more
nobody owns
the carriage rattled swiftly along blessington street
over the stones
we are going the pace i think martin cunningham said
god grant he doesnt upset us on the road mr power said
i hope not martin cunningham said
that will be a great race tomorrow in germany
the gordon bennett
yes by jove mr dedalus said
that will be worth seeing faith
as they turned into berkeley street a streetorgan near the basin sent over and after them a rollicking rattling song of the halls
has anybody here seen kelly
kay ee double ell wy
dead march from saul hes as bad as old antonio
he left me on my ownio
pirouette
the mater misericordiae
eccles street
my house down there
big place
ward for incurables there
very encouraging
our ladys hospice for the dying
deadhouse handy underneath
where old mrs riordan died
they look terrible the women
her feeding cup and rubbing her mouth with the spoon
then the screen round her bed for her to die
nice young student that was dressed that bite the bee gave me
hes gone over to the lyingin hospital they told me
from one extreme to the other
the carriage galloped round a corner stopped
whats wrong now
a divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows lowing slouching by on padded hoofs whisking their tails slowly on their clotted bony croups
outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleating their fear
emigrants mr power said
huuuh
the drovers voice cried his switch sounding on their flanks
huuuh
out of that
thursday of course
tomorrow is killing day
springers
cuffe sold them about twentyseven quid each
for liverpool probably
roastbeef for old england
they buy up all the juicy ones
and then the fifth quarter lost all that raw stuff hide hair horns
comes to a big thing in a year
dead meat trade
byproducts of the slaughterhouses for tanneries soap margarine
wonder if that dodge works now getting dicky meat off the train at clonsilla
the carriage moved on through the drove
i cant make out why the corporation doesnt run a tramline from the parkgate to the quays mr bloom said
all those animals could be taken in trucks down to the boats
instead of blocking up the thoroughfare martin cunningham said
quite right
they ought to
yes mr bloom said and another thing i often thought is to have municipal funeral trams like they have in milan you know
run the line out to the cemetery gates and have special trams hearse and carriage and all
dont you see what i mean
o that be damned for a story mr dedalus said
pullman car and saloon diningroom
a poor lookout for corny mr power added
why
mr bloom asked turning to mr dedalus
wouldnt it be more decent than galloping two abreast
well theres something in that mr dedalus granted
and martin cunningham said we wouldnt have scenes like that when the hearse capsized round dunphys and upset the coffin on to the road
that was terrible mr powers shocked face said and the corpse fell about the road
terrible
first round dunphys mr dedalus said nodding
gordon bennett cup
praises be to god
martin cunningham said piously
bom
upset
a coffin bumped out on to the road
burst open
paddy dignam shot out and rolling over stiff in the dust in a brown habit too large for him
red face grey now
mouth fallen open
asking whats up now
quite right to close it
looks horrid open
then the insides decompose quickly
much better to close up all the orifices
yes also
with wax
the sphincter loose
seal up all
dunphys mr power announced as the carriage turned right
dunphys corner
mourning coaches drawn up drowning their grief
a pause by the wayside
tiptop position for a pub
expect well pull up here on the way back to drink his health
pass round the consolation
elixir of life
but suppose now it did happen
would he bleed if a nail say cut him in the knocking about
he would and he wouldnt i suppose
depends on where
the circulation stops
still some might ooze out of an artery
it would be better to bury them in red a dark red
in silence they drove along phibsborough road
an empty hearse trotted by coming from the cemetery looks relieved
crossguns bridge the royal canal
water rushed roaring through the sluices
a man stood on his dropping barge between clamps of turf
on the towpath by the lock a slacktethered horse
aboard of the bugabu  their eyes watched him
on the slow weedy waterway he had floated on his raft coastward over ireland drawn by a haulage rope past beds of reeds over slime mudchoked bottles carrion dogs
athlone mullingar moyvalley i could make a walking tour to see milly by the canal
or cycle down
hire some old crock safety
wren had one the other day at the auction but a ladys
developing waterways
james mcanns hobby to row me oer the ferry
cheaper transit
by easy stages
houseboats
camping out
also hearses
to heaven by water
perhaps i will without writing
come as a surprise leixlip clonsilla
dropping down lock by lock to dublin
with turf from the midland bogs
salute
he lifted his brown straw hat saluting paddy dignam
they drove on past brian boroimhe house
near it now
i wonder how is our friend fogarty getting on mr power said
better ask tom kernan mr dedalus said
how is that
martin cunningham said
left him weeping i suppose
though lost to sight mr dedalus said to memory dear
the carriage steered left for finglas road
the stonecutters yard on the right
last lap
crowded on the spit of land silent shapes appeared white sorrowful holding out calm hands knelt in grief pointing
fragments of shapes hewn
in white silence appealing
the best obtainable
thos
h dennany monumental builder and sculptor
passed
on the curbstone before jimmy geary the sextons an old tramp sat grumbling emptying the dirt and stones out of his huge dustbrown yawning boot
after lifes journey
gloomy gardens then went by one by one gloomy houses
mr power pointed
that is where childs was murdered he said
the last house
so it is mr dedalus said
a gruesome case
seymour bushe got him off
murdered his brother
or so they said
the crown had no evidence mr power said
only circumstantial martin cunningham added
thats the maxim of the law
better for ninetynine guilty to escape than for one innocent person to be wrongfully condemned
they looked
murderers ground
it passed darkly
shuttered tenantless unweeded garden
whole place gone to hell
wrongfully condemned
murder
the murderers image in the eye of the murdered
they love reading about it
mans head found in a garden
her clothing consisted of
how she met her death
recent outrage
the weapon used
murderer is still at large
clues
a shoelace
the body to be exhumed
murder will out
cramped in this carriage
she mightnt like me to come that way without letting her know
must be careful about women
catch them once with their pants down
never forgive you after
fifteen
the high railings of prospect rippled past their gaze
dark poplars rare white forms
forms more frequent white shapes thronged amid the trees white forms and fragments streaming by mutely sustaining vain gestures on the air
the felly harshed against the curbstone stopped
martin cunningham put out his arm and wrenching back the handle shoved the door open with his knee
he stepped out
mr power and mr dedalus followed
change that soap now
mr blooms hand unbuttoned his hip pocket swiftly and transferred the paperstuck soap to his inner handkerchief pocket
he stepped out of the carriage replacing the newspaper his other hand still held
paltry funeral coach and three carriages
its all the same
pallbearers gold reins requiem mass firing a volley
pomp of death
beyond the hind carriage a hawker stood by his barrow of cakes and fruit
simnel cakes those are stuck together cakes for the dead
dogbiscuits
who ate them
mourners coming out
he followed his companions
mr kernan and ned lambert followed hynes walking after them
corny kelleher stood by the opened hearse and took out the two wreaths
he handed one to the boy
where is that childs funeral disappeared to
a team of horses passed from finglas with toiling plodding tread dragging through the funereal silence a creaking waggon on which lay a granite block
the waggoner marching at their head saluted
coffin now
got here before us dead as he is
horse looking round at it with his plume skeowways
dull eye collar tight on his neck pressing on a bloodvessel or something
do they know what they cart out here every day
must be twenty or thirty funerals every day
then mount jerome for the protestants
funerals all over the world everywhere every minute
shovelling them under by the cartload doublequick
thousands every hour
too many in the world
mourners came out through the gates woman and a girl
leanjawed harpy hard woman at a bargain her bonnet awry
girls face stained with dirt and tears holding the womans arm looking up at her for a sign to cry
fishs face bloodless and livid
the mutes shouldered the coffin and bore it in through the gates
so much dead weight
felt heavier myself stepping out of that bath
first the stiff then the friends of the stiff
corny kelleher and the boy followed with their wreaths
who is that beside them
ah the brotherinlaw
all walked after
martin cunningham whispered  i was in mortal agony with you talking of suicide before bloom
what
mr power whispered
how so
his father poisoned himself martin cunningham whispered
had the queens hotel in ennis
you heard him say he was going to clare
anniversary
o god
mr power whispered
first i heard of it
poisoned himself
he glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyes followed towards the cardinals mausoleum
speaking
was he insured
mr bloom asked
i believe so mr kernan answered
but the policy was heavily mortgaged
martin is trying to get the youngster into artane
how many children did he leave
five
ned lambert says hell try to get one of the girls into todds
a sad case mr bloom said gently
five young children
a great blow to the poor wife mr kernan added
indeed yes mr bloom agreed
has the laugh at him now
he looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished
she had outlived him
lost her husband
more dead for her than for me
one must outlive the other
wise men say
there are more women than men in the world
condole with her
your terrible loss
i hope youll soon follow him
for hindu widows only
she would marry another
him
no
yet who knows after
widowhood not the thing since the old queen died
drawn on a guncarriage
victoria and albert
frogmore memorial mourning
but in the end she put a few violets in her bonnet
vain in her heart of hearts
all for a shadow
consort not even a king
her son was the substance
something new to hope for not like the past she wanted back waiting
it never comes
one must go first alone under the ground and lie no more in her warm bed
how are you simon
ned lambert said softly clasping hands
havent seen you for a month of sundays
never better
how are all in corks own town
i was down there for the cork park races on easter monday ned lambert said
same old six and eightpence
stopped with dick tivy
and how is dick the solid man
nothing between himself and heaven ned lambert answered
by the holy paul
mr dedalus said in subdued wonder
dick tivy bald
martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters ned lambert said pointing ahead
a few bob a skull
just to keep them going till the insurance is cleared up
yes yes mr dedalus said dubiously
is that the eldest boy in front
yes ned lambert said with the wifes brother
john henry menton is behind
he put down his name for a quid
ill engage he did mr dedalus said
i often told poor paddy he ought to mind that job
john henry is not the worst in the world
how did he lose it
ned lambert asked
liquor what
many a good mans fault mr dedalus said with a sigh
they halted about the door of the mortuary chapel
mr bloom stood behind the boy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair and at the slender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar
poor boy
was he there when the father
both unconscious
lighten up at the last moment and recognise for the last time
all he might have done
i owe three shillings to ogrady
would he understand
the mutes bore the coffin into the chapel
which end is his head
after a moment he followed the others in blinking in the screened light
the coffin lay on its bier before the chancel four tall yellow candles at its corners
always in front of us
corny kelleher laying a wreath at each fore corner beckoned to the boy to kneel
the mourners knelt here and there in prayingdesks
mr bloom stood behind near the font and when all had knelt dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper from his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it
he fitted his black hat gently on his left knee and holding its brim bent over piously
a server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out through a door
the whitesmocked priest came after him tidying his stole with one hand balancing with the other a little book against his toads belly
wholl read the book
i said the rook
they halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book with a fluent croak
father coffey
i knew his name was like a coffin
dominenamine bully about the muzzle he looks
bosses the show
muscular christian
woe betide anyone that looks crooked at him priest
thou art peter
burst sideways like a sheep in clover dedalus says he will
with a belly on him like a poisoned pup
most amusing expressions that man finds
hhhn burst sideways
non intres in judicium cum servo tuo domine  makes them feel more important to be prayed over in latin
requiem mass
crape weepers
blackedged notepaper
your name on the altarlist
chilly place this
want to feed well sitting in there all the morning in the gloom kicking his heels waiting for the next please
eyes of a toad too
what swells him up that way
molly gets swelled after cabbage
air of the place maybe
looks full up of bad gas
must be an infernal lot of bad gas round the place
butchers for instance they get like raw beefsteaks
who was telling me
mervyn browne
down in the vaults of saint werburghs lovely old organ hundred and fifty they have to bore a hole in the coffins sometimes to let out the bad gas and burn it
out it rushes blue
one whiff of that and youre a goner
my kneecap is hurting me
ow
thats better
the priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boys bucket and shook it over the coffin
then he walked to the other end and shook it again
then he came back and put it back in the bucket
as you were before you rested
its all written down he has to do it
et ne nos inducas in tentationem  the server piped the answers in the treble
i often thought it would be better to have boy servants
up to fifteen or so
after that of course   holy water that was i expect
shaking sleep out of it
he must be fed up with that job shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up
what harm if he could see what he was shaking it over
every mortal day a fresh batch middleaged men old women children women dead in childbirth men with beards baldheaded businessmen consumptive girls with little sparrows breasts
all the year round he prayed the same thing over them all and shook water on top of them sleep
on dignam now
in paradisum  said he was going to paradise or is in paradise
says that over everybody
tiresome kind of a job
but he has to say something
the priest closed his book and went off followed by the server
corny kelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in hoisted the coffin again carried it out and shoved it on their cart
corny kelleher gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brotherinlaw
all followed them out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air
mr bloom came last folding his paper again into his pocket
he gazed gravely at the ground till the coffincart wheeled off to the left
the metal wheels ground the gravel with a sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt boots followed the trundled barrow along a lane of sepulchres
the ree the ra the ree the ra the roo
lord i mustnt lilt here
the oconnell circle mr dedalus said about him
mr powers soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone
hes at rest he said in the middle of his people old dan o
but his heart is buried in rome
how many broken hearts are buried here simon
her grave is over there jack mr dedalus said
ill soon be stretched beside her
let him take me whenever he likes
breaking down he began to weep to himself quietly stumbling a little in his walk
mr power took his arm
shes better where she is he said kindly
i suppose so mr dedalus said with a weak gasp
i suppose she is in heaven if there is a heaven
corny kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to plod by
sad occasions mr kernan began politely
mr bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head
the others are putting on their hats mr kernan said
i suppose we can do so too
we are the last
this cemetery is a treacherous place
they covered their heads
the reverend gentleman read the service too quickly dont you think
mr kernan said with reproof
mr bloom nodded gravely looking in the quick bloodshot eyes
secret eyes secretsearching
mason i think not sure
beside him again
we are the last
in the same boat
hope hell say something else
mr kernan added  the service of the irish church used in mount jerome is simpler more impressive i must say
mr bloom gave prudent assent
the language of course was another thing
mr kernan said with solemnity  i am the resurrection and the life
that touches a mans inmost heart
it does mr bloom said
your heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by two with his toes to the daisies
no touching that
seat of the affections
broken heart
a pump after all pumping thousands of gallons of blood every day
one fine day it gets bunged up and there you are
lots of them lying around here lungs hearts livers
old rusty pumps damn the thing else
the resurrection and the life
once you are dead you are dead
that last day idea
knocking them all up out of their graves
come forth lazarus
and he came fifth and lost the job
get up
last day
then every fellow mousing around for his liver and his lights and the rest of his traps
find damn all of himself that morning
pennyweight of powder in a skull
twelve grammes one pennyweight
troy measure
corny kelleher fell into step at their side
everything went off a he said
what
he looked on them from his drawling eye
policemans shoulders
with your tooraloom tooraloom
as it should be mr kernan said
what
eh
corny kelleher said
mr kernan assured him
who is that chap behind with tom kernan
john henry menton asked
i know his face
ned lambert glanced back
bloom he said madame marion tweedy that was is i mean the soprano
shes his wife
o to be sure john henry menton said
i havent seen her for some time
she was a finelooking woman
i danced with her wait fifteen seventeen golden years ago at mat dillons in roundtown
and a good armful she was
he looked behind through the others
what is he
he asked
what does he do
wasnt he in the stationery line
i fell foul of him one evening i remember at bowls
ned lambert smiled
yes he was he said in wisdom helys
a traveller for blottingpaper
in gods name john henry menton said what did she marry a coon like that for
she had plenty of game in her then
has still ned lambert said
he does some canvassing for ads
john henry mentons large eyes stared ahead
the barrow turned into a side lane
a portly man ambushed among the grasses raised his hat in homage
the gravediggers touched their caps
john oconnell mr power said pleased
he never forgets a friend
mr oconnell shook all their hands in silence
mr dedalus said  i am come to pay you another visit
my dear simon the caretaker answered in a low voice
i dont want your custom at all
saluting ned lambert and john henry menton he walked on at martin cunninghams side puzzling two long keys at his back
did you hear that one he asked them about mulcahy from the coombe
i did not martin cunningham said
they bent their silk hats in concert and hynes inclined his ear
the caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles
they tell the story he said that two drunks came out here one foggy evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs
they asked for mulcahy from the coombe and were told where he was buried
after traipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough
one of the drunks spelt out the name terence mulcahy
the other drunk was blinking up at a statue of our saviour the widow had got put up
the caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed
he resumed  and after blinking up at the sacred figure not a bloody bit like the man says he
thats not mulcahy says he whoever done it
rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with corny kelleher accepting the dockets given him turning them over and scanning them as he walked
thats all done with a purpose martin cunningham explained to hynes
i know hynes said
i know that
to cheer a fellow up martin cunningham said
its pure goodheartedness damn the thing else
mr bloom admired the caretakers prosperous bulk
all want to be on good terms with him
decent fellow john oconnell real good sort
keys like keyess ad no fear of anyone getting out
no passout checks
habeas corpus
i must see about that ad after the funeral
did i write ballsbridge on the envelope i took to cover when she disturbed me writing to martha
hope its not chucked in the dead letter office
be the better of a shave
grey sprouting beard
thats the first sign when the hairs come out grey
and temper getting cross
silver threads among the grey
fancy being his wife
wonder he had the gumption to propose to any girl
come out and live in the graveyard
dangle that before her
it might thrill her first
courting death
shades of night hovering here with all the dead stretched about
the shadows of the tombs when churchyards yawn and daniel oconnell must be a descendant i suppose who is this used to say he was a queer breedy man great catholic all the same like a big giant in the dark
will o the wisp
gas of graves
want to keep her mind off it to conceive at all
women especially are so touchy
tell her a ghost story in bed to make her sleep
have you ever seen a ghost
well i have
it was a pitchdark night
the clock was on the stroke of twelve
still theyd kiss all right if properly keyed up
whores in turkish graveyards
learn anything if taken young
you might pick up a young widow here
men like that
love among the tombstones
romeo
spice of pleasure
in the midst of death we are in life
both ends meet
tantalising for the poor dead
smell of grilled beefsteaks to the starving
gnawing their vitals
desire to grig people
molly wanting to do it at the window
eight children he has anyway
he has seen a fair share go under in his time lying around him field after field
holy fields
more room if they buried them standing
sitting or kneeling you couldnt
standing
his head might come up some day above ground in a landslip with his hand pointing
all honeycombed the ground must be oblong cells
and very neat he keeps it too trim grass and edgings
his garden major gamble calls mount jerome
well so it is
ought to be flowers of sleep
chinese cemeteries with giant poppies growing produce the best opium mastiansky told me
the botanic gardens are just over there
its the blood sinking in the earth gives new life
same idea those jews they said killed the christian boy
every man his price
well preserved fat corpse gentleman epicure invaluable for fruit garden
a bargain
by carcass of william wilkinson auditor and accountant lately deceased three pounds thirteen and six
with thanks
i daresay the soil would be quite fat with corpsemanure bones flesh nails
charnelhouses
dreadful
turning green and pink decomposing
rot quick in damp earth
the lean old ones tougher
then a kind of a tallowy kind of a cheesy
then begin to get black black treacle oozing out of them
then dried up
deathmoths
of course the cells or whatever they are go on living
changing about
live for ever practically
nothing to feed on feed on themselves
but they must breed a devil of a lot of maggots
soil must be simply swirling with them
your head it simply swurls
those pretty little seaside gurls
he looks cheerful enough over it
gives him a sense of power seeing all the others go under first
wonder how he looks at life
cracking his jokes too warms the cockles of his heart
the one about the bulletin
spurgeon went to heaven  am this morning
 pm closing time
not arrived yet
peter
the dead themselves the men anyhow would like to hear an odd joke or the women to know whats in fashion
a juicy pear or ladies punch hot strong and sweet
keep out the damp
you must laugh sometimes so better do it that way
gravediggers in hamlet
shows the profound knowledge of the human heart
darent joke about the dead for two years at least
de mortuis nil nisi prius
go out of mourning first
hard to imagine his funeral
seems a sort of a joke
read your own obituary notice they say you live longer
gives you second wind
new lease of life
how many have you for tomorrow
the caretaker asked
two corny kelleher said
half ten and eleven
the caretaker put the papers in his pocket
the barrow had ceased to trundle
the mourners split and moved to each side of the hole stepping with care round the graves
the gravediggers bore the coffin and set its nose on the brink looping the bands round it
burying him
we come to bury csar
his ides of march or june
he doesnt know who is here nor care
now who is that lankylooking galoot over there in the macintosh
now who is he id like to know
now id give a trifle to know who he is
always someone turns up you never dreamt of
a fellow could live on his lonesome all his life
yes he could
still hed have to get someone to sod him after he died though he could dig his own grave
we all do
only man buries
no ants too
first thing strikes anybody
bury the dead
say robinson crusoe was true to life
well then friday buried him
every friday buries a thursday if you come to look at it
o poor robinson crusoe
how could you possibly do so
poor dignam
his last lie on the earth in his box
when you think of them all it does seem a waste of wood
all gnawed through
they could invent a handsome bier with a kind of panel sliding let it down that way
ay but they might object to be buried out of another fellows
theyre so particular
lay me in my native earth
bit of clay from the holy land
only a mother and deadborn child ever buried in the one coffin
i see what it means
i see
to protect him as long as possible even in the earth
the irishmans house is his coffin
embalming in catacombs mummies the same idea
mr bloom stood far back his hat in his hand counting the bared heads
twelve
im thirteen
no
the chap in the macintosh is thirteen
deaths number
where the deuce did he pop out of
he wasnt in the chapel that ill swear
silly superstition that about thirteen
nice soft tweed ned lambert has in that suit
tinge of purple
i had one like that when we lived in lombard street west
dressy fellow he was once
used to change three suits in the day
must get that grey suit of mine turned by mesias
hello
its dyed
his wife i forgot hes not married or his landlady ought to have picked out those threads for him
the coffin dived out of sight eased down by the men straddled on the gravetrestles
they struggled up and out and all uncovered
twenty
pause
if we were all suddenly somebody else
far away a donkey brayed
rain
no such ass
never see a dead one they say
shame of death
they hide
also poor papa went away
gentle sweet air blew round the bared heads in a whisper
whisper
the boy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietly in the black open space
mr bloom moved behind the portly kindly caretaker
wellcut frockcoat
weighing them up perhaps to see which will go next
well it is a long rest
feel no more
its the moment you feel
must be damned unpleasant
cant believe it at first
mistake must be someone else
try the house opposite
wait i wanted to
i havent yet
then darkened deathchamber
light they want
whispering around you
would you like to see a priest
then rambling and wandering
delirium all you hid all your life
the death struggle
his sleep is not natural
press his lower eyelid
watching is his nose pointed is his jaw sinking are the soles of his feet yellow
pull the pillow away and finish it off on the floor since hes doomed
devil in that picture of sinners death showing him a woman
dying to embrace her in his shirt
last act of lucia
shall i nevermore behold thee
bam
he expires
gone at last
people talk about you a bit forget you
dont forget to pray for him
remember him in your prayers
even parnell
ivy day dying out
then they follow dropping into a hole one after the other
we are praying now for the repose of his soul
hoping youre well and not in hell
nice change of air
out of the fryingpan of life into the fire of purgatory
does he ever think of the hole waiting for himself
they say you do when you shiver in the sun
someone walking over it
callboys warning
near you
mine over there towards finglas the plot i bought
mamma poor mamma and little rudy
the gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay in on the coffin
mr bloom turned away his face
and if he was alive all the time
whew
by jingo that would be awful
no no he is dead of course
of course he is dead
monday he died
they ought to have some law to pierce the heart and make sure or an electric clock or a telephone in the coffin and some kind of a canvas airhole
flag of distress
three days
rather long to keep them in summer
just as well to get shut of them as soon as you are sure theres no
the clay fell softer
begin to be forgotten
out of sight out of mind
the caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat
had enough of it
the mourners took heart of grace one by one covering themselves without show
mr bloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make its way deftly through the maze of graves
quietly sure of his ground he traversed the dismal fields
hynes jotting down something in his notebook
ah the names
but he knows them all
no coming to me
i am just taking the names hynes said below his breath
what is your christian name
im not sure
l mr bloom said
leopold
and you might put down mcoys name too
he asked me to
charley hynes said writing
i know
he was on the freeman once
so he was before he got the job in the morgue under louis byrne
good idea a postmortem for doctors
find out what they imagine they know
he died of a tuesday
got the run
levanted with the cash of a few ads
charley youre my darling
that was why he asked me to
o well does no harm
i saw to that mcoy
thanks old chap much obliged
leave him under an obligation costs nothing
and tell us hynes said do you know that fellow in the fellow was over there in the
he looked around
macintosh
yes i saw him mr bloom said
where is he now
mintosh hynes said scribbling
i dont know who he is
is that his name
he moved away looking about him
no mr bloom began turning and stopping
i say hynes
didnt hear
what
where has he disappeared to
not a sign
well of all the
has anybody here seen
kay ee double ell
become invisible
good lord what became of him
a seventh gravedigger came beside mr bloom to take up an idle spade
o excuse me
he stepped aside nimbly
clay brown damp began to be seen in the hole
it rose
nearly over
a mound of damp clods rose more rose and the gravediggers rested their spades
all uncovered again for a few instants
the boy propped his wreath against a corner the brotherinlaw his on a lump
the gravediggers put on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards the barrow
then knocked the blades lightly on the turf clean
one bent to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass
one leaving his mates walked slowly on with shouldered weapon its blade blueglancing
silently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband
his navelcord
the brotherinlaw turning away placed something in his free hand
thanks in silence
sorry sir trouble
headshake
i know that
for yourselves just
the mourners moved away slowly without aim by devious paths staying at whiles to read a name on a tomb
let us go round by the chiefs grave hynes said
we have time
let us mr power said
they turned to the right following their slow thoughts
with awe mr powers blank voice spoke  some say he is not in that grave at all
that the coffin was filled with stones
that one day he will come again
hynes shook his head
parnell will never come again he said
hes there all that was mortal of him
peace to his ashes
mr bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels crosses broken pillars family vaults stone hopes praying with upcast eyes old irelands hearts and hands
more sensible to spend the money on some charity for the living
pray for the repose of the soul of
does anybody really
plant him and have done with him
like down a coalshoot
then lump them together to save time
all souls day
twentyseventh ill be at his grave
ten shillings for the gardener
he keeps it free of weeds
old man himself
bent down double with his shears clipping
near deaths door
who passed away
who departed this life
as if they did it of their own accord
got the shove all of them
who kicked the bucket
more interesting if they told you what they were
so and so wheelwright
i travelled for cork lino
i paid five shillings in the pound
or a womans with her saucepan
i cooked good irish stew
eulogy in a country churchyard it ought to be that poem of whose is it wordsworth or thomas campbell
entered into rest the protestants put it
old dr murrens
the great physician called him home
well its gods acre for them
nice country residence
newly plastered and painted
ideal spot to have a quiet smoke and read the church times marriage ads they never try to beautify
rusty wreaths hung on knobs garlands of bronzefoil
better value that for the money
still the flowers are more poetical
the other gets rather tiresome never withering
expresses nothing
immortelles
a bird sat tamely perched on a poplar branch
like stuffed
like the wedding present alderman hooper gave us
hoo
not a budge out of him
knows there are no catapults to let fly at him
dead animal even sadder
sillymilly burying the little dead bird in the kitchen matchbox a daisychain and bits of broken chainies on the grave
the sacred heart that is showing it
heart on his sleeve
ought to be sideways and red it should be painted like a real heart
ireland was dedicated to it or whatever that
seems anything but pleased
why this infliction
would birds come then and peck like the boy with the basket of fruit but he said no because they ought to have been afraid of the boy
apollo that was
how many
all these here once walked round dublin
faithful departed
as you are now so once were we
besides how could you remember everybody
eyes walk voice
well the voice yes gramophone
have a gramophone in every grave or keep it in the house
after dinner on a sunday
put on poor old greatgrandfather
kraahraark
hellohellohello amawfullyglad kraark awfullygladaseeagain hellohello amawf krpthsth
remind you of the voice like the photograph reminds you of the face
otherwise you couldnt remember the face after fifteen years say
for instance who
for instance some fellow that died when i was in wisdom helys
rtststr
a rattle of pebbles
wait
stop
he looked down intently into a stone crypt
some animal
wait
there he goes
an obese grey rat toddled along the side of the crypt moving the pebbles
an old stager greatgrandfather he knows the ropes
the grey alive crushed itself in under the plinth wriggled itself in under it
good hidingplace for treasure
who lives there
are laid the remains of robert emery
robert emmet was buried here by torchlight wasnt he
making his rounds
tail gone now
one of those chaps would make short work of a fellow
pick the bones clean no matter who it was
ordinary meat for them
a corpse is meat gone bad
well and whats cheese
corpse of milk
i read in that voyages in china that the chinese say a white man smells like a corpse
cremation better
priests dead against it
devilling for the other firm
wholesale burners and dutch oven dealers
time of the plague
quicklime feverpits to eat them
lethal chamber
ashes to ashes
or bury at sea
where is that parsee tower of silence
eaten by birds
earth fire water
drowning they say is the pleasantest
see your whole life in a flash
but being brought back to life no
cant bury in the air however
out of a flying machine
wonder does the news go about whenever a fresh one is let down
underground communication
we learned that from them
wouldnt be surprised
regular square feed for them
flies come before hes well dead
got wind of dignam
they wouldnt care about the smell of it
saltwhite crumbling mush of corpse smell taste like raw white turnips
the gates glimmered in front still open
back to the world again
enough of this place
brings you a bit nearer every time
last time i was here was mrs sinicos funeral
poor papa too
the love that kills
and even scraping up the earth at night with a lantern like that case i read of to get at fresh buried females or even putrefied with running gravesores
give you the creeps after a bit
i will appear to you after death
you will see my ghost after death
my ghost will haunt you after death
there is another world after death named hell
i do not like that other world she wrote
no more do i
plenty to see and hear and feel yet
feel live warm beings near you
let them sleep in their maggoty beds
they are not going to get me this innings
warm beds warm fullblooded life
martin cunningham emerged from a sidepath talking gravely
solicitor i think
i know his face
menton john henry solicitor commissioner for oaths and affidavits
dignam used to be in his office
mat dillons long ago
jolly mat
convivial evenings
cold fowl cigars the tantalus glasses
heart of gold really
yes menton
got his rag out that evening on the bowlinggreen because i sailed inside him
pure fluke of mine the bias
why he took such a rooted dislike to me
hate at first sight
molly and floey dillon linked under the lilactree laughing
fellow always like that mortified if women are by
got a dinge in the side of his hat
carriage probably
excuse me sir mr bloom said beside them
they stopped
your hat is a little crushed mr bloom said pointing
john henry menton stared at him for an instant without moving
there martin cunningham helped pointing also
john henry menton took off his hat bulged out the dinge and smoothed the nap with care on his coatsleeve
he clapped the hat on his head again
its all right now martin cunningham said
john henry menton jerked his head down in acknowledgment
thank you he said shortly
they walked on towards the gates
mr bloom chapfallen drew behind a few paces so as not to overhear
martin laying down the law
martin could wind a sappyhead like that round his little finger without his seeing it
oyster eyes
never mind
be sorry after perhaps when it dawns on him
get the pull over him that way
thank you

there it is red murray said
alexander keyes
just cut it out will you
mr bloom said and ill take it round to the telegraph office
the door of ruttledges office creaked again
davy stephens minute in a large capecoat a small felt hat crowning his ringlets passed out with a roll of papers under his cape a kings courier
red murrays long shears sliced out the advertisement from the newspaper in four clean strokes
scissors and paste
ill go through the printingworks mr bloom said taking the cut square
of course if he wants a par red murray said earnestly a pen behind his ear we can do him one
right mr bloom said with a nod
ill rub that in
we
william brayden esquire of oaklands sandymount   red murray touched mr blooms arm with the shears and whispered  brayden
mr bloom turned and saw the liveried porter raise his lettered cap as a stately figure entered between the newsboards of the weekly freeman and national press and the freemans journal and national press
dullthudding guinnesss barrels
it passed statelily up the staircase steered by an umbrella a solemn beardframed face
the broadcloth back ascended each step back
all his brains are in the nape of his neck simon dedalus says
welts of flesh behind on him
fat folds of neck fat neck fat neck
dont you think his face is like our saviour
red murray whispered
the door of ruttledges office whispered ee cree
they always build one door opposite another for the wind to

our saviour beardframed oval face talking in the dusk
mary martha
steered by an umbrella sword to the footlights mario the tenor
or like mario mr bloom said
yes red murray agreed
but mario was said to be the picture of our saviour
jesusmario with rougy cheeks doublet and spindle legs
hand on his heart
in martha       coome thou lost one      coome thou dear one
the crozier and the pen   his grace phoned down twice this morning red murray said gravely
they watched the knees legs boots vanish
neck
a telegram boy stepped in nimbly threw an envelope on the counter and stepped off posthaste with a word  freeman  mr bloom said slowly  well he is one of our saviours also
a meek smile accompanied him as he lifted the counterflap as he passed in through a sidedoor and along the warm dark stairs and passage along the now reverberating boards
but will he save the circulation
thumping
thumping
he pushed in the glass swingdoor and entered stepping over strewn packing paper
through a lane of clanking drums he made his way towards nannettis reading closet
with unfeigned regret it is we announce the dissolution of a most respected dublin burgess   hynes here too account of the funeral probably
thumping
thump
this morning the remains of the late mr patrick dignam
machines
smash a man to atoms if they got him caught
rule the world today
his machineries are pegging away too
like these got out of hand fermenting
working away tearing away
and that old grey rat tearing to get in
how a great daily organ is turned out   mr bloom halted behind the foremans spare body admiring a glossy crown
strange he never saw his real country
ireland my country
member for college green
he boomed that workaday worker tack for all it was worth
its the ads and side features sell a weekly not the stale news in the official gazette

monkeydoodle the whole thing
want a cool head
well get it into the evening edition councillor hynes said
soon be calling him my lord mayor
long john is backing him they say
the foreman without answering scribbled press on a corner of the sheet and made a sign to a typesetter
he handed the sheet silently over the dirty glass screen
right thanks hynes said moving off
mr bloom stood in his way
if you want to draw the cashier is just going to lunch he said pointing backward with his thumb
did you
hynes asked
mm mr bloom said
look sharp and youll catch him
thanks old man hynes said
ill tap him too
he hurried on eagerly towards the freemans journal
three bob i lent him in meaghers
three weeks
third hint
we see the canvasser at work   mr bloom laid his cutting on mr nannettis desk
excuse me councillor he said
this ad you see
keyes you remember
mr nannetti considered the cutting awhile and nodded
he wants it in for july mr bloom said
the foreman moved his pencil towards it
but wait mr bloom said
he wants it changed
keyes you see
he wants two keys at the top
hell of a racket they make
he doesnt hear it
nannan
iron nerves
maybe he understands what i
the foreman turned round to hear patiently and lifting an elbow began to scratch slowly in the armpit of his alpaca jacket
like that mr bloom said crossing his forefingers at the top
let him take that in first
mr bloom glancing sideways up from the cross he had made saw the foremans sallow face think he has a touch of jaundice and beyond the obedient reels feeding in huge webs of paper
clank it
clank it
miles of it unreeled
what becomes of it after
o wrap up meat parcels various uses thousand and one things
slipping his words deftly into the pauses of the clanking he drew swiftly on the scarred woodwork
house of keyes   like that see
two crossed keys here
a circle
then here the name
alexander keyes tea wine and spirit merchant
so on
better not teach him his own business
you know yourself councillor just what he wants
then round the top in leaded the house of keys
you see
do you think thats a good idea
the foreman moved his scratching hand to his lower ribs and scratched there quietly
the idea mr bloom said is the house of keys
you know councillor the manx parliament
innuendo of home rule
tourists you know from the isle of man
catches the eye you see
can you do that
i could ask him perhaps about how to pronounce that voglio but then if he didnt know only make it awkward for him
better not
we can do that the foreman said
have you the design
i can get it mr bloom said
it was in a kilkenny paper
he has a house there too
ill just run out and ask him
well you can do that and just a little par calling attention
you know the usual
highclass licensed premises
longfelt want
so on
the foreman thought for an instant
we can do that he said
let him give us a three months renewal
a typesetter brought him a limp galleypage
he began to check it silently
mr bloom stood by hearing the loud throbs of cranks watching the silent typesetters at their cases
orthographical   want to be sure of his spelling
proof fever
martin cunningham forgot to give us his spellingbee conundrum this morning
it is amusing to view the unpar one ar alleled embarra two ars is it
double ess ment of a harassed pedlar while gauging au the symmetry with a y of a peeled pear under a cemetery wall
silly isnt it
cemetery put in of course on account of the symmetry
i should have said when he clapped on his topper
thank you
i ought to have said something about an old hat or something
no
i could have said

see his phiz then
sllt
the nethermost deck of the first machine jogged forward its flyboard with sllt the first batch of quirefolded papers
sllt
almost human the way it sllt to call attention
doing its level best to speak

everything speaks in its own way
sllt
noted churchman an occasional contributor   the foreman handed back the galleypage suddenly saying  wait
wheres the archbishops letter
its to be repeated in the telegraph wheres whats his name
he looked about him round his loud unanswering machines
monks sir
a voice asked from the castingbox
ay
wheres monks
monks
mr bloom took up his cutting

tourists over for the show
a dayfather   he walked on through the caseroom passing an old man bowed spectacled aproned
old monks the dayfather
queer lot of stuff he must have put through his hands in his time obituary notices pubs ads speeches divorce suits found drowned
nearing the end of his tether now
sober serious man with a bit in the savingsbank id say
wife a good cook and washer
daughter working the machine in the parlour
plain jane no damn nonsense
and it was the feast of the passover   he stayed in his walk to watch a typesetter neatly distributing type
reads it backwards first
quickly he does it
must require some practice that
mangid kcirtap
poor papa with his hagadah book reading backwards with his finger to me
pessach
next year in jerusalem
dear o dear
all that long business about that brought us out of the land of egypt and into the house of bondage alleluia
shema israel adonai elohenu
no thats the other
then the twelve brothers jacobs sons
and then the lamb and the cat and the dog and the stick and the water and the butcher
and then the angel of death kills the butcher and he kills the ox and the dog kills the cat
sounds a bit silly till you come to look into it well
justice it means but its everybody eating everyone else
thats what life is after all
how quickly he does that job
practice makes perfect
seems to see with his fingers
mr bloom passed on out of the clanking noises through the gallery on to the landing
now am i going to tram it out all the way and then catch him out perhaps
better phone him up first
number
yes
same as citrons house
twentyeight
twentyeight double four
only once more that soap   he went down the house staircase
who the deuce scrawled all over those walls with matches
looks as if they did it for a bet
heavy greasy smell there always is in those works
lukewarm glue in thoms next door when i was there
he took out his handkerchief to dab his nose
citronlemon
ah the soap i put there
lose it out of that pocket
putting back his handkerchief he took out the soap and stowed it away buttoned into the hip pocket of his trousers
what perfume does your wife use
i could go home still tram something i forgot
just to see before dressing
no
here
no
a sudden screech of laughter came from the evening telegraph office
know who that is
whats up
pop in a minute to phone
ned lambert it is
he entered softly
erin green gem of the silver sea   the ghost walks professor machugh murmured softly biscuitfully to the dusty windowpane
mr dedalus staring from the empty fireplace at ned lamberts quizzing face asked of it sourly  agonising christ wouldnt it give you a heartburn on your arse
ned lambert seated on the table read on  or again note the meanderings of some purling rill as it babbles on its way tho quarrelling with the stony obstacles to the tumbling waters of neptunes blue domain mid mossy banks fanned by gentlest zephyrs played on by the glorious sunlight or neath the shadows cast oer its pensive bosom by the overarching leafage of the giants of the forest
what about that simon
he asked over the fringe of his newspaper
hows that for high
changing his drink mr dedalus said
ned lambert laughing struck the newspaper on his knees repeating  the pensive bosom and the overarsing leafage
o boys
o boys
and xenophon looked upon marathon mr dedalus said looking again on the fireplace and to the window and marathon looked on the sea
that will do professor machugh cried from the window
i dont want to hear any more of the stuff
he ate off the crescent of water biscuit he had been nibbling and hungered made ready to nibble the biscuit in his other hand
high falutin stuff
bladderbags
ned lambert is taking a day off i see
rather upsets a mans day a funeral does
he has influence they say
old chatterton the vicechancellor is his granduncle or his greatgranduncle
close on ninety they say
subleader for his death written this long time perhaps
living to spite them
might go first himself
johnny make room for your uncle
the right honourable hedges eyre chatterton
daresay he writes him an odd shaky cheque or two on gale days
windfall when he kicks out
alleluia
just another spasm ned lambert said
what is it
mr bloom asked
a recently discovered fragment of cicero professor machugh answered with pomp of tone
our lovely land
short but to the point   whose land
mr bloom said simply
most pertinent question the professor said between his chews
with an accent on the whose
dan dawsons land mr dedalus said
is it his speech last night
mr bloom asked
ned lambert nodded
but listen to this he said
the doorknob hit mr bloom in the small of the back as the door was pushed in
excuse me j j omolloy said entering
mr bloom moved nimbly aside
i beg yours he said
good day jack
come in
come in
good day
how are you dedalus
well
and yourself
j j omolloy shook his head
sad   cleverest fellow at the junior bar he used to be
decline poor chap
that hectic flush spells finis for a man
touch and go with him
whats in the wind i wonder
money worry
or again if we but climb the serried mountain peaks  youre looking extra
is the editor to be seen
j j omolloy asked looking towards the inner door
very much so professor machugh said
to be seen and heard
hes in his sanctum with lenehan
j j omolloy strolled to the sloping desk and began to turn back the pink pages of the file
practice dwindling
a mighthavebeen
losing heart
gambling
debts of honour
reaping the whirlwind
used to get good retainers from d and t fitzgerald
their wigs to show the grey matter
brains on their sleeve like the statue in glasnevin
believe he does some literary work for the express with gabriel conroy
wellread fellow
myles crawford began on the independent funny the way those newspaper men veer about when they get wind of a new opening
weathercocks
hot and cold in the same breath
wouldnt know which to believe
one story good till you hear the next
go for one another baldheaded in the papers and then all blows over
hail fellow well met the next moment
ah listen to this for god sake ned lambert pleaded
or again if we but climb the serried mountain peaks  bombast
the professor broke in testily
enough of the inflated windbag
peaks ned lambert went on towering high on high to bathe our souls as it were  bathe his lips mr dedalus said
blessed and eternal god
yes
is he taking anything for it
as twere in the peerless panorama of irelands portfolio unmatched despite their wellpraised prototypes in other vaunted prize regions for very beauty of bosky grove and undulating plain and luscious pastureland of vernal green steeped in the transcendent translucent glow of our mild mysterious irish twilight  his native doric   the moon professor machugh said
he forgot hamlet
that mantles the vista far and wide and wait till the glowing orb of the moon shine forth to irradiate her silver effulgence  o
mr dedalus cried giving vent to a hopeless groan
shite and onions
thatll do ned
life is too short
he took off his silk hat and blowing out impatiently his bushy moustache welshcombed his hair with raking fingers
ned lambert tossed the newspaper aside chuckling with delight
an instant after a hoarse bark of laughter burst over professor machughs unshaven blackspectacled face
doughy daw
he cried
what wetherup said   all very fine to jeer at it now in cold print but it goes down like hot cake that stuff
he was in the bakery line too wasnt he
why they call him doughy daw
feathered his nest well anyhow
daughter engaged to that chap in the inland revenue office with the motor
hooked that nicely
entertainments
open house
big blowout
wetherup always said that
get a grip of them by the stomach
the inner door was opened violently and a scarlet beaked face crested by a comb of feathery hair thrust itself in
the bold blue eyes stared about them and the harsh voice asked  what is it
and here comes the sham squire himself
professor machugh said grandly
getonouthat you bloody old pedagogue
the editor said in recognition
come ned mr dedalus said putting on his hat
i must get a drink after that
drink
the editor cried
no drinks served before mass
quite right too mr dedalus said going out
come on ned
ned lambert sidled down from the table
the editors blue eyes roved towards mr blooms face shadowed by a smile
will you join us myles
ned lambert asked
memorable battles recalled   north cork militia
the editor cried striding to the mantelpiece
we won every time
north cork and spanish officers
where was that myles
ned lambert asked with a reflective glance at his toecaps
in ohio
the editor shouted
so it was begad ned lambert agreed
passing out he whispered to j j omolloy  incipient jigs
sad case
ohio
the editor crowed in high treble from his uplifted scarlet face
my ohio
a perfect cretic
the professor said
long short and long
o harp eolian
he took a reel of dental floss from his waistcoat pocket and breaking off a piece twanged it smartly between two and two of his resonant unwashed teeth
bingbang bangbang
mr bloom seeing the coast clear made for the inner door
just a moment mr crawford he said
i just want to phone about an ad
he went in
what about that leader this evening
professor machugh asked coming to the editor and laying a firm hand on his shoulder
thatll be all right myles crawford said more calmly
never you fret
hello jack
thats all right
good day myles j j omolloy said letting the pages he held slip limply back on the file
is that canada swindle case on today
the telephone whirred inside
twentyeight no twenty
double four
yes
spot the winner   lenehan came out of the inner office with sports tissues
who wants a dead cert for the gold cup
he asked
sceptre with o madden up
he tossed the tissues on to the table
screams of newsboys barefoot in the hall rushed near and the door was flung open
hush lenehan said
i hear feetstoops
professor machugh strode across the room and seized the cringing urchin by the collar as the others scampered out of the hall and down the steps
the tissues rustled up in the draught floated softly in the air blue scrawls and under the table came to earth
it wasnt me sir
it was the big fellow shoved me sir
throw him out and shut the door the editor said
theres a hurricane blowing
lenehan began to paw the tissues up from the floor grunting as he stooped twice
waiting for the racing special sir the newsboy said
it was pat farrell shoved me sir
he pointed to two faces peering in round the doorframe
him sir
out of this with you professor machugh said gruffly
he hustled the boy out and banged the door to
j j omolloy turned the files crackingly over murmuring seeking  continued on page six column four
yes evening telegraph here mr bloom phoned from the inner office
is the boss
yes telegraph to where
aha
which auction rooms
aha
i see
right
ill catch him
a collision ensues   the bell whirred again as he rang off
he came in quickly and bumped against lenehan who was struggling up with the second tissue
pardon monsieur lenehan said clutching him for an instant and making a grimace
my fault mr bloom said suffering his grip
are you hurt
im in a hurry
knee lenehan said
he made a comic face and whined rubbing his knee  the accumulation of the anno domini
sorry mr bloom said
he went to the door and holding it ajar paused
j j omolloy slapped the heavy pages over
the noise of two shrill voices a mouthorgan echoed in the bare hallway from the newsboys squatted on the doorsteps       we are the boys of wexford      who fought with heart and hand
exit bloom   im just running round to bachelors walk mr bloom said about this ad of keyess
want to fix it up
they tell me hes round there in dillons
he looked indecisively for a moment at their faces
the editor who leaning against the mantelshelf had propped his head on his hand suddenly stretched forth an arm amply
begone
he said
the world is before you
back in no time mr bloom said hurrying out
j j omolloy took the tissues from lenehans hand and read them blowing them apart gently without comment
hell get that advertisement the professor said staring through his blackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind
look at the young scamps after him
show
where
lenehan cried running to the window
a street cortge   both smiled over the crossblind at the file of capering newsboys in mr blooms wake the last zigzagging white on the breeze a mocking kite a tail of white bowknots
look at the young guttersnipe behind him hue and cry lenehan said and youll kick
o my rib risible
taking off his flat spaugs and the walk
small nines
steal upon larks
he began to mazurka in swift caricature across the floor on sliding feet past the fireplace to j j omolloy who placed the tissues in his receiving hands
whats that
myles crawford said with a start
where are the other two gone
who
the professor said turning
theyre gone round to the oval for a drink
paddy hooper is there with jack hall
came over last night
come on then myles crawford said
wheres my hat
he walked jerkily into the office behind parting the vent of his jacket jingling his keys in his back pocket
they jingled then in the air and against the wood as he locked his desk drawer
hes pretty well on professor machugh said in a low voice
seems to be j j omolloy said taking out a cigarettecase in murmuring meditation but it is not always as it seems
who has the most matches
the calumet of peace   he offered a cigarette to the professor and took one himself
lenehan promptly struck a match for them and lit their cigarettes in turn
j j omolloy opened his case again and offered it
thanky vous lenehan said helping himself
the editor came from the inner office a straw hat awry on his brow
he declaimed in song pointing sternly at professor machugh       twas rank and fame that tempted thee      twas empire charmed thy heart
the professor grinned locking his long lips
eh
you bloody old roman empire
myles crawford said
he took a cigarette from the open case
lenehan lighting it for him with quick grace said  silence for my brandnew riddle
imperium romanum j j omolloy said gently
it sounds nobler than british or brixton
the word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire
myles crawford blew his first puff violently towards the ceiling
thats it he said
we are the fat
you and i are the fat in the fire
we havent got the chance of a snowball in hell
the grandeur that was rome   wait a moment professor machugh said raising two quiet claws
we mustnt be led away by words by sounds of words
we think of rome imperial imperious imperative
he extended elocutionary arms from frayed stained shirtcuffs pausing  what was their civilisation
vast i allow but vile
cloacae sewers
the jews in the wilderness and on the mountaintop said it is meet to be here
let us build an altar to jehovah
the roman like the englishman who follows in his footsteps brought to every new shore on which he set his foot on our shore he never set it only his cloacal obsession
he gazed about him in his toga and he said it is meet to be here
let us construct a watercloset  which they accordingly did do lenehan said
our old ancient ancestors as we read in the first chapter of guinnesss were partial to the running stream
they were natures gentlemen j j omolloy murmured
but we have also roman law
and pontius pilate is its prophet professor machugh responded
do you know that story about chief baron palles
j j omolloy asked
it was at the royal university dinner
everything was going swimmingly   first my riddle lenehan said
are you ready
mr omadden burke tall in copious grey of donegal tweed came in from the hallway
stephen dedalus behind him uncovered as he entered
entrez mes enfants lenehan cried
i escort a suppliant mr omadden burke said melodiously
youth led by experience visits notoriety
how do you do
the editor said holding out a hand
come in
your governor is just gone

lenehan said to all  silence
what opera resembles a railwayline
reflect ponder excogitate reply
stephen handed over the typed sheets pointing to the title and signature
who
the editor asked
bit torn off
mr garrett deasy stephen said
that old pelters the editor said
who tore it
was he short taken
on swift sail flaming      from storm and south      he comes pale vampire      mouth to my mouth
good day stephen the professor said coming to peer over their shoulders
foot and mouth
are you turned
bullockbefriending bard
shindy in wellknown restaurant   good day sir stephen answered blushing
the letter is not mine
mr garrett deasy asked me to  o i know him myles crawford said and i knew his wife too
the bloodiest old tartar god ever made
by jesus she had the foot and mouth disease and no mistake
the night she threw the soup in the waiters face in the star and garter
oho
a woman brought sin into the world
for helen the runaway wife of menelaus ten years the greeks
orourke prince of breffni
is he a widower
stephen asked
ay a grass one myles crawford said his eye running down the typescript
emperors horses
habsburg
an irishman saved his life on the ramparts of vienna
dont you forget
maximilian karl odonnell graf von tirconnell in ireland
sent his heir over to make the king an austrian fieldmarshal now
going to be trouble there one day
wild geese
o yes every time
dont you forget that
the moot point is did he forget it j j omolloy said quietly turning a horseshoe paperweight
saving princes is a thank you job
professor machugh turned on him
and if not
he said
ill tell you how it was myles crawford began
a hungarian it was one day  lost causes noble marquess mentioned   we were always loyal to lost causes the professor said
success for us is the death of the intellect and of the imagination
we were never loyal to the successful
we serve them
i teach the blatant latin language
i speak the tongue of a race the acme of whose mentality is the maxim time is money
material domination
dominus lord
where is the spirituality
lord jesus
lord salisbury
a sofa in a westend club
but the greek
kyrie eleison
a smile of light brightened his darkrimmed eyes lengthened his long lips
the greek
he said again
kyrios shining word
the vowels the semite and the saxon know not
kyrie the radiance of the intellect
i ought to profess greek the language of the mind
kyrie eleison the closetmaker and the cloacamaker will never be lords of our spirit
we are liege subjects of the catholic chivalry of europe that foundered at trafalgar and of the empire of the spirit not an imperium that went under with the athenian fleets at aegospotami
yes yes
they went under
pyrrhus misled by an oracle made a last attempt to retrieve the fortunes of greece
loyal to a lost cause
he strode away from them towards the window
they went forth to battle mr omadden burke said greyly but they always fell
boohoo
lenehan wept with a little noise
owing to a brick received in the latter half of the matine
poor poor poor pyrrhus
he whispered then near stephens ear  lenehans limerick   theres a ponderous pundit machugh who wears goggles of ebony hue
as he mostly sees double to wear them why trouble
i cant see the joe miller
can you   in mourning for sallust mulligan says
whose mother is beastly dead
myles crawford crammed the sheets into a sidepocket
thatll be all right he said
ill read the rest after
thatll be all right
lenehan extended his hands in protest
but my riddle
he said
what opera is like a railwayline
opera
mr omadden burkes sphinx face reriddled
lenehan announced gladly  the rose of castile
see the wheeze
rows of cast steel
gee
he poked mr omadden burke mildly in the spleen
mr omadden burke fell back with grace on his umbrella feigning a gasp
help
he sighed
i feel a strong weakness
lenehan rising to tiptoe fanned his face rapidly with the rustling tissues
the professor returning by way of the files swept his hand across stephens and mr omadden burkes loose ties
paris past and present he said
you look like communards
like fellows who had blown up the bastile j j omolloy said in quiet mockery
or was it you shot the lord lieutenant of finland between you
you look as though you had done the deed
general bobrikoff
omnium gatherum   we were only thinking about it stephen said
all the talents myles crawford said
law the classics  the turf lenehan put in
literature the press
if bloom were here the professor said
the gentle art of advertisement
and madam bloom mr omadden burke added
the vocal muse
dublins prime favourite
lenehan gave a loud cough
ahem
he said very softly
o for a fresh of breath air
i caught a cold in the park
the gate was open
you can do it   the editor laid a nervous hand on stephens shoulder
i want you to write something for me he said
something with a bite in it
you can do it
i see it in your face
in the lexicon of youth  see it in your face
see it in your eye
lazy idle little schemer
foot and mouth disease
the editor cried in scornful invective
great nationalist meeting in borrisinossory
all balls
bulldosing the public
give them something with a bite in it
put us all into it damn its soul
father son and holy ghost and jakes mcarthy
we can all supply mental pabulum mr omadden burke said
stephen raised his eyes to the bold unheeding stare
he wants you for the pressgang j j omolloy said
the great gallaher   you can do it myles crawford repeated clenching his hand in emphasis
wait a minute
well paralyse europe as ignatius gallaher used to say when he was on the shaughraun doing billiardmarking in the clarence
gallaher that was a pressman for you
that was a pen
you know how he made his mark
ill tell you
that was the smartest piece of journalism ever known
that was in eightyone sixth of may time of the invincibles murder in the phoenix park before you were born i suppose
ill show you
he pushed past them to the files
look at here he said turning
the new york world cabled for a special

professor machugh nodded

where it took place

stephen turned in surprise

he said

look at here

take page four advertisement for bransomes coffee let us say

the telephone whirred
a distant voice   ill answer it the professor said going
b is parkgate

his finger leaped and struck point after point vibrating
t is viceregal lodge
c is where murder took place
k is knockmaroon gate
the loose flesh of his neck shook like a cocks wattles
an illstarched dicky jutted up and with a rude gesture he thrust it back into his waistcoat

lenehan bowed to a shape of air announcing  madam im adam

the old woman of princes street was there first
there was weeping and gnashing of teeth over that

hello

come across yourself
where do you find a pressman like that now eh
the editor cried
he flung the pages down
clamn dever lenehan said to mr omadden burke
very smart mr omadden burke said
professor machugh came from the inner office
talking about the invincibles he said did you see that some hawkers were up before the recorder  o yes j j omolloy said eagerly
lady dudley was walking home through the park to see all the trees that were blown down by that cyclone last year and thought shed buy a view of dublin
and it turned out to be a commemoration postcard of joe brady or number one or skinthegoat
right outside the viceregal lodge imagine
theyre only in the hook and eye department myles crawford said
psha
press and the bar
where have you a man now at the bar like those fellows like whiteside like isaac butt like silvertongued ohagan
eh
ah bloody nonsense

his mouth continued to twitch unspeaking in nervous curls of disdain
would anyone wish that mouth for her kiss
how do you know
why did you write it then
rhymes and reasons   mouth south
is the mouth south someway
or the south a mouth
must be some
south pout out shout drouth
rhymes two men dressed the same looking the same two by two
 la tua pace       che parlar ti piace      mentre che il vento come fa si tace

speak up for yourself mr omadden burke said
sufficient for the day   j j omolloy smiling palely took up the gage
my dear myles he said flinging his cigarette aside you put a false construction on my words
i hold no brief as at present advised for the third profession qua profession but your cork legs are running away with you
why not bring in henry grattan and flood and demosthenes and edmund burke
ignatius gallaher we all know and his chapelizod boss harmsworth of the farthing press and his american cousin of the bowery guttersheet not to mention paddy kellys budget pues occurrences and our watchful friend the skibbereen eagle
why bring in a master of forensic eloquence like whiteside
sufficient for the day is the newspaper thereof
links with bygone days of yore   grattan and flood wrote for this very paper the editor cried in his face
irish volunteers
where are you now
established 
dr lucas
who have you now like john philpot curran
psha
well j j omolloy said bushe kc for example
bushe
the editor said
well yes bushe yes
he has a strain of it in his blood
kendal bushe or i mean seymour bushe
he would have been on the bench long ago the professor said only for 
but no matter
j j omolloy turned to stephen and said quietly and slowly  one of the most polished periods i think i ever listened to in my life fell from the lips of seymour bushe
it was in that case of fratricide the childs murder case
bushe defended him
and in the porches of mine ear did pour  by the way how did he find that out
he died in his sleep
or the other story beast with two backs
what was that
the professor asked
italia magistra artium   he spoke on the law of evidence j j omolloy said of roman justice as contrasted with the earlier mosaic code the lex talionis
and he cited the moses of michelangelo in the vatican
ha
a few wellchosen words lenehan prefaced
silence
pause
j j omolloy took out his cigarettecase
false lull
something quite ordinary
messenger took out his matchbox thoughtfully and lit his cigar
i have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that it was that small act trivial in itself that striking of that match that determined the whole aftercourse of both our lives
a polished period   j j omolloy resumed moulding his words  he said of it that stony effigy in frozen music horned and terrible of the human form divine that eternal symbol of wisdom and of prophecy which if aught that the imagination or the hand of sculptor has wrought in marble of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live deserves to live  his slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall
fine
myles crawford said at once
the divine afflatus mr omadden burke said
you like it
j j omolloy asked stephen
stephen his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture blushed
he took a cigarette from the case
j j omolloy offered his case to myles crawford
lenehan lit their cigarettes as before and took his trophy saying  muchibus thankibus
a man of high morale   professor magennis was speaking to me about you j j omolloy said to stephen
what do you think really of that hermetic crowd the opal hush poets a e the mastermystic
that blavatsky woman started it
she was a nice old bag of tricks
a e has been telling some yankee interviewer that you came to him in the small hours of the morning to ask him about planes of consciousness
magennis thinks you must have been pulling a es leg
he is a man of the very highest morale magennis
speaking about me
what did he say
what did he say
what did he say about me
dont ask
no thanks professor machugh said waving the cigarettecase aside
wait a moment
let me say one thing
the finest display of oratory i ever heard was a speech made by john f taylor at the college historical society
mr justice fitzgibbon the present lord justice of appeal had spoken and the paper under debate was an essay new for those days advocating the revival of the irish tongue
he turned towards myles crawford and said  you know gerald fitzgibbon
then you can imagine the style of his discourse
he is sitting with tim healy j j omolloy said rumour has it on the trinity college estates commission
he is sitting with a sweet thing myles crawford said in a childs frock
go on
well
it was the speech mark you the professor said of a finished orator full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction i will not say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud mans contumely upon the new movement
it was then a new movement
we were weak therefore worthless
he closed his long thin lips an instant but eager to be on raised an outspanned hand to his spectacles and with trembling thumb and ringfinger touching lightly the black rims steadied them to a new focus
impromptu   in ferial tone he addressed j j omolloy  taylor had come there you must know from a sickbed
that he had prepared his speech i do not believe for there was not even one shorthandwriter in the hall
his dark lean face had a growth of shaggy beard round it
he wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether he looked though he was not a dying man
his gaze turned at once but slowly from j j omolloys towards stephens face and then bent at once to the ground seeking
his unglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head soiled by his withering hair
still seeking he said  when fitzgibbons speech had ended john f taylor rose to reply
briefly as well as i can bring them to mind his words were these
he raised his head firmly
his eyes bethought themselves once more
witless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro seeking outlet
he began  mr chairman ladies and gentlemen great was my admiration in listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of ireland a moment since by my learned friend
it seemed to me that i had been transported into a country far away from this country into an age remote from this age that i stood in ancient egypt and that i was listening to the speech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful moses  his listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear their smokes ascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech
and let our crooked smokes noble words coming
look out
could you try your hand at it yourself
and it seemed to me that i heard the voice of that egyptian highpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride
i heard his words and their meaning was revealed to me  from the fathers   it was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are corrupted which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they were good could be corrupted
ah curse you
thats saint augustine
why will you jews not accept our culture our religion and our language
you are a tribe of nomad herdsmen we are a mighty people
you have no cities nor no wealth our cities are hives of humanity and our galleys trireme and quadrireme laden with all manner merchandise furrow the waters of the known globe
you have but emerged from primitive conditions we have a literature a priesthood an agelong history and a polity  nile
child man effigy
by the nilebank the babemaries kneel cradle of bulrushes a man supple in combat stonehorned stonebearded heart of stone
you pray to a local and obscure idol our temples majestic and mysterious are the abodes of isis and osiris of horus and ammon ra
yours serfdom awe and humbleness ours thunder and the seas
israel is weak and few are her children egypt is an host and terrible are her arms
vagrants and daylabourers are you called the world trembles at our name  a dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech
he lifted his voice above it boldly  but ladies and gentlemen had the youthful moses listened to and accepted that view of life had he bowed his head and bowed his will and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never have brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage nor followed the pillar of the cloud by day
he would never have spoken with the eternal amid lightnings on sinais mountaintop nor ever have come down with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the tables of the law graven in the language of the outlaw  he ceased and looked at them enjoying a silence
ominousfor him
j j omolloy said not without regret  and yet he died without having entered the land of promise
asuddenatthemomentthoughfromlingeringillnessoftenpreviously expectorateddemise lenehan added
and with a great future behind him
the troop of bare feet was heard rushing along the hallway and pattering up the staircase
that is oratory the professor said uncontradicted
gone with the wind
hosts at mullaghmast and tara of the kings
miles of ears of porches
the tribunes words howled and scattered to the four winds
a people sheltered within his voice
dead noise
akasic records of all that ever anywhere wherever was
love and laud him me no more
i have money
gentlemen stephen said
as the next motion on the agenda paper may i suggest that the house do now adjourn
you take my breath away
it is not perchance a french compliment
mr omadden burke asked
tis the hour methinks when the winejug metaphorically speaking is most grateful in ye ancient hostelry
that it be and hereby is resolutely resolved
all that are in favour say ay lenehan announced
the contrary no
i declare it carried
to which particular boosing shed
my casting vote is mooneys
he led the way admonishing  we will sternly refuse to partake of strong waters will we not
yes we will not
by no manner of means
mr omadden burke following close said with an allys lunge of his umbrella  lay on macduff
chip of the old block
the editor cried clapping stephen on the shoulder
let us go
where are those blasted keys
he fumbled in his pocket pulling out the crushed typesheets
foot and mouth
i know
thatll be all right
thatll go in
where are they
thats all right
he thrust the sheets back and went into the inner office
let us hope   j j omolloy about to follow him in said quietly to stephen  i hope you will live to see it published
myles one moment
he went into the inner office closing the door behind him
come along stephen the professor said
that is fine isnt it
it has the prophetic vision
fuit ilium the sack of windy troy
kingdoms of this world
the masters of the mediterranean are fellaheen today
the first newsboy came pattering down the stairs at their heels and rushed out into the street yelling  racing special
dublin
i have much much to learn
they turned to the left along abbey street
i have a vision too stephen said
yes
the professor said skipping to get into step
crawford will follow
another newsboy shot past them yelling as he ran  racing special
dear dirty dublin   dubliners
two dublin vestals stephen said elderly and pious have lived fifty and fiftythree years in fumballys lane
where is that
the professor asked
off blackpitts stephen said
damp night reeking of hungry dough
against the wall
face glistering tallow under her fustian shawl
frantic hearts
akasic records
quicker darlint
on now
dare it
let there be life
they want to see the views of dublin from the top of nelsons pillar
they save up three and tenpence in a red tin letterbox moneybox
they shake out the threepenny bits and sixpences and coax out the pennies with the blade of a knife
two and three in silver and one and seven in coppers
they put on their bonnets and best clothes and take their umbrellas for fear it may come on to rain
wise virgins professor machugh said
life on the raw   they buy one and fourpenceworth of brawn and four slices of panloaf at the north city diningrooms in marlborough street from miss kate collins proprietress
they purchase four and twenty ripe plums from a girl at the foot of nelsons pillar to take off the thirst of the brawn
they give two threepenny bits to the gentleman at the turnstile and begin to waddle slowly up the winding staircase grunting encouraging each other afraid of the dark panting one asking the other have you the brawn praising god and the blessed virgin threatening to come down peeping at the airslits
glory be to god
they had no idea it was that high
their names are anne kearns and florence maccabe
anne kearns has the lumbago for which she rubs on lourdes water given her by a lady who got a bottleful from a passionist father
florence maccabe takes a crubeen and a bottle of double x for supper every saturday
antithesis the professor said nodding twice
vestal virgins
i can see them
whats keeping our friend
he turned
a bevy of scampering newsboys rushed down the steps scattering in all directions yelling their white papers fluttering
hard after them myles crawford appeared on the steps his hat aureoling his scarlet face talking with j j omolloy
come along the professor cried waving his arm
he set off again to walk by stephens side
return of bloom   yes he said
i see them
mr bloom breathless caught in a whirl of wild newsboys near the offices of the irish catholic and dublin penny journal called  mr crawford
a moment
telegraph
racing special
what is it
myles crawford said falling back a pace
a newsboy cried in mr blooms face  terrible tragedy in rathmines
a child bit by a bellows
interview with the editor   just this ad mr bloom said pushing through towards the steps puffing and taking the cutting from his pocket
i spoke with mr keyes just now
hell give a renewal for two months he says
after hell see
but he wants a par to call attention in the telegraph too the saturday pink
and he wants it copied if its not too late i told councillor nannetti from the kilkenny people
i can have access to it in the national library
house of keys dont you see
his name is keyes
its a play on the name
but he practically promised hed give the renewal
but he wants just a little puff
what will i tell him mr crawford
kma
will you tell him he can kiss my arse
myles crawford said throwing out his arm for emphasis
tell him that straight from the stable
a bit nervy
look out for squalls
all off for a drink
arm in arm
lenehans yachting cap on the cadge beyond
usual blarney
wonder is that young dedalus the moving spirit
has a good pair of boots on him today
last time i saw him he had his heels on view
been walking in muck somewhere
careless chap
what was he doing in irishtown
well mr bloom said his eyes returning if i can get the design i suppose its worth a short par
hed give the ad i think
ill tell him  kmria
he can kiss my royal irish arse myles crawford cried loudly over his shoulder
any time he likes tell him
while mr bloom stood weighing the point and about to smile he strode on jerkily
raising the wind   nulla bona jack he said raising his hand to his chin
im up to here
ive been through the hoop myself
i was looking for a fellow to back a bill for me no later than last week
sorry jack
you must take the will for the deed
with a heart and a half if i could raise the wind anyhow
j j omolloy pulled a long face and walked on silently
they caught up on the others and walked abreast
when they have eaten the brawn and the bread and wiped their twenty fingers in the paper the bread was wrapped in they go nearer to the railings
something for you the professor explained to myles crawford
two old dublin women on the top of nelsons pillar
some columnthats what waddler one said   thats new myles crawford said
thats copy
out for the waxies dargle
two old trickies what
but they are afraid the pillar will fall stephen went on
they see the roofs and argue about where the different churches are rathmines blue dome adam and eves saint laurence otooles
but it makes them giddy to look so they pull up their skirts  those slightly rambunctious females   easy all myles crawford said
no poetic licence
were in the archdiocese here
and settle down on their striped petticoats peering up at the statue of the onehandled adulterer
onehandled adulterer
the professor cried
i like that
i see the idea
i see what you mean
dames donate dublins cits speedpills velocitous aeroliths belief   it gives them a crick in their necks stephen said and they are too tired to look up or down or to speak
they put the bag of plums between them and eat the plums out of it one after another wiping off with their handkerchiefs the plumjuice that dribbles out of their mouths and spitting the plumstones slowly out between the railings
he gave a sudden loud young laugh as a close
lenehan and mr omadden burke hearing turned beckoned and led on across towards mooneys
finished
myles crawford said
so long as they do no worse
sophist wallops haughty helen square on proboscis
spartans gnash molars
ithacans vow pen is champ
you remind me of antisthenes the professor said a disciple of gorgias the sophist
it is said of him that none could tell if he were bitterer against others or against himself
he was the son of a noble and a bondwoman
and he wrote a book in which he took away the palm of beauty from argive helen and handed it to poor penelope
poor penelope
penelope rich
they made ready to cross oconnell street
hello there central
at various points along the eight lines tramcars with motionless trolleys stood in their tracks bound for or from rathmines rathfarnham blackrock kingstown and dalkey sandymount green ringsend and sandymount tower donnybrook palmerston park and upper rathmines all still becalmed in short circuit
hackney cars cabs delivery waggons mailvans private broughams aerated mineral water floats with rattling crates of bottles rattled rolled horsedrawn rapidly
whatand likewisewhere
but what do you call it
myles crawford asked
where did they get the plums
virgilian says pedagogue
sophomore plumps for old man moses
call it wait the professor said opening his long lips wide to reflect
call it let me see
call it deus nobis hc otia fecit  no stephen said
i call it a pisgah sight of palestine or the parable of the plums  i see the professor said
he laughed richly
i see he said again with new pleasure
moses and the promised land
we gave him that idea he added to j j omolloy
horatio is cynosure this fair june day   j j omolloy sent a weary sidelong glance towards the statue and held his peace
i see the professor said
he halted on sir john grays pavement island and peered aloft at nelson through the meshes of his wry smile
diminished digits prove too titillating for frisky frumps
anne wimbles flo wanglesyet can you blame them
onehandled adulterer he said smiling grimly
that tickles me i must say
tickled the old ones too myles crawford said if the god almightys truth was known

a sombre y m c a young man watchful among the warm sweet fumes of graham lemons placed a throwaway in a hand of mr bloom
heart to heart talks

peppers ghost idea
iron nails ran in
phosphorus it must be done with
if you leave a bit of codfish for instance
i could see the bluey silver over it
night i went down to the pantry in the kitchen
dont like all the smells in it waiting to rush out
what was it she wanted
the malaga raisins
thinking of spain
before rudy was born
the phosphorescence that bluey greeny
very good for the brain
from butlers monument house corner he glanced along bachelors walk
dedalus daughter there still outside dillons auctionrooms
must be selling off some old furniture
knew her eyes at once from the father
lobbing about waiting for him
home always breaks up when the mother goes
fifteen children he had
birth every year almost
thats in their theology or the priest wont give the poor woman the confession the absolution
increase and multiply
did you ever hear such an idea
eat you out of house and home
no families themselves to feed
living on the fat of the land
their butteries and larders
id like to see them do the black fast yom kippur
crossbuns
one meal and a collation for fear hed collapse on the altar
a housekeeper of one of those fellows if you could pick it out of her
never pick it out of her
like getting 
s d out of him
does himself well
no guests
all for number one
watching his water
bring your own bread and butter
his reverence mums the word
good lord that poor childs dress is in flitters
underfed she looks too
potatoes and marge marge and potatoes

as he set foot on oconnell bridge a puffball of smoke plumed up from the parapet
brewery barge with export stout
england
sea air sours it i heard

regular world in itself
vats of porter wonderful
rats get in too
drink themselves bloated as big as a collie floating
dead drunk on the porter
drink till they puke again like christians
imagine drinking that
rats vats
well of course if we knew all the things
looking down he saw flapping strongly wheeling between the gaunt quaywalls gulls
rough weather outside
if i threw myself down
reuben js son must have swallowed a good bellyful of that sewage
one and eightpence too much
hhhhm
its the droll way he comes out with the things
knows how to tell a story too
they wheeled lower
looking for grub
wait
he threw down among them a crumpled paper ball
elijah thirtytwo feet per sec is com
not a bit
the ball bobbed unheeded on the wake of swells floated under by the bridgepiers
not such damn fools
also the day i threw that stale cake out of the erins king picked it up in the wake fifty yards astern
live by their wits
they wheeled flapping
the hungry famished gull      flaps oer the waters dull
that is how poets write the similar sounds
but then shakespeare has no rhymes blank verse
the flow of the language it is
the thoughts
solemn
hamlet i am thy fathers spirit      doomed for a certain time to walk the earth
two apples a penny
two for a penny
his gaze passed over the glazed apples serried on her stand
australians they must be this time of year
shiny peels polishes them up with a rag or a handkerchief
wait
those poor birds
he halted again and bought from the old applewoman two banbury cakes for a penny and broke the brittle paste and threw its fragments down into the liffey
see that
the gulls swooped silently two then all from their heights pouncing on prey
gone
every morsel
aware of their greed and cunning he shook the powdery crumb from his hands
they never expected that
manna
live on fish fishy flesh they have all seabirds gulls seagoose
swans from anna liffey swim down here sometimes to preen themselves
no accounting for tastes
wonder what kind is swanmeat
robinson crusoe had to live on them
they wheeled flapping weakly
im not going to throw any more
penny quite enough
lot of thanks i get
not even a caw
they spread foot and mouth disease too
if you cram a turkey say on chestnutmeal it tastes like that
eat pig like pig
but then why is it that saltwater fish are not salty
how is that
his eyes sought answer from the river and saw a rowboat rock at anchor on the treacly swells lazily its plastered board
kinos            trousers  good idea that
wonder if he pays rent to the corporation
how can you own water really
its always flowing in a stream never the same which in the stream of life we trace
because life is a stream
all kinds of places are good for ads
that quack doctor for the clap used to be stuck up in all the greenhouses
never see it now
strictly confidential
dr hy franks

o rocks
mr bloom smiled o rocks at two windows of the ballastoffice
shes right after all
only big words for ordinary things on account of the sound
shes not exactly witty
can be rude too
blurt out what i was thinking
still i dont know
she used to say ben dollard had a base barreltone voice
he has legs like barrels and youd think he was singing into a barrel
now isnt that wit
they used to call him big ben
not half as witty as calling him base barreltone
appetite like an albatross
get outside of a baron of beef
powerful man he was at stowing away number one bass
barrel of bass
see
it all works out
a procession of whitesmocked sandwichmen marched slowly towards him along the gutter scarlet sashes across their boards
bargains
like that priest they are this morning we have sinned we have suffered
he read the scarlet letters on their five tall white hats h e l y s wisdom helys
y lagging behind drew a chunk of bread from under his foreboard crammed it into his mouth and munched as he walked
our staple food
three bob a day walking along the gutters street after street
just keep skin and bone together bread and skilly
they are not boyl no mglades men
doesnt bring in any business either
i suggested to him about a transparent showcart with two smart girls sitting inside writing letters copybooks envelopes blottingpaper
i bet that would have caught on
smart girls writing something catch the eye at once
everyone dying to know what shes writing
get twenty of them round you if you stare at nothing
have a finger in the pie
women too
curiosity
pillar of salt
wouldnt have it of course because he didnt think of it himself first
or the inkbottle i suggested with a false stain of black celluloid
his ideas for ads like plumtrees potted under the obituaries cold meat department

our great day she said

sweet name too caramel
she knew i i think she knew by the way she
if she had married she would have changed
i suppose they really were short of money
fried everything in the best butter all the same
no lard for them
my hearts broke eating dripping
they like buttering themselves in and out
molly tasting it her veil up

bartell darcy was the tenor just coming out then
seeing her home after practice
conceited fellow with his waxedup moustache
gave her that song winds that blow from the south
windy night that was i went to fetch her there was that lodge meeting on about those lottery tickets after goodwins concert in the supperroom or oakroom of the mansion house
he and i behind
sheet of her music blew out of my hand against the high school railings
lucky it didnt
thing like that spoils the effect of a night for her
professor goodwin linking her in front
shaky on his pins poor old sot
his farewell concerts
positively last appearance on any stage
may be for months and may be for never
remember her laughing at the wind her blizzard collar up
corner of harcourt road remember that gust
brrfoo
blew up all her skirts and her boa nearly smothered old goodwin
she did get flushed in the wind
remember when we got home raking up the fire and frying up those pieces of lap of mutton for her supper with the chutney sauce she liked
and the mulled rum
could see her in the bedroom from the hearth unclamping the busk of her stays white
swish and soft flop her stays made on the bed
always warm from her
always liked to let her self out
sitting there after till near two taking out her hairpins
milly tucked up in beddyhouse
happy

the heavy noonreek tickled the top of mr blooms gullet

a barefoot arab stood over the grating breathing in the fumes
deaden the gnaw of hunger that way

someone taking a rise out of him
its a great shame for them whoever he is
indeed it is mr bloom said
she took back the card sighing
and now hes going round to mr mentons office
hes going to take an action for ten thousand pounds he says
she folded the card into her untidy bag and snapped the catch
same blue serge dress she had two years ago the nap bleaching
seen its best days
wispish hair over her ears
and that dowdy toque three old grapes to take the harm out of it
shabby genteel
she used to be a tasty dresser
lines round her mouth
only a year or so older than molly
see the eye that woman gave her passing
cruel
the unfair sex
he looked still at her holding back behind his look his discontent
pungent mockturtle oxtail mulligatawny

flakes of pastry on the gusset of her dress daub of sugary flour stuck to her cheek
rhubarb tart with liberal fillings rich fruit interior

mrs breen nodded
she was taken bad on the tuesday  mr bloom touched her funnybone gently warning her  mind
let this man pass
a bony form strode along the curbstone from the river staring with a rapt gaze into the sunlight through a heavystringed glass
tight as a skullpiece a tiny hat gripped his head
from his arm a folded dustcoat a stick and an umbrella dangled to his stride
watch him mr bloom said
he always walks outside the lampposts
watch
who is he if its a fair question
mrs breen asked
is he dotty
his name is cashel boyle oconnor fitzmaurice tisdall farrell mr bloom said smiling
watch
he has enough of them she said
denis will be like that one of these days
she broke off suddenly
there he is she said
i must go after him
goodbye
remember me to molly wont you
i will mr bloom said
he watched her dodge through passers towards the shopfronts
denis breen in skimpy frockcoat and blue canvas shoes shuffled out of harrisons hugging two heavy tomes to his ribs
blown in from the bay
like old times
he suffered her to overtake him without surprise and thrust his dull grey beard towards her his loose jaw wagging as he spoke earnestly
meshuggah
off his chump
mr bloom walked on again easily seeing ahead of him in sunlight the tight skullpiece the dangling stickumbrelladustcoat
going the two days
watch him
out he goes again
one way of getting on in the world
and that other old mosey lunatic in those duds
hard time she must have with him

his eyes followed the high figure in homespun beard and bicycle a listening woman at his side
coming from the vegetarian
only weggebobbles and fruit
dont eat a beefsteak
if you do the eyes of that cow will pursue you through all eternity
they say its healthier
windandwatery though
tried it
keep you on the run all day
bad as a bloater
dreams all night
why do they call that thing they gave me nutsteak
nutarians
fruitarians
to give you the idea you are eating rumpsteak
absurd
salty too
they cook in soda
keep you sitting by the tap all night
her stockings are loose over her ankles
i detest that so tasteless
those literary etherial people they are all
dreamy cloudy symbolistic
esthetes they are
i wouldnt be surprised if it was that kind of food you see produces the like waves of the brain the poetical
for example one of those policemen sweating irish stew into their shirts you couldnt squeeze a line of poetry out of him
dont know what poetry is even
must be in a certain mood
the dreamy cloudy gull      waves oer the waters dull
he crossed at nassau street corner and stood before the window of yeates and son pricing the fieldglasses
or will i drop into old harriss and have a chat with young sinclair
wellmannered fellow
probably at his lunch
must get those old glasses of mine set right
goerz lenses six guineas
germans making their way everywhere
sell on easy terms to capture trade
undercutting
might chance on a pair in the railway lost property office
astonishing the things people leave behind them in trains and cloakrooms
what do they be thinking about
women too
incredible
last year travelling to ennis had to pick up that farmers daughters bag and hand it to her at limerick junction
unclaimed money too
theres a little watch up there on the roof of the bank to test those glasses by
his lids came down on the lower rims of his irides
cant see it
if you imagine its there you can almost see it
cant see it
he faced about and standing between the awnings held out his right hand at arms length towards the sun
wanted to try that often
yes completely
the tip of his little finger blotted out the suns disk
must be the focus where the rays cross
if i had black glasses
interesting
there was a lot of talk about those sunspots when we were in lombard street west
looking up from the back garden
terrific explosions they are
there will be a total eclipse this year autumn some time
now that i come to think of it that ball falls at greenwich time
its the clock is worked by an electric wire from dunsink
must go out there some first saturday of the month
if i could get an introduction to professor joly or learn up something about his family
that would do to man always feels complimented
flattery where least expected
nobleman proud to be descended from some kings mistress
his foremother
lay it on with a trowel
cap in hand goes through the land
not go in and blurt out what you know youre not to whats parallax
show this gentleman the door
ah
his hand fell to his side again
never know anything about it
waste of time
gasballs spinning about crossing each other passing
same old dingdong always
gas then solid then world then cold then dead shell drifting around frozen rock like that pineapple rock
the moon
must be a new moon out she said
i believe there is
he went on by la maison claire
wait
the full moon was the night we were sunday fortnight exactly there is a new moon
walking down by the tolka
not bad for a fairview moon
she was humming
the young may moon shes beaming love
he other side of her
elbow arm

glowworms laamp is gleaming love
touch
fingers
asking
answer
yes
stop
stop
if it was it was
must
mr bloom quickbreathing slowlier walking passed adam court
with a keep quiet relief his eyes took note this is the street here middle of the day of bob dorans bottle shoulders
on his annual bend mcoy said
they drink in order to say or do something or cherchez la femme
up in the coombe with chummies and streetwalkers and then the rest of the year sober as a judge
yes
thought so
sloping into the empire
gone
plain soda would do him good
where pat kinsella had his harp theatre before whitbred ran the queens
broth of a boy
dion boucicault business with his harvestmoon face in a poky bonnet
three purty maids from school
how time flies eh
showing long red pantaloons under his skirts
drinkers drinking laughed spluttering their drink against their breath
more power pat
coarse red fun for drunkards guffaw and smoke
take off that white hat
his parboiled eyes
where is he now
beggar somewhere
the harp that once did starve us all
i was happier then
or was that i
or am i now i
twentyeight i was
she twentythree
when we left lombard street west something changed
could never like it again after rudy
cant bring back time
like holding water in your hand
would you go back to then
just beginning then
would you
are you not happy in your home you poor little naughty boy
wants to sew on buttons for me
i must answer
write it in the library
grafton street gay with housed awnings lured his senses
muslin prints silkdames and dowagers jingle of harnesses hoofthuds lowringing in the baking causeway
thick feet that woman has in the white stockings
hope the rain mucks them up on her
countrybred chawbacon
all the beef to the heels were in
always gives a woman clumsy feet
molly looks out of plumb
he passed dallying the windows of brown thomas silk mercers
cascades of ribbons
flimsy china silks
a tilted urn poured from its mouth a flood of bloodhued poplin lustrous blood
the huguenots brought that here
la causa  santa tara tara
great chorus that
taree tara
must be washed in rainwater
meyerbeer
tara bom bom bom
pincushions
im a long time threatening to buy one
sticking them all over the place
needles in window curtains
he bared slightly his left forearm
scrape nearly gone
not today anyhow

wealth of the world
a warm human plumpness settled down on his brain
his brain yielded
perfume of embraces all him assailed
with hungered flesh obscurely he mutely craved to adore
duke street
here we are
must eat
the burton
feel better then
he turned combridges corner still pursued
jingling hoofthuds
perfumed bodies warm full
all kissed yielded in deep summer fields tangled pressed grass in trickling hallways of tenements along sofas creaking beds
jack love
darling
kiss me reggy
my boy
love
his heart astir he pushed in the door of the burton restaurant
stink gripped his trembling breath pungent meatjuice slush of greens
see the animals feed
men men men
perched on high stools by the bar hats shoved back at the tables calling for more bread no charge swilling wolfing gobfuls of sloppy food their eyes bulging wiping wetted moustaches
a pallid suetfaced young man polished his tumbler knife fork and spoon with his napkin
new set of microbes
a man with an infants saucestained napkin tucked round him shovelled gurgling soup down his gullet
a man spitting back on his plate halfmasticated gristle gums no teeth to chewchewchew it
chump chop from the grill
bolting to get it over
sad boosers eyes
bitten off more than he can chew
am i like that
see ourselves as others see us
hungry man is an angry man
working tooth and jaw

that last pagan king of ireland cormac in the schoolpoem choked himself at sletty southward of the boyne
wonder what he was eating
something galoptious
saint patrick converted him to christianity
couldnt swallow it all however
roast beef and cabbage
one stew
smells of men
spaton sawdust sweetish warmish cigarettesmoke reek of plug spilt beer mens beery piss the stale of ferment
his gorge rose
couldnt eat a morsel here
fellow sharpening knife and fork to eat all before him old chap picking his tootles
slight spasm full chewing the cud
before and after
grace after meals
look on this picture then on that
scoffing up stewgravy with sopping sippets of bread
lick it off the plate man
get out of this
he gazed round the stooled and tabled eaters tightening the wings of his nose
two stouts here
one corned and cabbage
that fellow ramming a knifeful of cabbage down as if his life depended on it
good stroke
give me the fidgets to look
safer to eat from his three hands
tear it limb from limb
second nature to him
born with a silver knife in his mouth
thats witty i think
or no
silver means born rich
born with a knife
but then the allusion is lost
an illgirt server gathered sticky clattering plates
rock the head bailiff standing at the bar blew the foamy crown from his tankard
well up it splashed yellow near his boot
a diner knife and fork upright elbows on table ready for a second helping stared towards the foodlift across his stained square of newspaper
other chap telling him something with his mouth full
sympathetic listener
table talk
i munched hum un thu unchster bunk un munchday

ay now i remember nosey flynn said putting his hand in his pocket to scratch his groin

a warm shock of air heat of mustard hanched on mr blooms heart
he raised his eyes and met the stare of a bilious clock
two
pub clock five minutes fast
time going on
hands moving

his midriff yearned then upward sank within him yearned more longly longingly
wine
he smellsipped the cordial juice and bidding his throat strongly to speed it set his wineglass delicately down

nosey flynn snuffled and scratched
flea having a good square meal

mr bloom ate his strips of sandwich fresh clean bread with relish of disgust pungent mustard the feety savour of green cheese
sips of his wine soothed his palate
not logwood that

nice quiet bar
nice piece of wood in that counter
nicely planed

i wouldnt do anything at all in that line davy byrne said
it ruined many a man the same horses

that was a rare bit of horseflesh
saint frusquin was her sire
she won in a thunderstorm rothschilds filly with wadding in her ears
blue jacket and yellow cap

mawkish pulp her mouth had mumbled sweetsour of her spittle
joy i ate it joy
young life her lips that gave me pouting
soft warm sticky gumjelly lips
flowers her eyes were take me willing eyes
pebbles fell

high on ben howth rhododendrons a nannygoat walking surefooted dropping currants
screened under ferns she laughed warmfolded
wildly i lay on her kissed her eyes her lips her stretched neck beating womans breasts full in her blouse of nuns veiling fat nipples upright

when the sound of his boots had ceased davy byrne said from his book  what is this he is

he does canvassing for the freeman  i know him well to see davy byrne said

nosey flynn said
so he was faith
i asked him how was all at home
youre right by god
so he was
i never broach the subject davy byrne said humanely if i see a gentleman is in trouble that way
it only brings it up fresh in their minds
its not the wife anyhow nosey flynn said
i met him the day before yesterday and he coming out of that irish farm dairy john wyse nolans wife has in henry street with a jar of cream in his hand taking it home to his better half
shes well nourished i tell you
plovers on toast
and is he doing for the freeman davy byrne said
nosey flynn pursed his lips
he doesnt buy cream on the ads he picks up
you can make bacon of that
how so
davy byrne asked coming from his book
nosey flynn made swift passes in the air with juggling fingers
he winked
hes in the craft he said
do you tell me so
davy byrne said
very much so nosey flynn said
ancient free and accepted order
hes an excellent brother
light life and love by god
they give him a leg up
i was told that by awell i wont say who
is that a fact
o its a fine order nosey flynn said
they stick to you when youre down
i know a fellow was trying to get into it
but theyre as close as damn it
by god they did right to keep the women out of it
davy byrne smiledyawnednodded all in one  iiiiiichaaaaaaach
there was one woman nosey flynn said hid herself in a clock to find out what they do be doing
but be damned but they smelt her out and swore her in on the spot a master mason
that was one of the saint legers of doneraile
davy byrne sated after his yawn said with tearwashed eyes  and is that a fact
decent quiet man he is
i often saw him in here and i never once saw himyou know over the line
god almighty couldnt make him drunk nosey flynn said firmly
slips off when the fun gets too hot
didnt you see him look at his watch
ah you werent there
if you ask him to have a drink first thing he does he outs with the watch to see what he ought to imbibe
declare to god he does
there are some like that davy byrne said
hes a safe man id say
hes not too bad nosey flynn said snuffling it up
hes been known to put his hand down too to help a fellow
give the devil his due
o bloom has his good points
but theres one thing hell never do
his hand scrawled a dry pen signature beside his grog
i know davy byrne said
nothing in black and white nosey flynn said
paddy leonard and bantam lyons came in
tom rochford followed frowning a plaining hand on his claret waistcoat

they paused at the counter

paddy leonard asked
ill take a stone ginger bantam lyons said

paddy leonard cried
since when for god sake

how is the main drainage
nosey flynn asked sipping
for answer tom rochford pressed his hand to his breastbone and hiccupped
would i trouble you for a glass of fresh water mr byrne
he said

paddy leonard eyed his alemates
lord love a duck he said
look at what im standing drinks to
cold water and gingerpop
two fellows that would suck whisky off a sore leg
he has some bloody horse up his sleeve for the gold cup
a dead snip
zinfandel is it
nosey flynn asked
tom rochford spilt powder from a twisted paper into the water set before him
that cursed dyspepsia he said before drinking
breadsoda is very good davy byrne said
tom rochford nodded and drank
is it zinfandel

bantam lyons winked
im going to plunge five bob on my own
tell us if youre worth your salt and be damned to you paddy leonard said
who gave it to you
mr bloom on his way out raised three fingers in greeting
so long
nosey flynn said
the others turned

prrwht
paddy leonard said with scorn
mr byrne sir well take two of your small jamesons after that and a  stone ginger davy byrne added civilly
ay paddy leonard said
a suckingbottle for the baby
mr bloom walked towards dawson street his tongue brushing his teeth smooth
something green it would have to be spinach say
then with those rntgen rays searchlight you could
at duke lane a ravenous terrier choked up a sick knuckly cud on the cobblestones and lapped it with new zest
surfeit
returned with thanks having fully digested the contents
first sweet then savoury
mr bloom coasted warily
ruminants
his second course
their upper jaw they move
wonder if tom rochford will do anything with that invention of his
wasting time explaining it to flynns mouth
lean people long mouths
ought to be a hall or a place where inventors could go in and invent free
course then youd have all the cranks pestering
he hummed prolonging in solemn echo the closes of the bars       don giovanni a cenar teco      minvitasti

against john longs a drowsing loafer lounged in heavy thought gnawing a crusted knuckle
handy man wants job

mr bloom turned at grays confectioners window of unbought tarts and passed the reverend thomas connellans bookstore
why i left the church of rome
birds nest women run him
they say they used to give pauper children soup to change to protestants in the time of the potato blight
society over the way papa went to for the conversion of poor jews
same bait
why we left the church of rome
a blind stripling stood tapping the curbstone with his slender cane
no tram in sight
wants to cross
do you want to cross
mr bloom asked
the blind stripling did not answer
his wallface frowned weakly
he moved his head uncertainly
youre in dawson street mr bloom said
molesworth street is opposite
do you want to cross
theres nothing in the way
the cane moved out trembling to the left
mr blooms eye followed its line and saw again the dyeworks van drawn up before dragos
where i saw his brillantined hair just when i was
horse drooping
driver in john longs
slaking his drouth
theres a van there mr bloom said but its not moving
ill see you across
do you want to go to molesworth street
yes the stripling answered
south frederick street
come mr bloom said
he touched the thin elbow gently then took the limp seeing hand to guide it forward
say something to him
better not do the condescending
they mistrust what you tell them
pass a common remark
the rain kept off
no answer
stains on his coat
slobbers his food i suppose
tastes all different for him
have to be spoonfed first
like a childs hand his hand
like millys was
sensitive
sizing me up i daresay from my hand
wonder if he has a name
van
keep his cane clear of the horses legs tired drudge get his doze
thats right
clear
behind a bull in front of a horse
thanks sir
knows im a man
voice
right now
first turn to the left
the blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way drawing his cane back feeling again
mr bloom walked behind the eyeless feet a flatcut suit of herringbone tweed
poor young fellow
how on earth did he know that van was there
must have felt it
see things in their forehead perhaps kind of sense of volume
weight or size of it something blacker than the dark
wonder would he feel it if something was removed
feel a gap
queer idea of dublin he must have tapping his way round by the stones
could he walk in a beeline if he hadnt that cane
bloodless pious face like a fellow going in to be a priest
penrose
that was that chaps name
look at all the things they can learn to do
read with their fingers
tune pianos
or we are surprised they have any brains
why we think a deformed person or a hunchback clever if he says something we might say
of course the other senses are more
embroider
plait baskets
people ought to help
workbasket i could buy for mollys birthday
hates sewing
might take an objection
dark men they call them
sense of smell must be stronger too
smells on all sides bunched together
each street different smell
each person too
then the spring the summer smells
tastes
they say you cant taste wines with your eyes shut or a cold in the head
also smoke in the dark they say get no pleasure
and with a woman for instance
more shameless not seeing
that girl passing the stewart institution head in the air
look at me
i have them all on
must be strange not to see her
kind of a form in his minds eye
the voice temperatures when he touches her with his fingers must almost see the lines the curves
his hands on her hair for instance
say it was black for instance
good
we call it black
then passing over her white skin
different feel perhaps
feeling of white
postoffice
must answer
fag today
send her a postal order two shillings half a crown
accept my little present
stationers just here too
wait
think over it
with a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair combed back above his ears
again
fibres of fine fine straw
then gently his finger felt the skin of his right cheek
downy hair there too
not smooth enough
the belly is the smoothest
noone about
there he goes into frederick street
perhaps to levenstons dancing academy piano
might be settling my braces
walking by dorans publichouse he slid his hand between his waistcoat and trousers and pulling aside his shirt gently felt a slack fold of his belly
but i know its whitey yellow
want to try in the dark to see
he withdrew his hand and pulled his dress to
poor fellow
quite a boy
terrible
really terrible
what dreams would he have not seeing
life a dream for him
where is the justice being born that way
all those women and children excursion beanfeast burned and drowned in new york
holocaust
karma they call that transmigration for sins you did in a past life the reincarnation met him pike hoses
dear dear dear
pity of course but somehow you cant cotton on to them someway
sir frederick falkiner going into the freemasons hall
solemn as troy
after his good lunch in earlsfort terrace
old legal cronies cracking a magnum
tales of the bench and assizes and annals of the bluecoat school
i sentenced him to ten years
i suppose hed turn up his nose at that stuff i drank
vintage wine for them the year marked on a dusty bottle
has his own ideas of justice in the recorders court
wellmeaning old man

mr bloom came to kildare street

he swerved to the right

almost certain
wont look
wine in my face
why did i
too heady
yes it is
the walk
not see
get on
making for the museum gate with long windy steps he lifted his eyes
handsome building
sir thomas deane designed
not following me
didnt see me perhaps
light in his eyes
the flutter of his breath came forth in short sighs
quick
cold statues quiet there
safe in a minute
no
didnt see me
after two
just at the gate
my heart
his eyes beating looked steadfastly at cream curves of stone
sir thomas deane was the greek architecture
look for something i
his hasty hand went quick into a pocket took out read unfolded agendath netaim

busy looking
he thrust back quick agendath

     urbane to comfort them the quaker librarian purred  and we have have we not those priceless pages of wilhelm meister
a great poet on a great brother poet
a hesitating soul taking arms against a sea of troubles torn by conflicting doubts as one sees in real life
he came a step a sinkapace forward on neatsleather creaking and a step backward a sinkapace on the solemn floor
a noiseless attendant setting open the door but slightly made him a noiseless beck
directly said he creaking to go albeit lingering
the beautiful ineffectual dreamer who comes to grief against hard facts
one always feels that goethes judgments are so true
true in the larger analysis

our young irish bards john eglinton censured have yet to create a figure which the world will set beside saxon shakespeares hamlet though i admire him as old ben did on this side idolatry
all these questions are purely academic russell oracled out of his shadow
i mean whether hamlet is shakespeare or james i or essex
clergymens discussions of the historicity of jesus
art has to reveal to us ideas formless spiritual essences
the supreme question about a work of art is out of how deep a life does it spring
the painting of gustave moreau is the painting of ideas
the deepest poetry of shelley the words of hamlet bring our minds into contact with the eternal wisdom platos world of ideas
all the rest is the speculation of schoolboys for schoolboys
a e has been telling some yankee interviewer
wall tarnation strike me
the schoolmen were schoolboys first stephen said superpolitely
aristotle was once platos schoolboy
and has remained so one should hope john eglinton sedately said
one can see him a model schoolboy with his diploma under his arm
he laughed again at the now smiling bearded face

mr best entered tall young mild light
he bore in his hand with grace a notebook new large clean bright
that model schoolboy stephen said would find hamlets musings about the afterlife of his princely soul the improbable insignificant and undramatic monologue as shallow as platos
john eglinton frowning said waxing wroth  upon my word it makes my blood boil to hear anyone compare aristotle with plato
which of the two stephen asked would have banished me from his commonwealth

mr best came forward amiable towards his colleague

an emerald set in the ring of the sea
people do not know how dangerous lovesongs can be the auric egg of russell warned occultly
the movements which work revolutions in the world are born out of the dreams and visions in a peasants heart on the hillside
for them the earth is not an exploitable ground but the living mother
the rarefied air of the academy and the arena produce the sixshilling novel the musichall song
france produces the finest flower of corruption in mallarm but the desirable life is revealed only to the poor of heart the life of homers phacians
from these words mr best turned an unoffending face to stephen
mallarm dont you know he said has written those wonderful prose poems stephen mackenna used to read to me in paris
the one about hamlet he says il se promne lisant au livre de luimme dont you know reading the book of himself
he describes hamlet given in a french town dont you know a provincial town
they advertised it
his free hand graciously wrote tiny signs in air
hamlet ou le distrait pice de shakespeare   he repeated to john eglintons newgathered frown  pice de shakespeare dont you know
its so french
the french point of view
hamlet ou  the absentminded beggar stephen ended
john eglinton laughed
yes i suppose it would be he said
excellent people no doubt but distressingly shortsighted in some matters
sumptuous and stagnant exaggeration of murder
a deathsman of the soul robert greene called him stephen said
not for nothing was he a butchers son wielding the sledded poleaxe and spitting in his palms

he will have it that hamlet is a ghoststory john eglinton said for mr bests behoof
like the fat boy in pickwick he wants to make our flesh creep
list
list
o list
my flesh hears him creeping hears
if thou didst ever   what is a ghost
stephen said with tingling energy
one who has faded into impalpability through death through absence through change of manners
elizabethan london lay as far from stratford as corrupt paris lies from virgin dublin
who is the ghost from limbo patrum returning to the world that has forgotten him
who is king hamlet
john eglinton shifted his spare body leaning back to judge
lifted
it is this hour of a day in mid june stephen said begging with a swift glance their hearing
the flag is up on the playhouse by the bankside
the bear sackerson growls in the pit near it paris garden
canvasclimbers who sailed with drake chew their sausages among the groundlings
local colour
work in all you know

shakespeare has left the huguenots house in silver street and walks by the swanmews along the riverbank
but he does not stay to feed the pen chivying her game of cygnets towards the rushes
the swan of avon has other thoughts
composition of place
ignatius loyola make haste to help me
the play begins
a player comes on under the shadow made up in the castoff mail of a court buck a wellset man with a bass voice
it is the ghost the king a king and no king and the player is shakespeare who has studied hamlet all the years of his life which were not vanity in order to play the part of the spectre
he speaks the words to burbage the young player who stands before him beyond the rack of cerecloth calling him by a name       hamlet i am thy fathers spirit  bidding him list
to a son he speaks the son of his soul the prince young hamlet and to the son of his body hamnet shakespeare who has died in stratford that his namesake may live for ever
is it possible that that player shakespeare a ghost by absence and in the vesture of buried denmark a ghost by death speaking his own words to his own sons name had hamnet shakespeare lived he would have been prince hamlets twin is it possible i want to know or probable that he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises you are the dispossessed son i am the murdered father your mother is the guilty queen ann shakespeare born hathaway
but this prying into the family life of a great man russell began impatiently
art thou there truepenny
interesting only to the parish clerk
i mean we have the plays
i mean when we read the poetry of king lear what is it to us how the poet lived
as for living our servants can do that for us villiers de lisle has said
peeping and prying into greenroom gossip of the day the poets drinking the poets debts
we have king lear and it is immortal

john eglintons carping voice asked
her ghost at least has been laid for ever
she died for literature at least before she was born
she died stephen retorted sixtyseven years after she was born
she saw him into and out of the world
she took his first embraces
she bore his children and she laid pennies on his eyes to keep his eyelids closed when he lay on his deathbed
mothers deathbed
candle
the sheeted mirror
who brought me into this world lies there bronzelidded under few cheap flowers
liliata rutilantium  i wept alone
john eglinton looked in the tangled glowworm of his lamp
the world believes that shakespeare made a mistake he said and got out of it as quickly and as best he could
bosh
stephen said rudely
a man of genius makes no mistakes
his errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery
portals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian softcreakfooted bald eared and assiduous
a shrew john eglinton said shrewdly is not a useful portal of discovery one should imagine
what useful discovery did socrates learn from xanthippe
dialectic stephen answered and from his mother how to bring thoughts into the world
what he learnt from his other wife myrto absit nomen socratididions epipsychidion no man not a woman will ever know
but neither the midwifes lore nor the caudlelectures saved him from the archons of sinn fein and their naggin of hemlock
but ann hathaway
mr bests quiet voice said forgetfully
yes we seem to be forgetting her as shakespeare himself forgot her
his look went from brooders beard to carpers skull to remind to chide them not unkindly then to the baldpink lollard costard guiltless though maligned
he had a good groatsworth of wit stephen said and no truant memory
he carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to romeville whistling the girl i left behind me if the earthquake did not time it we should know where to place poor wat sitting in his form the cry of hounds the studded bridle and her blue windows
that memory venus and adonis lay in the bedchamber of every lightoflove in london
is katharine the shrew illfavoured
hortensio calls her young and beautiful
do you think the writer of antony and cleopatra a passionate pilgrim had his eyes in the back of his head that he chose the ugliest doxy in all warwickshire to lie withal
good he left her and gained the world of men
but his boywomen are the women of a boy
their life thought speech are lent them by males
he chose badly
he was chosen it seems to me
if others have their will ann hath a way
by cock she was to blame
she put the comether on him sweet and twentysix
the greyeyed goddess who bends over the boy adonis stooping to conquer as prologue to the swelling act is a boldfaced stratford wench who tumbles in a cornfield a lover younger than herself
and my turn
when
come
ryefield mr best said brightly gladly raising his new book gladly brightly
he murmured then with blond delight for all       between the acres of the rye      these pretty countryfolk would lie

a tall figure in bearded homespun rose from shadow and unveiled its cooperative watch
i am afraid i am due at the homestead  whither away

mr russell rumour has it is gathering together a sheaf of our younger poets verses
we are all looking forward anxiously
anxiously he glanced in the cone of lamplight where three faces lighted shone
see this
remember
stephen looked down on a wide headless caubeen hung on his ashplanthandle over his knee

the gaelic league wants something in irish
i hope you will come round tonight
bring starkey
stephen sat down
the quaker librarian came from the leavetakers
blushing his mask said  mr dedalus your views are most illuminating
he creaked to and fro tiptoing up nearer heaven by the altitude of a chopine and covered by the noise of outgoing said low  is it your view then that she was not faithful to the poet
alarmed face asks me
why did he come
courtesy or an inward light
where there is a reconciliation stephen said there must have been first a sundering
yes
christfox in leather trews hiding a runaway in blighted treeforks from hue and cry

women he won to him tender people a whore of babylon ladies of justices bully tapsters wives

the door closed behind the outgoer
rest suddenly possessed the discreet vaulted cell rest of warm and brooding air
a vestals lamp
here he ponders things that were not what csar would have lived to do had he believed the soothsayer what might have been possibilities of the possible as possible things not known what name achilles bore when he lived among women
coffined thoughts around me in mummycases embalmed in spice of words
thoth god of libraries a birdgod moonycrowned
and i heard the voice of that egyptian highpriest
in painted chambers loaded with tilebooks  they are still
once quick in the brains of men
still but an itch of death is in them to tell me in my ear a maudlin tale urge me to wreak their will
certainly john eglinton mused of all great men he is the most enigmatic
we know nothing but that he lived and suffered
not even so much
others abide our question
a shadow hangs over all the rest
but hamlet is so personal isnt it
mr best pleaded
i mean a kind of private paper dont you know of his private life
i mean i dont care a button dont you know who is killed or who is guilty
he rested an innocent book on the edge of the desk smiling his defiance
his private papers in the original
ta an bad ar an tir

put beurla on it littlejohn
quoth littlejohn eglinton  i was prepared for paradoxes from what malachi mulligan told us but i may as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that shakespeare is hamlet you have a stern task before you
bear with me
stephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes glinting stern under wrinkled brows
a basilisk
e quando vede luomo lattosca
messer brunetto i thank thee for the word
as we or mother dana weave and unweave our bodies stephen said from day to day their molecules shuttled to and fro so does the artist weave and unweave his image
and as the mole on my right breast is where it was when i was born though all my body has been woven of new stuff time after time so through the ghost of the unquiet father the image of the unliving son looks forth
in the intense instant of imagination when the mind shelley says is a fading coal that which i was is that which i am and that which in possibility i may come to be
so in the future the sister of the past i may see myself as i sit here now but by reflection from that which then i shall be
drummond of hawthornden helped you at that stile
yes mr best said youngly
i feel hamlet quite young
the bitterness might be from the father but the passages with ophelia are surely from the son
has the wrong sow by the lug
he is in my father
i am in his son
that mole is the last to go stephen said laughing
john eglinton made a nothing pleasing mow
if that were the birthmark of genius he said genius would be a drug in the market
the plays of shakespeares later years which renan admired so much breathe another spirit
the spirit of reconciliation the quaker librarian breathed
there can be no reconciliation stephen said if there has not been a sundering
said that
if you want to know what are the events which cast their shadow over the hell of time of king lear othello hamlet troilus and cressida look to see when and how the shadow lifts
what softens the heart of a man shipwrecked in storms dire tried like another ulysses pericles prince of tyre
head redconecapped buffeted brineblinded

the leaning of sophists towards the bypaths of apocrypha is a constant quantity john eglinton detected
the highroads are dreary but they lead to the town

will we be there by candlelight
mr brandes accepts it stephen said as the first play of the closing period
does he
what does mr sidney lee or mr simon lazarus as some aver his name is say of it
marina stephen said a child of storm miranda a wonder perdita that which was lost
what was lost is given back to him his daughters child
my dearest wife pericles says was like this maid will any man love the daughter if he has not loved the mother
the art of being a grandfather mr best gan murmur
lart dtre grand  will he not see reborn in her with the memory of his own youth added another image
do you know what you are talking about
love yes
word known to all men
amor vero aliquid alicui bonum vult unde et ea quae concupiscimus   his own image to a man with that queer thing genius is the standard of all experience material and moral
such an appeal will touch him
the images of other males of his blood will repel him
he will see in them grotesque attempts of nature to foretell or to repeat himself
the benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope
i hope mr dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of the public
and we ought to mention another irish commentator mr george bernard shaw
nor should we forget mr frank harris
his articles on shakespeare in the saturday review were surely brilliant
oddly enough he too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of the sonnets
the favoured rival is william herbert earl of pembroke
i own that if the poet must be rejected such a rejection would seem more in harmony withwhat shall i sayour notions of what ought not to have been
felicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them auks egg prize of their fray
he thous and thees her with grave husbandwords
dost love miriam
dost love thy man
that may be too stephen said
theres a saying of goethes which mr magee likes to quote
beware of what you wish for in youth because you will get it in middle life
why does he send to one who is a buonaroba a bay where all men ride a maid of honour with a scandalous girlhood a lordling to woo for him
he was himself a lord of language and had made himself a coistrel gentleman and he had written romeo and juliet
why
belief in himself has been untimely killed
he was overborne in a cornfield first ryefield i should say and he will never be a victor in his own eyes after nor play victoriously the game of laugh and lie down
assumed dongiovannism will not save him
no later undoing will undo the first undoing
the tusk of the boar has wounded him there where love lies ableeding
if the shrew is worsted yet there remains to her womans invisible weapon
there is i feel in the words some goad of the flesh driving him into a new passion a darker shadow of the first darkening even his own understanding of himself
a like fate awaits him and the two rages commingle in a whirlpool
they list
and in the porches of their ears i pour
the soul has been before stricken mortally a poison poured in the porch of a sleeping ear
but those who are done to death in sleep cannot know the manner of their quell unless their creator endow their souls with that knowledge in the life to come
the poisoning and the beast with two backs that urged it king hamlets ghost could not know of were he not endowed with knowledge by his creator
that is why the speech his lean unlovely english is always turned elsewhere backward
ravisher and ravished what he would but would not go with him from lucreces bluecircled ivory globes to imogens breast bare with its mole cinquespotted
he goes back weary of the creation he has piled up to hide him from himself an old dog licking an old sore
but because loss is his gain he passes on towards eternity in undiminished personality untaught by the wisdom he has written or by the laws he has revealed
his beaver is up
he is a ghost a shadow now the wind by elsinores rocks or what you will the seas voice a voice heard only in the heart of him who is the substance of his shadow the son consubstantial with the father
amen
was responded from the doorway
hast thou found me o mine enemy

a ribald face sullen as a deans buck mulligan came forward then blithe in motley towards the greeting of their smiles

yes indeed the quaker librarian said
a most instructive discussion
mr mulligan ill be bound has his theory too of the play and of shakespeare
all sides of life should be represented
he smiled on all sides equally
buck mulligan thought puzzled  shakespeare
he said
i seem to know the name
a flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features
to be sure he said remembering brightly
the chap that writes like synge
mr best turned to him
haines missed you he said
did you meet him
hell see you after at the d b c hes gone to gills to buy hydes lovesongs of connacht
i came through the museum buck mulligan said
was he here
the bards fellowcountrymen john eglinton answered are rather tired perhaps of our brilliancies of theorising
i hear that an actress played hamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in dublin
vining held that the prince was a woman
has noone made him out to be an irishman
judge barton i believe is searching for some clues
he swears his highness not his lordship by saint patrick
the most brilliant of all is that story of wildes mr best said lifting his brilliant notebook
that portrait of mr w h where he proves that the sonnets were written by a willie hughes a man all hues
for willie hughes is it not
the quaker librarian asked
or hughie wills
mr william himself
w h who am i
i mean for willie hughes mr best said amending his gloss easily
of course its all paradox dont you know hughes and hews and hues the colour but its so typical the way he works it out
its the very essence of wilde dont you know
the light touch
his glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled a blond ephebe
tame essence of wilde

the quaker librarian was asking
the mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious
they talked seriously of mockers seriousness
buck mulligans again heavy face eyed stephen awhile
then his head wagging he came near drew a folded telegram from his pocket
his mobile lips read smiling with new delight
telegram
he said
wonderful inspiration
telegram
a papal bull
he sat on a corner of the unlit desk reading aloud joyfully  the sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done signed dedalus

joyfully he thrust message and envelope into a pocket but keened in a querulous brogue  its what im telling you mister honey its queer and sick we were haines and myself the time himself brought it in
twas murmur we did for a gallus potion would rouse a friar im thinking and he limp with leching
and we one hour and two hours and three hours in connerys sitting civil waiting for pints apiece
he wailed  and we to be there mavrone and you to be unbeknownst sending us your conglomerations the way we to have our tongues out a yard long like the drouthy clerics do be fainting for a pussful
stephen laughed
quickly warningfully buck mulligan bent down
the tramper synge is looking for you he said to murder you
he heard you pissed on his halldoor in glasthule
hes out in pampooties to murder you
me
stephen exclaimed
that was your contribution to literature
buck mulligan gleefully bent back laughing to the dark eavesdropping ceiling
murder you
he laughed

what is it
theres a gentleman here sir the attendant said coming forward and offering a card
from the freeman he wants to see the files of the kilkenny people for last year
certainly certainly certainly
is the gentleman
he took the eager card glanced not saw laid down unglanced looked asked creaked asked  is he

if you just follow the atten or please allow me

the door closed

buck mulligan cried
he jumped up and snatched the card
whats his name
ikey moses

he rattled on  jehovah collector of prepuces is no more
i found him over in the museum where i went to hail the foamborn aphrodite
the greek mouth that has never been twisted in prayer
every day we must do homage to her
life of life thy lips enkindle  suddenly he turned to stephen  he knows you
he knows your old fellow
o i fear me he is greeker than the greeks
his pale galilean eyes were upon her mesial groove
venus kallipyge
o the thunder of those loins
the god pursuing the maiden hid
we want to hear more john eglinton decided with mr bests approval
we begin to be interested in mrs s till now we had thought of her if at all as a patient griselda a penelope stayathome
antisthenes pupil of gorgias stephen said took the palm of beauty from kyrios menelaus brooddam argive helen the wooden mare of troy in whom a score of heroes slept and handed it to poor penelope
twenty years he lived in london and during part of that time he drew a salary equal to that of the lord chancellor of ireland

you know manninghams story of the burghers wife who bade dick burbage to her bed after she had seen him in richard iii and how shakespeare overhearing without more ado about nothing took the cow by the horns and when burbage came knocking at the gate answered from the capons blankets william the conqueror came before richard iii

but all those twenty years what do you suppose poor penelope in stratford was doing behind the diamond panes

lids of junos eyes violets
he walks
one life is all

afar in a reek of lust and squalor hands are laid on whiteness
buck mulligan rapped john eglintons desk sharply
whom do you suspect
he challenged
say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets
once spurned twice spurned
but the court wanton spurned him for a lord his dearmylove
love that dare not speak its name
as an englishman you mean john sturdy eglinton put in he loved a lord
old wall where sudden lizards flash
at charenton i watched them
it seems so stephen said when he wants to do for him and for all other and singular uneared wombs the holy office an ostler does for the stallion
maybe like socrates he had a midwife to mother as he had a shrew to wife
but she the giglot wanton did not break a bedvow
two deeds are rank in that ghosts mind a broken vow and the dullbrained yokel on whom her favour has declined deceased husbands brother
sweet ann i take it was hot in the blood
once a wooer twice a wooer
stephen turned boldly in his chair
the burden of proof is with you not with me he said frowning
if you deny that in the fifth scene of hamlet he has branded her with infamy tell me why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour years between the day she married him and the day she buried him
all those women saw their men down and under mary her goodman john ann her poor dear willun when he went and died on her raging that he was the first to go joan her four brothers judith her husband and all her sons susan her husband too while susans daughter elizabeth to use granddaddys words wed her second having killed her first
o yes mention there is
in the years when he was living richly in royal london to pay a debt she had to borrow forty shillings from her fathers shepherd
explain you then
explain the swansong too wherein he has commended her to posterity
he faced their silence
to whom thus eglinton you mean the will
but that has been explained i believe by jurists
she was entitled to her widows dower at common law
his legal knowledge was great our judges tell us
him satan fleers mocker             and therefore he left out her name from the first draft but he did not leave out the presents for his granddaughter for his daughters for his sister for his old cronies in stratford and in london
and therefore when he was urged as i believe to name her he left her his secondbest bed
punkt  leftherhis secondbest leftherhis bestabed secabest leftabed
woa
pretty countryfolk had few chattels then john eglinton observed as they have still if our peasant plays are true to type
he was a rich country gentleman stephen said with a coat of arms and landed estate at stratford and a house in ireland yard a capitalist shareholder a bill promoter a tithefarmer
why did he not leave her his best bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in peace
it is clear that there were two beds a best and a secondbest mr secondbest best said finely
separatio a mensa et a thalamo bettered buck mulligan and was smiled on
antiquity mentions famous beds second eglinton puckered bedsmiling
let me think
antiquity mentions that stagyrite schoolurchin and bald heathen sage stephen said who when dying in exile frees and endows his slaves pays tribute to his elders wills to be laid in earth near the bones of his dead wife and bids his friends be kind to an old mistress dont forget nell gwynn herpyllis and let her live in his villa
do you mean he died so
mr best asked with slight concern
i mean  he died dead drunk buck mulligan capped
a quart of ale is a dish for a king
o i must tell you what dowden said
what
asked besteglinton
william shakespeare and company limited
the peoples william
for terms apply e dowden highfield house  lovely
buck mulligan suspired amorously
i asked him what he thought of the charge of pederasty brought against the bard
he lifted his hands and said all we can say is that life ran very high in those days lovely
catamite
the sense of beauty leads us astray said beautifulinsadness best to ugling eglinton
steadfast john replied severe  the doctor can tell us what those words mean
you cannot eat your cake and have it
sayest thou so
will they wrest from us from me the palm of beauty
and the sense of property stephen said
he drew shylock out of his own long pocket
the son of a maltjobber and moneylender he was himself a cornjobber and moneylender with ten tods of corn hoarded in the famine riots
his borrowers are no doubt those divers of worship mentioned by chettle falstaff who reported his uprightness of dealing
he sued a fellowplayer for the price of a few bags of malt and exacted his pound of flesh in interest for every money lent
how else could aubreys ostler and callboy get rich quick
all events brought grist to his mill
shylock chimes with the jewbaiting that followed the hanging and quartering of the queens leech lopez his jews heart being plucked forth while the sheeny was yet alive hamlet and macbeth with the coming to the throne of a scotch philosophaster with a turn for witchroasting
the lost armada is his jeer in loves labour lost

there he keened a wailing rune
pogue mahone
acushla machree its destroyed we are from this day
its destroyed we are surely
all smiled their smiles
saint thomas stephen smiling said whose gorbellied works i enjoy reading in the original writing of incest from a standpoint different from that of the new viennese school mr magee spoke of likens it in his wise and curious way to an avarice of the emotions
he means that the love so given to one near in blood is covetously withheld from some stranger who it may be hungers for it
jews whom christians tax with avarice are of all races the most given to intermarriage
accusations are made in anger
the christian laws which built up the hoards of the jews for whom as for the lollards storm was shelter bound their affections too with hoops of steel
whether these be sins or virtues old nobodaddy will tell us at doomsday leet
but a man who holds so tightly to what he calls his rights over what he calls his debts will hold tightly also to what he calls his rights over her whom he calls his wife
no sir smile neighbour shall covet his ox or his wife or his manservant or his maidservant or his jackass
or his jennyass buck mulligan antiphoned
gentle will is being roughly handled gentle mr best said gently
which will
gagged sweetly buck mulligan
we are getting mixed
the will to live john eglinton philosophised for poor ann wills widow is the will to die
requiescat stephen prayed
what of all the will to do
it has vanished long ago  she lies laid out in stark stiffness in that secondbest bed the mobled queen even though you prove that a bed in those days was as rare as a motorcar is now and that its carvings were the wonder of seven parishes
in old age she takes up with gospellers one stayed with her at new place and drank a quart of sack the town council paid for but in which bed he slept it skills not to ask and heard she had a soul
she read or had read to her his chapbooks preferring them to the merry wives and loosing her nightly waters on the jordan she thought over hooks and eyes for believers breeches and the most spiritual snuffbox to make the most devout souls sneeze
venus has twisted her lips in prayer

a father stephen said battling against hopelessness is a necessary evil
he wrote the play in the months that followed his fathers death
if you hold that he a greying man with two marriageable daughters with thirtyfive years of life nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita with fifty of experience is the beardless undergraduate from wittenberg then you must hold that his seventyyear old mother is the lustful queen
no
the corpse of john shakespeare does not walk the night
from hour to hour it rots and rots
he rests disarmed of fatherhood having devised that mystical estate upon his son
boccaccios calandrino was the first and last man who felt himself with child
fatherhood in the sense of conscious begetting is unknown to man
it is a mystical estate an apostolic succession from only begetter to only begotten
on that mystery and not on the madonna which the cunning italian intellect flung to the mob of europe the church is founded and founded irremovably because founded like the world macro and microcosm upon the void
upon incertitude upon unlikelihood

the bulldog of aquin with whom no word shall be impossible refutes him
well if the father who has not a son be not a father can the son who has not a father be a son
when rutlandbaconsouthamptonshakespeare or another poet of the same name in the comedy of errors wrote hamlet he was not the father of his own son merely but being no more a son he was and felt himself the father of all his race the father of his own grandfather the father of his unborn grandson who by the same token never was born for nature as mr magee understands her abhors perfection

as for his family stephen said his mothers name lives in the forest of arden
her death brought from him the scene with volumnia in coriolanus his boysons death is the deathscene of young arthur in king john hamlet the black prince is hamnet shakespeare

best i hope edmund is going to catch it
i dont want richard my name   laughter  quakerlyster a tempo but he that filches from me my good name  stephen stringendo he has hidden his own name a fair name william in the plays a super here a clown there as a painter of old italy set his face in a dark corner of his canvas
he has revealed it in the sonnets where there is will in overplus
like john ogaunt his name is dear to him as dear as the coat and crest he toadied for on a bend sable a spear or steeled argent honorificabilitudinitatibus dearer than his glory of greatest shakescene in the country

the third brother that always marries the sleeping beauty and wins the best prize
best of best brothers

the quaker librarian springhalted near
i should like to know he said which brother you
i understand you to suggest there was misconduct with one of the brothers
but perhaps i am anticipating
he caught himself in the act looked at all refrained

john eglinton touched the foil
come he said
let us hear what you have to say of richard and edmund
you kept them for the last didnt you
in asking you to remember those two noble kinsmen nuncle richie and nuncle edmund stephen answered i feel i am asking too much perhaps
a brother is as easily forgotten as an umbrella

you will say those names were already in the chronicles from which he took the stuff of his plays
why did he take them rather than others
richard a whoreson crookback misbegotten makes love to a widowed ann whats in a name
 woos and wins her a whoreson merry widow
richard the conqueror third brother came after william the conquered
the other four acts of that play hang limply from that first
of all his kings richard is the only king unshielded by shakespeares reverence the angel of the world
why is the underplot of king lear in which edmund figures lifted out of sidneys arcadia and spatchcocked on to a celtic legend older than history
that was wills way john eglinton defended
we should not now combine a norse saga with an excerpt from a novel by george meredith
que voulezvous moore would say
he puts bohemia on the seacoast and makes ulysses quote aristotle
why
stephen answered himself
because the theme of the false or the usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to shakespeare what the poor are not always with him
the note of banishment banishment from the heart banishment from home sounds uninterruptedly from the two gentlemen of verona onward till prospero breaks his staff buries it certain fathoms in the earth and drowns his book
it doubles itself in the middle of his life reflects itself in another repeats itself protasis epitasis catastasis catastrophe
it repeats itself again when he is near the grave when his married daughter susan chip of the old block is accused of adultery
but it was the original sin that darkened his understanding weakened his will and left in him a strong inclination to evil
the words are those of my lords bishops of maynooth
an original sin and like original sin committed by another in whose sin he too has sinned
it is between the lines of his last written words it is petrified on his tombstone under which her four bones are not to be laid
age has not withered it
beauty and peace have not done it away
it is in infinite variety everywhere in the world he has created in much ado about nothing twice in as you like it in the tempest in hamlet in measure for measureand in all the other plays which i have not read
he laughed to free his mind from his minds bondage
judge eglinton summed up
the truth is midway he affirmed
he is the ghost and the prince
he is all in all
he is stephen said
the boy of act one is the mature man of act five
all in all
in cymbeline in othello he is bawd and cuckold
he acts and is acted on
lover of an ideal or a perversion like jos he kills the real carmen
his unremitting intellect is the hornmad iago ceaselessly willing that the moor in him shall suffer
cuckoo
cuckoo
cuck mulligan clucked lewdly
o word of fear
dark dome received reverbed
and what a character is iago
undaunted john eglinton exclaimed
when all is said dumas fils or is it dumas pre
 is right
after god shakespeare has created most
man delights him not nor woman neither stephen said
he returns after a life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born where he has always been man and boy a silent witness and there his journey of life ended he plants his mulberrytree in the earth
then dies
the motion is ended
gravediggers bury hamlet pre and hamlet fils a king and a prince at last in death with incidental music
and what though murdered and betrayed bewept by all frail tender hearts for dane or dubliner sorrow for the dead is the only husband from whom they refuse to be divorced
if you like the epilogue look long on it prosperous prospero the good man rewarded lizzie grandpas lump of love and nuncle richie the bad man taken off by poetic justice to the place where the bad niggers go
strong curtain
he found in the world without as actual what was in his world within as possible

we walk through ourselves meeting robbers ghosts giants old men young men wives widows brothersinlove but always meeting ourselves
the playwright who wrote the folio of this world and wrote it badly he gave us light first and the sun two days later the lord of things as they are whom the most roman of catholics call dio boia hangman god is doubtless all in all in all of us ostler and butcher and would be bawd and cuckold too but that in the economy of heaven foretold by hamlet there are no more marriages glorified man an androgynous angel being a wife unto himself

you ought to make it a dialogue dont you know like the platonic dialogues wilde wrote

well in that case he said i dont see why you should expect payment for it since you dont believe it yourself
dowden believes there is some mystery in hamlet but will say no more

the curving balustrade smoothsliding mincius
puck mulligan panamahelmeted went step by step iambing trolling       john eglinton my jo john      why wont you wed a wife
he spluttered to the air  o the chinless chinaman

i forgot he  longworth and mcurdy atkinson were there  puck mulligan footed featly trilling       i hardly hear the purlieu cry      or a tommy talk as i pass one by      before my thoughts begin to run      on f mcurdy atkinson      the same that had the wooden leg      and that filibustering filibeg      that never dared to slake his drouth      magee that had the chinless mouth
being afraid to marry on earth      they masturbated for all they were worth
jest on

halted below me a quizzer looks at me

mournful mummer buck mulligan moaned
synge has left off wearing black to be like nature
only crows priests and english coal are black
a laugh tripped over his lips
longworth is awfully sick he said after what you wrote about that old hake gregory
o you inquisitional drunken jewjesuit
she gets you a job on the paper and then you go and slate her drivel to jaysus
couldnt you do the yeats touch
he went on and down mopping chanting with waving graceful arms  the most beautiful book that has come out of our country in my time
one thinks of homer
he stopped at the stairfoot
i have conceived a play for the mummers he said solemnly
the pillared moorish hall shadows entwined
gone the nine mens morrice with caps of indices
in sweetly varying voices buck mulligan read his tablet  everyman his own wife or a honeymoon in the hand a national immorality in three orgasms by ballocky mulligan   he turned a happy patchs smirk to stephen saying  the disguise i fear is thin
but listen
he read marcato  characters       toby tostoff a ruined pole      crab a bushranger      medical dick           and       two birds with one stone      medical davy       mother grogan a watercarrier      fresh nelly          and      rosalie the coalquay whore
he laughed lolling a to and fro head walking on followed by stephen and mirthfully he told the shadows souls of men  o the night in the camden hall when the daughters of erin had to lift their skirts to step over you as you lay in your mulberrycoloured multicoloured multitudinous vomit
the most innocent son of erin stephen said for whom they ever lifted them
about to pass through the doorway feeling one behind he stood aside

day
wheelbarrow sun over arch of bridge
a dark back went before them step of a pard down out by the gateway under portcullis barbs
they followed
offend me still
speak on
kind air defined the coigns of houses in kildare street
no birds
frail from the housetops two plumes of smoke ascended pluming and in a flaw of softness softly were blown
cease to strive
peace of the druid priests of cymbeline hierophantic from wide earth an altar
laud we the gods      and let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils      from our blessd altars
     the superior the very reverend john conmee s j reset his smooth watch in his interior pocket as he came down the presbytery steps
five to three
just nice time to walk to artane
what was that boys name again
dignam
yes
vere dignum et iustum est brother swan was the person to see
mr cunninghams letter
yes
oblige him if possible
good practical catholic useful at mission time
a onelegged sailor swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his crutches growled some notes
he jerked short before the convent of the sisters of charity and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the very reverend john conmee s j
father conmee blessed him in the sun for his purse held he knew one silver crown
father conmee crossed to mountjoy square
he thought but not for long of soldiers and sailors whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs ending their days in some pauper ward and of cardinal wolseys words if i had served my god as i have served my king he would not have abandoned me in my old days he walked by the treeshade of sunnywinking leaves and towards him came the wife of mr david sheehy mp
very well indeed father
and you father
father conmee was wonderfully well indeed
he would go to buxton probably for the waters
and her boys were they getting on well at belvedere
was that so
father conmee was very glad indeed to hear that
and mr sheehy himself
still in london
the house was still sitting to be sure it was
beautiful weather it was delightful indeed
yes it was very probable that father bernard vaughan would come again to preach
o yes a very great success
a wonderful man really
father conmee was very glad to see the wife of mr david sheehy mp
iooking so well and he begged to be remembered to mr david sheehy mp
yes he would certainly call
good afternoon mrs sheehy
father conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled as he took leave at the jet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun
and smiled yet again in going
he had cleaned his teeth he knew with arecanut paste
father conmee walked and walking smiled for he thought on father bernard vaughans droll eyes and cockney voice
pilate
wy dont you old back that owlin mob
a zealous man however
really he was
and really did great good in his way
beyond a doubt
he loved ireland he said and he loved the irish
of good family too would one think it
welsh were they not
o lest he forget
that letter to father provincial
father conmee stopped three little schoolboys at the corner of mountjoy square
yes they were from belvedere
the little house
aha
and were they good boys at school
o
that was very good now
and what was his name
jack sohan
and his name
ger
gallaher
and the other little man
his name was brunny lynam
o that was a very nice name to have
father conmee gave a letter from his breast to master brunny lynam and pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of fitzgibbon street
but mind you dont post yourself into the box little man he said
the boys sixeyed father conmee and laughed  o sir
well let me see if you can post a letter father conmee said
master brunny lynam ran across the road and put father conmees letter to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox
father conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along mountjoy square east
mr denis j maginni professor of dancing c in silk hat slate frockcoat with silk facings white kerchief tie tight lavender trousers canary gloves and pointed patent boots walking with grave deportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady maxwell at the corner of dignams court
was that not mrs mguinness
mrs mguinness stately silverhaired bowed to father conmee from the farther footpath along which she sailed
and father conmee smiled and saluted
how did she do
a fine carriage she had
like mary queen of scots something
and to think that she was a pawnbroker
well now
such a what should he say
such a queenly mien
father conmee walked down great charles street and glanced at the shutup free church on his left
the reverend t r greene ba
will dv
speak
the incumbent they called him
he felt it incumbent on him to say a few words
but one should be charitable
invincible ignorance
they acted according to their lights
father conmee turned the corner and walked along the north circular road
it was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important thoroughfare
surely there ought to be
a band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from richmond street
all raised untidy caps
father conmee greeted them more than once benignly
christian brother boys
father conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked
saint josephs church portland row
for aged and virtuous females
father conmee raised his hat to the blessed sacrament
virtuous but occasionally they were also badtempered
near aldborough house father conmee thought of that spendthrift nobleman
and now it was an office or something
father conmee began to walk along the north strand road and was saluted by mr william gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop
father conmee saluted mr william gallagher and perceived the odours that came from baconflitches and ample cools of butter
he passed grogans the tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful catastrophe in new york
in america those things were continually happening
unfortunate people to die like that unprepared
still an act of perfect contrition
father conmee went by daniel bergins publichouse against the window of which two unlabouring men lounged
they saluted him and were saluted
father conmee passed h j oneills funeral establishment where corny kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay
a constable on his beat saluted father conmee and father conmee saluted the constable
in youkstetters the porkbutchers father conmee observed pigs puddings white and black and red lie neatly curled in tubes
moored under the trees of charleville mall father conmee saw a turfbarge a towhorse with pendent head a bargeman with a hat of dirty straw seated amidships smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above him
it was idyllic and father conmee reflected on the providence of the creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor people
on newcomen bridge the very reverend john conmee s j of saint francis xaviers church upper gardiner street stepped on to an outward bound tram
off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend nicholas dudley c c of saint agathas church north william street on to newcomen bridge
at newcomen bridge father conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past mud island
father conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar a blue ticket tucked with care in the eye of one plump kid glove while four shillings a sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse
passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket
the solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to father conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap
father conmee liked cheerful decorum
it was a peaceful day
the gentleman with the glasses opposite father conmee had finished explaining and looked down
his wife father conmee supposed
a tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with the glasses
she raised her small gloved fist yawned ever so gently tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily sweetly
father conmee perceived her perfume in the car
he perceived also that the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the seat
father conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head
at annesley bridge the tram halted and when it was about to go an old woman rose suddenly from her place to alight
the conductor pulled the bellstrap to stay the car for her
she passed out with her basket and a marketnet and father conmee saw the conductor help her and net and basket down and father conmee thought that as she had nearly passed the end of the penny fare she was one of those good souls who had always to be told twice bless you my child that they have been absolved pray for me but they had so many worries in life so many cares poor creatures
from the hoardings mr eugene stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at father conmee
father conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and of his sermon on saint peter claver s j and the african mission and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their last hour came like a thief in the night
that book by the belgian jesuit le nombre des lus seemed to father conmee a reasonable plea
those were millions of human souls created by god in his own likeness to whom the faith had not dv
been brought
but they were gods souls created by god
it seemed to father conmee a pity that they should all be lost a waste if one might say
at the howth road stop father conmee alighted was saluted by the conductor and saluted in his turn
the malahide road was quiet
it pleased father conmee road and name
the joybells were ringing in gay malahide
lord talbot de malahide immediate hereditary lord admiral of malahide and the seas adjoining
then came the call to arms and she was maid wife and widow in one day
those were old worldish days loyal times in joyous townlands old times in the barony
father conmee walking thought of his little book old times in the barony and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of mary rochfort daughter of lord molesworth first countess of belvedere
a listless lady no more young walked alone the shore of lough ennel mary first countess of belvedere listlessly walking in the evening not startled when an otter plunged
who could know the truth
not the jealous lord belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed adultery fully eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris with her husbands brother
she would half confess if she had not all sinned as women did
only god knew and she and he her husbands brother
father conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence needed however for mans race on earth and of the ways of god which were not our ways
don john conmee walked and moved in times of yore
he was humane and honoured there
he bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom ceiled with full fruit clusters
and the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom noble to noble were impalmed by don john conmee
it was a charming day
the lychgate of a field showed father conmee breadths of cabbages curtseying to him with ample underleaves
the sky showed him a flock of small white clouds going slowly down the wind
moutonner the french said
a just and homely word
father conmee reading his office watched a flock of muttoning clouds over rathcoffey
his thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of clongowes field
he walked there reading in the evening and heard the cries of the boys lines at their play young cries in the quiet evening
he was their rector his reign was mild
father conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out
an ivory bookmark told him the page
nones
he should have read that before lunch
but lady maxwell had come
father conmee read in secret pater and ave and crossed his breast
deus in adiutorium  he walked calmly and read mutely the nones walking and reading till he came to res in beati immaculati principium verborum tuorum veritas in eternum omnia iudicia iustiti tu  a flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand
the young man raised his cap abruptly the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig
father conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his breviary
sin principes persecuti sunt me gratis et a verbis tuis formidavit cor meum             corny kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner
he pulled himself erect went to it and spinning it on its axle viewed its shape and brass furnishings
chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came to the doorway
there he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes and leaned against the doorcase looking idly out
father john conmee stepped into the dollymount tram on newcomen bridge
corny kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed his hat downtilted chewing his blade of hay
constable c on his beat stood to pass the time of day
thats a fine day mr kelleher
ay corny kelleher said
its very close the constable said
corny kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth while a generous white arm from a window in eccles street flung forth a coin
whats the best news
he asked
i seen that particular party last evening the constable said with bated breath
           a onelegged sailor crutched himself round macconnells corner skirting rabaiottis icecream car and jerked himself up eccles street
towards larry orourke in shirtsleeves in his doorway he growled unamiably  for england
he swung himself violently forward past katey and boody dedalus halted and growled  home and beauty  j j omolloys white careworn face was told that mr lambert was in the warehouse with a visitor
a stout lady stopped took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it into the cap held out to her
the sailor grumbled thanks glanced sourly at the unheeding windows sank his head and swung himself forward four strides
he halted and growled angrily  for england  two barefoot urchins sucking long liquorice laces halted near him gaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths
he swung himself forward in vigorous jerks halted lifted his head towards a window and bayed deeply  home and beauty  the gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two ceased
the blind of the window was drawn aside
a card unfurnished apartments slipped from the sash and fell
a plump bare generous arm shone was seen held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut shiftstraps
a womans hand flung forth a coin over the area railings
it fell on the path
one of the urchins ran to it picked it up and dropped it into the minstrels cap saying  there sir
           katey and boody dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteaming kitchen
did you put in the books
boody asked
maggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds twice with her potstick and wiped her brow
they wouldnt give anything on them she said
father conmee walked through clongowes fields his thinsocked ankles tickled by stubble
where did you try
boody asked
mguinnesss
boody stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table
bad cess to her big face
she cried
katey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes
whats in the pot
she asked
shirts maggy said
boody cried angrily  crickey is there nothing for us to eat
katey lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt asked  and whats in this
a heavy fume gushed in answer
peasoup maggy said
where did you get it
katey asked
sister mary patrick maggy said
the lacquey rang his bell
barang
boody sat down at the table and said hungrily  give us it here
maggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl
katey sitting opposite boody said quietly as her fingertip lifted to her mouth random crumbs  a good job we have that much
wheres dilly
gone to meet father maggy said
boody breaking big chunks of bread into the yellow soup added  our father who art not in heaven
maggy pouring yellow soup in kateys bowl exclaimed  boody
for shame
a skiff a crumpled throwaway elijah is coming rode lightly down the liffey under loopline bridge shooting the rapids where water chafed around the bridgepiers sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains between the customhouse old dock and georges quay
           the blond girl in thorntons bedded the wicker basket with rustling fibre
blazes boylan handed her the bottle swathed in pink tissue paper and a small jar
put these in first will you
he said
yes sir the blond girl said
and the fruit on top
thatll do game ball blazes boylan said
she bestowed fat pears neatly head by tail and among them ripe shamefaced peaches
blazes boylan walked here and there in new tan shoes about the fruitsmelling shop lifting fruits young juicy crinkled and plump red tomatoes sniffing smells
h e l ys filed before him tallwhitehatted past tangier lane plodding towards their goal
he turned suddenly from a chip of strawberries drew a gold watch from his fob and held it at its chains length
can you send them by tram
now
a darkbacked figure under merchants arch scanned books on the hawkers cart
certainly sir
is it in the city
o yes blazes boylan said
ten minutes
the blond girl handed him a docket and pencil
will you write the address sir
blazes boylan at the counter wrote and pushed the docket to her
send it at once will you
he said
its for an invalid
yes sir
i will sir
blazes boylan rattled merry money in his trousers pocket
whats the damage
he asked
the blond girls slim fingers reckoned the fruits
blazes boylan looked into the cut of her blouse
a young pullet
he took a red carnation from the tall stemglass
this for me
he asked gallantly
the blond girl glanced sideways at him got up regardless with his tie a bit crooked blushing
yes sir she said
bending archly she reckoned again fat pears and blushing peaches
blazes boylan looked in her blouse with more favour the stalk of the red flower between his smiling teeth
may i say a word to your telephone missy
he asked roguishly
           ma almidano artifoni said
he gazed over stephens shoulder at goldsmiths knobby poll
two carfuls of tourists passed slowly their women sitting fore gripping the handrests
palefaces
mens arms frankly round their stunted forms
they looked from trinity to the blind columned porch of the bank of ireland where pigeons roocoocooed
anchio ho avuto di queste idee almidano artifoni said quand ero giovine come lei
eppoi mi sono convinto che il mondo  una bestia
 peccato
perch la sua voce sarebbe un cespite di rendita via
invece lei si sacrifica  sacrifizio incruento stephen said smiling swaying his ashplant in slow swingswong from its midpoint lightly
speriamo the round mustachioed face said pleasantly
ma dia retta a me
ci rifletta
by the stern stone hand of grattan bidding halt an inchicore tram unloaded straggling highland soldiers of a band
ci rifletter stephen said glancing down the solid trouserleg
ma sul serio eh almidano artifoni said
his heavy hand took stephens firmly
human eyes
they gazed curiously an instant and turned quickly towards a dalkey tram
eccolo almidano artifoni said in friendly haste
venga a trovarmi e ci pensi
addio caro  arrivederla maestro stephen said raising his hat when his hand was freed
e grazie  di che almidano artifoni said
scusi eh
tante belle cose  almidano artifoni holding up a baton of rolled music as a signal trotted on stout trousers after the dalkey tram
in vain he trotted signalling in vain among the rout of barekneed gillies smuggling implements of music through trinity gates
           miss dunne hid the capel street library copy of the woman in white far back in her drawer and rolled a sheet of gaudy notepaper into her typewriter
too much mystery business in it
is he in love with that one marion
change it and get another by mary cecil haye
the disk shot down the groove wobbled a while ceased and ogled them six
miss dunne clicked on the keyboard   june 
five tallwhitehatted sandwichmen between monypenys corner and the slab where wolfe tones statue was not eeled themselves turning h e l ys and plodded back as they had come
then she stared at the large poster of marie kendall charming soubrette and listlessly lolling scribbled on the jotter sixteens and capital esses
mustard hair and dauby cheeks
shes not nicelooking is she
the way shes holding up her bit of a skirt
wonder will that fellow be at the band tonight
if i could get that dressmaker to make a concertina skirt like susy nagles
they kick out grand
shannon and all the boatclub swells never took his eyes off her
hope to goodness he wont keep me here till seven
the telephone rang rudely by her ear

           two pink faces turned in the flare of the tiny torch
whos that
ned lambert asked
is that crotty
ringabella and crosshaven a voice replied groping for foothold
hello jack is that yourself
ned lambert said raising in salute his pliant lath among the flickering arches
come on
mind your steps there
the vesta in the clergymans uplifted hand consumed itself in a long soft flame and was let fall
at their feet its red speck died and mouldy air closed round them
how interesting
a refined accent said in the gloom
yes sir ned lambert said heartily
we are standing in the historic council chamber of saint marys abbey where silken thomas proclaimed himself a rebel in 
this is the most historic spot in all dublin
omadden burke is going to write something about it one of these days
the old bank of ireland was over the way till the time of the union and the original jews temple was here too before they built their synagogue over in adelaide road
you were never here before jack were you
no ned
he rode down through dame walk the refined accent said if my memory serves me
the mansion of the kildares was in thomas court
thats right ned lambert said
thats quite right sir
if you will be so kind then the clergyman said the next time to allow me perhaps  certainly ned lambert said
bring the camera whenever you like
ill get those bags cleared away from the windows
you can take it from here or from here
in the still faint light he moved about tapping with his lath the piled seedbags and points of vantage on the floor
from a long face a beard and gaze hung on a chessboard
im deeply obliged mr lambert the clergyman said
i wont trespass on your valuable time  youre welcome sir ned lambert said
drop in whenever you like
next week say
can you see
yes yes
good afternoon mr lambert
very pleased to have met you
pleasure is mine sir ned lambert answered
he followed his guest to the outlet and then whirled his lath away among the pillars
with j j omolloy he came forth slowly into marys abbey where draymen were loading floats with sacks of carob and palmnut meal oconnor wexford
he stood to read the card in his hand
the reverend hugh c love rathcoffey
present address saint michaels sallins
nice young chap he is
hes writing a book about the fitzgeralds he told me
hes well up in history faith
the young woman with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig
i thought you were at a new gunpowder plot j j omolloy said
ned lambert cracked his fingers in the air

he cried
i forgot to tell him that one about the earl of kildare after he set fire to cashel cathedral
you know that one
im bloody sorry i did it says he but i declare to god i thought the archbishop was inside he mightnt like it though
what
god ill tell him anyhow
that was the great earl the fitzgerald mor
hot members they were all of them the geraldines
the horses he passed started nervously under their slack harness
he slapped a piebald haunch quivering near him and cried  woa sonny
he turned to j j omolloy and asked  well jack
what is it
whats the trouble
wait awhile
hold hard
with gaping mouth and head far back he stood still and after an instant sneezed loudly
chow
he said

the dust from those sacks j j omolloy said politely
no ned lambert gasped i caught a cold night before blast your soul night before last and there was a hell of a lot of draught
he held his handkerchief ready for the coming  i was glasnevin this morning poor little what do you call him

mother of moses
           tom rochford took the top disk from the pile he clasped against his claret waistcoat
see
he said
say its turn six
in here see
turn now on
he slid it into the left slot for them
it shot down the groove wobbled a while ceased ogling them six
lawyers of the past haughty pleading beheld pass from the consolidated taxing office to nisi prius court richie goulding carrying the costbag of goulding collis and ward and heard rustling from the admiralty division of kings bench to the court of appeal an elderly female with false teeth smiling incredulously and a black silk skirt of great amplitude

he said

he showed them the rising column of disks on the right

tom rochford said
he slid in a disk for himself and watched it shoot wobble ogle stop four

goodnight mcoy said abruptly

but how does it work here tommy
he asked
tooraloo lenehan said

he followed mcoy out across the tiny square of crampton court
hes a hero he said simply
i know mcoy said
the drain you mean
drain
lenehan said
it was down a manhole
they passed dan lowrys musichall where marie kendall charming soubrette smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile
going down the path of sycamore street beside the empire musichall lenehan showed mcoy how the whole thing was
one of those manholes like a bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it half choked with sewer gas
down went tom rochford anyhow bookys vest and all with the rope round him
and be damned but he got the rope round the poor devil and the two were hauled up
the act of a hero he said
at the dolphin they halted to allow the ambulance car to gallop past them for jervis street
this way he said walking to the right
i want to pop into lynams to see sceptres starting price

mcoy peered into marcus tertius moses sombre office then at oneills clock
after three he said

while he waited in temple bar mcoy dodged a banana peel with gentle pushes of his toe from the path to the gutter
fellow might damn easy get a nasty fall there coming along tight in the dark
the gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregal cavalcade
even money lenehan said returning
i knocked against bantam lyons in there going to back a bloody horse someone gave him that hasnt an earthly
through here
they went up the steps and under merchants arch
a darkbacked figure scanned books on the hawkers cart
there he is lenehan said
wonder what hes buying mcoy said glancing behind
leopoldo or the bloom is on the rye lenehan said
hes dead nuts on sales mcoy said
i was with him one day and he bought a book from an old one in liffey street for two bob
there were fine plates in it worth double the money the stars and the moon and comets with long tails
astronomy it was about
lenehan laughed
ill tell you a damn good one about comets tails he said
come over in the sun
they crossed to the metal bridge and went along wellington quay by the riverwall
master patrick aloysius dignam came out of mangans late fehrenbachs carrying a pound and a half of porksteaks
there was a long spread out at glencree reformatory lenehan said eagerly
the annual dinner you know
boiled shirt affair
the lord mayor was there val dillon it was and sir charles cameron and dan dawson spoke and there was music
bartell darcy sang and benjamin dollard  i know mcoy broke in
my missus sang there once
did she
lenehan said
a card unfurnished apartments reappeared on the windowsash of number  eccles street
he checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh
but wait till i tell you he said
delahunt of camden street had the catering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher
bloom and the wife were there
lashings of stuff we put up port wine and sherry and curacoa to which we did ample justice
fast and furious it was
after liquids came solids
cold joints galore and mince pies  i know mcoy said
the year the missus was there  lenehan linked his arm warmly
but wait till i tell you he said
we had a midnight lunch too after all the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue oclock the morning after the night before
coming home it was a gorgeous winters night on the featherbed mountain
bloom and chris callinan were on one side of the car and i was with the wife on the other
we started singing glees and duets lo the early beam of morning
she was well primed with a good load of delahunts port under her bellyband
every jolt the bloody car gave i had her bumping up against me
hells delights
she has a fine pair god bless her
like that
he held his caved hands a cubit from him frowning  i was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time
know what i mean
his hands moulded ample curves of air
he shut his eyes tight in delight his body shrinking and blew a sweet chirp from his lips
the lad stood to attention anyhow he said with a sigh
shes a gamey mare and no mistake
bloom was pointing out all the stars and the comets in the heavens to chris callinan and the jarvey the great bear and hercules and the dragon and the whole jingbang lot
but by god i was lost so to speak in the milky way
he knows them all faith
at last she spotted a weeny weeshy one miles away
and what star is that poldy says she
by god she had bloom cornered
that one is it says chris callinan sure thats only what you might call a pinprick by god he wasnt far wide of the mark
lenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall panting with soft laughter
im weak he gasped
mcoys white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave
lenehan walked on again
he lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead rapidly
he glanced sideways in the sunlight at mcoy
hes a cultured allroundman bloom is he said seriously
hes not one of your common or garden you know theres a touch of the artist about old bloom
           mr bloom turned over idly pages of the awful disclosures of maria monk then of aristotles masterpiece crooked botched print
plates infants cuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of slaughtered cows
lots of them like that at this moment all over the world
all butting with their skulls to get out of it
child born every minute somewhere
mrs purefoy
he laid both books aside and glanced at the third tales of the ghetto by leopold von sacher masoch
that i had he said pushing it by
the shopman let two volumes fall on the counter
them are two good ones he said
onions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth
he bent to make a bundle of the other books hugged them against his unbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain
on oconnell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment and gay apparel of mr denis j maginni professor of dancing c  mr bloom alone looked at the titles
fair tyrants by james lovebirch
know the kind that is
had it
yes
he opened it
thought so
a womans voice behind the dingy curtain
listen the man
no she wouldnt like that much
got her it once
he read the other title sweets of sin
more in her line
let us see
he read where his finger opened
all the dollarbills her husband gave her were spent in the stores on wondrous gowns and costliest frillies
for him
for raoul  yes
this
here
try
her mouth glued on his in a luscious voluptuous kiss while his hands felt for the opulent curves inside her dshabill  yes
take this
the end
you are late he spoke hoarsely eying her with a suspicious glare
the beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap displaying her queenly shoulders and heaving embonpoint
an imperceptible smile played round her perfect lips as she turned to him calmly
mr bloom read again the beautiful woman  warmth showered gently over him cowing his flesh
flesh yielded amply amid rumpled clothes whites of eyes swooning up
his nostrils arched themselves for prey
melting breast ointments for him
for raoul
armpits oniony sweat
fishgluey slime her heaving embonpoint
feel
press
crished
sulphur dung of lions
young
young
an elderly female no more young left the building of the courts of chancery kings bench exchequer and common pleas having heard in the lord chancellors court the case in lunacy of potterton in the admiralty division the summons exparte motion of the owners of the lady cairns versus the owners of the barque mona in the court of appeal reservation of judgment in the case of harvey versus the ocean accident and guarantee corporation
phlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop bulging out the dingy curtains
the shopmans uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven reddened face coughing
he raked his throat rudely puked phlegm on the floor
he put his boot on what he had spat wiping his sole along it and bent showing a rawskinned crown scantily haired
mr bloom beheld it
mastering his troubled breath he said  ill take this one
the shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum
sweets of sin he said tapping on it
thats a good one
           the lacquey by the door of dillons auctionrooms shook his handbell twice again and viewed himself in the chalked mirror of the cabinet
dilly dedalus loitering by the curbstone heard the beats of the bell the cries of the auctioneer within
four and nine
those lovely curtains
five shillings
cosy curtains
selling new at two guineas
any advance on five shillings
going for five shillings
the lacquey lifted his handbell and shook it  barang
bang of the lastlap bell spurred the halfmile wheelmen to their sprint
j
a jackson w e wylie a munro and h t gahan their stretched necks wagging negotiated the curve by the college library
mr dedalus tugging a long moustache came round from williamss row
he halted near his daughter
its time for you she said
stand up straight for the love of the lord jesus mr dedalus said
are you trying to imitate your uncle john the cornetplayer head upon shoulder
melancholy god
dilly shrugged her shoulders
mr dedalus placed his hands on them and held them back
stand up straight girl he said
youll get curvature of the spine
do you know what you look like
he let his head sink suddenly down and forward hunching his shoulders and dropping his underjaw
give it up father dilly said
all the people are looking at you
mr dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache
did you get any money
dilly asked
where would i get money
mr dedalus said
there is noone in dublin would lend me fourpence
you got some dilly said looking in his eyes
how do you know that
mr dedalus asked his tongue in his cheek
mr kernan pleased with the order he had booked walked boldly along jamess street
i know you did dilly answered
were you in the scotch house now
i was not then mr dedalus said smiling
was it the little nuns taught you to be so saucy
here
he handed her a shilling
see if you can do anything with that he said
i suppose you got five dilly said
give me more than that
wait awhile mr dedalus said threateningly
youre like the rest of them are you
an insolent pack of little bitches since your poor mother died
but wait awhile
youll all get a short shrift and a long day from me
low blackguardism
im going to get rid of you
wouldnt care if i was stretched out stiff
hes dead
the man upstairs is dead
he left her and walked on
dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat
well what is it
he said stopping
the lacquey rang his bell behind their backs
barang
curse your bloody blatant soul mr dedalus cried turning on him
the lacquey aware of comment shook the lolling clapper of his bell but feebly  bang
mr dedalus stared at him
watch him he said
its instructive
i wonder will he allow us to talk
you got more than that father dilly said
im going to show you a little trick mr dedalus said
ill leave you all where jesus left the jews
look theres all i have
i got two shillings from jack power and i spent twopence for a shave for the funeral
he drew forth a handful of copper coins nervously
cant you look for some money somewhere
dilly said
mr dedalus thought and nodded
i will he said gravely
i looked all along the gutter in oconnell street
ill try this one now
youre very funny dilly said grinning
here mr dedalus said handing her two pennies
get a glass of milk for yourself and a bun or a something
ill be home shortly
he put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on
the viceregal cavalcade passed greeted by obsequious policemen out of parkgate
im sure you have another shilling dilly said
the lacquey banged loudly
mr dedalus amid the din walked off murmuring to himself with a pursing mincing mouth gently  the little nuns
nice little things
o sure they wouldnt do anything
o sure they wouldnt really
is it little sister monica
           from the sundial towards jamess gate walked mr kernan pleased with the order he had booked for pulbrook robertson boldly along jamess street past shackletons offices
got round him all right
how do you do mr crimmins
first rate sir
i was afraid you might be up in your other establishment in pimlico
how are things going
just keeping alive
lovely weather were having
yes indeed
good for the country
those farmers are always grumbling
ill just take a thimbleful of your best gin mr crimmins
a small gin sir
yes sir
terrible affair that general slocum explosion
terrible terrible
a thousand casualties
and heartrending scenes
men trampling down women and children
most brutal thing
what do they say was the cause
spontaneous combustion
most scandalous revelation
not a single lifeboat would float and the firehose all burst
what i cant understand is how the inspectors ever allowed a boat like that now youre talking straight mr crimmins
you know why
palm oil
is that a fact
without a doubt
well now look at that
and america they say is the land of the free
i thought we were bad here
i smiled at him
america i said quietly just like that
what is it
the sweepings of every country including our own
isnt that true thats a fact
graft my dear sir
well of course where theres money going theres always someone to pick it up
saw him looking at my frockcoat
dress does it
nothing like a dressy appearance
bowls them over
hello simon father cowley said
how are things
hello bob old man mr dedalus answered stopping
mr kernan halted and preened himself before the sloping mirror of peter kennedy hairdresser
stylish coat beyond a doubt
scott of dawson street
well worth the half sovereign i gave neary for it
never built under three guineas
fits me down to the ground
some kildare street club toff had it probably
john mulligan the manager of the hibernian bank gave me a very sharp eye yesterday on carlisle bridge as if he remembered me
aham
must dress the character for those fellows
knight of the road
gentleman
and now mr crimmins may we have the honour of your custom again sir
the cup that cheers but not inebriates as the old saying has it
north wall and sir john rogersons quay with hulls and anchorchains sailing westward sailed by a skiff a crumpled throwaway rocked on the ferrywash elijah is coming
mr kernan glanced in farewell at his image
high colour of course
grizzled moustache
returned indian officer
bravely he bore his stumpy body forward on spatted feet squaring his shoulders
is that ned lamberts brother over the way sam
what
yes
hes as like it as damn it
no
the windscreen of that motorcar in the sun there
just a flash like that
damn like him
aham
hot spirit of juniper juice warmed his vitals and his breath
good drop of gin that was
his frocktails winked in bright sunshine to his fat strut
down there emmet was hanged drawn and quartered
greasy black rope
dogs licking the blood off the street when the lord lieutenants wife drove by in her noddy
bad times those were
well well
over and done with
great topers too
fourbottle men
let me see
is he buried in saint michans
or no there was a midnight burial in glasnevin
corpse brought in through a secret door in the wall
dignam is there now
went out in a puff
well well
better turn down here
make a detour
mr kernan turned and walked down the slope of watling street by the corner of guinnesss visitors waitingroom
outside the dublin distillers companys stores an outside car without fare or jarvey stood the reins knotted to the wheel
damn dangerous thing
some tipperary bosthoon endangering the lives of the citizens
runaway horse
denis breen with his tomes weary of having waited an hour in john henry mentons office led his wife over oconnell bridge bound for the office of messrs collis and ward
mr kernan approached island street
times of the troubles
must ask ned lambert to lend me those reminiscences of sir jonah barrington
when you look back on it all now in a kind of retrospective arrangement
gaming at dalys
no cardsharping then
one of those fellows got his hand nailed to the table by a dagger
somewhere here lord edward fitzgerald escaped from major sirr
stables behind moira house
damn good gin that was
fine dashing young nobleman
good stock of course
that ruffian that sham squire with his violet gloves gave him away
course they were on the wrong side
they rose in dark and evil days
fine poem that is ingram
they were gentlemen
ben dollard does sing that ballad touchingly
masterly rendition
at the siege of ross did my father fall  a cavalcade in easy trot along pembroke quay passed outriders leaping leaping in their in their saddles
frockcoats
cream sunshades
mr kernan hurried forward blowing pursily
his excellency
too bad
just missed that by a hair
damn it
what a pity
           stephen dedalus watched through the webbed window the lapidarys fingers prove a timedulled chain
dust webbed the window and the showtrays
dust darkened the toiling fingers with their vulture nails
dust slept on dull coils of bronze and silver lozenges of cinnabar on rubies leprous and winedark stones
born all in the dark wormy earth cold specks of fire evil lights shining in the darkness
where fallen archangels flung the stars of their brows
muddy swinesnouts hands root and root gripe and wrest them
she dances in a foul gloom where gum bums with garlic
a sailorman rustbearded sips from a beaker rum and eyes her
a long and seafed silent rut
she dances capers wagging her sowish haunches and her hips on her gross belly flapping a ruby egg
old russell with a smeared shammy rag burnished again his gem turned it and held it at the point of his moses beard
grandfather ape gloating on a stolen hoard
and you who wrest old images from the burial earth
the brainsick words of sophists antisthenes
a lore of drugs
orient and immortal wheat standing from everlasting to everlasting
two old women fresh from their whiff of the briny trudged through irishtown along london bridge road one with a sanded tired umbrella one with a midwifes bag in which eleven cockles rolled
the whirr of flapping leathern bands and hum of dynamos from the powerhouse urged stephen to be on
beingless beings
stop
throb always without you and the throb always within
your heart you sing of
i between them
where
between two roaring worlds where they swirl i shatter them one and both
but stun myself too in the blow
shatter me you who can
bawd and butcher were the words
i say
not yet awhile
a look around
yes quite true
very large and wonderful and keeps famous time
you say right sir
a monday morning twas so indeed
stephen went down bedford row the handle of the ash clacking against his shoulderblade
in clohisseys window a faded  print of heenan boxing sayers held his eye
staring backers with square hats stood round the roped prizering
the heavyweights in tight loincloths proposed gently each to other his bulbous fists
and they are throbbing heroes hearts
he turned and halted by the slanted bookcart
twopence each the huckster said
four for sixpence
tattered pages
the irish beekeeper
life and miracles of the cur of ars
pocket guide to killarney  i might find here one of my pawned schoolprizes
stephano dedalo alumno optimo palmam ferenti  father conmee having read his little hours walked through the hamlet of donnycarney murmuring vespers
binding too good probably
what is this
eighth and ninth book of moses
secret of all secrets
seal of king david
thumbed pages read and read
who has passed here before me
how to soften chapped hands
recipe for white wine vinegar
how to win a womans love
for me this
say the following talisman three times with hands folded  se el yilo nebrakada femininum
amor me solo
sanktus
amen  who wrote this
charms and invocations of the most blessed abbot peter salanka to all true believers divulged
as good as any other abbots charms as mumbling joachims
down baldynoddle or well wool your wool
what are you doing here stephen
dillys high shoulders and shabby dress
shut the book quick
dont let see
what are you doing
stephen said
a stuart face of nonesuch charles lank locks falling at its sides
it glowed as she crouched feeding the fire with broken boots
i told her of paris
late lieabed under a quilt of old overcoats fingering a pinchbeck bracelet dan kellys token
nebrakada femininum  what have you there
stephen asked
i bought it from the other cart for a penny dilly said laughing nervously
is it any good
my eyes they say she has
do others see me so
quick far and daring
shadow of my mind
he took the coverless book from her hand
chardenals french primer
what did you buy that for
he asked
to learn french
she nodded reddening and closing tight her lips
show no surprise
quite natural
here stephen said
its all right
mind maggy doesnt pawn it on you
i suppose all my books are gone
some dilly said
we had to
she is drowning
agenbite
save her
agenbite
all against us
she will drown me with her eyes and hair
lank coils of seaweed hair around me my heart my soul
salt green death
we
agenbite of inwit
inwits agenbite
misery
misery
           hello simon father cowley said
how are things
hello bob old man mr dedalus answered stopping
they clasped hands loudly outside reddy and daughters
father cowley brushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand
whats the best news
mr dedalus said
why then not much father cowley said
im barricaded up simon with two men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance
jolly mr dedalus said
who is it
o father cowley said
a certain gombeen man of our acquaintance
with a broken back is it
mr dedalus asked
the same simon father cowley answered
reuben of that ilk
im just waiting for ben dollard
hes going to say a word to long john to get him to take those two men off
all i want is a little time
he looked with vague hope up and down the quay a big apple bulging in his neck
i know mr dedalus said nodding
poor old bockedy ben
hes always doing a good turn for someone
hold hard
he put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant
there he is by god he said arse and pockets
ben dollards loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops crossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge
he came towards them at an amble scratching actively behind his coattails
as he came near mr dedalus greeted  hold that fellow with the bad trousers
hold him now ben dollard said
mr dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of ben dollards figure
then turning to father cowley with a nod he muttered sneeringly  thats a pretty garment isnt it for a summers day
why god eternally curse your soul ben dollard growled furiously i threw out more clothes in my time than you ever saw
he stood beside them beaming on them first and on his roomy clothes from points of which mr dedalus flicked fluff saying  they were made for a man in his health ben anyhow
bad luck to the jewman that made them ben dollard said
thanks be to god hes not paid yet
and how is that basso profondo benjamin
father cowley asked
cashel boyle oconnor fitzmaurice tisdall farrell murmuring glassyeyed strode past the kildare street club
ben dollard frowned and making suddenly a chanters mouth gave forth a deep note
aw
he said
thats the style mr dedalus said nodding to its drone
what about that
ben dollard said
not too dusty
what
he turned to both
thatll do father cowley said nodding also
the reverend hugh c love walked from the old chapterhouse of saint marys abbey past james and charles kennedys rectifiers attended by geraldines tall and personable towards the tholsel beyond the ford of hurdles
ben dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward his joyful fingers in the air
come along with me to the subsheriffs office he said
i want to show you the new beauty rock has for a bailiff
hes a cross between lobengula and lynchehaun
hes well worth seeing mind you
come along
i saw john henry menton casually in the bodega just now and it will cost me a fall if i dont
wait awhile were on the right lay bob believe you me
for a few days tell him father cowley said anxiously
ben dollard halted and stared his loud orifice open a dangling button of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright
what few days
he boomed
hasnt your landlord distrained for rent
he has father cowley said
then our friends writ is not worth the paper its printed on ben dollard said
the landlord has the prior claim
i gave him all the particulars
 windsor avenue
love is the name
thats right father cowley said
the reverend mr love
hes a minister in the country somewhere
but are you sure of that
you can tell barabbas from me ben dollard said that he can put that writ where jacko put the nuts
he led father cowley boldly forward linked to his bulk
filberts i believe they were mr dedalus said as he dropped his glasses on his coatfront following them
           the youngster will be all right martin cunningham said as they passed out of the castleyard gate
the policeman touched his forehead
god bless you martin cunningham said cheerily
he signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on towards lord edward street
bronze by gold miss kennedys head by miss douces head appeared above the crossblind of the ormond hotel
yes martin cunningham said fingering his beard
i wrote to father conmee and laid the whole case before him
you could try our friend mr power suggested backward
boyd
martin cunningham said shortly
touch me not
john wyse nolan lagging behind reading the list came after them quickly down cork hill
on the steps of the city hall councillor nannetti descending hailed alderman cowley and councillor abraham lyon ascending
the castle car wheeled empty into upper exchange street
look here martin john wyse nolan said overtaking them at the mail office
i see bloom put his name down for five shillings
quite right martin cunningham said taking the list
and put down the five shillings too
without a second word either mr power said
strange but true martin cunningham added
john wyse nolan opened wide eyes
ill say there is much kindness in the jew he quoted elegantly
they went down parliament street
theres jimmy henry mr power said just heading for kavanaghs
righto martin cunningham said
here goes
outside la maison claire blazes boylan waylaid jack mooneys brotherinlaw humpy tight making for the liberties
john wyse nolan fell back with mr power while martin cunningham took the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit who walked uncertainly with hasty steps past micky andersons watches
the assistant town clerks corns are giving him some trouble john wyse nolan told mr power
they followed round the corner towards james kavanaghs winerooms
the empty castle car fronted them at rest in essex gate
martin cunningham speaking always showed often the list at which jimmy henry did not glance
and long john fanning is here too john wyse nolan said as large as life
the tall form of long john fanning filled the doorway where he stood
good day mr subsheriff martin cunningham said as all halted and greeted
long john fanning made no way for them
he removed his large henry clay decisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all their faces
are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations
he said with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk
hell open to christians they were having jimmy henry said pettishly about their damned irish language
where was the marshal he wanted to know to keep order in the council chamber
and old barlow the macebearer laid up with asthma no mace on the table nothing in order no quorum even and hutchinson the lord mayor in llandudno and little lorcan sherlock doing locum tenens for him
damned irish language language of our forefathers
long john fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips
martin cunningham spoke by turns twirling the peak of his beard to the assistant town clerk and the subsheriff while john wyse nolan held his peace
what dignam was that
long john fanning asked
jimmy henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot
o my corns
he said plaintively
come upstairs for goodness sake till i sit down somewhere
uff
ooo
mind
testily he made room for himself beside long john fannings flank and passed in and up the stairs
come on up martin cunningham said to the subsheriff
i dont think you knew him or perhaps you did though
with john wyse nolan mr power followed them in
decent little soul he was mr power said to the stalwart back of long john fanning ascending towards long john fanning in the mirror
rather lowsized
dignam of mentons office that was martin cunningham said
long john fanning could not remember him
clatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air
whats that
martin cunningham said
all turned where they stood
john wyse nolan came down again
from the cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass parliament street harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering
gaily they went past before his cool unfriendly eyes not quickly
in saddles of the leaders leaping leaders rode outriders
what was it
martin cunningham asked as they went on up the staircase
the lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of ireland john wyse nolan answered from the stairfoot
           as they trod across the thick carpet buck mulligan whispered behind his panama to haines  parnells brother
there in the corner
they chose a small table near the window opposite a longfaced man whose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard
is that he
haines asked twisting round in his seat
yes mulligan said
thats john howard his brother our city marshal
john howard parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw went up again to his forehead whereat it rested
an instant after under its screen his eyes looked quickly ghostbright at his foe and fell once more upon a working corner
ill take a mlange haines said to the waitress
two mlanges buck mulligan said
and bring us some scones and butter and some cakes as well
when she had gone he said laughing  we call it dbc
because they have damn bad cakes
o but you missed dedalus on hamlet  haines opened his newbought book
im sorry he said
shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all minds that have lost their balance
the onelegged sailor growled at the area of  nelson street  england expects  buck mulligans primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter
you should see him he said when his body loses its balance
wandering ngus i call him
i am sure he has an ide fixe haines said pinching his chin thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger
now i am speculating what it would be likely to be
such persons always have
buck mulligan bent across the table gravely
they drove his wits astray he said by visions of hell
he will never capture the attic note
the note of swinburne of all poets the white death and the ruddy birth
that is his tragedy
he can never be a poet
the joy of creation  eternal punishment haines said nodding curtly
i see
i tackled him this morning on belief
there was something on his mind i saw
its rather interesting because professor pokorny of vienna makes an interesting point out of that
buck mulligans watchful eyes saw the waitress come
he helped her to unload her tray
he can find no trace of hell in ancient irish myth haines said amid the cheerful cups
the moral idea seems lacking the sense of destiny of retribution
rather strange he should have just that fixed idea
does he write anything for your movement
he sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream
buck mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over its smoking pith
he bit off a soft piece hungrily
ten years he said chewing and laughing
he is going to write something in ten years
seems a long way off haines said thoughtfully lifting his spoon
still i shouldnt wonder if he did after all
he tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup
this is real irish cream i take it he said with forbearance
i dont want to be imposed on
elijah skiff light crumpled throwaway sailed eastward by flanks of ships and trawlers amid an archipelago of corks beyond new wapping street past bensons ferry and by the threemasted schooner rosevean from bridgwater with bricks
           almidano artifoni walked past holles street past sewells yard
behind him cashel boyle oconnor fitzmaurice tisdall farrell with stickumbrelladustcoat dangling shunned the lamp before mr law smiths house and crossing walked along merrion square
distantly behind him a blind stripling tapped his way by the wall of college park
cashel boyle oconnor fitzmaurice tisdall farrell walked as far as mr lewis werners cheerful windows then turned and strode back along merrion square his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling
at the corner of wildes house he halted frowned at elijahs name announced on the metropolitan hall frowned at the distant pleasance of dukes lawn
his eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun
with ratsteeth bared he muttered  coactus volui  he strode on for clare street grinding his fierce word
as he strode past mr blooms dental windows the sway of his dustcoat brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards having buffeted a thewless body
the blind stripling turned his sickly face after the striding form
gods curse on you he said sourly whoever you are
youre blinder nor i am you bitchs bastard
           opposite ruggy odonohoes master patrick aloysius dignam pawing the pound and a half of mangans late fehrenbachs porksteaks he had been sent for went along warm wicklow street dawdling
it was too blooming dull sitting in the parlour with mrs stoer and mrs quigley and mrs macdowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle barney brought from tunneys
and they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake jawing the whole blooming time and sighing
after wicklow lane the window of madame doyle courtdress milliner stopped him
he stood looking in at the two puckers stripped to their pelts and putting up their props
from the sidemirrors two mourning masters dignam gaped silently
myler keogh dublins pet lamb will meet sergeantmajor bennett the portobello bruiser for a purse of fifty sovereigns
gob thatd be a good pucking match to see
myler keogh thats the chap sparring out to him with the green sash
two bar entrance soldiers half price
i could easy do a bunk on ma
master dignam on his left turned as he turned
thats me in mourning
when is it
may the twentysecond
sure the blooming thing is all over
he turned to the right and on his right master dignam turned his cap awry his collar sticking up
buttoning it down his chin lifted he saw the image of marie kendall charming soubrette beside the two puckers
one of them mots that do be in the packets of fags stoer smokes that his old fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found out
master dignam got his collar down and dawdled on
the best pucker going for strength was fitzsimons
one puck in the wind from that fellow would knock you into the middle of next week man
but the best pucker for science was jem corbet before fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out of him dodging and all
in grafton street master dignam saw a red flower in a toffs mouth and a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was telling him and grinning all the time
no sandymount tram
master dignam walked along nassau street shifted the porksteaks to his other hand
his collar sprang up again and he tugged it down
the blooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt blooming end to it
he met schoolboys with satchels
im not going tomorrow either stay away till monday
he met other schoolboys
do they notice im in mourning
uncle barney said hed get it into the paper tonight
then theyll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pas name
his face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a fly walking over it up to his eye
the scrunch that was when they were screwing the screws into the coffin and the bumps when they were bringing it downstairs
pa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle barney telling the men how to get it round the bend
a big coffin it was and high and heavylooking
how was that
the last night pa was boosed he was standing on the landing there bawling out for his boots to go out to tunneys for to boose more and he looked butty and short in his shirt
never see him again
death that is
pa is dead
my father is dead
he told me to be a good son to ma
i couldnt hear the other things he said but i saw his tongue and his teeth trying to say it better
poor pa that was mr dignam my father

she poured in a teacup tea then back in the teapot tea
they cowered under their reef of counter waiting on footstools crates upturned waiting for their teas to draw
they pawed their blouses both of black satin two and nine a yard waiting for their teas to draw and two and seven

that night in the antient concert rooms
she sipped distastefully her brew hot tea a sip sipped sweet tea

tempting poor simple males
miss douce of satin douced her arm away

with the greatest alacrity miss douce agreed
with grace of alacrity towards the mirror gilt cantrell and cochranes she turned herself
with grace she tapped a measure of gold whisky from her crystal keg
forth from the skirt of his coat mr dedalus brought pouch and pipe
alacrity she served
he blew through the flue two husky fifenotes
by jove he mused i often wanted to see the mourne mountains

but a long threatening comes at last they say

miss douce turned to her tea aside

in mooneys en ville and in mooneys sur mer he had received the rhino for the labour of his muse
he smiled at bronzes teabathed lips at listening lips and eyes  the lite of erin hung upon his lips
the ponderous pundit hugh machugh dublins most brilliant scribe and editor and that minstrel boy of the wild wet west who is known by the euphonious appellation of the omadden burke
after an interval mr dedalus raised his grog and  that must have been highly diverting said he
i see

he drank
with faraway mourning mountain eye

he looked towards the saloon door

boylan eyed eyed
tossed to fat lips his chalice drank off his chalice tiny sucking the last fat violet syrupy drops
his spellbound eyes went after after her gliding head as it went down the bar by mirrors gilded arch for ginger ale hock and claret glasses shimmering a spiky shell where it concerted mirrored bronze with sunnier bronze

why do they hide their ears with seaweed hair
and turks the mouth why
her eyes over the sheet

an old plumber named geraghty

tell him says he i dare him says he and i doubledare him to send you round here again or if he does says he ill have him summonsed up before the court so i will for trading without a licence and he after stuffing himself till hes fit to burst
jesus i had to laugh at the little jewy getting his shirt out

anything strange or wonderful joe
not a word says joe
i was up at that meeting in the city arms
what was that joe
says i
cattle traders says joe about the foot and mouth disease
i want to give the citizen the hard word about it
so we went around by the linenhall barracks and the back of the courthouse talking of one thing or another
decent fellow joe when he has it but sure like that he never has it
jesus i couldnt get over that bloody foxy geraghty the daylight robber
for trading without a licence says he
in inisfail the fair there lies a land the land of holy michan
there rises a watchtower beheld of men afar
there sleep the mighty dead as in life they slept warriors and princes of high renown
a pleasant land it is in sooth of murmuring waters fishful streams where sport the gurnard the plaice the roach the halibut the gibbed haddock the grilse the dab the brill the flounder the pollock the mixed coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to be enumerated
in the mild breezes of the west and of the east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage the wafty sycamore the lebanonian cedar the exalted planetree the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied
lovely maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden ingots silvery fishes crans of herrings drafts of eels codlings creels of fingerlings purple seagems and playful insects
and heroes voyage from afar to woo them from eblana to slievemargy the peerless princes of unfettered munster and of connacht the just and of smooth sleek leinster and of cruachans land and of armagh the splendid and of the noble district of boyle princes the sons of kings
and there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for that purpose and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits of that land for oconnell fitzsimon takes toll of them a chieftain descended from chieftains
thither the extremely large wains bring foison of the fields flaskets of cauliflowers floats of spinach pineapple chunks rangoon beans strikes of tomatoes drums of figs drills of swedes spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale york and savoy and trays of onions pearls of the earth and punnets of mushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and red green yellow brown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples and chips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries pulpy and pelurious and strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their canes
i dare him says he and i doubledare him
come out here geraghty you notorious bloody hill and dale robber
and by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers and roaring mares and polled calves and longwools and storesheep and cuffes prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and angus heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime premiated milchcows and beeves and there is ever heard a trampling cackling roaring lowing bleating bellowing rumbling grunting champing chewing of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from pasturelands of lusk and rush and carrickmines and from the streamy vales of thomond from the mgillicuddys reeks the inaccessible and lordly shannon the unfathomable and from the gentle declivities of the place of the race of kiar their udders distended with superabundance of milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmers firkins and targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great hundreds various in size the agate with this dun
so we turned into barney kiernans and there sure enough was the citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that bloody mangy mongrel garryowen and he waiting for what the sky would drop in the way of drink
there he is says i in his gloryhole with his cruiskeen lawn and his load of papers working for the cause
the bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps
be a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody dog
im told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a constabulary man in santry that came round one time with a blue paper about a licence
stand and deliver says he
thats all right citizen says joe
friends here
pass friends says he
then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he  whats your opinion of the times
doing the rapparee and rory of the hill
but begob joe was equal to the occasion
i think the markets are on a rise says he sliding his hand down his fork
so begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says  foreign wars is the cause of it
and says joe sticking his thumb in his pocket  its the russians wish to tyrannise
arrah give over your bloody codding joe says i ive a thirst on me i wouldnt sell for half a crown
give it a name citizen says joe
wine of the country says he
whats yours
says joe
ditto macanaspey says i
three pints terry says joe
and hows the old heart citizen
says he
never better a chara says he
what garry
are we going to win
eh
and with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck and by jesus he near throttled him
the figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero
from shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous knees were covered as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse ulex europeus
the widewinged nostrils from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest
the eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower
a powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground the summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble
he wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited straw and rushes
beneath this he wore trews of deerskin roughly stitched with gut
his nether extremities were encased in high balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple the feet being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast
from his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude yet striking art the tribal images of many irish heroes and heroines of antiquity cuchulin conn of hundred battles niall of nine hostages brian of kincora the ardri malachi art macmurragh shane oneill father john murphy owen roe patrick sarsfield red hugh odonnell red jim macdermott soggarth eoghan ogrowney michael dwyer francy higgins henry joy mcracken goliath horace wheatley thomas conneff peg woffington the village blacksmith captain moonlight captain boycott dante alighieri christopher columbus s fursa s brendan marshal macmahon charlemagne theobald wolfe tone the mother of the maccabees the last of the mohicans the rose of castile the man for galway the man that broke the bank at monte carlo the man in the gap the woman who didnt benjamin franklin napoleon bonaparte john l sullivan cleopatra savourneen deelish julius caesar paracelsus sir thomas lipton william tell michelangelo hayes muhammad the bride of lammermoor peter the hermit peter the packer dark rosaleen patrick w shakespeare brian confucius murtagh gutenberg patricio velasquez captain nemo tristan and isolde the first prince of wales thomas cook and son the bold soldier boy arrah na pogue dick turpin ludwig beethoven the colleen bawn waddler healy angus the culdee dolly mount sidney parade ben howth valentine greatrakes adam and eve arthur wellesley boss croker herodotus jack the giantkiller gautama buddha lady godiva the lily of killarney balor of the evil eye the queen of sheba acky nagle joe nagle alessandro volta jeremiah odonovan rossa don philip osullivan beare
a couched spear of acuminated granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone
so anyhow terry brought the three pints joe was standing and begob the sight nearly left my eyes when i saw him land out a quid
o as true as im telling you
a goodlooking sovereign
and theres more where that came from says he
were you robbing the poorbox joe
says i

who comes through michans land bedight in sable armour
obloom the son of rory it is he
impervious to fear is rorys son he of the prudent soul
for the old woman of princes street says the citizen the subsidised organ

ah

dont be talking
i was blue mouldy for the want of that pint
declare to god i could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with a click
and lo as they quaffed their cup of joy a godlike messenger came swiftly in radiant as the eye of heaven a comely youth and behind him there passed an elder of noble gait and countenance bearing the sacred scrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage fairest of her race
little alf bergan popped in round the door and hid behind barneys snug squeezed up with the laughing
and who was sitting up there in the corner that i hadnt seen snoring drunk blind to the world only bob doran
i didnt know what was up and alf kept making signs out of the door
and begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon denis breen in his bathslippers with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter and the wife hotfoot after him unfortunate wretched woman trotting like a poodle
i thought alf would split

terence oryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers bungiveagh and bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats cunning as the sons of deathless leda
for they garner the succulent berries of the hop and mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day from their toil those cunning brothers lords of the vat
then did you chivalrous terence hand forth as to the manner born that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that thirsted the soul of chivalry in beauty akin to the immortals
but he the young chief of the obergans could ill brook to be outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of costliest bronze
thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen the image of a queen of regal port scion of the house of brunswick victoria her name her most excellent majesty by grace of god of the united kingdom of great britain and ireland and of the british dominions beyond the sea queen defender of the faith empress of india even she who bore rule a victress over many peoples the wellbeloved for they knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof the pale the dark the ruddy and the ethiop

in the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible the apparition of the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face
communication was effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus
questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of prly or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levels
in reply to a question as to his first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them
interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such as tlfn lvtr htkld wtklst and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature
having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief
asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of my to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that mars and jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power
it was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was we greet you friends of earth who are still in the body
mind c k doesnt pile it on it was ascertained that the reference was to mr cornelius kelleher manager of messrs h j oneills popular funeral establishment a personal friend of the defunct who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment arrangements
before departing he requested that it should be told to his dear son patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to cullens to be soled only as the heels were still good
he stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made known
assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction
he is gone from mortal haunts odignam sun of our morning
fleet was his foot on the bracken patrick of the beamy brow
wail banba with your wind and wail o ocean with your whirlwind
there he is again says the citizen staring out
who
says i
bloom says he
hes on point duty up and down there for the last ten minutes
and begob i saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again
little alf was knocked bawways
faith he was
good christ
says he
i could have sworn it was him
and says bob doran with the hat on the back of his poll lowest blackguard in dublin when hes under the influence  who said christ is good
i beg your parsnips says alf
is that a good christ says bob doran to take away poor little willy dignam
ah well says alf trying to pass it off
hes over all his troubles
but bob doran shouts out of him
hes a bloody ruffian i say to take away poor little willy dignam
terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet that they didnt want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises
and bob doran starts doing the weeps about paddy dignam true as youre there
the finest man says he snivelling the finest purest character
the tear is bloody near your eye
talking through his bloody hat
fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married mooney the bumbailiffs daughter mother kept a kip in hardwicke street that used to be stravaging about the landings bantam lyons told me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her exposing her person open to all comers fair field and no favour
the noblest the truest says he
and hes gone poor little willy poor little paddy dignam
and mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that beam of heaven
old garryowen started growling again at bloom that was skeezing round the door
come in come on he wont eat you says the citizen
so bloom slopes in with his cods eye on the dog and he asks terry was martin cunningham there
o christ mkeown says joe reading one of the letters
listen to this will you
and he starts reading out one
 hunter street liverpool   to the high sheriff of dublin             dublin   honoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful case i hanged joe gann in bootle jail on the  of febuary  and i hanged  show us joe says i
 private arthur chace for fowl murder of jessie tilsit in pentonville prison and i was assistant when  jesus says i
 billington executed the awful murderer toad smith  the citizen made a grab at the letter

rumbold             master barber   and a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too says the citizen
and the dirty scrawl of the wretch says joe
here says he take them to hell out of my sight alf
hello bloom says he what will you have
so they started arguing about the point bloom saying he wouldnt and he couldnt and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well hed just take a cigar
gob hes a prudent member and no mistake
give us one of your prime stinkers terry says joe
and alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it
theyre all barbers says he from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses
and he was telling us theres two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull
in the dark land they bide the vengeful knights of the razor
their deadly coil they grasp yea and therein they lead to erebus whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for i will on nowise suffer it even so saith the lord
so they started talking about capital punishment and of course bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time im told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about i dont know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on
theres one thing it hasnt a deterrent effect on says alf
whats that
says joe
the poor buggers tool thats being hanged says alf
that so
says joe
gods truth says alf
i heard that from the head warder that was in kilmainham when they hanged joe brady the invincible
he told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker
ruling passion strong in death says joe as someone said
that can be explained by science says bloom
its only a natural phenomenon dont you see because on account of the  and then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon
the distinguished scientist herr professor luitpold blumenduft tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would according to the best approved tradition of medical science be calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus thereby causing the elastic pores of the corpora cavernosa to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection in articulo mortis per diminutionem capitis  so of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new ireland and new this that and the other
talking about new ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought
mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his scabs
and round he goes to bob doran that was standing alf a half one sucking up for what he could get
so of course bob doran starts doing the bloody fool with him  give us the paw
give the paw doggy
good old doggy
give the paw here
give us the paw
arrah bloody end to the paw hed paw and alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and intelligent dog give you the bloody pip
then he starts scraping a few bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a jacobs tin he told terry to bring
gob he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out of him a yard long for more
near ate the tin and all hungry bloody mongrel
and the citizen and bloom having an argument about the point the brothers sheares and wolfe tone beyond on arbour hill and robert emmet and die for your country the tommy moore touch about sara curran and shes far from the land
and bloom of course with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face
phenomenon
the fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley
time they were stopping up in the city arms pisser burke told me there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing bzique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the lout out for a walk
and one time he led him the rounds of dublin and by the holy farmer he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol and by herrings if the three women didnt near roast him its a queer story the old one blooms wife and mrs odowd that kept the hotel
jesus i had to laugh at pisser burke taking them off chewing the fat
and bloom with his but dont you see and but on the other hand
and sure more be token the lout im told was in powers after the blenders round in cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody establishment
phenomenon
the memory of the dead says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at bloom
ay ay says joe
you dont grasp my point says bloom
what i mean is  sinn fein says the citizen
sinn fein amhain the friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us
the last farewell was affecting in the extreme
from the belfries far and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance
the deafening claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle
a torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand persons
a posse of dublin metropolitan police superintended by the chief commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the york street brass and reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle by speranzas plaintive muse
special quick excursion trains and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of whom there were large contingents
considerable amusement was caused by the favourite dublin streetsingers lnhn and mllgn who sang the night before larry was stretched in their usual mirthprovoking fashion
our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies
the children of the male and female foundling hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the days entertainment and a word of praise is due to the little sisters of the poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat
the viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by their excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the friends of the emerald isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite
the delegation present in full force consisted of commendatore bacibaci beninobenone the semiparalysed doyen of the party who had to be assisted to his seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane monsieur pierrepaul petitpatant the grandjoker vladinmire pokethankertscheff the archjoker leopold rudolph von schwanzenbadhodenthaler countess marha virga kisszony putrpesthi hiram y bomboost count athanatos karamelopulos ali baba backsheesh rahat lokum effendi seor hidalgo caballero don pecadillo y palabras y paternoster de la malora de la malaria hokopoko harakiri hi hung chang olaf kobberkeddelsen mynheer trik van trumps pan poleaxe paddyrisky goosepond prhklstr kratchinabritchisitch borus hupinkoff herr hurhausdirektorpresident hans chuechlisteuerli nationalgymnasiummuseumsanatoriumandsuspensoriumsordinaryprivatdocentge neralhistoryspecialprofessordoctor kriegfried ueberallgemein
all the delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which they had been called upon to witness
an animated altercation in which all took part ensued among the f o t e i as to whether the eighth or the ninth of march was the correct date of the birth of irelands patron saint
in the course of the argument cannonballs scimitars boomerangs blunderbusses stinkpots meatchoppers umbrellas catapults knuckledusters sandbags lumps of pig iron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged
the baby policeman constable macfadden summoned by special courier from booterstown quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending parties
the readywitted ninefooters suggestion at once appealed to all and was unanimously accepted
constable macfadden was heartily congratulated by all the f o t e i several of whom were bleeding profusely
commendatore beninobenone having been extricated from underneath the presidential armchair it was explained by his legal adviser avvocato pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their senses
the objects which included several hundred ladies and gentlemens gold and silver watches were promptly restored to their rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme
quietly unassumingly rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless morning dress and wearing his favourite flower the gladiolus cruentus
he announced his presence by that gentle rumboldian cough which so many have tried unsuccessfully to imitateshort painstaking yet withal so characteristic of the man
the arrival of the worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of cries hoch banzai eljen zivio chinchin polla kronia hiphip vive allah amid which the ringing evviva of the delegate of the land of song a high double f recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers was easily distinguishable
it was exactly seventeen oclock
the signal for prayer was then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared the commendatores patriarchal sombrero which has been in the possession of his family since the revolution of rienzi being removed by his medical adviser in attendance dr pippi
the learned prelate who administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater his cassock above his hoary head and offered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication
hard by the block stood the grim figure of the executioner his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered furiously
as he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office
on a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers messrs john round and sons sheffield a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum colon blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the most precious victim
the housesteward of the amalgamated cats and dogs home was in attendance to convey these vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution
quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs fried steak and onions done to a nicety delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he with an abnegation rare in these our times rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying wish immediately acceded to that the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers association as a token of his regard and esteem
the nec and non plus ultra of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for her sake
the hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring fondly sheila my own
encouraged by this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach
she swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory that she would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in clonturk park
she brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the banks of anna liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and oblivious of the dreadful present they both laughed heartily all the spectators including the venerable pastor joining in the general merriment
that monster audience simply rocked with delight
but anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time
a fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people touched to the inmost core broke into heartrending sobs not the least affected being the aged prebendary himself
big strong men officers of the peace and genial giants of the royal irish constabulary were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage
a most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young oxford graduate noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex stepped forward and presenting his visiting card bankbook and genealogical tree solicited the hand of the hapless young lady requesting her to name the day and was accepted on the spot
every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion and when the gallant young oxonian the bearer by the way of one of the most timehonoured names in albions history placed on the finger of his blushing fiance an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds
nay even the stern provostmarshal lieutenantcolonel tomkinmaxwell ffrenchmullan tomlinson who presided on the sad occasion he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching could not now restrain his natural emotion
with his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard by those privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate entourage to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone  god blimey if she aint a clinker that there bleeding tart
blimey it makes me kind of bleeding cry straight it does when i sees her cause i thinks of my old mashtub whats waiting for me down limehouse way
so then the citizen begins talking about the irish language and the corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that cant speak their own language and joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off of joe and talking about the gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink the curse of ireland
antitreating is about the size of it
gob hed let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the lord would call him before youd ever see the froth of his pint
and one night i went in with a fellow into one of their musical evenings song and dance about she could get up on a truss of hay she could my maureen lay and there was a fellow with a ballyhooly blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in irish and a lot of colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns gob flahoolagh entertainment dont be talking
ireland sober is ireland free
and then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of
and one or two sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females hitting below the belt
so howandever as i was saying the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by joe and me
id train him by kindness so i would if he was my dog
give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldnt blind him
afraid hell bite you
says the citizen jeering
no says i
but he might take my leg for a lamppost
so he calls the old dog over
whats on you garry
says he
then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in irish and the old towser growling letting on to answer like a duet in the opera
such growling you never heard as they let off between them
someone that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter pro bono publico to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that
growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws
all those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower animals and their name is legion should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the sobriquet of garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances owen garry
the exhibition which is the result of years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system comprises among other achievements the recitation of verse
our greatest living phonetic expert wild horses shall not drag it from us
has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a striking resemblance the italics are ours to the ranns of ancient celtic bards
we are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the little sweet branch has familiarised the bookloving world but rather as a contributor d o c points out in an interesting communication published by an evening contemporary of the harsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous raftery and of donal macconsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye
we subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into english by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication
the metrical system of the canine original which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the welsh englyn is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught
perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased if owens verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour
the curse of my curses      seven days every day      and seven dry thursdays      on you barney kiernan      has no sup of water      to cool my courage      and my guts red roaring      after lowrys lights
so he told terry to bring some water for the dog and gob you could hear him lapping it up a mile off
and joe asked him would he have another
i will says he a chara to show theres no ill feeling
gob hes not as green as hes cabbagelooking
arsing around from one pub to another leaving it to your own honour with old giltraps dog and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators
entertainment for man and beast
and says joe  could you make a hole in another pint
could a swim duck
says i
same again terry says joe
are you sure you wont have anything in the way of liquid refreshment
says he
thank you no says bloom
as a matter of fact i just wanted to meet martin cunningham dont you see about this insurance of poor dignams
martin asked me to go to the house
you see he dignam i mean didnt serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and nominally under the act the mortgagee cant recover on the policy
holy wars says joe laughing thats a good one if old shylock is landed
so the wife comes out top dog what
well thats a point says bloom for the wifes admirers
whose admirers
says joe
the wifes advisers i mean says bloom
then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that dignam owed bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the mortgagees right till he near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor under the act
he was bloody safe he wasnt run in himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court
selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal hungarian privileged lottery
true as youre there
o commend me to an israelite
royal and privileged hungarian robbery
so bob doran comes lurching around asking bloom to tell mrs dignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer a finer than poor little willy thats dead to tell her
choking with bloody foolery
and shaking blooms hand doing the tragic to tell her that
shake hands brother
youre a rogue and im another
let me said he so far presume upon our acquaintance which however slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time is founded as i hope and believe on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of you this favour
but should i have overstepped the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness
no rejoined the other i appreciate to the full the motives which actuate your conduct and i shall discharge the office you entrust to me consoled by the reflection that though the errand be one of sorrow this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of the cup
then suffer me to take your hand said he
the goodness of your heart i feel sure will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy were i to give vent to my feelings would deprive me even of speech
and off with him and out trying to walk straight
boosed at five oclock
night he was near being lagged only paddy leonard knew the bobby a
blind to the world up in a shebeen in bride street after closing time fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard drinking porter out of teacups
and calling himself a frenchy for the shawls joseph manuo and talking against the catholic religion and he serving mass in adam and eves when he was young with his eyes shut who wrote the new testament and the old testament and hugging and smugging
and the two shawls killed with the laughing picking his pockets the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another
how is your testament
have you got an old testament only paddy was passing there i tell you what
then see him of a sunday with his little concubine of a wife and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her no less and her violets nice as pie doing the little lady
jack mooneys sister
and the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples
gob jack made him toe the line
told him if he didnt patch up the pot jesus hed kick the shite out of him
so terry brought the three pints
here says joe doing the honours
here citizen
slan leat says he
fortune joe says i
good health citizen
gob he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already
want a small fortune to keep him in drinks
who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty alf

the mimber
i wont mention any names says alf
i thought so says joe
i saw him up at that meeting now with william field m p the cattle traders
hairy iopas says the citizen that exploded volcano the darling of all countries and the idol of his own
so joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending them all to the rightabout and bloom coming out with his sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the guaranteed remedy for timber tongue
because he was up one time in a knackers yard
walking about with his book and pencil heres my head and my heels are coming till joe cuffe gave him the order of the boot for giving lip to a grazier
mister knowall
teach your grandmother how to milk ducks
pisser burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used to be in rivers of tears some times with mrs odowd crying her eyes out with her eight inches of fat all over her
couldnt loosen her farting strings but old cods eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do it
whats your programme today
ay

because the poor animals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that doesnt cause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently

mr allfours tamoshant
con
 honourable members are already in possession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole house

the answer to the honourable members question is in the affirmative
mr orelli oreilly montenotte
nat
 have similar orders been issued for the slaughter of human animals who dare to play irish games in the phoenix park
mr allfours the answer is in the negative

theres the man says joe that made the gaelic sports revival
there he is sitting there
the man that got away james stephens
the champion of all ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot
what was your best throw citizen
na bacleis says the citizen letting on to be modest
there was a time i was as good as the next fellow anyhow
put it there citizen says joe
you were and a bloody sight better
is that really a fact
says alf
yes says bloom
thats well known
did you not know that
so off they started about irish sports and shoneen games the like of lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil and building up a nation once again and all to that
and of course bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rowers heart violent exercise was bad
i declare to my antimacassar if you took up a straw from the bloody floor and if you said to bloom look at bloom
do you see that straw
thats a straw
declare to my aunt hed talk about it for an hour so he would and talk steady
a most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of brian ociarnains in sraid na bretaine bheag under the auspices of sluagh na heireann on the revival of ancient gaelic sports and the importance of physical culture as understood in ancient greece and ancient rome and ancient ireland for the development of the race
the venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the attendance was of large dimensions
after an instructive discourse by the chairman a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high standard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient panceltic forefathers
the wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old tongue mr joseph mcarthy hynes made an eloquent appeal for the resuscitation of the ancient gaelic sports and pastimes practised morning and evening by finn maccool as calculated to revive the best traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient ages
l bloom who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the discussion to a close in response to repeated requests and hearty plaudits from all parts of a bumper house by a remarkably noteworthy rendering of the immortal thomas osborne davis evergreen verses happily too familiar to need recalling here a nation once again in the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself
the irish carusogaribaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing it
his superb highclass vocalism which by its superquality greatly enhanced his already international reputation was vociferously applauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed many prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press and the bar and the other learned professions
the proceedings then terminated
amongst the clergy present were the very rev

talking about violent exercise says alf were you at that keoghbennett match
no says joe
i heard so and so made a cool hundred quid over it says alf
who
blazes
says joe
and says bloom  what i meant about tennis for example is the agility and training the eye
ay blazes says alf
he let out that myler was on the beer to run up the odds and he swatting all the time
we know him says the citizen
the traitors son
we know what put english gold in his pocket
true for you says joe
and bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the blood asking alf  now dont you think bergan
myler dusted the floor with him says alf
heenan and sayers was only a bloody fool to it
handed him the father and mother of a beating
see the little kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping
god he gave him one last puck in the wind queensberry rules and all made him puke what he never ate
it was a historic and a hefty battle when myler and percy were scheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns
handicapped as he was by lack of poundage dublins pet lamb made up for it by superlative skill in ringcraft
the final bout of fireworks was a gruelling for both champions
the welterweight sergeantmajor had tapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which keogh had been receivergeneral of rights and lefts the artilleryman putting in some neat work on the pets nose and myler came on looking groggy
the soldier got to business leading off with a powerful left jab to which the irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the point of bennetts jaw
the redcoat ducked but the dubliner lifted him with a left hook the body punch being a fine one
the men came to handigrips
myler quickly became busy and got his man under the bout ending with the bulkier man on the ropes myler punishing him
the englishman whose right eye was nearly closed took his corner where he was liberally drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey and brimful of pluck confident of knocking out the fistic eblanite in jigtime
it was a fight to a finish and the best man for it
the two fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high
the referee twice cautioned pucking percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat to watch
after a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from his opponents mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left to battling bennetts stomach flooring him flat
it was a knockout clean and clever
amid tense expectation the portobello bruiser was being counted out when bennetts second ole pfotts wettstein threw in the towel and the santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight
he knows which side his bread is buttered says alf
i hear hes running a concert tour now up in the north

i dismiss the case
and whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and in the third week after the feastday of the holy and undivided trinity the daughter of the skies the virgin moon being then in her first quarter it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the halls of law
there master courtenay sitting in his own chamber gave his rede and master justice andrews sitting without a jury in the probate court weighed well and pondered the claim of the first chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and final testamentary disposition in re the real and personal estate of the late lamented jacob halliday vintner deceased versus livingstone an infant of unsound mind and another
and to the solemn court of green street there came sir frederick the falconer
and he sat him there about the hour of five oclock to administer the law of the brehons at the commission for all that and those parts to be holden in and for the county of the city of dublin
and there sat with him the high sinhedrim of the twelve tribes of iar for every tribe one man of the tribe of patrick and of the tribe of hugh and of the tribe of owen and of the tribe of conn and of the tribe of oscar and of the tribe of fergus and of the tribe of finn and of the tribe of dermot and of the tribe of cormac and of the tribe of kevin and of the tribe of caolte and of the tribe of ossian there being in all twelve good men and true
and he conjured them by him who died on rood that they should well and truly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined between their sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and true verdict give according to the evidence so help them god and kiss the book
and they rose in their seats those twelve of iar and they swore by the name of him who is from everlasting that they would do his rightwiseness
and straightway the minions of the law led forth from their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended in consequence of information received
and they shackled him hand and foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge against him for he was a malefactor
those are nice things says the citizen coming over here to ireland filling the country with bugs
so bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with joe telling him he neednt trouble about that little matter till the first but if he would just say a word to mr crawford
and so joe swore high and holy by this and by that hed do the devil and all
because you see says bloom for an advertisement you must have repetition
thats the whole secret
rely on me says joe
swindling the peasants says the citizen and the poor of ireland
we want no more strangers in our house

very kind of you says bloom
the strangers says the citizen
our own fault
we let them come in
we brought them in
the adulteress and her paramour brought the saxon robbers here
decree nisi says j j
and bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing a spiders web in the corner behind the barrel and the citizen scowling after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite and when
a dishonoured wife says the citizen thats whats the cause of all our misfortunes
and here she is says alf that was giggling over the police gazette with terry on the counter in all her warpaint

so anyhow in came john wyse nolan and lenehan with him with a face on him as long as a late breakfast
well says the citizen whats the latest from the scene of action
what did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide about the irish language
onolan clad in shining armour low bending made obeisance to the puissant and high and mighty chief of all erin and did him to wit of that which had befallen how that the grave elders of the most obedient city second of the realm had met them in the tholsel and there after due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal had taken solemn counsel whereby they might if so be it might be bring once more into honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided gael
its on the march says the citizen
to hell with the bloody brutal sassenachs and their patois  so j j puts in a word doing the toff about one story was good till you heard another and blinking facts and the nelson policy putting your blind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to impeach a nation and bloom trying to back him up moderation and botheration and their colonies and their civilisation
their syphilisation you mean says the citizen
to hell with them
the curse of a goodfornothing god light sideways on the bloody thicklugged sons of whores gets

and says lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo  conspuez les anglais
perfide albion  he said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the medher of dark strong foamy ale and uttering his tribal slogan lamh dearg abu he drank to the undoing of his foes a race of mighty valorous heroes rulers of the waves who sit on thrones of alabaster silent as the deathless gods
whats up with you says i to lenehan

the bride who was given away by her father the mconifer of the glands looked exquisitely charming in a creation carried out in green mercerised silk moulded on an underslip of gloaming grey sashed with a yoke of broad emerald and finished with a triple flounce of darkerhued fringe the scheme being relieved by bretelles and hip insertions of acorn bronze
the maids of honour miss larch conifer and miss spruce conifer sisters of the bride wore very becoming costumes in the same tone a dainty motif of plume rose being worked into the pleats in a pinstripe and repeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the form of heron feathers of paletinted coral
senhor enrique flor presided at the organ with his wellknown ability and in addition to the prescribed numbers of the nuptial mass played a new and striking arrangement of woodman spare that tree at the conclusion of the service

as much as his bloody life is worth to go down and address his tall talk to the assembled multitude in shanagolden where he darent show his nose with the molly maguires looking for him to let daylight through him for grabbing the holding of an evicted tenant

half one terry says john wyse and a hands up
terry

small whisky and bottle of allsop
right sir
hanging over the bloody paper with alf looking for spicy bits instead of attending to the general public
picture of a butting match trying to crack their bloody skulls one chap going for the other with his head down like a bull at a gate
and another one black beast burned in omaha ga
a lot of deadwood dicks in slouch hats and they firing at a sambo strung up in a tree with his tongue out and a bonfire under him
gob they ought to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and crucify him to make sure of their job
but what about the fighting navy says ned that keeps our foes at bay
ill tell you what about it says the citizen
hell upon earth it is
read the revelations thats going on in the papers about flogging on the training ships at portsmouth
a fellow writes that calls himself disgusted one
so he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew of tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the parson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad brought out howling for his ma and they tie him down on the buttend of a gun
a rump and dozen says the citizen was what that old ruffian sir john beresford called it but the modern gods englishman calls it caning on the breech
and says john wyse  tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance
then he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane and he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad till he yells meila murder
thats your glorious british navy says the citizen that bosses the earth
the fellows that never will be slaves with the only hereditary chamber on the face of gods earth and their land in the hands of a dozen gamehogs and cottonball barons
thats the great empire they boast about of drudges and whipped serfs
on which the sun never rises says joe
and the tragedy of it is says the citizen they believe it
the unfortunate yahoos believe it
they believe in rod the scourger almighty creator of hell upon earth and in jacky tar the son of a gun who was conceived of unholy boast born of the fighting navy suffered under rump and dozen was scarified flayed and curried yelled like bloody hell the third day he arose again from the bed steered into haven sitteth on his beamend till further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid
but says bloom isnt discipline the same everywhere
i mean wouldnt it be the same here if you put force against force
didnt i tell you
as true as im drinking this porter if he was at his last gasp hed try to downface you that dying was living
well put force against force says the citizen
we have our greater ireland beyond the sea
they were driven out of house and home in the black 
their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid low by the batteringram and the times rubbed its hands and told the whitelivered saxons there would soon be as few irish in ireland as redskins in america
even the grand turk sent us his piastres
but the sassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of crops that the british hyenas bought and sold in rio de janeiro
ay they drove out the peasants in hordes
twenty thousand of them died in the coffinships
but those that came to the land of the free remember the land of bondage
and they will come again and with a vengeance no cravens the sons of granuaile the champions of kathleen ni houlihan
perfectly true says bloom
but my point was  we are a long time waiting for that day citizen says ned
since the poor old woman told us that the french were on the sea and landed at killala
ay says john wyse
we fought for the royal stuarts that reneged us against the williamites and they betrayed us
remember limerick and the broken treatystone
we gave our best blood to france and spain the wild geese
fontenoy eh
and sarsfield and odonnell duke of tetuan in spain and ulysses browne of camus that was fieldmarshal to maria teresa
but what did we ever get for it
the french
says the citizen
set of dancing masters
do you know what it is
they were never worth a roasted fart to ireland
arent they trying to make an entente cordiale now at tay pays dinnerparty with perfidious albion
firebrands of europe and they always were
conspuez les franais says lenehan nobbling his beer
and as for the prooshians and the hanoverians says joe havent we had enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from george the elector down to the german lad and the flatulent old bitch thats dead
jesus i had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old one with the winkers on her blind drunk in her royal palace every night of god old vic with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman carting her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the whiskers and singing him old bits of songs about ehren on the rhine and come where the boose is cheaper
well says j j
we have edward the peacemaker now

theres a bloody sight more pox than pax about that boyo
edward guelphwettin
and what do you think says joe of the holy boys the priests and bishops of ireland doing up his room in maynooth in his satanic majestys racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his jockeys rode
the earl of dublin no less
they ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself says little alf
and says j j  considerations of space influenced their lordships decision
will you try another citizen
says joe
yes sir says he
i will
you
says joe
beholden to you joe says i
may your shadow never grow less
repeat that dose says joe
bloom was talking and talking with john wyse and he quite excited with his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling about
persecution says he all the history of the world is full of it
perpetuating national hatred among nations
but do you know what a nation means
says john wyse
yes says bloom
what is it
says john wyse
a nation
says bloom
a nation is the same people living in the same place
by god then says ned laughing if thats so im a nation for im living in the same place for the past five years
so of course everyone had the laugh at bloom and says he trying to muck out of it  or also living in different places
that covers my case says joe
what is your nation if i may ask
says the citizen
ireland says bloom
i was born here
ireland

the muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient irish facecloth attributed to solomon of droma and manus tomaltach og macdonogh authors of the book of ballymote was then carefully produced and called forth prolonged admiration
no need to dwell on the legendary beauty of the cornerpieces the acme of art wherein one can distinctly discern each of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the four masters his evangelical symbol a bogoak sceptre a north american puma a far nobler king of beasts than the british article be it said in passing a kerry calf and a golden eagle from carrantuohill
the scenes depicted on the emunctory field showing our ancient duns and raths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as when the sligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy long long ago in the time of the barmecides

the delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of which the dusky potentate in the course of a happy speech freely translated by the british chaplain the reverend ananias praisegod barebones tendered his best thanks to massa walkup and emphasised the cordial relations existing between abeakuta and the british empire stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an illuminated bible the volume of the word of god and the secret of englands greatness graciously presented to him by the white chief woman the great squaw victoria with a personal dedication from the august hand of the royal donor
the alaki then drank a lovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the toast black and white from the skull of his immediate predecessor in the dynasty kakachakachak surnamed forty warts after which he visited the chief factory of cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors book subsequently executing a charming old abeakutic wardance in the course of which he swallowed several knives and forks amid hilarious applause from the girl hands

and as they wended their way by nelsons pillar henry street mary street capel street little britain street chanting the introit in epiphania domini which beginneth surge illuminare and thereafter most sweetly the gradual omnes which saith de saba venient they did divers wonders such as casting out devils raising the dead to life multiplying fishes healing the halt and the blind discovering various articles which had been mislaid interpreting and fulfilling the scriptures blessing and prophesying
and last beneath a canopy of cloth of gold came the reverend father oflynn attended by malachi and patrick
and when the good fathers had reached the appointed place the house of bernard kiernan and co limited   and  little britain street wholesale grocers wine and brandy shippers licensed for the sale of beer wine and spirits for consumption on the premises the celebrant blessed the house and censed the mullioned windows and the groynes and the vaults and the arrises and the capitals and the pediments and the cornices and the engrailed arches and the spires and the cupolas and sprinkled the lintels thereof with blessed water and prayed that god might bless that house as he had blessed the house of abraham and isaac and jacob and make the angels of his light to inhabit therein

and he got them out as quick as he could jack power and crofton or whatever you call him and him in the middle of them letting on to be all at sea and up with them on the bloody jaunting car
off with you says martin to the jarvey
the milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and rising in the golden poop the helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off forward with all sail set the spinnaker to larboard
a many comely nymphs drew nigh to starboard and to larboard and clinging to the sides of the noble bark they linked their shining forms as doth the cunning wheelwright when he fashions about the heart of his wheel the equidistant rays whereof each one is sister to another and he binds them all with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feet of men whenas they ride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair
even so did they come and set them those willing nymphs the undying sisters
and they laughed sporting in a circle of their foam and the bark clave the waves
but begob i was just lowering the heel of the pint when i saw the citizen getting up to waddle to the door puffing and blowing with the dropsy and he cursing the curse of cromwell on him bell book and candle in irish spitting and spatting out of him and joe and little alf round him like a leprechaun trying to peacify him
let me alone says he
and begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and he bawls out of him  three cheers for israel

a large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from the metropolis and greater dublin assembled in their thousands to bid farewell to nagyasgos uram lipti virag late of messrs alexander thoms printers to his majesty on the occasion of his departure for the distant clime of szzharminczbrojgulysduguls meadow of murmuring waters
the ceremony which went off with great clat was characterised by the most affecting cordiality
an illuminated scroll of ancient irish vellum the work of irish artists was presented to the distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the community and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket tastefully executed in the style of ancient celtic ornament a work which reflects every credit on the makers messrs jacob agus jacob
the departing guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation many of those who were present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of irish pipes struck up the wellknown strains of come back to erin followed immediately by rakczsys march
tarbarrels and bonfires were lighted along the coastline of the four seas on the summits of the hill of howth three rock mountain sugarloaf bray head the mountains of mourne the galtees the ox and donegal and sperrin peaks the nagles and the bograghs the connemara hills the reeks of mgillicuddy slieve aughty slieve bernagh and slieve bloom
amid cheers that rent the welkin responded to by answering cheers from a big muster of henchmen on the distant cambrian and caledonian hills the mastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final floral tribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were present in large numbers while as it proceeded down the river escorted by a flotilla of barges the flags of the ballast office and custom house were dipped in salute as were also those of the electrical power station at the pigeonhouse and the poolbeg light

the bloody nag took fright and the old mongrel after the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting and laughing and the old tinbox clattering along the street
the catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect
the observatory of dunsink registered in all eleven shocks all of the fifth grade of mercallis scale and there is no record extant of a similar seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of  the year of the rebellion of silken thomas
the epicentre appears to have been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the inns quay ward and parish of saint michan covering a surface of fortyone acres two roods and one square pole or perch
all the lordly residences in the vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble edifice itself in which at the time of the catastrophe important legal debates were in progress is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it is to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive
from the reports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic character
an article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the much respected clerk of the crown and peace mr george fottrell and a silk umbrella with gold handle with the engraved initials crest coat of arms and house number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of quarter sessions sir frederick falkiner recorder of dublin have been discovered by search parties in remote parts of the island respectively the former on the third basaltic ridge of the giants causeway the latter embedded to the extent of one foot three inches in the sandy beach of holeopen bay near the old head of kinsale
other eyewitnesses depose that they observed an incandescent object of enormous proportions hurtling through the atmosphere at a terrifying velocity in a trajectory directed southwest by west
messages of condolence and sympathy are being hourly received from all parts of the different continents and the sovereign pontiff has been graciously pleased to decree that a special missa pro defunctis shall be celebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries of each and every cathedral church of all the episcopal dioceses subject to the spiritual authority of the holy see in suffrage of the souls of those faithful departed who have been so unexpectedly called away from our midst

gob if he got that lottery ticket on the side of his poll hed remember the gold cup he would so but begob the citizen would have been lagged for assault and battery and joe for aiding and abetting
the jarvey saved his life by furious driving as sure as god made moses
what
o jesus he did
and he let a volley of oaths after him
did i kill him says he or what
and he shouting to the bloody dog  after him garry
after him boy
and the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and old sheepsface on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it with his lugs back for all he was bloody well worth to tear him limb from limb

when lo there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld the chariot wherein he stood ascend to heaven
and they beheld him in the chariot clothed upon in the glory of the brightness having raiment as of the sun fair as the moon and terrible that for awe they durst not look upon him
and there came a voice out of heaven calling elijah
elijah and he answered with a main cry abba
adonai and they beheld him even him ben bloom elijah amid clouds of angels ascend to the glory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees over donohoes in little green street like a shot off a shovel
     the summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious embrace
far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand on the proud promontory of dear old howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay on the weedgrown rocks along sandymount shore and last but not least on the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man mary star of the sea
the three girl friends were seated on the rocks enjoying the evening scene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly
many a time and oft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy chat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine cissy caffrey and edy boardman with the baby in the pushcar and tommy and jacky caffrey two little curlyheaded boys dressed in sailor suits with caps to match and the name h
m s belleisle printed on both
for tommy and jacky caffrey were twins scarce four years old and very noisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about them
they were dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets building castles as children do or playing with their big coloured ball happy as the day was long
and edy boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight
he was but eleven months and nine days old and though still a tiny toddler was just beginning to lisp his first babyish words
cissy caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin
now baby cissy caffrey said
say out big big
i want a drink of water
and baby prattled after her  a jink a jink a jawbo
cissy caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children so patient with little sufferers and tommy caffrey could never be got to take his castor oil unless it was cissy caffrey that held his nose and promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden syrup on
what a persuasive power that girl had
but to be sure baby boardman was as good as gold a perfect little dote in his new fancy bib
none of your spoilt beauties flora macflimsy sort was cissy caffrey
a truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe red lips a girl lovable in the extreme
and edy boardman laughed too at the quaint language of little brother
but just then there was a slight altercation between master tommy and master jacky
boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to this golden rule
the apple of discord was a certain castle of sand which master jacky had built and master tommy would have it right go wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the martello tower had
but if master tommy was headstrong master jacky was selfwilled too and true to the maxim that every little irishmans house is his castle he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the wouldbe assailant came to grief and alas to relate
the coveted castle too
needless to say the cries of discomfited master tommy drew the attention of the girl friends
come here tommy his sister called imperatively
at once
and you jacky for shame to throw poor tommy in the dirty sand
wait till i catch you for that
his eyes misty with unshed tears master tommy came at her call for their big sisters word was law with the twins
and in a sad plight he was too after his misadventure
his little manowar top and unmentionables were full of sand but cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing over lifes tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit
still the blue eyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness and shook her hand at master jacky the culprit and said if she was near him she wouldnt be far from him her eyes dancing in admonition
nasty bold jacky
she cried
she put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly  whats your name
butter and cream
tell us who is your sweetheart spoke edy boardman
is cissy your sweetheart
nao tearful tommy said
is edy boardman your sweetheart
cissy queried
nao tommy said
i know edy boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from her shortsighted eyes
i know who is tommys sweetheart
gerty is tommys sweetheart
nao tommy said on the verge of tears
cissys quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to edy boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman couldnt see and to mind he didnt wet his new tan shoes
but who was gerty
gerty macdowell who was seated near her companions lost in thought gazing far away into the distance was in very truth as fair a specimen of winsome irish girlhood as one could wish to see
she was pronounced beautiful by all who knew her though as folks often said she was more a giltrap than a macdowell
her figure was slight and graceful inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the widow welchs female pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to get and that tired feeling
the waxen pallor of her face was almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine cupids bow greekly perfect
her hands were of finely veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either
bertha supple told that once to edy boardman a deliberate lie when she was black out at daggers drawn with gerty the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals and she told her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or shed never speak to her again
no
honour where honour is due
there was an innate refinement a languid queenly hauteur about gerty which was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep
had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education gerty macdowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to her
mayhap it was this the love that might have been that lent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look tense with suppressed meaning that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes a charm few could resist
why have women such eyes of witchery
gertys were of the bluest irish blue set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive brows
time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive
it was madame vera verity directress of the woman beautiful page of the princess novelette who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes so becoming in leaders of fashion and she had never regretted it
then there was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face but your nose
that would suit mrs dignam because she had a button one
but gertys crowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair
it was dark brown with a natural wave in it
she had cut it that very morning on account of the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clusters and pared her nails too thursday for wealth
and just now at edys words as a telltale flush delicate as the faintest rosebloom crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety gods fair land of ireland did not hold her equal
for an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes
she was about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue
inclination prompted her to speak out dignity told her to be silent
the pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young may morning
she knew right well noone better what made squinty edy say that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a lovers quarrel
as per usual somebodys nose was out of joint about the boy that had the bicycle off the london bridge road always riding up and down in front of her window
only now his father kept him in in the evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he was going to go to trinity college to study for a doctor when he left the high school like his brother w e wylie who was racing in the bicycle races in trinity college university
little recked he perhaps for what she felt that dull aching void in her heart sometimes piercing to the core
yet he was young and perchance he might learn to love her in time
they were protestants in his family and of course gerty knew who came first and after him the blessed virgin and then saint joseph
but he was undeniably handsome with an exquisite nose and he was what he looked every inch a gentleman the shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would know anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size too he and she and that was why edy boardman thought she was so frightfully clever because he didnt go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden
gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of dame fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be out
a neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes because it was expected in the ladys pictorial that electric blue would be worn with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit and a navy threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure to perfection
she wore a coquettish little love of a hat of wideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue chenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone
all tuesday week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she found what she wanted at clerys summer sales the very it slightly shopsoiled but you would never notice seven fingers two and a penny
she did it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on then smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her
and when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that would take the shine out of some people she knew
her shoes were the newest thing in footwear edy boardman prided herself that she was very petite but she never had a foot like gerty macdowell a five and never would ash oak or elm with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle over her higharched instep
her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and wide garter tops
as for undies they were gertys chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen though gerty would never see seventeen again can find it in his heart to blame her
she had four dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery three garments and nighties extra and each set slotted with different coloured ribbons rosepink pale blue mauve and peagreen and she aired them herself and blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldnt trust those washerwomen as far as shed see them scorching the things
she was wearing the blue for luck hoping against hope her own colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that was for luck and lovers meeting if you put those things on inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long as it wasnt of a friday
and yet and yet
that strained look on her face
a gnawing sorrow is there all the time
her very soul is in her eyes and she would give worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where giving way to tears she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings though not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the mirror
you are lovely gerty it said
the paly light of evening falls upon a face infinitely sad and wistful
gerty macdowell yearns in vain
yes she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for mrs reggy wylie t c d because the one who married the elder brother would be mrs wylie and in the fashionable intelligence mrs gertrude wylie was wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to be
he was too young to understand
he would not believe in love a womans birthright
the night of the party long ago in stoers he was still in short trousers when they were alone and he stole an arm round her waist she went white to the very lips
he called her little one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss the first
but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from the room with a remark about refreshments
impetuous fellow
strength of character had never been reggy wylies strong point and he who would woo and win gerty macdowell must be a man among men
but waiting always waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be over
no prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who had not found his ideal perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey and who would understand take her in his sheltering arms strain her to him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort her with a long long kiss
it would be like heaven
for such a one she yearns this balmy summer eve
with all the heart of her she longs to be his only his affianced bride for riches for poor in sickness in health till death us two part from this to this day forward
and while edy boardman was with little tommy behind the pushcar she was just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his little wife to be
then they could talk about her till they went blue in the face bertha supple too and edy little spitfire because she would be twentytwo in november
she would care for him with creature comforts too for gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that feeling of hominess
her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and queen anns pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though she didnt like the eating part when there were any people that made her shy and often she wondered why you couldnt eat something poetical like violets or roses and they would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and the photograph of grandpapa giltraps lovely dog garryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in clerys summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses
he would be tall with broad shoulders she had always admired tall men for a husband with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their honeymoon three wonderful weeks
and then when they settled down in a nice snug and cosy little homely house every morning they would both have brekky simple but perfectly served for their own two selves and before he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes
edy boardman asked tommy caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off and play with jacky and to be good now and not to fight
but tommy said he wanted the ball and edy told him no that baby was playing with the ball and if he took it thered be wigs on the green but tommy said it was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground if you please
the temper of him
o he was a man already was little tommy caffrey since he was out of pinnies
edy told him no no and to be off now with him and she told cissy caffrey not to give in to him
youre not my sister naughty tommy said
its my ball
but cissy caffrey told baby boardman to look up look up high at her finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and tommy after it in full career having won the day
anything for a quiet life laughed ciss
and she tickled tiny tots two cheeks to make him forget and played heres the lord mayor heres his two horses heres his gingerbread carriage and here he walks in chinchopper chinchopper chinchopper chin
but edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way like that from everyone always petting him
id like to give him something she said so i would where i wont say
on the beeoteetom laughed cissy merrily
gerty macdowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of cissy saying an unladylike thing like that out loud shed be ashamed of her life to say flushing a deep rosy red and edy boardman said she was sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said
but not a pin cared ciss
let him
she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of her nose
give it to him too on the same place as quick as id look at him
madcap ciss with her golliwog curls
you had to laugh at her sometimes
for instance when she asked you would you have some more chinese tea and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the mens faces on her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the miss white
that was just like cissycums
o and will you ever forget her the evening she dressed up in her fathers suit and hat and the burned cork moustache and walked down tritonville road smoking a cigarette
there was none to come up to her for fun
but she was sincerity itself one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made not one of your twofaced things too sweet to be wholesome
and then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing anthem of the organ
it was the mens temperance retreat conducted by the missioner the reverend john hughes s j rosary sermon and benediction of the most blessed sacrament
they were there gathered together without distinction of social class and a most edifying spectacle it was to see in that simple fane beside the waves after the storms of this weary world kneeling before the feet of the immaculate reciting the litany of our lady of loreto beseeching her to intercede for them the old familiar words holy mary holy virgin of virgins
how sad to poor gertys ears
had her father only avoided the clutches of the demon drink by taking the pledge or those powders the drink habit cured in pearsons weekly she might now be rolling in her carriage second to none
over and over had she told herself that as she mused by the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket thinking
but that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cast its shadow over her childhood days
nay she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father a prey to the fumes of intoxication forget himself completely for if there was one thing of all things that gerty knew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of kindness deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low
and still the voices sang in supplication to the virgin most powerful virgin most merciful
and gerty rapt in thought scarce saw or heard her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off sandymount green that cissy caffrey called the man that was so like himself passing along the strand taking a short walk
you never saw him any way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a father because he was too old or something or on account of his face it was a palpable case of doctor fell or his carbuncly nose with the pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose
poor father
with all his faults she loved him still when he sang tell me mary how to woo thee or my love and cottage near rochelle and they had stewed cockles and lettuce with lazenbys salad dressing for supper and when he sang the moon hath raised with mr dignam that died suddenly and was buried god have mercy on him from a stroke
her mothers birthday that was and charley was home on his holidays and tom and mr dignam and mrs and patsy and freddy dignam and they were to have had a group taken
noone would have thought the end was so near
now he was laid to rest
and her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldnt even go to the funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from his office about catesbys cork lino artistic standard designs fit for a palace gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the home
a sterling good daughter was gerty just like a second mother in the house a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in gold
and when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was it rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but gerty though she didnt like her mothers taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single thing they ever had words about taking snuff
everyone thought the world of her for her gentle ways
it was gerty who turned off the gas at the main every night and it was gerty who tacked up on the wall of that place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime mr tunney the grocers christmas almanac the picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with oldtime chivalry through her lattice window
you could see there was a story behind it
the colours were done something lovely
she was in a soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat
she often looked at them dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and thought about those times because she had found out in walkers pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa giltrap about the halcyon days what they meant
the twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till at last master jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could down towards the seaweedy rocks
needless to say poor tommy was not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted the ball
our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and to avoid trouble cissy caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to her please
the gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it up the strand towards cissy caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stopped right under gertys skirt near the little pool by the rock
the twins clamoured again for it and cissy told her to kick it away and let them fight for it so gerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadnt come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and edy and cissy laughed
if you fail try again edy boardman said
gerty smiled assent and bit her lip
a delicate pink crept into her pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towards the shingle
pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking
she felt the warm flush a danger signal always with gerty macdowell surging and flaming into her cheeks
till then they had only exchanged glances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she ventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the twilight wan and strangely drawn seemed to her the saddest she had ever seen
through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of original sin spiritual vessel pray for us honourable vessel pray for us vessel of singular devotion pray for us mystical rose
and careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erred and wandered their eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright with hope for the reverend father father hughes had told them what the great saint bernard said in his famous prayer of mary the most pious virgins intercessory power that it was not recorded in any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her
the twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of childhood are but as fleeting summer showers
cissy caffrey played with baby boardman till he crowed with glee clapping baby hands in air
peep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and edy asked where was cissy gone and then cissy popped up her head and cried ah
and my word didnt the little chap enjoy that
and then she told him to say papa
say papa baby
say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa  and baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of health a perfect little bunch of love and he would certainly turn out to be something great they said
haja ja ja haja
cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to sit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried out holy saint denis that he was possing wet and to double the half blanket the other way under him
of course his infant majesty was most obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it  habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa
and two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks
it was all no use soothering him with no nono baby no and telling him about the geegee and where was the puffpuff but ciss always readywitted gave him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was quickly appeased
gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out of that and not get on her nerves no hour to be out and the little brats of twins
she gazed out towards the distant sea
it was like the paintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out the evening and the clouds coming out and the bailey light on howth and to hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they burned in the church like a kind of waft
and while she gazed her heart went pitapat
yes it was her he was looking at and there was meaning in his look
his eyes burned into her as though they would search her through and through read her very soul
wonderful eyes they were superbly expressive but could you trust them
people were so queer
she could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face that he was a foreigner the image of the photo she had of martin harvey the matinee idol only for the moustache which she preferred because she wasnt stagestruck like winny rippingham that wanted they two to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly retrouss from where he was sitting
he was in deep mourning she could see that and the story of a haunting sorrow was written on his face
she would have given worlds to know what it was
he was looking up so intently so still and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down
she was glad that something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking reggy wylie might be out but that was far away
here was that of which she had so often dreamed
it was he who mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he was like noone else
the very heart of the girlwoman went out to him her dreamhusband because she knew on the instant it was him
if he had suffered more sinned against than sinning or even even if he had been himself a sinner a wicked man she cared not
even if he was a protestant or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved her
there were wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm
she was a womanly woman not like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known those cyclists showing off what they hadnt got and she just yearned to know all to forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her make him forget the memory of the past
then mayhap he would embrace her gently like a real man crushing her soft body to him and love her his ownest girlie for herself alone
refuge of sinners
comfortress of the afflicted
ora pro nobis
well has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can never be lost or cast away and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heart
gerty could picture the whole scene in the church the stained glass windows lighted up the candles the flowers and the blue banners of the blessed virgins sodality and father conroy was helping canon ohanlon at the altar carrying things in and out with his eyes cast down
he looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever she became a dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come to the convent for the novena of saint dominic
he told her that time when she told him about that in confession crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he could see not to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we were all subject to natures laws he said in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by god he said and that our blessed lady herself said to the archangel gabriel be it done unto me according to thy word
he was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little house to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hours adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of dublin or some place
the exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and jacky threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it
little monkeys common as ditchwater
someone ought to take them and give them a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places the both of them
and cissy and edy shouted after them to come back because they were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned
jacky
tommy
not they
what a great notion they had
so cissy said it was the very last time shed ever bring them out
she jumped up and called them and she ran down the slope past him tossing her hair behind her which had a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldnt get it to grow long because it wasnt natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it
she ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didnt rip up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboy about cissy caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible
it would have served her just right if she had tripped up over something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked french heels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble
tableau that would have been a very charming expos for a gentleman like that to witness
queen of angels queen of patriarchs queen of prophets of all saints they prayed queen of the most holy rosary and then father conroy handed the thurible to canon ohanlon and he put in the incense and censed the blessed sacrament and cissy caffrey caught the two twins and she was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didnt because she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger mistake in all her life because gerty could see without looking that he never took his eyes off of her and then canon ohanlon handed the thurible back to father conroy and knelt down looking up at the blessed sacrament and the choir began to sing the tantum ergo and she just swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to the tantumer gosa cramen tum
three and eleven she paid for those stockings in sparrows of georges street on the tuesday no the monday before easter and there wasnt a brack on them and that was what he was looking at transparent and not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape nor form the cheek of her
because he had eyes in his head to see the difference for himself
cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanging like a caricature
gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle her hair and a prettier a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen on a girls shouldersa radiant little vision in sooth almost maddening in its sweetness
you would have to travel many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that
she could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerve
she put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes
he was eying her as a snake eyes its prey
her womans instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose
edy boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at gerty half smiling with her specs like an old maid pretending to nurse the baby
irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why noone could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of hers
and she said to gerty  a penny for your thoughts
what
replied gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth
i was only wondering was it late
because she wished to goodness theyd take the snottynosed twins and their babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave a gentle hint about its being late
and when cissy came up edy asked her the time and miss cissy as glib as you like said it was half past kissing time time to kiss again
but edy wanted to know because they were told to be in early
wait said cissy ill run ask my uncle peter over there whats the time by his conundrum
so over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his hand out of his pocket getting nervous and beginning to play with his watchchain looking up at the church
passionate nature though he was gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself
one moment he had been there fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze and the next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman selfcontrol expressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure
cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the right time and gerty could see him taking out his watch listening to it and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sun was set
his voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones
cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said his waterworks were out of order
then they sang the second verse of the tantum ergo and canon ohanlon got up again and censed the blessed sacrament and knelt down and he told father conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the flowers and father conroy got up and settled it all right and she could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and she swung her leg more in and out in time
it was getting darker but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands back into his pockets
she felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on because the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of the moon
his dark eyes fixed themselves on her again drinking in her every contour literally worshipping at her shrine
if ever there was undisguised admiration in a mans passionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that mans face
it is for you gertrude macdowell and you know it
edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and gerty noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place to push up the pushcar and cissy took off the twins caps and tidied their hair to make herself attractive of course and canon ohanlon stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and father conroy handed him the card to read off and he read out panem de coelo praestitisti eis and edy and cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politeness when edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over
gerty winced sharply
a brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn immeasurable
it hurto yes it cut deep because edy had her own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would wound like the confounded little cat she was
gertys lips parted swiftly to frame the word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throat so slim so flawless so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of
she had loved him better than he knew
lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears
their eyes were probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see
o responded gerty quick as lightning laughing and the proud head flashed up
i can throw my cap at who i like because its leap year
her words rang out crystalclear more musical than the cooing of the ringdove but they cut the silence icily
there was that in her young voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with
as for mr reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a dozen pieces
and if ever after he dared to presume she could give him one look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot
miss puny little edys countenance fell to no slight extent and gerty could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering rage though she hid it the little kinnatt because that shaft had struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was something aloof apart in another sphere that she was not of them and never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it
edy straightened up baby boardman to get ready to go and cissy tucked in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the sandman was on his way for master boardman junior
and cissy told him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby looked just too ducky laughing up out of his gleeful eyes and cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby without as much as by your leave sent up his compliments to all and sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib
o my
puddeny pie
protested ciss
he has his bib destroyed
the slight contretemps claimed her attention but in two twos she set that little matter to rights
gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and edy asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet seashore because canon ohanlon was up on the altar with the veil that father conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the blessed sacrament in his hands
how moving the scene there in the gathering twilight the last glimpse of erin the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk hither thither with a tiny lost cry
and she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of paints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along by shady tritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the lamp near her window where reggy wylie used to turn his freewheel like she read in that book the lamplighter by miss cummins author of mabel vaughan and other tales
for gerty had her dreams that noone knew of
she loved to read poetry and when she got a keepsake from bertha supple of that lovely confession album with the coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of her toilettable which though it did not err on the side of luxury was scrupulously neat and clean
it was there she kept her girlish treasure trove the tortoiseshell combs her child of mary badge the whiterose scent the eyebrowleine her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her things came home from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in helys of dame street for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only express herself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs
art thou real my ideal it was called by louis j walsh magherafelt and after there was something about twilight wilt thou ever and ofttimes the beauty of poetry so sad in its transient loveliness had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the years were slipping by for her one by one and but for that one shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an accident coming down dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it
but it must end she felt
if she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be no holding back for her
love laughs at locksmiths
she would make the great sacrifice
her every effort would be to share his thoughts
dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his days with happiness
there was the allimportant question and she was dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land of song had to have her put into a madhouse cruel only to be kind
but even ifwhat then
would it make a very great difference
from everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively recoiled
she loathed that sort of person the fallen women off the accommodation walk beside the dodder that went with the soldiers and coarse men with no respect for a girls honour degrading the sex and being taken up to the police station
no no not that
they would be just good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other in spite of the conventions of society with a big ess
perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall
she thought she understood
she would try to understand him because men were so different
the old love was waiting waiting with little white hands stretched out with blue appealing eyes
heart of mine
she would follow her dream of love the dictates of her heart that told her he was her all in all the only man in all the world for her for love was the master guide
nothing else mattered
come what might she would be wild untrammelled free
canon ohanlon put the blessed sacrament back into the tabernacle and genuflected and the choir sang laudate dominum omnes gentes and then he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and father conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat edy asked wasnt she coming but jacky caffrey called out  o look cissy
and they all looked was it sheet lightning but tommy saw it too over the trees beside the church blue and then green and purple
its fireworks cissy caffrey said
and they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church helterskelter edy with the pushcar with baby boardman in it and cissy holding tommy and jacky by the hand so they wouldnt fall running
come on gerty cissy called
its the bazaar fireworks
but gerty was adamant
she had no intention of being at their beck and call
if they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could see from where she was
the eyes that were fastened upon her set her pulses tingling
she looked at him a moment meeting his glance and a light broke in upon her
whitehot passion was in that face passion silent as the grave and it had made her his
at last they were left alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he could be trusted to the death steadfast a sterling man a man of inflexible honour to his fingertips
his hands and face were working and a tremour went over her
she leaned back far to look up where the fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back looking up and there was noone to see only him and her when she revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that supply soft and delicately rounded and she seemed to hear the panting of his heart his hoarse breathing because she knew too about the passion of men like that hotblooded because bertha supple told her once in dead secret and made her swear shed never about the gentleman lodger that was staying with them out of the congested districts board that had pictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in the bed
but this was altogether different from a thing like that because there was all the difference because she could almost feel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his handsome lips
besides there was absolution so long as you didnt do the other thing before being married and there ought to be women priests that would understand without your telling out and cissy caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she too my dear and winny rippingham so mad about actors photographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on the way it did
and jacky caffrey shouted to look there was another and she leaned back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and they all saw it and they all shouted to look look there it was and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flying through the air a soft thing to and fro dark
and she saw a long roman candle going up over the trees up up and in the tense hush they were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up after it high high almost out of sight and her face was suffused with a divine an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her other things too nainsook knickers the fabric that caresses the skin better than those other pettiwidth the green four and eleven on account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full view high up above her knee where noone ever not even on the swing or wading and she wasnt ashamed and he wasnt either to look in that immodest way like that because he couldnt resist the sight of the wondrous revealment half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on looking looking
she would fain have cried to him chokingly held out her snowy slender arms to him to come to feel his lips laid on her white brow the cry of a young girls love a little strangled cry wrung from her that cry that has rung through the ages
and then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and o
then the roman candle burst and it was like a sigh of o
and everyone cried o
o
in raptures and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah
they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden o so lovely o soft sweet soft
then all melted away dewily in the grey air all was silent
ah
she glanced at him as she bent forward quickly a pathetic little glance of piteous protest of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl
he was leaning back against the rock behind
leopold bloom for it is he stands silent with bowed head before those young guileless eyes
what a brute he had been
at it again
a fair unsullied soul had called to him and wretch that he was how had he answered
an utter cad he had been
he of all men
but there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and wandered
should a girl tell
no a thousand times no
that was their secret only theirs alone in the hiding twilight and there was none to know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the evening to and fro and little bats dont tell
cissy caffrey whistled imitating the boys in the football field to show what a great person she was and then she cried  gerty
gerty
were going
come on
we can see from farther up
gerty had an idea one of loves little ruses
she slipped a hand into her kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of course without letting him and then slipped it back
wonder if hes too far to
she rose
was it goodbye
no
she had to go but they would meet again there and she would dream of that till then tomorrow of her dream of yester eve
she drew herself up to her full height
their souls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart full of a strange shining hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face
she half smiled at him wanly a sweet forgiving smile a smile that verged on tears and then they parted
slowly without looking back she went down the uneven strand to cissy to edy to jacky and tommy caffrey to little baby boardman
it was darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippy seaweed
she walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic of her but with care and very slowly becausebecause gerty macdowell was
tight boots
no
shes lame
o
mr bloom watched her as she limped away
poor girl
thats why shes left on the shelf and the others did a sprint
thought something was wrong by the cut of her jib
jilted beauty
a defect is ten times worse in a woman
but makes them polite
glad i didnt know it when she was on show
hot little devil all the same
i wouldnt mind
curiosity like a nun or a negress or a girl with glasses
that squinty one is delicate
near her monthlies i expect makes them feel ticklish
i have such a bad headache today
where did i put the letter
yes all right
all kinds of crazy longings
licking pennies
girl in tranquilla convent that nun told me liked to smell rock oil
virgins go mad in the end i suppose
sister
how many women in dublin have it today
martha she
something in the air
thats the moon
but then why dont all women menstruate at the same time with the same moon i mean
depends on the time they were born i suppose
or all start scratch then get out of step
sometimes molly and milly together
anyhow i got the best of that
damned glad i didnt do it in the bath this morning over her silly i will punish you letter
made up for that tramdriver this morning
that gouger mcoy stopping me to say nothing
and his wife engagement in the country valise voice like a pickaxe
thankful for small mercies
cheap too
yours for the asking
because they want it themselves
their natural craving
shoals of them every evening poured out of offices
reserve better
dont want it they throw it at you
catch em alive o
pity they cant see themselves
a dream of wellfilled hose
where was that
ah yes
mutoscope pictures in capel street for men only
peeping tom
willys hat and what the girls did with it
do they snapshot those girls or is it all a fake
lingerie does it
felt for the curves inside her dshabill excites them also when theyre
im all clean come and dirty me
and they like dressing one another for the sacrifice
milly delighted with mollys new blouse
at first
put them all on to take them all off
molly
why i bought her the violet garters
us too the tie he wore his lovely socks and turnedup trousers
he wore a pair of gaiters the night that first we met
his lovely shirt was shining beneath his what
of jet
say a woman loses a charm with every pin she takes out
pinned together
o mairy lost the pin of her
dressed up to the nines for somebody
fashion part of their charm
just changes when youre on the track of the secret
except the east mary martha now as then
no reasonable offer refused
she wasnt in a hurry either
always off to a fellow when they are
they never forget an appointment
out on spec probably
they believe in chance because like themselves
and the others inclined to give her an odd dig
girl friends at school arms round each others necks or with ten fingers locked kissing and whispering secrets about nothing in the convent garden
nuns with whitewashed faces cool coifs and their rosaries going up and down vindictive too for what they cant get
barbed wire
be sure now and write to me
and ill write to you
now wont you
molly and josie powell
till mr right comes along then meet once in a blue moon
tableau o look who it is for the love of god

picking holes in each others appearance
youre looking splendid
sister souls
showing their teeth at one another
how many have you left
wouldnt lend each other a pinch of salt
ah
devils they are when thats coming on them
dark devilish appearance
molly often told me feel things a ton weight
scratch the sole of my foot
o that way
o thats exquisite
feel it myself too
good to rest once in a way
wonder if its bad to go with them then
safe in one way
turns milk makes fiddlestrings snap
something about withering plants i read in a garden
besides they say if the flower withers she wears shes a flirt
all are
daresay she felt i
when you feel like that you often meet what you feel
liked me or what
dress they look at
always know a fellow courting collars and cuffs
well cocks and lions do the same and stags
same time might prefer a tie undone or something
trousers
suppose i when i was
no
gently does it
dislike rough and tumble
kiss in the dark and never tell
saw something in me
wonder what
sooner have me as i am than some poet chap with bearsgrease plastery hair lovelock over his dexter optic
to aid gentleman in literary
ought to attend to my appearance my age
didnt let her see me in profile
still you never know
pretty girls and ugly men marrying
beauty and the beast
besides i cant be so if molly
took off her hat to show her hair
wide brim
bought to hide her face meeting someone might know her bend down or carry a bunch of flowers to smell
hair strong in rut
ten bob i got for mollys combings when we were on the rocks in holles street
why not
suppose he gave her money
why not
all a prejudice
shes worth ten fifteen more a pound
what
i think so
all that for nothing
bold hand mrs marion
did i forget to write address on that letter like the postcard i sent to flynn
and the day i went to drimmies without a necktie
wrangle with molly it was put me off
no i remember
richie goulding hes another
weighs on his mind
funny my watch stopped at half past four
dust
shark liver oil they use to clean

save
was that just when he she
o he did
into her
she did
done
ah
mr bloom with careful hand recomposed his wet shirt
o lord that little limping devil
begins to feel cold and clammy
aftereffect not pleasant
still you have to get rid of it someway
they dont care
complimented perhaps
go home to nicey bread and milky and say night prayers with the kiddies
well arent they
see her as she is spoil all
must have the stage setting the rouge costume position music
the name too
amours of actresses
nell gwynn mrs bracegirdle maud branscombe
curtain up
moonlight silver effulgence
maiden discovered with pensive bosom
little sweetheart come and kiss me
still i feel
the strength it gives a man
thats the secret of it
good job i let off there behind the wall coming out of dignams
cider that was
otherwise i couldnt have
makes you want to sing after
lacaus esant taratara
suppose i spoke to her
what about
bad plan however if you dont know how to end the conversation
ask them a question they ask you another
good idea if youre stuck
gain time
but then youre in a cart
wonderful of course if you say good evening and you see shes on for it good evening
o but the dark evening in the appian way i nearly spoke to mrs clinch o thinking she was
whew
girl in meath street that night
all the dirty things i made her say
all wrong of course
my arks she called it
its so hard to find one who
aho
if you dont answer when they solicit must be horrible for them till they harden
and kissed my hand when i gave her the extra two shillings
parrots
press the button and the bird will squeak
wish she hadnt called me sir
o her mouth in the dark
and you a married man with a single girl
thats what they enjoy
taking a man from another woman
or even hear of it
different with me
glad to get away from other chaps wife
eating off his cold plate
chap in the burton today spitting back gumchewed gristle
french letter still in my pocketbook
cause of half the trouble
but might happen sometime i dont think
come in all is prepared
i dreamt
what
worst is beginning
how they change the venue when its not what they like
ask you do you like mushrooms because she once knew a gentleman who
or ask you what someone was going to say when he changed his mind and stopped
yet if i went the whole hog say i want to something like that
because i did
she too
offend her
then make it up
pretend to want something awfully then cry off for her sake
flatters them
she must have been thinking of someone else all the time
what harm
must since she came to the use of reason he he and he
first kiss does the trick
the propitious moment
something inside them goes pop
mushy like tell by their eye on the sly
first thoughts are best
remember that till their dying day
molly lieutenant mulvey that kissed her under the moorish wall beside the gardens
fifteen she told me
but her breasts were developed
fell asleep then
after glencree dinner that was when we drove home
featherbed mountain
gnashing her teeth in sleep
lord mayor had his eye on her too
val dillon
apoplectic
there she is with them down there for the fireworks
my fireworks
up like a rocket down like a stick
and the children twins they must be waiting for something to happen
want to be grownups
dressing in mothers clothes
time enough understand all the ways of the world
and the dark one with the mop head and the nigger mouth
i knew she could whistle
mouth made for that
like molly
why that highclass whore in jammets wore her veil only to her nose
would you mind please telling me the right time
ill tell you the right time up a dark lane
say prunes and prisms forty times every morning cure for fat lips
caressing the little boy too
onlookers see most of the game
of course they understand birds animals babies
in their line
didnt look back when she was going down the strand
wouldnt give that satisfaction
those girls those girls those lovely seaside girls
fine eyes she had clear
its the white of the eye brings that out not so much the pupil
did she know what i
course
like a cat sitting beyond a dogs jump
women never meet one like that wilkins in the high school drawing a picture of venus with all his belongings on show
call that innocence
poor idiot
his wife has her work cut out for her
never see them sit on a bench marked wet paint
eyes all over them
look under the bed for whats not there
longing to get the fright of their lives
sharp as needles they are
when i said to molly the man at the corner of cuffe street was goodlooking thought she might like twigged at once he had a false arm
had too
where do they get that
typist going up roger greenes stairs two at a time to show her understandings
handed down from father to mother to daughter i mean
bred in the bone
milly for example drying her handkerchief on the mirror to save the ironing
best place for an ad to catch a womans eye on a mirror
and when i sent her for mollys paisley shawl to prescotts by the way that ad i must carrying home the change in her stocking
clever little minx
i never told her
neat way she carries parcels too
attract men small thing like that
holding up her hand shaking it to let the blood flow back when it was red
who did you learn that from
nobody
something the nurse taught me
o dont they know
three years old she was in front of mollys dressingtable just before we left lombard street west
me have a nice pace
mullingar
who knows
ways of the world
young student
straight on her pins anyway not like the other
still she was game
lord i am wet
devil you are
swell of her calf
transparent stockings stretched to breaking point
not like that frump today
a e rumpled stockings
or the one in grafton street
white
wow
beef to the heel
a monkey puzzle rocket burst spluttering in darting crackles
zrads and zrads zrads zrads
and cissy and tommy and jacky ran out to see and edy after with the pushcar and then gerty beyond the curve of the rocks
will she
watch
watch
see
looked round
she smelt an onion
darling i saw your
i saw all
lord
did me good all the same
off colour after kiernans dignams
for this relief much thanks
in hamlet that is
lord
it was all things combined
excitement
when she leaned back felt an ache at the butt of my tongue
your head it simply swirls
hes right
might have made a worse fool of myself however
instead of talking about nothing
then i will tell you all
still it was a kind of language between us
it couldnt be
no gerty they called her
might be false name however like my name and the address dolphins barn a blind
her maiden name was jemina brown      and she lived with her mother in irishtown
place made me think of that i suppose
all tarred with the same brush
wiping pens in their stockings
but the ball rolled down to her as if it understood
every bullet has its billet
course i never could throw anything straight at school
crooked as a rams horn
sad however because it lasts only a few years till they settle down to potwalloping and papas pants will soon fit willy and fullers earth for the baby when they hold him out to do ah ah
no soft job
saves them
keeps them out of harms way
nature
washing child washing corpse
dignam
childrens hands always round them
cocoanut skulls monkeys not even closed at first sour milk in their swaddles and tainted curds
oughtnt to have given that child an empty teat to suck
fill it up with wind
mrs beaufoy purefoy
must call to the hospital
wonder is nurse callan there still
she used to look over some nights when molly was in the coffee palace
that young doctor ohare i noticed her brushing his coat
and mrs breen and mrs dignam once like that too marriageable
worst of all at night mrs duggan told me in the city arms
husband rolling in drunk stink of pub off him like a polecat
have that in your nose in the dark whiff of stale boose
then ask in the morning was i drunk last night
bad policy however to fault the husband
chickens come home to roost
they stick by one another like glue
maybe the womens fault also
thats where molly can knock spots off them
its the blood of the south
moorish
also the form the figure
hands felt for the opulent
just compare for instance those others
wife locked up at home skeleton in the cupboard
allow me to introduce my
then they trot you out some kind of a nondescript wouldnt know what to call her
always see a fellows weak point in his wife
still theres destiny in it falling in love
have their own secrets between them
chaps that would go to the dogs if some woman didnt take them in hand
then little chits of girls height of a shilling in coppers with little hubbies
as god made them he matched them
sometimes children turn out well enough
twice nought makes one
or old rich chap of seventy and blushing bride
marry in may and repent in december
this wet is very unpleasant
stuck
well the foreskin is not back
better detach
ow
other hand a sixfooter with a wifey up to his watchpocket
long and the short of it
big he and little she
very strange about my watch
wristwatches are always going wrong
wonder is there any magnetic influence between the person because that was about the time he
yes i suppose at once
cats away the mice will play
i remember looking in pill lane
also that now is magnetism
back of everything magnetism
earth for instance pulling this and being pulled
that causes movement
and time well thats the time the movement takes
then if one thing stopped the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit
because its all arranged
magnetic needle tells you whats going on in the sun the stars
little piece of steel iron
when you hold out the fork
come
come
tip
woman and man that is
fork and steel
molly he
dress up and look and suggest and let you see and see more and defy you if youre a man to see that and like a sneeze coming legs look look and if you have any guts in you
tip
have to let fly
wonder how is she feeling in that region
shame all put on before third person
more put out about a hole in her stocking
molly her underjaw stuck out head back about the farmer in the ridingboots and spurs at the horse show
and when the painters were in lombard street west
fine voice that fellow had
how giuglini began
smell that i did
like flowers
it was too
violets
came from the turpentine probably in the paint
make their own use of everything
same time doing it scraped her slipper on the floor so they wouldnt hear
but lots of them cant kick the beam i think
keep that thing up for hours
kind of a general all round over me and half down my back
wait
hm
hm
yes
thats her perfume
why she waved her hand
i leave you this to think of me when im far away on the pillow
what is it
heliotrope
no
hyacinth
hm
roses i think
shed like scent of that kind
sweet and cheap soon sour
why molly likes opoponax
suits her with a little jessamine mixed
her high notes and her low notes
at the dance night she met him dance of the hours
heat brought it out
she was wearing her black and it had the perfume of the time before
good conductor is it
or bad
light too
suppose theres some connection
for instance if you go into a cellar where its dark
mysterious thing too
why did i smell it only now
took its time in coming like herself slow but sure
suppose its ever so many millions of tiny grains blown across
yes it is
because those spice islands cinghalese this morning smell them leagues off
tell you what it is
its like a fine fine veil or web they have all over the skin fine like what do you call it gossamer and theyre always spinning it out of them fine as anything like rainbow colours without knowing it
clings to everything she takes off
vamp of her stockings
warm shoe
stays
drawers little kick taking them off
byby till next time
also the cat likes to sniff in her shift on the bed
know her smell in a thousand
bathwater too
reminds me of strawberries and cream
wonder where it is really
there or the armpits or under the neck
because you get it out of all holes and corners
hyacinth perfume made of oil of ether or something
muskrat
bag under their tails
one grain pour off odour for years
dogs at each other behind
good evening
evening
how do you sniff
hm
hm
very well thank you
animals go by that
yes now look at it that way
were the same
some women instance warn you off when they have their period
come near
then get a hogo you could hang your hat on
like what
potted herrings gone stale or
boof
please keep off the grass
perhaps they get a man smell off us
what though
cigary gloves long john had on his desk the other day
breath
what you eat and drink gives that
no
mansmell i mean
must be connected with that because priests that are supposed to be are different
women buzz round it like flies round treacle
railed off the altar get on to it at any cost
the tree of forbidden priest
o father will you
let me be the first to
that diffuses itself all through the body permeates
source of life
and its extremely curious the smell
celery sauce
let me
mr bloom inserted his nose
hm
into the
hm
opening of his waistcoat
almonds or
no
lemons it is
ah no thats the soap
o by the by that lotion
i knew there was something on my mind
never went back and the soap not paid
dislike carrying bottles like that hag this morning
hynes might have paid me that three shillings
i could mention meaghers just to remind him
still if he works that paragraph
two and nine
bad opinion of me hell have
call tomorrow
how much do i owe you
three and nine
two and nine sir
ah
might stop him giving credit another time
lose your customers that way
pubs do
fellows run up a bill on the slate and then slinking around the back streets into somewhere else
heres this nobleman passed before
blown in from the bay
just went as far as turn back
always at home at dinnertime
looks mangled out had a good tuck in
enjoying nature now
grace after meals
after supper walk a mile
sure he has a small bank balance somewhere government sit
walk after him now make him awkward like those newsboys me today
still you learn something
see ourselves as others see us
so long as women dont mock what matter
thats the way to find out
ask yourself who is he now
the mystery man on the beach prize titbit story by mr leopold bloom
payment at the rate of one guinea per column
and that fellow today at the graveside in the brown macintosh
corns on his kismet however
healthy perhaps absorb all the
whistle brings rain they say
must be some somewhere
salt in the ormond damp
the body feels the atmosphere
old bettys joints are on the rack
mother shiptons prophecy that is about ships around they fly in the twinkling
no
signs of rain it is
the royal reader
and distant hills seem coming nigh
howth
bailey light
two four six eight nine
see
has to change or they might think it a house
wreckers
grace darling
people afraid of the dark
also glowworms cyclists lightingup time
jewels diamonds flash better
women
light is a kind of reassuring
not going to hurt you
better now of course than long ago
country roads
run you through the small guts for nothing
still two types there are you bob against
scowl or smile
pardon
not at all
best time to spray plants too in the shade after the sun
some light still
red rays are longest
roygbiv vance taught us red orange yellow green blue indigo violet
a star i see
venus

two
when three its night
were those nightclouds there all the time
looks like a phantom ship
no
wait
trees are they
an optical illusion
mirage
land of the setting sun this
homerule sun setting in the southeast
my native land goodnight
dew falling
bad for you dear to sit on that stone
brings on white fluxions
never have little baby then less he was big strong fight his way up through
might get piles myself
sticks too like a summer cold sore on the mouth
cut with grass or paper worst
friction of the position
like to be that rock she sat on
o sweet little you dont know how nice you looked
i begin to like them at that age
green apples
grab at all that offer
suppose its the only time we cross legs seated
also the library today those girl graduates
happy chairs under them
but its the evening influence
they feel all that
open like flowers know their hours sunflowers jerusalem artichokes in ballrooms chandeliers avenues under the lamps
nightstock in mat dillons garden where i kissed her shoulder
wish i had a full length oilpainting of her then
june that was too i wooed
the year returns
history repeats itself
ye crags and peaks im with you once again
life love voyage round your own little world
and now
sad about her lame of course but must be on your guard not to feel too much pity
they take advantage
all quiet on howth now
the distant hills seem
where we
the rhododendrons
i am a fool perhaps
he gets the plums and i the plumstones
where i come in
all that old hill has seen
names change thats all
lovers yum yum
tired i feel now
will i get up
o wait
drained all the manhood out of me little wretch
she kissed me
never again
my youth
only once it comes
or hers

returning not the same
like kids your second visit to a house
the new i want
nothing new under the sun
care of p o dolphins barn
are you not happy in your
naughty darling
at dolphins barn charades in luke doyles house
mat dillon and his bevy of daughters tiny atty floey maimy louy hetty
molly too
eightyseven that was
year before we
and the old major partial to his drop of spirits
curious she an only child i an only child
so it returns
think youre escaping and run into yourself
longest way round is the shortest way home
and just when he and she
circus horse walking in a ring
rip van winkle we played
rip tear in henny doyles overcoat
van breadvan delivering
winkle cockles and periwinkles
then i did rip van winkle coming back
she leaned on the sideboard watching
moorish eyes
twenty years asleep in sleepy hollow
all changed
forgotten
the young are old
his gun rusty from the dew
ba
what is that flying about
swallow
bat probably
thinks im a tree so blind
have birds no smell
metempsychosis
they believed you could be changed into a tree from grief
weeping willow
ba
there he goes
funny little beggar
wonder where he lives
belfry up there
very likely
hanging by his heels in the odour of sanctity
bell scared him out i suppose
mass seems to be over
could hear them all at it
pray for us
and pray for us
and pray for us
good idea the repetition
same thing with ads
buy from us
and buy from us
yes theres the light in the priests house
their frugal meal
remember about the mistake in the valuation when i was in thoms
twentyeight it is
two houses they have
gabriel conroys brother is curate
ba
again
wonder why they come out at night like mice
theyre a mixed breed
birds are like hopping mice
what frightens them light or noise
better sit still
all instinct like the bird in drouth got water out of the end of a jar by throwing in pebbles
like a little man in a cloak he is with tiny hands
weeny bones
almost see them shimmering kind of a bluey white
colours depend on the light you see
stare the sun for example like the eagle then look at a shoe see a blotch blob yellowish
wants to stamp his trademark on everything
instance that cat this morning on the staircase
colour of brown turf
say you never see them with three colours
not true
that half tabbywhite tortoiseshell in the city arms with the letter em on her forehead
body fifty different colours
howth a while ago amethyst
glass flashing
thats how that wise man whats his name with the burning glass
then the heather goes on fire
it cant be tourists matches
what
perhaps the sticks dry rub together in the wind and light
or broken bottles in the furze act as a burning glass in the sun
archimedes
i have it
my memorys not so bad
ba
who knows what theyre always flying for
insects
that bee last week got into the room playing with his shadow on the ceiling
might be the one bit me come back to see
birds too
never find out
or what they say
like our small talk
and says she and says he
nerve they have to fly over the ocean and back
lots must be killed in storms telegraph wires
dreadful life sailors have too
big brutes of oceangoing steamers floundering along in the dark lowing out like seacows
faugh a ballagh out of that bloody curse to you
others in vessels bit of a handkerchief sail pitched about like snuff at a wake when the stormy winds do blow
married too
sometimes away for years at the ends of the earth somewhere
no ends really because its round
wife in every port they say
she has a good job if she minds it till johnny comes marching home again
if ever he does
smelling the tail end of ports
how can they like the sea
yet they do
the anchors weighed
off he sails with a scapular or a medal on him for luck
well
and the tephilim no whats this they call it poor papas father had on his door to touch
that brought us out of the land of egypt and into the house of bondage
something in all those superstitions because when you go out never know what dangers
hanging on to a plank or astride of a beam for grim life lifebelt round him gulping salt water and thats the last of his nibs till the sharks catch hold of him
do fish ever get seasick
then you have a beautiful calm without a cloud smooth sea placid crew and cargo in smithereens davy jones locker moon looking down so peaceful
not my fault old cockalorum
a last lonely candle wandered up the sky from mirus bazaar in search of funds for mercers hospital and broke drooping and shed a cluster of violet but one white stars
they floated fell they faded
the shepherds hour the hour of folding hour of tryst
from house to house giving his everwelcome double knock went the nine oclock postman the glowworms lamp at his belt gleaming here and there through the laurel hedges
and among the five young trees a hoisted lintstock lit the lamp at leahys terrace
by screens of lighted windows by equal gardens a shrill voice went crying wailing evening telegraph stop press edition
result of the gold cup races and from the door of dignams house a boy ran out and called
twittering the bat flew here flew there
far out over the sands the coming surf crept grey
howth settled for slumber tired of long days of yumyum rhododendrons he was old and felt gladly the night breeze lift ruffle his fell of ferns
he lay but opened a red eye unsleeping deep and slowly breathing slumberous but awake
and far on kish bank the anchored lightship twinkled winked at mr bloom
life those chaps out there must have stuck in the same spot
irish lights board
penance for their sins
coastguards too
rocket and breeches buoy and lifeboat
day we went out for the pleasure cruise in the erins king throwing them the sack of old papers
bears in the zoo
filthy trip
drunkards out to shake up their livers
puking overboard to feed the herrings
nausea
and the women fear of god in their faces
milly no sign of funk
her blue scarf loose laughing
dont know what death is at that age
and then their stomachs clean
but being lost they fear
when we hid behind the tree at crumlin
i didnt want to
mamma
mamma
babes in the wood
frightening them with masks too
throwing them up in the air to catch them
ill murder you
is it only half fun
or children playing battle
whole earnest
how can people aim guns at each other
sometimes they go off
poor kids
only troubles wildfire and nettlerash
calomel purge i got her for that
after getting better asleep with molly
very same teeth she has
what do they love
another themselves
but the morning she chased her with the umbrella
perhaps so as not to hurt
i felt her pulse
ticking
little hand it was now big
dearest papli
all that the hand says when you touch
loved to count my waistcoat buttons
her first stays i remember
made me laugh to see
little paps to begin with
left one is more sensitive i think
mine too
nearer the heart
padding themselves out if fat is in fashion
her growing pains at night calling wakening me
frightened she was when her nature came on her first
poor child
strange moment for the mother too
brings back her girlhood
gibraltar
looking from buena vista
oharas tower
the seabirds screaming
old barbary ape that gobbled all his family
sundown gunfire for the men to cross the lines
looking out over the sea she told me
evening like this but clear no clouds
i always thought id marry a lord or a rich gentleman coming with a private yacht
buenas noches seorita
el hombre ama la muchacha hermosa
why me
because you were so foreign from the others
better not stick here all night like a limpet
this weather makes you dull
must be getting on for nine by the light
go home
too late for leah lily of killarney no
might be still up
call to the hospital to see
hope shes over
long day ive had
martha the bath funeral house of keyes museum with those goddesses dedalus song
then that bawler in barney kiernans
got my own back there
drunken ranters what i said about his god made him wince
mistake to hit back
or
no
ought to go home and laugh at themselves
always want to be swilling in company
afraid to be alone like a child of two
suppose he hit me
look at it other way round
not so bad then
perhaps not to hurt he meant
three cheers for israel
three cheers for the sisterinlaw he hawked about three fangs in her mouth
same style of beauty
particularly nice old party for a cup of tea
the sister of the wife of the wild man of borneo has just come to town
imagine that in the early morning at close range
everyone to his taste as morris said when he kissed the cow
but dignams put the boots on it
houses of mourning so depressing because you never know
anyhow she wants the money
must call to those scottish widows as i promised
strange name
takes it for granted were going to pop off first
that widow on monday was it outside cramers that looked at me
buried the poor husband but progressing favourably on the premium
her widows mite
well
what do you expect her to do
must wheedle her way along
widower i hate to see

poor man oconnor wife and five children poisoned by mussels here

some good matronly woman in a porkpie hat to mother him

some flatfoot tramp on it in the morning
useless

all these rocks with lines and scars and letters
o those transparent
besides they dont know
what is the meaning of that other world
i called you naughty boy because i do not like

mr bloom effaced the letters with his slow boot
hopeless thing sand
nothing grows in it
all fades
no fear of big vessels coming up here
except guinnesss barges
round the kish in eighty days
done half by design
he flung his wooden pen away
the stick fell in silted sand stuck
now if you were trying to do that for a week on end you couldnt
chance

universally that persons acumen is esteemed very little perceptive concerning whatsoever matters are being held as most profitably by mortals with sapience endowed to be studied who is ignorant of that which the most in doctrine erudite and certainly by reason of that in them high minds ornament deserving of veneration constantly maintain when by general consent they affirm that other circumstances being equal by no exterior splendour is the prosperity of a nation more efficaciously asserted than by the measure of how far forward may have progressed the tribute of its solicitude for that proliferent continuance which of evils the original if it be absent when fortunately present constitutes the certain sign of omnipollent natures incorrupted benefaction
for who is there who anything of some significance has apprehended but is conscious that that exterior splendour may be the surface of a downwardtending lutulent reality or on the contrary anyone so is there unilluminated as not to perceive that as no natures boon can contend against the bounty of increase so it behoves every most just citizen to become the exhortator and admonisher of his semblables and to tremble lest what had in the past been by the nation excellently commenced might be in the future not with similar excellence accomplished if an inverecund habit shall have gradually traduced the honourable by ancestors transmitted customs to that thither of profundity that that one was audacious excessively who would have the hardihood to rise affirming that no more odious offence can for anyone be than to oblivious neglect to consign that evangel simultaneously command and promise which on all mortals with prophecy of abundance or with diminutions menace that exalted of reiteratedly procreating function ever irrevocably enjoined

full she drad that god the wreaker all mankind would fordo with water for his evil sins
christs rood made she on breastbone and him drew that he would rathe infare under her thatch
that man her will wotting worthful went in hornes house
loth to irk in hornes hall hat holding the seeker stood
on her stow he ere was living with dear wife and lovesome daughter that then over land and seafloor nine years had long outwandered
once her in townhithe meeting he to her bow had not doffed
her to forgive now he craved with good ground of her allowed that that of him swiftseen face hers so young then had looked
light swift her eyes kindled bloom of blushes his word winning
as her eyes then ongot his weeds swart therefor sorrow she feared
glad after she was that ere adread was
her he asked if ohare doctor tidings sent from far coast and she with grameful sigh him answered that ohare doctor in heaven was
sad was the man that word to hear that him so heavied in bowels ruthful
all she there told him ruing death for friend so young algate sore unwilling gods rightwiseness to withsay
she said that he had a fair sweet death through god his goodness with masspriest to be shriven holy housel and sick mens oil to his limbs
the man then right earnest asked the nun of which death the dead man was died and the nun answered him and said that he was died in mona island through bellycrab three year agone come childermas and she prayed to god the allruthful to have his dear soul in his undeathliness
he heard her sad words in held hat sad staring
so stood they there both awhile in wanhope sorrowing one with other
therefore everyman look to that last end that is thy death and the dust that gripeth on every man that is born of woman for as he came naked forth from his mothers womb so naked shall he wend him at the last for to go as he came
the man that was come in to the house then spoke to the nursingwoman and he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in childbed
the nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in throes now full three days and that it would be a hard birth unneth to bear but that now in a little it would be
she said thereto that she had seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was that womans birth
then she set it all forth to him for because she knew the man that time was had lived nigh that house
the man hearkened to her words for he felt with wonder womens woe in the travail that they have of motherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair face for any man to see but yet was she left after long years a handmaid
nine twelve bloodflows chiding her childless
and whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there nighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat
and there came against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept dixon
and the traveller leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where this learningknight lay by cause the traveller leopold came there to be healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice
and he said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with them that were there
and the traveller leopold said that he should go otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile
also the lady was of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility
but the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a marvellous castle
and the traveller leopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometime venery
and in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of finlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not move more for enchantment
and on this board were frightful swords and knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there abound marvellously
and there were vessels that are wrought by magic of mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he blases in to them like to bubbles
and full fair cheer and rich was on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer
and there was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be possible thing without they see it natheless they are so
and these fishes lie in an oily water brought there from portugal land because of the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress
and also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of chaldee that by aid of certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain
and they teach the serpents there to entwine themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead
and the learning knight let pour for childe leopold a draught and halp thereto the while all they that were there drank every each
and childe leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and his neighbour nist not of this wile
and he sat down in that castle with them for to rest him there awhile
thanked be almighty god
this meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at the reverence of jesu our alther liege lord to leave their wassailing for there was above one quick with child a gentle dame whose time hied fast
sir leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what cry that it was whether of child or woman and i marvel said he that it be not come or now
meseems it dureth overlong
and he was ware and saw a franklin that hight lenehan on that side the table that was older than any of the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full gently
but said he or it be long too she will bring forth by god his bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long
and the franklin that had drunken said expecting each moment to be her next
also he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to drink and now drink said he fully delectably and he quaffed as far as he might to their boths health for he was a passing good man of his lustiness
and sir leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat in scholars hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight of the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him courtly in the cup
womans woe with wonder pondering
now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be drunken an they might
there was a sort of scholars along either side the board that is to wit dixon yclept junior of saint mary merciables with other his fellows lynch and madden scholars of medicine and the franklin that hight lenehan and one from alba longa one crotthers and young stephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board and costello that men clepen punch costello all long of a mastery of him erewhile gested and of all them reserved young stephen he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead and beside the meek sir leopold
but on young malachi they waited for that he promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his avow
and sir leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir simon and to this his son young stephen and for that his languor becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that time in the honourablest manner
ruth red him love led on with will to wander loth to leave
for they were right witty scholars
and he heard their aresouns each gen other as touching birth and righteousness young madden maintaining that put such case it were hard the wife to die for so it had fallen out a matter of some year agone with a woman of eblana in hornes house that now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case
and they said farther she should live because in the beginning they said the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of this imagination affirmed how young madden had said truth for he had conscience to let her die
and not few and of these was young lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges did provide no remedy
a redress god grant
this was scant said but all cried with one acclaim nay by our virgin mother the wife should live and the babe to die
in colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but the franklin lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lack
then young madden showed all the whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to saint ultan of arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby they were all wondrous grieved
to whom young stephen had these words following murmur sirs is eke oft among lay folk
both babe and parent now glorify their maker the one in limbo gloom the other in purgefire
but gramercy what of those godpossibled souls that we nightly impossibilise which is the sin against the holy ghost very god lord and giver of life
for sirs he said our lust is brief
we are means to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends than we
then said dixon junior to punch costello wist he what ends
but he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead
whereat crotthers of alba longa sang young malachis praise of that beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn the other all this while pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice him witnessing all and several by saint foutinus his engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do
thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young stephen and sir leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might be or wheresoever
then spake young stephen orgulous of mother church that would cast him out of her bosom of law of canons of lilith patron of abortions of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or as virgilius saith by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with effectu secuto or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of averroes and moses maimonides
he said also how at the end of the second month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for gods greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the fishermans seal even that blessed peter on which rock was holy church for all ages founded
all they bachelors then asked of sir leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life
a wariness of mind he would answer as fitted all and laying hand to jaw he said dissembling as his wont was that as it was informed him who had ever loved the art of physic as might a layman and agreeing also with his experience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that mother church belike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their questions
that is truth pardy said dixon and or i err a pregnant word
which hearing young stephen was a marvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons
but sir leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and as he was minded of his good lady marion that had borne him an only manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art could save so dark is destiny
and she was wondrous stricken of heart for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of lambs wool the flower of the flock lest he might perish utterly and lie akeled for it was then about the midst of the winter and now sir leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his friends son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage for all accounted him of real parts so grieved he also in no less measure for young stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and murdered his goods with whores
about that present time young stephen filled all cups that stood empty so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed their approach from him that still plied it very busily who praying for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff he gave them for a pledge the vicar of christ which also as he said is vicar of bray
now drink we quod he of this mazer and quaff ye this mead which is not indeed parcel of my body but my souls bodiment
leave ye fraction of bread to them that live by bread alone
be not afeard neither for any want for this will comfort more than the other will dismay
see ye here
and he showed them glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the worth of two pound nineteen shilling that he had he said for a song which he writ
they all admired to see the foresaid riches in such dearth of money as was herebefore
his words were then these as followeth know all men he said times ruins build eternitys mansions
what means this
desires wind blasts the thorntree but after it becomes from a bramblebush to be a rose upon the rood of time
mark me now
in womans womb word is made flesh but in the spirit of the maker all flesh that passes becomes the word that shall not pass away

to be short this passage was scarce by when master dixon of mary in eccles goodly grinning asked young stephen what was the reason why he had not cided to take friars vows and he answered him obedience in the womb chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days
master lenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds and how as he heard hereof counted he had besmirched the lily virtue of a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all intershowed it too waxing merry and toasting to his fathership
but he said very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was the eternal son and ever virgin
thereat mirth grew in them the more and they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing and deflowering of spouses as the priests use in madagascar island she to be in guise of white and saffron her groom in white and grain with burning of nard and tapers on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries and the anthem ut novetur sexus omnis corporis mysterium till she was there unmaided

young stephen said indeed to his best remembrance they had but the one doxy between them and she of the stews to make shift with in delights amorous for life ran very high in those days and the custom of the country approved with it

a black crack of noise in the street here alack bawled back
loud on left thor thundered in anger awful the hammerhurler
came now the storm that hist his heart
and master lynch bade him have a care to flout and witwanton as the god self was angered for his hellprate and paganry
and he that had erst challenged to be so doughty waxed wan as they might all mark and shrank together and his pitch that was before so haught uplift was now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart shook within the cage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that storm
then did some mock and some jeer and punch costello fell hard again to his yale which master lenehan vowed he would do after and he was indeed but a word and a blow on any the least colour
but the braggart boaster cried that an old nobodaddy was in his cups it was muchwhat indifferent and he would not lag behind his lead
but this was only to dye his desperation as cowed he crouched in hornes hall
he drank indeed at one draught to pluck up a heart of any grace for it thundered long rumblingly over all the heavens so that master madden being godly certain whiles knocked him on his ribs upon that crack of doom and master bloom at the braggarts side spoke to him calming words to slumber his great fear advertising how it was no other thing but a hubbub noise that he heard the discharge of fluid from the thunderhead look you having taken place and all of the order of a natural phenomenon
but was young boasthards fear vanquished by calmers words
no for he had in his bosom a spike named bitterness which could not by words be done away
and was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the other
he was neither as much as he would have liked to be either
but could he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the bottle holiness that then he lived withal
indeed no for grace was not there to find that bottle
heard he then in that clap the voice of the god bringforth or what calmer said a hubbub of phenomenon
heard
why he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube understanding which he had not done
for through that tube he saw that he was in the land of phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die as he was like the rest too a passing show
and would he not accept to die like the rest and pass away
by no means would he though he must nor would he make more shows according as men do with wives which phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book law
then wotted he nought of that other land which is called believeonme that is the land of promise which behoves to the king delightful and shall be for ever where there is no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering at which all shall come as many as believe on it
yes pious had told him of that land and chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing exterior whose name she said is birdinthehand and she beguiled him wrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to him as ho you pretty man turn aside hither and i will show you a brave place and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him in her grot which is named twointhebush or by some learned carnal concupiscence
this was it what all that company that sat there at commons in manse of mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore birdinthehand which was within all foul plagues monsters and a wicked devil they would strain the last but they would make at her and know her
for regarding believeonme they said it was nought else but notion and they could conceive no thought of it for first twointhebush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and in it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these words printed on them pickaback and topsyturvy and shameface and cheek by jowl and second for that foul plague allpox and the monsters they cared not for them for preservative had given them a stout shield of oxengut and third that they might take no hurt neither from offspring that was that wicked devil by virtue of this same shield which was named killchild
so were they all in their blind fancy mr cavil and mr sometimes godly mr ape swillale mr false franklin mr dainty dixon young boasthard and mr cautious calmer

bloom there for a languor he had but was now better he having dreamed tonight a strange fancy of his dame mrs moll with red slippers on in a pair of turkey trunks which is thought by those in ken to be for a change and mistress purefoy there that got in through pleading her belly and now on the stools poor body two days past her term the midwives sore put to it and cant deliver she queasy for a bowl of riceslop that is a shrewd drier up of the insides and her breath very heavy more than good and should be a bullyboy from the knocks they say but god give her soon issue
tis her ninth chick to live i hear and lady day bit off her last chicks nails that was then a twelvemonth and with other three all breastfed that died written out in a fair hand in the kings bible
her hub fifty odd and a methodist but takes the sacrament and is to be seen any fair sabbath with a pair of his boys off bullock harbour dapping on the sound with a heavybraked reel or in a punt he has trailing for flounder and pollock and catches a fine bag i hear
in sum an infinite great fall of rain and all refreshed and will much increase the harvest yet those in ken say after wind and water fire shall come for a prognostication of malachis almanac and i hear that mr russell has done a prophetical charm of the same gist out of the hindustanish for his farmers gazette to have three things in all but this a mere fetch without bottom of reason for old crones and bairns yet sometimes they are found in the right guess with their queerities no telling how
with this came up lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the letter was in that nights gazette and he made a show to find it about him for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it but on stephens persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit near by which he did mighty brisk
he was a kind of sport gentleman that went for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of women horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat
to tell the truth he was mean in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the coffeehouses and low taverns with crimps ostlers bookies pauls men runners flatcaps waistcoateers ladies of the bagnio and other rogues of the game or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at nights till broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much loose gossip
he took his ordinary at a boilingcooks and if he had but gotten into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a bare tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his tongue some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every mothers son of them would burst their sides
the other costello that is hearing this talk asked was it poetry or a tale
faith no he says frank that was his name tis all about kerry cows that are to be butchered along of the plague
but they can go hang says he with a wink for me with their bully beef a pox on it
theres as good fish in this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly he offered to take of some salty sprats that stood by which he had eyed wishly in the meantime and found the place which was indeed the chief design of his embassy as he was sharpset
mort aux vaches says frank then in the french language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper that has a winelodge in bordeaux and he spoke french like a gentleman too
from a child this frank had been a donought that his father a headborough who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and the use of the globes matriculated at the university to study the mechanics but he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes
one time he would be a playactor then a sutler or a welsher then nought would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main then he was for the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the romany folk kidnapping a squires heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids linen or choking chicken behind a hedge
he had been off as many times as a cat has lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to his father the headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw him
what says mr leopold with his hands across that was earnest to know the drift of it will they slaughter all
i protest i saw them but this day morning going to the liverpool boats says he
i can scarce believe tis so bad says he
and he had experience of the like brood beasts and of springers greasy hoggets and wether wool having been some years before actuary for mr joseph cuffe a worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by mr gavin lows yard in prussia street
i question with you there says he
more like tis the hoose or the timber tongue
mr stephen a little moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had dispatches from the emperors chief tailtickler thanking him for the hospitality that was sending over doctor rinderpest the bestquoted cowcatcher in all muscovy with a bolus or two of physic to take the bull by the horns
come come says mr vincent plain dealing
hell find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull thats irish says he
irish by name and irish by nature says mr stephen and he sent the ale purling about an irish bull in an english chinashop
i conceive you says mr dixon
it is that same bull that was sent to our island by farmer nicholas the bravest cattlebreeder of them all with an emerald ring in his nose
true for you says mr vincent cross the table and a bullseye into the bargain says he and a plumper and a portlier bull says he never shit on shamrock
he had horns galore a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils so that the women of our island leaving doughballs and rollingpins followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains
what for that says mr dixon but before he came over farmer nicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who were no better off than himself
so be off now says he and do all my cousin german the lord harry tells you and take a farmers blessing and with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly
but the slap and the blessing stood him friend says mr vincent for to make up he taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid wife abbess and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the four fields of all ireland
another then put in his word and they dressed him says he in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his hearts content
by this time the father of the faithful for so they called him was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture
to remedy which our cozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on his hind quarters to show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls language and they all after him
ay says another and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself for that was the only colour to his mind and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice saying by the lord harry green is the grass that grows on the ground
and says mr dixon if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in roscommon or the wilds of connemara or a husbandman in sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out hed run amok over half the countryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord harrys orders
there was bad blood between them at first says mr vincent and the lord harry called farmer nicholas all the old nicks in the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and ill meddle in his matters says he
ill make that animal smell hell says he with the help of that good pizzle my father left me
but one evening says mr dixon when the lord harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace he had spade oars for himself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row with pitchforks he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion bull of the romans bos bovum which is good bog latin for boss of the show
after that says mr vincent the lord harry put his head into a cows drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and pulling it out again told them all his new name
then with the water running off him he got into an old smock and skirt that had belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls language to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what took his fancy the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of cotton or a corkfloat
in short he and the bull of ireland were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt
they were says mr stephen and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward as the ungrate women were all of one mind made a wherry raft loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard set all masts erect manned the yards sprang their luff heaved to spread three sheets in the wind put her head between wind and water weighed anchor ported her helm ran up the jolly roger gave three times three let the bullgine run pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of america
which was the occasion says mr vincent of the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty  pope peters but a pissabed
a mans a man for a that  our worthy acquaintance mr malachi mulligan now appeared in the doorway as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend whom he had just rencountered a young gentleman his name alec bannon who had late come to town it being his intention to buy a colour or a cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars
mr mulligan was civil enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched on
whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards which he had had printed that day at mr quinnells bearing a legend printed in fair italics mr malachi mulligan
fertiliser and incubator
lambay island
his project as he went on to expound was to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir fopling popinjay and sir milksop quidnunc in town and to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed
well let us hear of it good my friend said mr dixon
i make no doubt it smacks of wenching
come be seated both
tis as cheap sitting as standing
mr mulligan accepted of the invitation and expatiating upon his design told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility both the inhibitory and the prohibitory whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities acquired
it grieved him plaguily he said to see the nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges and to reflect upon so many agreeable females with rich jointures a prey to the vilest bonzes who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress this he assured them made his heart weep
to curb this inconvenient which he concluded due to a suppression of latent heat having advised with certain counsellors of worth and inspected into this matter he had resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of lambay island from its holder lord talbot de malahide a tory gentleman of note much in favour with our ascendancy party
he proposed to set up there a national fertilising farm to be named omphalos with an obelisk hewn and erected after the fashion of egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her natural
money was no object he said nor would he take a penny for his pains
the poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of fashion if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm persuaders for their petitions would find in him their man
for his nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there the flesh of these latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose both broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum chillies
after this homily which he delivered with much warmth of asseveration mr mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with which he had shielded it
they both it seems had been overtaken by the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water as might be observed by mr mulligans smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now somewhat piebald
his project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though mr dixon of marys excepted to it asking with a finicking air did he purpose also to carry coals to newcastle
mr mulligan however made court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which as it dwelt upon his memory seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of his contention talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi o quirites ut matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus centurionum romanorum magnopere anteponunt while for those of ruder wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more suitable to their stomach the buck and doe of the forest glade the farmyard drake and duck
valuing himself not a little upon his elegance being indeed a proper man of person this talkative now applied himself to his dress with animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had advanced
the young gentleman his friend overjoyed as he was at a passage that had late befallen him could not forbear to tell it his nearest neighbour
mr mulligan now perceiving the table asked for whom were those loaves and fishes and seeing the stranger he made him a civil bow and said pray sir was you in need of any professional assistance we could give
who upon his offer thanked him very heartily though preserving his proper distance and replied that he was come there about a lady now an inmate of hornes house that was in an interesting condition poor body from womans woe and here he fetched a deep sigh to know if her happiness had yet taken place
mr dixon to turn the table took on to ask of mr mulligan himself whether his incipient ventripotence upon which he rallied him betokened an ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due as with the noted physician mr austin meldon to a wolf in the stomach
for answer mr mulligan in a gale of laughter at his smalls smote himself bravely below the diaphragm exclaiming with an admirable droll mimic of mother grogan the most excellent creature of her sex though tis pity shes a trollop theres a belly that never bore a bastard
this was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight
the spry rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the antechamber
here the listener who was none other than the scotch student a little fume of a fellow blond as tow congratulated in the liveliest fashion with the young gentleman and interrupting the narrative at a salient point having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by a questioning poise of the head a whole century of polite breeding had not achieved so nice a gesture to which was united an equivalent but contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it
mais bien sr noble stranger said he cheerily et mille compliments
that you may and very opportunely
there wanted nothing but this cup to crown my felicity
but gracious heaven was i left with but a crust in my wallet and a cupful of water from the well my god i would accept of them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the giver of good things
with these words he approached the goblet to his lips took a complacent draught of the cordial slicked his hair and opening his bosom out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband that very picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein
gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness ah monsieur he said had you but beheld her as i did with these eyes at that affecting instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap a gift for her feastday as she told me prettily in such an artless disorder of so melting a tenderness pon my conscience even you monsieur had been impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever
i declare i was never so touched in all my life
god i thank thee as the author of my days
thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her favours
a sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and having replaced the locket in his bosom he wiped his eye and sighed again
beneficent disseminator of blessings to all thy creatures how great and universal must be that sweetest of thy tyrannies which can hold in thrall the free and the bond the simple swain and the polished coxcomb the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of maturer years
but indeed sir i wander from the point
how mingled and imperfect are all our sublunary joys
maledicity
he exclaimed in anguish
would to god that foresight had but remembered me to take my cloak along
i could weep to think of it
then though it had poured seven showers we were neither of us a penny the worse
but beshrew me he cried clapping hand to his forehead tomorrow will be a new day and thousand thunders i know of a marchand de capotes monsieur poyntz from whom i can have for a livre as snug a cloak of the french fashion as ever kept a lady from wetting
tut tut
cries le fcondateur tripping in my friend monsieur moore that most accomplished traveller i have just cracked a half bottle avec lui in a circle of the best wits of the town is my authority that in cape horn ventre biche they have a rain that will wet through any even the stoutest cloak
a drenching of that violence he tells me sans blague has sent more than one luckless fellow in good earnest posthaste to another world
pooh
a livre cries monsieur lynch
the clumsy things are dear at a sou
one umbrella were it no bigger than a fairy mushroom is worth ten such stopgaps
no woman of any wit would wear one
my dear kitty told me today that she would dance in a deluge before ever she would starve in such an ark of salvation for as she reminded me blushing piquantly and whispering in my ear though there was none to snap her words but giddy butterflies dame nature by the divine blessing has implanted it in our hearts and it has become a household word that il y a deux choses for which the innocence of our original garb in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties is the fittest nay the only garment
the first said she and here my pretty philosopher as i handed her to her tilbury to fix my attention gently tipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my ear the first is a bath
but at this point a bell tinkling in the hall cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of our store of knowledge
amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and while all were conjecturing what might be the cause miss callan entered and having spoken a few words in a low tone to young mr dixon retired with a profound bow to the company
the presence even for a moment among a party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and not less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of ribaldry
strike me silly said costello a low fellow who was fuddled
a monstrous fine bit of cowflesh
ill be sworn she has rendezvoused you
what you dog
have you a way with them
gads bud immensely so said mr lynch
the bedside manner it is that they use in the mater hospice
demme does not doctor ogargle chuck the nuns there under the chin
as i look to be saved i had it from my kitty who has been wardmaid there any time these seven months
lawksamercy doctor cried the young blood in the primrose vest feigning a womanish simper and with immodest squirmings of his body how you do tease a body

the young surgeon however rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just then informed him that he was needed in the ward
merciful providence had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings of the lady who was enceinte which she had borne with a laudable fortitude and she had given birth to a bouncing boy

having delivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and repaired to the door
a murmur of approval arose from all and some were for ejecting the low soaker without more ado a design which would have been effected nor would he have received more than his bare deserts had he not abridged his transgression by affirming with a horrid imprecation for he swore a round hand that he was as good a son of the true fold as ever drew breath

to revert to mr bloom who after his first entry had been conscious of some impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity
the young sparks it is true were as full of extravagancies as overgrown children the words of their tumultuary discussions were difficultly understood and not often nice their testiness and outrageous mots were such that his intellects resiled from nor were they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf
but the word of mr costello was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch that seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity born out of wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into the world which the dint of the surgeons pliers in his skull lent indeed a colour to so as to put him in thought of that missing link of creations chain desiderated by the late ingenious mr darwin
it was now for more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had passed through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and being of a wary ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast he had enjoined his heart to repress all motions of a rising choler and by intercepting them with the readiest precaution foster within his breast that plenitude of sufferance which base minds jeer at rash judgers scorn and all find tolerable and but tolerable
to those who create themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy a habit of mind which he never did hold with to them he would concede neither to bear the name nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding while for such that having lost all forbearance can lose no more there remained the sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to beat a precipitate and inglorious retreat

all fell to praising of it each after his own fashion though the same young blade held with his former view that another than her conjugial had been the man in the gap a clerk in orders a linkboy virtuous or an itinerant vendor of articles needed in every household
singular communed the guest with himself the wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them that the puerperal dormitory and the dissecting theatre should be the seminaries of such frivolity that the mere acquisition of academic titles should suffice to transform in a pinch of time these votaries of levity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most men anywise eminent have esteemed the noblest

the gravest problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine were examined with as much animation as the most popular beliefs on the state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid woman to step over a countrystile lest by her movement the navelcord should strangle her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a yearning ardently and ineffectually entertained to place her hand against that part of her person which long usage has consecrated as the seat of castigation

but malachias tale began to freeze them with horror
he conjured up the scene before them
the secret panel beside the chimney slid back and in the recess appeared haines
which of us did not feel his flesh creep
he had a portfolio full of celtic literature in one hand in the other a phial marked poison surprise horror loathing were depicted on all faces while he eyed them with a ghostly grin

tare and ages what way would i be resting at all he muttered thickly and i tramping dublin this while back with my share of songs and himself after me the like of a soulth or a bullawurrus
my hell and irelands is in this life
it is what i tried to obliterate my crime
distractions rookshooting the erse language he recited some laudanum he raised the phial to his lips camping out
in vain
his spectre stalks me
dope is my only hope ah
destruction
the black panther
with a cry he suddenly vanished and the panel slid back
an instant later his head appeared in the door opposite and said meet me at westland row station at ten past eleven
he was gone
tears gushed from the eyes of the dissipated host
the seer raised his hand to heaven murmuring the vendetta of mananaun
the sage repeated lex talionis
the sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done
malachias overcome by emotion ceased
the mystery was unveiled
haines was the third brother
his real name was childs
the black panther was himself the ghost of his own father

no longer is leopold as he sits there ruminating chewing the cud of reminiscence that staid agent of publicity and holder of a modest substance in the funds

the voices blend and fuse in clouded silence silence that is the infinite of space and swiftly silently the soul is wafted over regions of cycles of generations that have lived
a region where grey twilight ever descends never falls on wide sagegreen pasturefields shedding her dusk scattering a perennial dew of stars
she follows her mother with ungainly steps a mare leading her fillyfoal
twilight phantoms are they yet moulded in prophetic grace of structure slim shapely haunches a supple tendonous neck the meek apprehensive skull

how serene does she now arise a queen among the pleiades in the penultimate antelucan hour shod in sandals of bright gold coifed with a veil of what do you call it gossamer
it floats it flows about her starborn flesh and loose it streams emerald sapphire mauve and heliotrope sustained on currents of the cold interstellar wind winding coiling simply swirling writhing in the skies a mysterious writing till after a myriad metamorphoses of symbol it blazes alpha a ruby and triangled sign upon the forehead of taurus
francis was reminding stephen of years before when they had been at school together in conmees time
he asked about glaucon alcibiades pisistratus

o no vincent lenehan said laying a hand on the shoulder near him
have no fear
he could not leave his mother an orphan
the young mans face grew dark
all could see how hard it was for him to be reminded of his promise and of his recent loss
he would have withdrawn from the feast had not the noise of voices allayed the smart
madden had lost five drachmas on sceptre for a whim of the riders name lenehan as much more
he told them of the race

off scamper the mare ran out freshly with o madden up
she was leading the field
all hearts were beating
even phyllis could not contain herself
she waved her scarf and cried huzzah

but in the straight on the run home when all were in close order the dark horse throwaway drew level reached outstripped her
all was lost now
phyllis was silent her eyes were sad anemones
juno she cried i am undone
but her lover consoled her and brought her a bright casket of gold in which lay some oval sugarplums which she partook
a tear fell one only

four winners yesterday and three today
what rider is like him

but let us bear it as was the ancient wont
mercy on the luckless

he said with a light sigh
she is not the filly that she was
never by this hand shall we behold such another

i wish you could have seen my queen today vincent said
how young she was and radiant lalage were scarce fair beside her in her yellow shoes and frock of muslin i do not know the right name of it
the chestnuts that shaded us were in bloom the air drooped with their persuasive odour and with pollen floating by us
in the sunny patches one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of those buns with corinth fruit in them that periplipomenes sells in his booth near the bridge
but she had nought for her teeth but the arm with which i held her and in that she nibbled mischievously when i pressed too close
a week ago she lay ill four days on the couch but today she was free blithe mocked at peril
she is more taking then
her posies too
mad romp that she is she had pulled her fill as we reclined together
and in your ear my friend you will not think who met us as we left the field
conmee himself
he was walking by the hedge reading i think a brevier book with i doubt not a witty letter in it from glycera or chloe to keep the page
the sweet creature turned all colours in her confusion feigning to reprove a slight disorder in her dress a slip of underwood clung there for the very trees adore her
when conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely echo in that little mirror she carries
but he had been kind
in going by he had blessed us
the gods too are ever kind lenehan said

he was laying his hand upon a winejar malachi saw it and withheld his act pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label

do you not think it stephen
theosophos told me so stephen answered whom in a previous existence egyptian priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law
the lords of the moon theosophos told me an orangefiery shipload from planet alpha of the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these were therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second constellation
however as a matter of fact though the preposterous surmise about him being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which was entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character was not the case at all
the individual whose visual organs while the above was going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of animation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody that conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty speedily in the wrong shop
during the past four minutes or thereabouts he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one bass bottled by messrs bass and co at burtonontrent which happened to be situated amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was certainly calculated to attract anyones remark on account of its scarlet appearance
he was simply and solely as it subsequently transpired for reasons best known to himself which put quite an altogether different complexion on the proceedings after the moment befores observations about boyhood days and the turf recollecting two or three private transactions of his own which the other two were as mutually innocent of as the babe unborn
eventually however both their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other was endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid sought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out with also at the same time however a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it about the place
the debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the course of life
neither place nor council was lacking in dignity
the debaters were the keenest in the land the theme they were engaged on the loftiest and most vital
the high hall of hornes house had never beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so encyclopaedic
a gallant scene in truth it made
crotthers was there at the foot of the table in his striking highland garb his face glowing from the briny airs of the mull of galloway
there too opposite to him was lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early depravity and premature wisdom
next the scotchman was the place assigned to costello the eccentric while at his side was seated in stolid repose the squat form of madden
the chair of the resident indeed stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank of it the figure of bannon in explorers kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide brogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred manners of malachi roland st john mulligan
lastly at the head of the board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of socratic discussion while to right and left of him were accommodated the flippant prognosticator fresh from the hippodrome and that vigilant wanderer soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelible dishonour but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired pencil of lafayette has limned for ages yet to come
it had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted transcendentalism to which mr s dedalus div
scep
contentions would appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to accepted scientific methods
science it cannot be too often repeated deals with tangible phenomena
the man of science like the man in the street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain them as best he can

must we accept the view of empedocles of trinacria that the right ovary the postmenstrual period assert others is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is it as most embryologists incline to opine such as culpepper spallanzani blumenbach lusk hertwig leopold and valenti a mixture of both
this would be tantamount to a cooperation one of natures favourite devices between the nisus formativus of the nemasperm on the one hand and on the other a happily chosen position succubitus felix of the passive element
the other problem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely less vital infant mortality

attributes some of these demises to abdominal trauma in the case of women workers subjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in the home but by far the vast majority to neglect private or official culminating in the exposure of newborn infants the practice of criminal abortion or in the atrocious crime of infanticide
although the former we are thinking of neglect is undoubtedly only too true the case he cites of nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too rare to be normative
in fact when one comes to look into it the wonder is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which often baulk nature in her intentions
an ingenious suggestion is that thrown out by mr v lynch bacc

still the plain straightforward question why a child of normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood though other children of the same marriage do not must certainly in the poets words give us pause
nature we may rest assured has her own good and cogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous germs have taken up their residence modern science has conclusively shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal tend to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development an arrangement which though productive of pain to some of our feelings notably the maternal is nevertheless some of us think in the long run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest

yet a chance word will call them forth suddenly and they will rise up to confront him in the most various circumstances a vision or a dream or while timbrel and harp soothe his senses or amid the cool silver tranquility of the evening or at the feast at midnight when he is now filled with wine
not to insult over him will the vision come as over one that lies under her wrath not for vengeance to cut him off from the living but shrouded in the piteous vesture of the past silent remote reproachful
the stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow recession of that false calm there imposed as it seemed by habit or some studied trick upon words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an unhealthiness a flair for the cruder things of life
a scene disengages itself in the observers memory evoked it would seem by a word of so natural a homeliness as if those days were really present there as some thought with their immediate pleasures
a shaven space of lawn one soft may evening the wellremembered grove of lilacs at roundtown purple and white fragrant slender spectators of the game but with much real interest in the pellets as they run slowly forward over the sward or collide and stop one by its fellow with a brief alert shock
and yonder about that grey urn where the water moves at times in thoughtful irrigation you saw another as fragrant sisterhood floey atty tiny and their darker friend with i know not what of arresting in her pose then our lady of the cherries a comely brace of them pendent from an ear bringing out the foreign warmth of the skin so daintily against the cool ardent fruit
a lad of four or five in linseywoolsey blossomtime but there will be cheer in the kindly hearth when ere long the bowls are gathered and hutched is standing on the urn secured by that circle of girlish fond hands
he frowns a little just as this young man does now with a perhaps too conscious enjoyment of the danger but must needs glance at whiles towards where his mother watches from the piazzetta giving upon the flowerclose with a faint shadow of remoteness or of reproach alles vergngliche in her glad look
mark this farther and remember
the end comes suddenly
enter that antechamber of birth where the studious are assembled and note their faces
nothing as it seems there of rash or violent
quietude of custody rather befitting their station in that house the vigilant watch of shepherds and of angels about a crib in bethlehem of juda long ago
but as before the lightning the serried stormclouds heavy with preponderant excess of moisture in swollen masses turgidly distended compass earth and sky in one vast slumber impending above parched field and drowsy oxen and blighted growth of shrub and verdure till in an instant a flash rives their centres and with the reverberation of the thunder the cloudburst pours its torrent so and not otherwise was the transformation violent and instantaneous upon the utterance of the word

a coin gleams on her forehead

her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain
beside her a camel hooded with a turreting turban waits

i had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm

mrs bellingham he addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome compliments as a venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my frostbound coachman palmer while in the same breath he expressed himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate proximity to my person when standing behind my chair wearing my livery and the armorial bearings of the bellingham escutcheon garnished sable a bucks head couped or
he lauded almost extravagantly my nether extremities my swelling calves in silk hose drawn up to the limit and eulogised glowingly my other hidden treasures in priceless lace which he said he could conjure up
he urged me stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me
to defile the marriage bed to commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity
the honourable mrs mervyn talboys in amazon costume hard hat jackboots cockspurred vermilion waistcoat fawn musketeer gauntlets with braided drums long train held up and hunting crop with which she strikes her welt constantly

i have it still
it represents a partially nude seorita frail and lovely his wife as he solemnly assured me taken by him from nature practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero evidently a blackguard
he urged me to do likewise to misbehave to sin with officers of the garrison
he implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner to chastise him as he richly deserves to bestride and ride him to give him a most vicious horsewhipping

by word and deed he frankly encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises
in five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males
and by the offensively smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and what and how much he could see

 those that hides knows where to find
bella frowns

this isnt a musical peepshow
and dont you smash that piano

stephen fumbles in his pocket and taking out a banknote by its corner hands it to her
  stephen with exaggerated politeness
 this silken purse i made out of the sows ear of the public

he fumbles again and takes out and hands her two crowns
 permit brevi manu my sight is somewhat troubled
bella goes to the table to count the money while stephen talks to himself in monosyllables
zoe bends over the table
kitty leans over zoes neck
lynch gets up rights his cap and clasping kittys waist adds his head to the group
  florry strives heavily to rise

bloom quietly lays a half sovereign on the table between bella and florry

lynch bends kitty back over the sofa and kisses her
bloom goes with the poundnote to stephen

bloom quietly

 and so georgina johnson is dead and married
a cigarette appears on the table
stephen looks at it
 wonder
parlour magic

he strikes a match and proceeds to light the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy
  lynch watching him
 you would have a better chance of lighting it if you held the match nearer
stephen brings the match near his eye
 lynx eye

sixteen years ago

the eye sees all flat
he draws the match away

ineluctable modality of the visible
he frowns mysteriously

zoe it was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with him
florry nods
 mr lambe from london
stephen lamb of london who takest away the sins of our world
lynch embracing kitty on the sofa chants deeply
dona nobis pacem  the cigarette slips from stephens fingers
bloom picks it up and throws it in the grate
  bloom dont smoke
you ought to eat
cursed dog i met
to zoe

zoe is he hungry
stephen extends his hand to her smiling and chants to the air of the bloodoath in the dusk of the gods
hangende hunger      fragende frau      macht uns alle kaputt
zoe tragically

she takes his hand

florry follows spilling water from her tilted tumbler
on the doorstep all the whores clustered talk volubly pointing to the right where the fog has cleared off
from the left arrives a jingling hackney car
it slows to in front of the house
bloom at the halldoor perceives corny kelleher who is about to dismount from the car with two silent lechers
he averts his face
bella from within the hall urges on her whores
they blow ickylickysticky yumyum kisses
corny kelleher replies with a ghastly lewd smile
the silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey
zoe and kitty still point right

retaining the perpendicular
he staggers a pace back
  bloom propping him

stephen laughs emptily
 my centre of gravity is displaced
i have forgotten the trick

corny kelleher laughs pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to the car brought up against the scaffolding
 two commercials that were standing fizz in jammets
like princes faith
one of them lost two quid on the race
drowning his grief
and were on for a go with the jolly girls
so i landed them up on behans car and down to nighttown
bloom i was just going home by gardiner street when i happened to  corny kelleher laughs

the horse harness jingles
  corny kelleher from the car standing
 night
bloom night
the jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly
the car and horse back slowly awkwardly and turn
corny kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at blooms plight
the jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat
bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply
with thumb and palm corny kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done
with a slow nod bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what stephen needs
the car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane
corny kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand
bloom with his hand assuralooms corny kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay
the tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloo looloo lay
bloom holding in his hand stephens hat festooned with shavings and ashplant stands irresolute
then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder
  bloom eh
ho
there is no answer he bends again
 mr dedalus
there is no answer
 the name if you call
somnambulist
he bends again and hesitating brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form
 stephen
there is no answer
he calls again
 stephen
stephen groans
 who
black panther
vampire
he sighs and stretches himself then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels
       who drive fergus now      and pierce woods woven shade
he turns on his left side sighing doubling himself together
  bloom poetry
well educated
pity
he bends again and undoes the buttons of stephens waistcoat
 to breathe
he brushes the woodshavings from stephens clothes with light hand and fingers
 one pound seven
not hurt anyhow
he listens
 what
stephen murmurs
        shadows the woods       white breast dim sea
he stretches out his arms sighs again and curls his body
bloom holding the hat and ashplant stands erect
a dog barks in the distance
bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant
he looks down on stephens face and form
  bloom communes with the night
 face reminds me of his poor mother
in the shady wood
the deep white breast
ferguson i think i caught
a girl
some girl
best thing could happen him
he murmurs
swear that i will always hail ever conceal never reveal any part or parts art or arts he murmurs
in the rough sands of the sea a cabletows length from the shore where the tide ebbs and flows   silent thoughtful alert he stands on guard his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master
against the dark wall a figure appears slowly a fairy boy of eleven a changeling kidnapped dressed in an eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet holding a book in his hand
he reads from right to left inaudibly smiling kissing the page
  bloom wonderstruck calls inaudibly
 rudy
rudy gazes unseeing into blooms eyes and goes on reading kissing smiling
he has a delicate mauve face
on his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons
in his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet bowknot
a white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket
      iii        preparatory to anything else mr bloom brushed off the greater bulk of the shavings and handed stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up generally in orthodox samaritan fashion which he very badly needed
his stephens mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink mr bloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of vartry water available for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit upon an expedient by suggesting off the reel the propriety of the cabmans shelter as it was called hardly a stonesthrow away near butt bridge where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and soda or a mineral
but how to get there was the rub
for the nonce he was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means during which stephen repeatedly yawned
so far as he could see he was rather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly advisable to get a conveyance of some description which would answer in their then condition both of them being eded particularly stephen always assuming that there was such a thing to be found
accordingly after a few such preliminaries as brushing in spite of his having forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman service in the shaving line they both walked together along beaver street or more properly lane as far as the farriers and the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence debouching into amiens street round by the corner of dan bergins
but as he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a jehu plying for hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler probably engaged by some fellows inside on the spree outside the north star hotel and there was no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when mr bloom who was anything but a professional whistler endeavoured to hail it by emitting a kind of a whistle holding his arms arched over his head twice
this was a quandary but bringing common sense to bear on it evidently there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it which they accordingly did
so bevelling around by mulletts and the signal house which they shortly reached they proceeded perforce in the direction of amiens street railway terminus mr bloom being handicapped by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had to vary the timehonoured adage gone the way of all buttons though entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing he heroically made light of the mischance
so as neither of them were particularly pressed for time as it happened and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the recent visitation of jupiter pluvius they dandered along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey
as it so happened a dublin united tramways companys sandstrewer happened to be returning and the elder man recounted to his companion  propos of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little while back
they passed the main entrance of the great northern railway station the starting point for belfast where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour and passing the backdoor of the morgue a not very enticing locality not to say gruesome to a degree more especially at night ultimately gained the dock tavern and in due course turned into store street famous for its c division police station
between this point and the high at present unlit warehouses of beresford place stephen thought to think of ibsen associated with bairds the stonecutters in his mind somehow in talbot place first turning on the right while the other who was acting as his fidus achates inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of james rourkes city bakery situated quite close to where they were the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread of all commodities of the public the primary and most indispensable
bread the staff of life earn your bread o tell me where is fancy bread at rourkes the bakers it is said
en route to his taciturn and not to put too fine a point on it not yet perfectly sober companion mr bloom who at all events was in complete possession of his faculties never more so in fact disgustingly sober spoke a word of caution re the dangers of nighttown women of ill fame and swell mobsmen which barely permissible once in a while though not as a habitual practice was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu for every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick if you didnt look out
highly providential was the appearance on the scene of corny kelleher when stephen was blissfully unconscious but for that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour the finis might have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward or failing that the bridewell and an appearance in the court next day before mr tobias or he being the solicitor rather old wall he meant to say or mahony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about
the reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen whom he cordially disliked were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the crown and as mr bloom put it recalling a case or two in the a division in clanbrassil street prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot
never on the spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the city pembroke road for example the guardians of the law were well in evidence the obvious reason being they were paid to protect the upper classes
another thing he commented on was equipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description liable to go off at any time which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians should by any chance they fall out over anything
you frittered away your time he very sensibly maintained and health and also character besides which the squandermania of the thing fast women of the demimonde ran away with a lot of 
s d into the bargain and the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though touching the much vexed question of stimulants he relished a glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing aperient virtues notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch believer in still never beyond a certain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of others practically
most of all he commented adversely on the desertion of stephen by all his pubhunting confrres but one a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his brother medicos under all the circs
and that one was judas stephen said who up to then had said nothing whatsoever of any kind
discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back of the customhouse and passed under the loop line bridge where a brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one attracted their rather lagging footsteps
stephen of his own accord stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox
he began to remember that this had happened or had been mentioned as having happened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a quondam friend of his fathers gumley
to avoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge
someone saluted you mr bloom said
a figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches saluted again calling  night
stephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the compliment
mr bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch as he always believed in minding his own business moved off but nevertheless remained on the qui vive with just a shade of anxiety though not funkyish in the least
though unusual in the dublin area he knew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next to nothing to live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some secluded spot outside the city proper famished loiterers of the thames embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply marauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell swoop at a moments notice your money or your life leaving you there to point a moral gagged and garrotted
stephen that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters though he was not in an over sober state himself recognised corleys breath redolent of rotten cornjuice
lord john corley some called him and his genealogy came about in this wise
he was the eldest son of inspector corley of the g division lately deceased who had married a certain katherine brophy the daughter of a louth farmer
his grandfather patrick michael corley of new ross had married the widow of a publican there whose maiden name had been katherine also talbot
rumour had it though not proved that she descended from the house of the lords talbot de malahide in whose mansion really an unquestionably fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing her mother or aunt or some relative a woman as the tale went of extreme beauty had enjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen
this therefore was the reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute man who now addressed stephen was spoken of by some with facetious proclivities as lord john corley
taking stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell
not as much as a farthing to purchase a nights lodgings
his friends had all deserted him
furthermore he had a row with lenehan and called him to stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of other uncalledfor expressions
he was out of a job and implored of stephen to tell him where on gods earth he could get something anything at all to do
no it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected through the mother in some way both occurrences happening at the same time if the whole thing wasnt a complete fabrication from start to finish
anyhow he was all in
i wouldnt ask you only pursued he on my solemn oath and god knows im on the rocks
therell be a job tomorrow or next day stephen told him in a boys school at dalkey for a gentleman usher
mr garrett deasy
try it
you may mention my name
ah god corley replied sure i couldnt teach in a school man
i was never one of your bright ones he added with a half laugh
i got stuck twice in the junior at the christian brothers
i have no place to sleep myself stephen informed him
corley at the first gooff was inclined to suspect it was something to do with stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart off the street
there was a dosshouse in marlborough street mrs maloneys but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but mconachie told him you got a decent enough do in the brazen head over in winetavern street which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed of friar bacon for a bob
he was starving too though he hadnt said a word about it
though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it still stephens feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew that corleys brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was hardly deserving of much credence
however haud ignarus malorum miseris succurrere disco etcetera as the latin poet remarks especially as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished
but the cream of the joke was nothing would get it out of corleys head that he was living in affluence and hadnt a thing to do but hand out the needful
whereas
he put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with the idea of finding any food there but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat but the result was in the negative for to his chagrin he found his cash missing
a few broken biscuits were all the result of his investigation
he tried his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he had lost as well he might have or left because in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout very much the reverse in fact
he was altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough search though he tried to recollect
about biscuits he dimly remembered
who now exactly gave them he wondered or where was or did he buy
however in another pocket he came across what he surmised in the dark were pennies erroneously however as it turned out
those are halfcrowns man corley corrected him
and so in point of fact they turned out to be
stephen anyhow lent him one of them
thanks corley answered youre a gentleman
ill pay you back one time
whos that with you
i saw him a few times in the bleeding horse in camden street with boylan the billsticker
you might put in a good word for us to get me taken on there
id carry a sandwichboard only the girl in the office told me theyre full up for the next three weeks man
god youve to book ahead man youd think it was for the carl rosa
i dont give a shite anyway so long as i get a job even as a crossing sweeper
subsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two and six he got he informed stephen about a fellow by the name of bags comisky that he said stephen knew well out of fullams the shipchandlers bookkeeper there that used to be often round in nagles back with omara and a little chap with a stutter the name of tighe
anyhow he was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and refusing to go with the constable
mr bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation watchmans sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work it struck him was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own private account while dublin slept
he threw an odd eye at the same time now and then at stephens anything but immaculately attired interlocutor as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when
being a levelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in point of shrewd observation he also remarked on his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally testifying to a chronic impecuniosity
palpably he was one of his hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one preying on his nextdoor neighbour all round in every deep so to put it a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude with or without the option of a fine would be a very rara avis altogether
in any case he had a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning
pretty thick that was certainly
the pair parted company and stephen rejoined mr bloom who with his practised eye was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the blandiloquence of the other parasite
alluding to the encounter he said laughingly stephen that is  he is down on his luck
he asked me to ask you to ask somebody named boylan a billsticker to give him a job as a sandwichman
at this intelligence in which he seemingly evinced little interest mr bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the direction of a bucketdredger rejoicing in the farfamed name of eblana moored alongside customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair whereupon he observed evasively  everybody gets their own ration of luck they say
now you mention it his face was familiar to me
but leaving that for the moment how much did you part with he queried if i am not too inquisitive
half a crown stephen responded
i daresay he needs it to sleep somewhere
needs
mr bloom ejaculated professing not the least surprise at the intelligence i can quite credit the assertion and i guarantee he invariably does
everyone according to his needs or everyone according to his deeds
but talking about things in general where added he with a smile will you sleep yourself
walking to sandycove is out of the question
and even supposing you did you wont get in after what occurred at westland row station
simply fag out there for nothing
i dont mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why did you leave your fathers house
to seek misfortune was stephens answer
i met your respected father on a recent occasion mr bloom diplomatically returned today in fact or to be strictly accurate on yesterday
where does he live at present
i gathered in the course of conversation that he had moved
i believe he is in dublin somewhere stephen answered unconcernedly
why
a gifted man mr bloom said of mr dedalus senior in more respects than one and a born raconteur if ever there was one
he takes great pride quite legitimate out of you
you could go back perhaps he hasarded still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at westland row terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two mulligan that is and that english tourist friend of his who eventually euchred their third companion were patently trying as if the whole bally station belonged to them to give stephen the slip in the confusion which they did
there was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however such as it was stephens minds eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his family hearth the last time he saw it with his sister dilly sitting by the ingle her hair hanging down waiting for some weak trinidad shell cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the friday herrings they had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for maggy boody and katey the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper in accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on the days commanded it being quarter tense or if not ember days or something like that
no mr bloom repeated again i wouldnt personally repose much trust in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element dr mulligan as a guide philosopher and friend if i were in your shoes
he knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals
of course you didnt notice as much as i did
but it wouldnt occasion me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in your drink for some ulterior object
he understood however from all he heard that dr mulligan was a versatile allround man by no means confined to medicine only who was rapidly coming to the fore in his line and if the report was verified bade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid at skerries or malahide was it was he was bound to admit an exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise so that frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or jealousy pure and simple
except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking your brains he ventured to throw out
the guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by friendliness which he gave at stephens at present morose expression of features did not throw a flood of light none at all in fact on the problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge by two or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about saw through the affair and for some reason or other best known to himself allowed matters to more or less
grinding poverty did have that effect and he more than conjectured that high educational abilities though he possessed he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet
adjacent to the mens public urinal they perceived an icecream car round which a group of presumably italians in heated altercation were getting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly animated way there being some little differences between the parties
puttana madonna che ci dia i quattrini
ho ragione
culo rotto  intendiamoci
mezzo sovrano pi  dice lui per  mezzo  farabutto
mortacci sui  ma ascolta
cinque la testa pi  mr bloom and stephen entered the cabmans shelter an unpretentious wooden structure where prior to then he had rarely if ever been before the former having previously whispered to the latter a few hints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous skinthegoat fitzharris the invincible though he could not vouch for the actual facts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in
a few moments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the genus homo already there engaged in eating and drinking diversified by conversation for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity
now touching a cup of coffee mr bloom ventured to plausibly suggest to break the ice it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the shape of solid food say a roll of some description
accordingly his first act was with characteristic sangfroid to order these commodities quietly
the hoi polloi of jarvies or stevedores or whatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyes apparently dissatisfied away though one redbearded bibulous individual portion of whose hair was greyish a sailor probably still stared for some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention to the floor
mr bloom availing himself of the right of free speech he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute though to be sure rather in a quandary over voglio remarked to his protg in an audible tone of voice  propos of the battle royal in the street which was still raging fast and furious  a beautiful language
i mean for singing purposes
why do you not write your poetry in that language
bella poetria
it is so melodious and full
belladonna
voglio  stephen who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could suffering from lassitude generally replied  to fill the ear of a cow elephant
they were haggling over money
is that so
mr bloom asked
of course he subjoined pensively at the inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were absolutely necessary it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds it
the keeper of the shelter in the middle of this ttette put a boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun or so it seemed
after which he beat a retreat to his counter mr bloom determining to have a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to
for which reason he encouraged stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was temporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him
sounds are impostures stephen said after a pause of some little time like names
cicero podmore napoleon mr goodbody
jesus mr doyle
shakespeares were as common as murphies
whats in a name
yes to be sure mr bloom unaffectedly concurred
of course
our name was changed too he added pushing the socalled roll across
the redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded stephen whom he had singled out for attention in particular squarely by asking  and what might your name be
just in the nick of time mr bloom touched his companions boot but stephen apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected quarter answered  dedalus
the sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes rather bunged up from excessive use of boose preferably good old hollands and water
you know simon dedalus
he asked at length
ive heard of him stephen said
mr bloom was all at sea for a moment seeing the others evidently eavesdropping too
hes irish the seaman bold affirmed staring still in much the same way and nodding
all irish
all too irish stephen rejoined
as for mr bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the shelter with the remark  i seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his shoulder
the lefthand dead shot
though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his gestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain
bottles out there say
fifty yards measured
eggs on the bottles
cocks his gun over his shoulder
aims
he turned his body half round shut up his right eye completely
then he screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the night with an unprepossessing cast of countenance
pom
he then shouted once
the entire audience waited anticipating an additional detonation there being still a further egg
pom
he shouted twice
egg two evidently demolished he nodded and winked adding bloodthirstily  buffalo bill shoots to kill  never missed nor he never will  a silence ensued till mr bloom for agreeableness sake just felt like asking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the bisley
beg pardon the sailor said
long ago
mr bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth
why the sailor replied relaxing to a certain extent under the magic influence of diamond cut diamond it might be a matter of ten years
he toured the wide world with henglers royal circus
i seen him do that in stockholm
curious coincidence mr bloom confided to stephen unobtrusively
murphys my name the sailor continued
d b murphy of carrigaloe
know where that is
queenstown harbour stephen replied
thats right the sailor said
fort camden and fort carlisle
thats where i hails from
i belongs there
thats where i hails from
my little womans down there
shes waiting for me i know
for england home and beauty
shes my own true wife i havent seen for seven years now sailing about
mr bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene the homecoming to the mariners roadside shieling after having diddled davy jones a rainy night with a blind moon
across the world for a wife
quite a number of stories there were on that particular alice ben bolt topic enoch arden and rip van winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember caoc oleary a favourite and most trying declamation piece by the way of poor john casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way
never about the runaway wife coming back however much devoted to the absentee
the face at the window
judge of his astonishment when he finally did breast the tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent his better half wrecked in his affections
you little expected me but ive come to stay and make a fresh start
there she sits a grasswidow at the selfsame fireside
believes me dead rocked in the cradle of the deep
and there sits uncle chubb or tomkin as the case might be the publican of the crown and anchor in shirtsleeves eating rumpsteak and onions
no chair for father
broo
the wind
her brandnew arrival is on her knee post mortem child
with a high ro
and a randy ro
and my galloping tearing tandy o
bow to the inevitable
grin and bear it
i remain with much love your brokenhearted husband w b murphy
the sailor who scarcely seemed to be a dublin resident turned to one of the jarvies with the request  you dont happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you
the jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die of plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was passed from hand to hand
thank you the sailor said
he deposited the quid in his gob and chewing and with some slow stammers proceeded  we come up this morning eleven oclock
the threemaster rosevean from bridgwater with bricks
i shipped to get over
paid off this afternoon
theres my discharge
see
d b murphy
a
b s  in confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket and handed to his neighbour a not very cleanlooking folded document
you must have seen a fair share of the world the keeper remarked leaning on the counter
why the sailor answered upon reflection upon it ive circumnavigated a bit since i first joined on
i was in the red sea
i was in china and north america and south america
we was chased by pirates one voyage
i seen icebergs plenty growlers
i was in stockholm and the black sea the dardanelles under captain dalton the best bloody man that ever scuttled a ship
i seen russia
gospodi pomilyou
thats how the russians prays
you seen queer sights dont be talking put in a jarvey
why the sailor said shifting his partially chewed plug
i seen queer things too ups and downs
i seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchor same as i chew that quid
he took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and lodging it between his teeth bit ferociously  khaan
like that
and i seen maneaters in peru that eats corpses and the livers of horses
look here
here they are
a friend of mine sent me
he fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed to be in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table
the printed matter on it stated choza de indios
beni bolivia  all focussed their attention at the scene exhibited a group of savage women in striped loincloths squatted blinking suckling frowning sleeping amid a swarm of infants there must have been quite a score of them outside some primitive shanties of osier
chews coca all day the communicative tarpaulin added
stomachs like breadgraters
cuts off their diddies when they cant bear no more children
see them sitting there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horses liver raw
his postcard proved a centre of attraction for messrs the greenhorns for several minutes if not more
know how to keep them off
he inquired generally
nobody volunteering a statement he winked saying  glass
that boggles em
glass
mr bloom without evincing surprise unostentatiously turned over the card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark
it ran as follows tarjeta postal seor a boudin galeria becche santiago chile there was no message evidently as he took particular notice
though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated or the eggsniping transaction for that matter despite william tell and the lazarillodon cesar de bazan incident depicted in maritana on which occasion the formers ball passed through the latters hat having detected a discrepancy between his name assuming he was the person he represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after having boxed the compass on the strict qt
somewhere and the fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some suspicions of our friends bona fides nevertheless it reminded him in a way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some wednesday or saturday of travelling to london via long sea not to say that he had ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to holyhead which was his longest
martin cunningham frequently said he would work a pass through egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up with the net result that the scheme fell through
but even suppose it did come to planking down the needful and breaking boyds heart it was not so dear purse permitting a few guineas at the outside considering the fare to mullingar where he figured on going was five and six there and back
the trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone and be in every way thoroughly pleasurable especially for a chap whose liver was out of order seeing the different places along the route plymouth falmouth southampton and so on culminating in an instructive tour of the sights of the great metropolis the spectacle of our modern babylon where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement tower abbey wealth of park lane to renew acquaintance with
another thing just struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze around on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a concert tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure resorts margate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas eastbourne scarborough margate and so on beautiful bournemouth the channel islands and similar bijou spots which might prove highly remunerative
not of course with a hole and corner scratch company or local ladies on the job witness mrs c p mcoy type lend me your valise and ill post you the ticket
no something top notch an all star irish caste the tweedyflower grand opera company with his own legal consort as leading lady as a sort of counterblast to the elster grimes and moodymanners perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of success providing puffs in the local papers could be managed by some fellow with a bit of bounce who could pull the indispensable wires and thus combine business with pleasure
but who
that was the rub
also without being actually positive it struck him a great field was to be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with the times apropos of the fishguardrosslare route which it was mooted was once more on the tapis in the circumlocution departments with the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete fogeydom and dunderheads generally
a great opportunity there certainly was for push and enterprise to meet the travelling needs of the public at large the average man ie
brown robinson and co
it was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no small blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street when the system really needed toning up for the matter of a couple of paltry pounds was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead of being always and ever cooped up since my old stickinthemud took me for a wife
after all hang it they had their eleven and more humdrum months of it and merited a radical change of venue after the grind of city life in the summertime for choice when dame nature is at her spectacular best constituting nothing short of a new lease of life
there were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home island delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation offering a plethora of attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around dublin and its picturesque environs even poulaphouca to which there was a steamtram but also farther away from the madding crowd in wicklow rightly termed the garden of ireland an ideal neighbourhood for elderly wheelmen so long as it didnt come down and in the wilds of donegal where if report spoke true the coup dil was exceedingly grand though the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that the influx of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering the signal benefits to be derived from it while howth with its historic associations and otherwise silken thomas grace omalley george iv rhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt with all sorts and conditions of men especially in the spring when young mens fancy though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off the cliffs by design or accidentally usually by the way on their left leg it being only about three quarters of an hours run from the pillar
because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely in its infancy so to speak and the accommodation left much to be desired
interesting to fathom it seemed to him from a motive of curiosity pure and simple was whether it was the traffic that created the route or viceversa or the two sides in fact
he turned back the other side of the card picture and passed it along to stephen
i seen a chinese one time related the doughty narrator that had little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened and every pill was something different
one was a ship another was a house another was a flower
cooks rats in your soup he appetisingly added the chinks does
possibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces the globetrotter went on adhering to his adventures
and i seen a man killed in trieste by an italian chap
knife in his back
knife like that
whilst speaking he produced a dangerouslooking claspknife quite in keeping with his character and held it in the striking position
in a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers
fellow hid behind a door come up behind him
like that
prepare to meet your god says he
chuk
it went into his back up to the butt
his heavy glance drowsily roaming about kind of defied their further questions even should they by any chance want to
thats a good bit of steel repeated he examining his formidable stiletto
after which harrowing dnouement sufficient to appal the stoutest he snapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before in his chamber of horrors otherwise pocket
theyre great for the cold steel somebody who was evidently quite in the dark said for the benefit of them all
that was why they thought the park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of them using knives
at this remark passed obviously in the spirit of where ignorance is bliss mr b and stephen each in his own particular way both instinctively exchanged meaning glances in a religious silence of the strictly entre nous variety however towards where skinthegoat alias the keeper not turning a hair was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair
his inscrutable face which was really a work of art a perfect study in itself beggaring description conveyed the impression that he didnt understand one jot of what was going on
funny very
there ensued a somewhat lengthy pause
one man was reading in fits and starts a stained by coffee evening journal another the card with the natives choza de another the seamans discharge
mr bloom so far as he was personally concerned was just pondering in pensive mood
he vividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as yesterday roughly some score of years previously in the days of the land troubles when it took the civilised world by storm figuratively speaking early in the eighties eightyone to be correct when he was just turned fifteen
ay boss the sailor broke in
give us back them papers
the request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape
have you seen the rock of gibraltar
mr bloom inquired
the sailor grimaced chewing in a way that might be read as yes ay or no
ah youve touched there too mr bloom said europa point thinking he had in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but he failed to do so simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the sawdust and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn
what year would that be about
mr b interrogated
can you recall the boats
our soidisant sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before answering  im tired of all them rocks in the sea he said and boats and ships
salt junk all the time
tired seemingly he ceased
his questioner perceiving that he was not likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer fell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globe suffice it to say that as a casual glance at the map revealed it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly what it meant to rule the waves
on more than one occasion a dozen at the lowest near the north bull at dollymount he had remarked a superannuated old salt evidently derelict seated habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on the wall staring quite obliviously at it and it at him dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone somewhere sings
and it left him wondering why
possibly he had tried to find out the secret for himself floundering up and down the antipodes and all that sort of thing and over and under well not exactly under tempting the fates
and the odds were twenty to nil there was really no secret about it at all
nevertheless without going into the minutiae of the business the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of things somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that sort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery and insurance which were run on identically the same lines so that for that very reason if no other lifeboat sunday was a highly laudable institution to which the public at large no matter where living inland or seaside as the case might be having it brought home to them like that should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and coastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid the elements whatever the season when duty called ireland expects that every man and so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the wintertime not forgetting the irish lights kish and others liable to capsize at any moment rounding which he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkably choppy not to say stormy weather
there was a fellow sailed with me in the rover the old seadog himself a rover proceeded went ashore and took up a soft job as gentlemans valet at six quid a month
them are his trousers ive on me and he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife
im game for that job shaving and brushup
i hate roaming about
theres my son now danny run off to sea and his mother got him took in a drapers in cork where he could be drawing easy money
what age is he
queried one hearer who by the way seen from the side bore a distant resemblance to henry campbell the townclerk away from the carking cares of office unwashed of course and in a seedy getup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage
why the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance my son danny
hed be about eighteen now way i figure it
the skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to be seen an image tattooed in blue chinese ink intended to represent an anchor
there was lice in that bunk in bridgwater he remarked sure as nuts
i must get a wash tomorrow or next day
its them black lads i objects to
i hate those buggers
suck your blood dry they does
seeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged his shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the mariners hope and rest they had a full view of the figure  and a young mans sideface looking frowningly rather
tattoo the exhibitor explained
that was done when we were lying becalmed off odessa in the black sea under captain dalton
fellow the name of antonio done that
there he is himself a greek
did it hurt much doing it
one asked the sailor
that worthy however was busily engaged in collecting round the
someway in his
squeezing or
see here he said showing antonio
there he is cursing the mate
and there he is now he added the same fellow pulling the skin with his fingers some special knack evidently and he laughing at a yarn
and in point of fact the young man named antonios livid face did actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the unreserved admiration of everybody including skinthegoat who this time stretched over
ay ay sighed the sailor looking down on his manly chest
hes gone too
ate by sharks after
ay ay
he let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression of before
neat bit of work one longshoreman said
and whats the number for
loafer number two queried
eaten alive
a third asked the sailor
ay ay sighed again the latter personage more cheerily this time with some sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the direction of the questioner about the number
ate
a greek he was
and then he added with rather gallowsbird humour considering his alleged end       as bad as old antonio      for he left me on my ownio
the face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat peered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on her own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill
mr bloom scarcely knowing which way to look turned away on the moment flusterfied but outwardly calm and picking up from the table the pink sheet of the abbey street organ which the jarvey if such he was had laid aside he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink
his reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on ormond quay the partially idiotic female namely of the lane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you mrs b
and begged the chance of his washing
also why washing which seemed rather vague than not your washing
still candour compelled him to admit he had washed his wifes undergarments when soiled in holles street and women would and did too a mans similar garments initialled with bewley and drapers marking ink hers were that is if they really loved him that is to say love me love my dirty shirt
still just then being on tenterhooks he desired the females room more than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself off
round the side of the evening telegraph he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactly all there viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers round skipper murphys nautical chest and then there was no more of her
the gunboat the keeper said
it beats me mr bloom confided to stephen medically i am speaking how a wretched creature like that from the lock hospital reeking with disease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses if he values his health in the least
unfortunate creature
of course i suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition
still no matter what the cause is from  stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders merely remarking  in this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a roaring trade
fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy the soul
she is a bad merchant
she buys dear and sells cheap
the elder man though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a stop to instanter to say that women of that stamp quite apart from any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject a necessary evil were not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities a thing he could truthfully state he as a paterfamilias was a stalwart advocate of from the very first start
whoever embarked on a policy of the sort he said and ventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a lasting boon on everybody concerned
you as a good catholic he observed talking of body and soul believe in the soul
or do you mean the intelligence the brainpower as such as distinct from any outside object the table let us say that cup
i believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as the convolutions of the grey matter
otherwise we would never have such inventions as x rays for instance
do you
thus cornered stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try and concentrate and remember before he could say  they tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and therefore incorruptible
it would be immortal i understand but for the possibility of its annihilation by its first cause who from all i can hear is quite capable of adding that to the number of his other practical jokes corruptio per se and corruptio per accidens both being excluded by court etiquette
mr bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple promptly rejoining  simple
i shouldnt think that is the proper word
of course i grant you to concede a point you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue moon
but what i am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for instance to invent those rays rntgen did or the telescope like edison though i believe it was before his time galileo was the man i mean and the same applies to the laws for example of a farreaching natural phenomenon such as electricity but its a horse of quite another colour to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural god
o that stephen expostulated has been proved conclusively by several of the bestknown passages in holy writ apart from circumstantial evidence
on this knotty point however the views of the pair poles apart as they were both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference in their respective ages clashed
has been
the more experienced of the two objected sticking to his original point with a smile of unbelief
im not so sure about that
thats a matter for everymans opinion and without dragging in the sectarian side of the business i beg to differ with you in toto there
my belief is to tell you the candid truth that those bits were genuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or its the big question of our national poet over again who precisely wrote them like hamlet and bacon as you who know your shakespeare infinitely better than i of course i neednt tell you
cant you drink that coffee by the way
let me stir it
and take a piece of that bun
its like one of our skippers bricks disguised
still noone can give what he hasnt got
try a bit
couldnt stephen contrived to get out his mental organs for the moment refusing to dictate further
faultfinding being a proverbially bad hat mr bloom thought well to stir or try to the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with something approaching acrimony on the coffee palace and its temperance and lucrative work
to be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or nay did a world of good shelters such as the present one they were in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night concerts dramatic evenings and useful lectures admittance free by qualified men for the lower orders
on the other hand he had a distinct and painful recollection they paid his wife madam marion tweedy who had been prominently associated with it at one time a very modest remuneration indeed for her pianoplaying
the idea he was strongly inclined to believe was to do good and net a profit there being no competition to speak of
sulphate of copper poison so or something in some dried peas he remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he couldnt remember when it was or where
anyhow inspection medical inspection of all eatables seemed to him more than ever necessary which possibly accounted for the vogue of dr tibbles vicocoa on account of the medical analysis involved
have a shot at it now he ventured to say of the coffee after being stirred
thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it stephen lifted the heavy mug from the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle and took a sip of the offending beverage
still its solid food his good genius urged im a stickler for solid food his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but regular meals as the sine qua non for any kind of proper work mental or manual
you ought to eat more solid food
you would feel a different man
liquids i can eat stephen said
but o oblige me by taking away that knife
i cant look at the point of it
it reminds me of roman history
mr bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly roman or antique about it to the lay eye observing that the point was the least conspicuous point about it
our mutual friends stories are like himself mr bloom apropos of knives remarked to his confidante sotto voce
do you think they are genuine
he could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and lie like old boots
look at him
yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent probability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly accurate gospel
he had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and sherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him
though a wellpreserved man of no little stamina if a trifle prone to baldness there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity
he might even have done for his man supposing it was his own case he told as people often did about others namely that he killed him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say nothing of the antonio personage no relation to the dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen of our national poet who expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above described
on the other hand he might be only bluffing a pardonable weakness because meeting unmistakable mugs dublin residents like those jarvies waiting news from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner hesperus and etcetera
and when all was said and done the lies a fellow told about himself couldnt probably hold a proverbial candle to the wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him
mind you im not saying that its all a pure invention he resumed
analogous scenes are occasionally if not often met with
giants though that is rather a far cry you see once in a way marcella the midget queen
in those waxworks in henry street i myself saw some aztecs as they are called sitting bowlegged they couldnt straighten their legs if you paid them because the muscles here you see he proceeded indicating on his companion the brief outline of the sinews or whatever you like to call them behind the right knee were utterly powerless from sitting that way so long cramped up being adored as gods
theres an example again of simple souls
however reverting to friend sinbad and his horrifying adventures who reminded him a bit of ludwig alias ledwidge when he occupied the boards of the gaiety when michael gunn was identified with the management in the flying dutchman a stupendous success and his host of admirers came in large numbers everyone simply flocking to hear him though ships of any sort phantom or the reverse on the stage usually fell a bit flat as also did trains there was nothing intrinsically incompatible about it he conceded
on the contrary that stab in the back touch was quite in keeping with those italianos though candidly he was none the less free to admit those icecreamers and friers in the fish way not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in little italy there near the coombe were sober thrifty hardworking fellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless necessary animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to have a good old succulent tuckin with garlic de rigueur off him or her next day on the quiet and he added on the cheap
spaniards for instance he continued passionate temperaments like that impetuous as old nick are given to taking the law into their own hands and give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they carry in the abdomen
it comes from the great heat climate generally
my wife is so to speak spanish half that is
point of fact she could actually claim spanish nationality if she wanted having been born in technically spain ie
gibraltar
she has the spanish type
quite dark regular brunette black
i for one certainly believe climate accounts for character
thats why i asked you if you wrote your poetry in italian
the temperaments at the door stephen interposed with were very passionate about ten shillings
roberto ruba roba sua
quite so mr bloom dittoed
then stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown listener somewhere we have the impetuosity of dante and the isosceles triangle miss portinari he fell in love with and leonardo and san tommaso mastino
its in the blood mr bloom acceded at once
all are washed in the blood of the sun
coincidence i just happened to be in the kildare street museum today shortly prior to our meeting if i can so call it and i was just looking at those antique statues there
the splendid proportions of hips bosom
you simply dont knock against those kind of women here
an exception here and there
handsome yes pretty in a way you find but what im talking about is the female form
besides they have so little taste in dress most of them which greatly enhances a womans natural beauty no matter what you say
rumpled stockings it may be possibly is a foible of mine but still its a thing i simply hate to see
interest however was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the others got on to talking about accidents at sea ships lost in a fog collisions with icebergs all that sort of thing
shipahoy of course had his own say to say
he had doubled the cape a few odd times and weathered a monsoon a kind of wind in the china seas and through all those perils of the deep there was one thing he declared stood to him or words to that effect a pious medal he had that saved him
so then after that they drifted on to the wreck off daunts rock wreck of that illfated norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for the moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of henry campbell remembered it palme on booterstown strand
that was the talk of the town that year albert william quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the irish times breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion petrified with horror
then someone said something about the case of the s s lady cairns of swansea run into by the mona which was on an opposite tack in rather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on deck
no aid was given
her master the monas said he was afraid his collision bulkhead would give way
she had no water it appears in her hold
at this stage an incident happened
it having become necessary for him to unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat
let me cross your bows mate he said to his neighbour who was just gently dropping off into a peaceful doze
he made tracks heavily slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore due left
while he was in the act of getting his bearings mr bloom who noticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ships rum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his burning interior saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew and applying its nozzle to his lips take a good old delectable swig out of it with a gurgling noise
the irrepressible bloom who also had a shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manuvre after the counterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared to all intents and purposes could by straining just perceive him when duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit gaping up at the piers and girders of the loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was all radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved
some person or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by the cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a brief space of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor evidently giving it a wide berth eased himself closer at hand the noise of his bilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the ground where it apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank
a hoof scooped anyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingled
slightly disturbed in his sentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of the corporation stones who though now broken down and fast breaking up was none other in stern reality than the gumley aforesaid now practically on the parish rates given the temporary job by pat tobin in all human probability from dictates of humanity knowing him before shifted about and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again in to the arms of morpheus a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its most virulent form on a fellow most respectably connected and familiarised with decent home comforts all his life who came in for a cool   a year at one time which of course the doublebarrelled ass proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of
and there he was at the end of his tether after having often painted the town tolerably pink without a beggarly stiver
he drank needless to be told and it pointed only once more a moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of business ifa big if howeverhe had contrived to cure himself of his particular partiality
all meantime were loudly lamenting the falling off in irish shipping coastwise and foreign as well which was all part and parcel of the same thing
a palgrave murphy boat was put off the ways at alexandra basin the only launch that year
right enough the harbours were there only no ships ever called
there were wrecks and wreckers the keeper said who was evidently au fait
what he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only rock in galway bay when the galway harbour scheme was mooted by a mr worthington or some name like that eh
ask the then captain he advised them how much palmoil the british government gave him for that days work captain john lever of the lever line
am i right skipper
he queried of the sailor now returning after his private potation and the rest of his exertions
that worthy picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words growled in wouldbe music but with great vim some kind of chanty or other in seconds or thirds
mr blooms sharp ears heard him then expectorate the plug probably which it was so that he must have lodged it for the time being in his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in question
anyhow in he rolled after his successful libationcumpotation introducing an atmosphere of drink into the soire boisterously trolling like a veritable son of a seacook       the biscuits was as hard as brass      and the beef as salt as lots wifes arse

after which effusion the redoubtable specimen duly arrived on the scene and regaining his seat he sank rather than sat heavily on the form provided
skinthegoat assuming he was he evidently with an axe to grind was airing his grievances in a forciblefeeble philippic anent the natural resources of ireland or something of that sort which he described in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none on the face of gods earth far and away superior to england with coal in large quantities six million pounds worth of pork exported every year ten millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained out of it by england levying taxes on the poor people that paid through the nose always and gobbling up the best meat in the market and a lot more surplus steam in the same vein
their conversation accordingly became general and all agreed that that was a fact
you could grow any mortal thing in irish soil he stated and there was that colonel everard down there in navan growing tobacco
where would you find anywhere the like of irish bacon
but a day of reckoning he stated crescendo with no uncertain voice thoroughly monopolising all the conversation was in store for mighty england despite her power of pelf on account of her crimes
there would be a fall and the greatest fall in history
the germans and the japs were going to have their little lookin he affirmed
the boers were the beginning of the end
brummagem england was toppling already and her downfall would be ireland her achilles heel which he explained to them about the vulnerable point of achilles the greek hero a point his auditors at once seized as he completely gripped their attention by showing the tendon referred to on his boot
his advice to every irishman was stay in the land of your birth and work for ireland and live for ireland
ireland parnell said could not spare a single one of her sons
silence all round marked the termination of his finale
the impervious navigator heard these lurid tidings undismayed
take a bit of doing boss retaliated that rough diamond palpably a bit peeved in response to the foregoing truism
to which cold douche referring to downfall and so on the keeper concurred but nevertheless held to his main view
whos the best troops in the army
the grizzled old veteran irately interrogated
and the best jumpers and racers
and the best admirals and generals weve got
tell me that
the irish for choice retorted the cabby like campbell facial blemishes apart
thats right the old tarpaulin corroborated
the irish catholic peasant
hes the backbone of our empire
you know jem mullins
while allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added he cared nothing for any empire ours or his and considered no irishman worthy of his salt that served it
then they began to have a few irascible words when it waxed hotter both needless to say appealing to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long as they didnt indulge in recriminations and come to blows
from inside information extending over a series of years mr bloom was rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for he was fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for rather concealed their strength than the opposite
it was quite on a par with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out and if as time went on that turned out to be how the cat jumped all he could personally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies equally relevant to the issue might occur ere then it was highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countries even though poles apart
another little interesting point the amours of whores and chummies to put it in common parlance reminded him irish soldiers had as often fought for england as against her more so in fact
and now why
so the scene between the pair of them the licensee of the place rumoured to be or have been fitzharris the famous invincible and the other obviously bogus reminded him forcibly as being on all fours with the confidence trick supposing that is it was prearranged as the lookeron a student of the human soul if anything the others seeing least of the game
and as for the lessee or keeper who probably wasnt the other person at all he b
couldnt help feeling and most properly it was better to give people like that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and their felonsetting there always being the offchance of a dannyman coming forward and turning queens evidence or kings now like denis or peter carey an idea he utterly repudiated
quite apart from that he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle
yet though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any shape or form he certainly did feel and no denying it while inwardly remaining what he was a certain kind of admiration for a man who had actually brandished a knife cold steel with the courage of his political convictions though personally he would never be a party to any such thing off the same bat as those love vendettas of the south have her or swing for her when the husband frequently after some words passed between the two concerning her relations with the other lucky mortal he having had the pair watched inflicted fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial liaison by plunging his knife into her until it just struck him that fitz nicknamed skinthegoat merely drove the car for the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not if he was reliably informed actually party to the ambush which in point of fact was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on
in any case that was very ancient history by now and as for our friend the pseudo skintheetcetera he had transparently outlived his welcome
he ought to have either died naturally or on the scaffold high
like actresses always farewell positively last performance then come up smiling again
generous to a fault of course temperamental no economising or any idea of the sort always snapping at the bone for the shadow
so similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that mr johnny lever got rid of some 
s d in the course of his perambulations round the docks in the congenial atmosphere of the old ireland tavern come back to erin and so on
then as for the other he had heard not so long before the same identical lingo as he told stephen how he simply but effectually silenced the offender
he took umbrage at something or other that muchinjured but on the whole eventempered person declared i let slip
he called me a jew and in a heated fashion offensively
so i without deviating from plain facts in the least told him his god i mean christ was a jew too and all his family like me though in reality im not
that was one for him
a soft answer turns away wrath
he hadnt a word to say for himself as everyone saw
am i not right
he turned a long you are wrong gaze on stephen of timorous dark pride at the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to glean in a kind of a way that it wasnt all exactly
ex quibus stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent their two or four eyes conversing christus or bloom his name is or after all any other secundum carnem
of course mr b proceeded to stipulate you must look at both sides of the question
it is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is though every country they say our own distressful included has the government it deserves
but with a little goodwill all round
its all very fine to boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual equality
i resent violence and intolerance in any shape or form
it never reaches anything or stops anything
a revolution must come on the due instalments plan
its a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate people because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular in the next house so to speak
memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes war stephen assented between skinners alley and ormond market
yes mr bloom thoroughly agreed entirely endorsing the remark that was overwhelmingly right
and the whole world was full of that sort of thing
you just took the words out of my mouth he said
a hocuspocus of conflicting evidence that candidly you couldnt remotely  all those wretched quarrels in his humble opinion stirring up bad blood from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kind erroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag were very largely a question of the money question which was at the back of everything greed and jealousy people never knowing when to stop
they accuse remarked he audibly
he turned away from the others who probably and spoke nearer to so as the others in case they  jews he softly imparted in an aside in stephens ear are accused of ruining
not a vestige of truth in it i can safely say
history would you be surprised to learn proves up to the hilt spain decayed when the inquisition hounded the jews out and england prospered when cromwell an uncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer for imported them
why
because they are imbued with the proper spirit
they are practical and are proved to be so
i dont want to indulge in any because you know the standard works on the subject and then orthodox as you are
but in the economic not touching religion domain the priest spells poverty
spain again you saw in the war compared with goahead america
turks
its in the dogma
because if they didnt believe theyd go straight to heaven when they die theyd try to live better at least so i think
thats the juggle on which the pps raise the wind on false pretences
im he resumed with dramatic force as good an irishman as that rude person i told you about at the outset and i want to see everyone concluded he all creeds and classes pro rata having a comfortable tidysized income in no niggard fashion either something in the neighbourhood of   per annum
thats the vital issue at stake and its feasible and would be provocative of friendlier intercourse between man and man
at least thats my idea for what its worth
i call that patriotism
ubi patria as we learned a smattering of in our classical days in alma mater vita bene
where you can live well the sense is if you work
over his untastable apology for a cup of coffee listening to this synopsis of things in general stephen stared at nothing in particular
he could hear of course all kinds of words changing colour like those crabs about ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere beneath or seemed to
then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or didnt say the words the voice he heard said if you work
count me out he managed to remark meaning work
the eyes were surprised at this observation because as he the person who owned them pro tem
observed or rather his voice speaking did all must work have to together
i mean of course the other hastened to affirm work in the widest possible sense
also literary labour not merely for the kudos of the thing
writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel nowadays
thats work too
important work
after all from the little i know of you after all the money expended on your education you are entitled to recoup yourself and command your price
you have every bit as much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the peasant has
what
you both belong to ireland the brain and the brawn
each is equally important
you suspect stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh that i may be important because i belong to the faubourg saint patrice called ireland for short
i would go a step farther mr bloom insinuated
but i suspect stephen interrupted that ireland must be important because it belongs to me
what belongs queried mr bloom bending fancying he was perhaps under some misapprehension
excuse me
unfortunately i didnt catch the latter portion
what was it you
stephen patently crosstempered repeated and shoved aside his mug of coffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely adding  we cant change the country
let us change the subject
at this pertinent suggestion mr bloom to change the subject looked down but in a quandary as he couldnt tell exactly what construction to put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry
the rebuke of some kind was clearer than the other part
needless to say the fumes of his recent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way foreign to his sober state
probably the homelife to which mr b attached the utmost importance had not been all that was needful or he hadnt been familiarised with the right sort of people
with a touch of fear for the young man beside him whom he furtively scrutinised with an air of some consternation remembering he had just come back from paris the eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister failing to throw much light on the subject however he brought to mind instances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly nipped in the bud of premature decay and nobody to blame but themselves
for instance there was the case of ocallaghan for one the halfcrazy faddist respectably connected though of inadequate means with his mad vagaries among whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a nuisance to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously sporting in public a suit of brown paper a fact
and then the usual dnouement after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed into hot water and had to be spirited away by a few friends after a strong hint to a blind horse from john mallon of lower castle yard so as not to be made amenable under section two of the criminal law amendment act certain names of those subpnaed being handed in but not divulged for reasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of brains
briefly putting two and two together six sixteen which he pointedly turned a deaf ear to antonio and so forth jockeys and esthetes and the tattoo which was all the go in the seventies or thereabouts even in the house of lords because early in life the occupant of the throne then heir apparent the other members of the upper ten and other high personages simply following in the footsteps of the head of the state he reflected about the errors of notorieties and crowned heads running counter to morality such as the cornwall case a number of years before under their veneer in a way scarcely intended by nature a thing good mrs grundy as the law stands was terribly down on though not for the reason they thought they were probably whatever it was except women chiefly who were always fiddling more or less at one another it being largely a matter of dress and all the rest of it
ladies who like distinctive underclothing should and every welltailored man must trying to make the gap wider between them by innuendo and give more of a genuine filip to acts of impropriety between the two she unbuttoned his and then he untied her mind the pin whereas savages in the cannibal islands say at ninety degrees in the shade not caring a continental
however reverting to the original there were on the other hand others who had forced their way to the top from the lowest rung by the aid of their bootstraps
sheer force of natural genius that
with brains sir
for which and further reasons he felt it was his interest and duty even to wait on and profit by the unlookedfor occasion though why he could not exactly tell being as it was already several shillings to the bad having in fact let himself in for it
still to cultivate the acquaintance of someone of no uncommon calibre who could provide food for reflection would amply repay any small
intellectual stimulation as such was he felt from time to time a firstrate tonic for the mind
added to which was the coincidence of meeting discussion dance row old salt of the here today and gone tomorrow type night loafers the whole galaxy of events all went to make up a miniature cameo of the world we live in especially as the lives of the submerged tenth viz
coalminers divers scavengers etc were very much under the microscope lately
to improve the shining hour he wondered whether he might meet with anything approaching the same luck as mr philip beaufoy if taken down in writing suppose he were to pen something out of the common groove as he fully intended doing at the rate of one guinea per column
my experiences let us say in a cabmans shelter

different ways of bringing off a coup
lovemaking damages
though that halfbaked lyons ran off at a tangent in his impetuosity to get left
of course gambling eminently lent itself to that sort of thing though as the event turned out the poor fool hadnt much reason to congratulate himself on his pick the forlorn hope
guesswork it reduced itself to eventually
there was every indication they would arrive at that he bloom said
who
the other whose hand by the way was hurt said
one morning you would open the paper the cabman affirmed and read return of parnell
he bet them what they liked
a dublin fusilier was in that shelter one night and said he saw him in south africa
pride it was killed him
he ought to have done away with himself or lain low for a time after committee room no  until he was his old self again with noone to point a finger at him
then they would all to a man have gone down on their marrowbones to him to come back when he had recovered his senses
dead he wasnt
simply absconded somewhere
the coffin they brought over was full of stones
he changed his name to de wet the boer general
he made a mistake to fight the priests
and so forth and so on
all the same bloom properly so dubbed was rather surprised at their memories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels and not singly but in their thousands and then complete oblivion because it was twenty odd years
highly unlikely of course there was even a shadow of truth in the stones and even supposing he thought a return highly inadvisable all things considered
something evidently riled them in his death
either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when his various different political arrangements were nearing completion or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to change his boots and clothes after a wetting when a cold resulted and failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his room till he eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at an end or quite possibly they were distressed to find the job was taken out of their hands
of course nobody being acquainted with his movements even before there was absolutely no clue as to his whereabouts which were decidedly of the alice where art thou order even prior to his starting to go under several aliases such as fox and stewart so the remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within the bounds of possibility
naturally then it would prey on his mind as a born leader of men which undoubtedly he was and a commanding figure a sixfooter or at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged feet whereas messrs so and so who though they werent even a patch on the former man ruled the roost after their redeeming features were very few and far between
it certainly pointed a moral the idol with feet of clay and then seventytwo of his trusty henchmen rounding on him with mutual mudslinging
and the identical same with murderers
you had to come back
that haunting sense kind of drew you
to show the understudy in the title rle how to
he saw him once on the auspicious occasion when they broke up the type in the insuppressible or was it united ireland a privilege he keenly appreciated and in point of fact handed him his silk hat when it was knocked off and he said thank you excited as he undoubtedly was under his frigid exterior notwithstanding the little misadventure mentioned between the cup and the lip whats bred in the bone
still as regards return
you were a lucky dog if they didnt set the terrier at you directly you got back
then a lot of shillyshally usually followed tom for and dick and harry against
and then number one you came up against the man in possession and had to produce your credentials like the claimant in the tichborne case roger charles tichborne bella was the boats name to the best of his recollection he the heir went down in as the evidence went to show and there was a tattoo mark too in indian ink lord bellew was it as he might very easily have picked up the details from some pal on board ship and then when got up to tally with the description given introduce himself with excuse me my name is so and so or some such commonplace remark
a more prudent course as bloom said to the not over effusive in fact like the distinguished personage under discussion beside him would have been to sound the lie of the land first
that bitch that english whore did for him the shebeen proprietor commented
she put the first nail in his coffin
fine lump of a woman all the same the soidisant townclerk henry campbell remarked and plenty of her

the husband was a captain or an officer
ay skinthegoat amusingly added he was and a cottonball one
this gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair amount of laughter among his entourage
as regards bloom he without the faintest suspicion of a smile merely gazed in the direction of the door and reflected upon the historic story which had aroused extraordinary interest at the time when the facts to make matters worse were made public with the usual affectionate letters that passed between them full of sweet nothings
first it was strictly platonic till nature intervened and an attachment sprang up between them till bit by bit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk of the town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few evildisposed however who were resolved upon encompassing his downfall though the thing was public property all along though not to anything like the sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed into
since their names were coupled though since he was her declared favourite where was the particular necessity to proclaim it to the rank and file from the housetops the fact namely that he had shared her bedroom which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went through the packed court literally electrifying everybody in the shape of witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a particular date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance of a ladder in night apparel having gained admittance in the same fashion a fact the weeklies addicted to the lubric a little simply coined shoals of money out of
whereas the simple fact of the case was it was simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch with nothing in common between them beyond the name and then a real man arriving on the scene strong to the verge of weakness falling a victim to her siren charms and forgetting home ties the usual sequel to bask in the loved ones smiles
the eternal question of the life connubial needless to say cropped up
can real love supposing there happens to be another chap in the case exist between married folk
poser
though it was no concern of theirs absolutely if he regarded her with affection carried away by a wave of folly
a magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly augmented obviously by gifts of a high order as compared with the other military supernumerary that is who was just the usual everyday farewell my gallant captain kind of an individual in the light dragoons the th hussars to be accurate and inflammable doubtless the fallen leader that is not the other in his own peculiar way which she of course woman quickly perceived as highly likely to carve his way to fame which he almost bid fair to do till the priests and ministers of the gospel as a whole his erstwhile staunch adherents and his beloved evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts of the country by taking up the cudgels on their behalf in a way that exceeded their most sanguine expectations very effectually cooked his matrimonial goose thereby heaping coals of fire on his head much in the same way as the fabled asss kick
looking back now in a retrospective kind of arrangement all seemed a kind of dream
and then coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it went without saying you would feel out of place as things always moved with the times
why as he reflected irishtown strand a locality he had not been in for quite a number of years looked different somehow since as it happened he went to reside on the north side
north or south however it was just the wellknown case of hot passion pure and simple upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the very thing he was saying as she also was spanish or half so types that wouldnt do things by halves passionate abandon of the south casting every shred of decency to the winds
just bears out what i was saying he with glowing bosom said to stephen about blood and the sun
and if i dont greatly mistake she was spanish too
the king of spains daughter stephen answered adding something or other rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you spanish onions and the first land called the deadman and from ramhead to scilly was so and so many
was she
bloom ejaculated surprised though not astonished by any means i never heard that rumour before
possible especially there it was as she lived there
so spain
carefully avoiding a book in his pocket sweets of which reminded him by the by of that capel street library book out of date he took out his pocketbook and turning over the various contents it contained rapidly finally he
do you consider by the by he said thoughtfully selecting a faded photo which he laid on the table that a spanish type
stephen obviously addressed looked down on the photo showing a large sized lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she was in the full bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiously low for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom with more than vision of breasts her full lips parted and some perfect teeth standing near ostensibly with gravity a piano on the rest of which was in old madrid a ballad pretty in its way which was then all the vogue
her the ladys eyes dark large looked at stephen about to smile about something to be admired lafayette of westmoreland street dublins premier photographic artist being responsible for the esthetic execution
mrs bloom my wife the prima donna madam marion tweedy bloom indicated
taken a few years since
in or about ninety six
very like her then
beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his legal wife who he intimated was the accomplished daughter of major brian tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a singer having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered barely sweet sixteen
as for the face it was a speaking likeness in expression but it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage in that getup
she could without difficulty he said have posed for the ensemble not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the
he dwelt being a bit of an artist in his spare time on the female form in general developmentally because as it so happened no later than that afternoon he had seen those grecian statues perfectly developed as works of art in the national museum
marble could give the original shoulders back all the symmetry all the rest
yes puritanisme it does though saint josephs sovereign thievery alors bandez
figne toi trop
whereas no photo could because it simply wasnt art in a word
the spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow jack tars good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for itself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the beauty for himself her stage presence being frankly a treat in itself which the camera could not at all do justice to
but it was scarcely professional etiquette so
though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet wonderfully cool for the season considering for sunshine after storm
and he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion
nevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased by opulent curves none the worse for wear however and looked away thoughtfully with the intention of not further increasing the others possible embarrassment while gauging her symmetry of heaving embonpoint
in fact the slight soiling was only an added charm like the case of linen slightly soiled good as new much better in fact with the starch out
suppose she was gone when he
i looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind but merely as a passing fancy of his because he then recollected the morning littered bed etcetera and the book about ruby with met him pike hoses sic in it which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies to lindley murray
the vicinity of the young man he certainly relished educated distingu and impulsive into the bargain far and away the pick of the bunch though you wouldnt think he had it in him yet you would
besides he said the picture was handsome which say what you like it was though at the moment she was distinctly stouter
and why not
an awful lot of makebelieve went on about that sort of thing involving a lifelong slur with the usual splash page of gutterpress about the same old matrimonial tangle alleging misconduct with professional golfer or the newest stage favourite instead of being honest and aboveboard about the whole business
how they were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up between the two so that their names were coupled in the public eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy and compromising expressions leaving no loophole to show that they openly cohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and relations when the thing ran its normal course became in due course intimate
then the decree nisi and the kings proctor tries to show cause why and he failing to quash it nisi was made absolute
but as for that the two misdemeanants wrapped up as they largely were in one another could safely afford to ignore it as they very largely did till the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor who filed a petition for the party wronged in due course
he b enjoyed the distinction of being close to erins uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred on the historic fracas when the fallen leaders who notoriously stuck to his guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery leaders trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated into the printing works of the insuppressible or no it was united ireland a by no means by the by appropriate appellative and broke up the typecases with hammers or something like that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from the facile pens of the obrienite scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation reflecting on the erstwhile tribunes private morals
though palpably a radically altered man he was still a commanding figure though carelessly garbed as usual with that look of settled purpose which went a long way with the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture that their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a pedestal which she however was the first to perceive
as those were particularly hot times in the general hullaballoo bloom sustained a minor injury from a nasty prod of some chaps elbow in the crowd that of course congregated lodging some place about the pit of the stomach fortunately not of a grave character
his hat parnells a silk one was inadvertently knocked off and as a matter of strict history bloom was the man who picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to return it to him and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity who panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat at the time all the same being a gentleman born with a stake in the country he as a matter of fact having gone into it more for the kudos of the thing than anything else whats bred in the bone instilled into him in infancy at his mothers knee in the shape of knowing what good form was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and thanked him with perfect aplomb saying thank you sir though in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal profession whose headgear bloom also set to rights earlier in the course of the day history repeating itself with a difference after the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave
on the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest laughing immoderately pretending to understand everything the why and the wherefore and in reality not knowing their own minds it being a case for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from the usual boy jones who happened to come across them at the crucial moment in a loving position locked in one anothers arms drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord and master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would overlook the matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes though possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as quite possibly there were several others
he personally being of a sceptical bias believed and didnt make the smallest bones about saying so either that man or men in the plural were always hanging around on the waiting list about a lady even supposing she was the best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the sake of argument when neglecting her duties she chose to be tired of wedded life and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on her with improper intent the upshot being that her affections centred on another the cause of many liaisons between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty and younger men no doubt as several famous cases of feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt
it was a thousand pities a young fellow blessed with an allowance of brains as his neighbour obviously was should waste his valuable time with profligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last him his lifetime
in the nature of single blessedness he would one day take unto himself a wife when miss right came on the scene but in the interim ladies society was a conditio sine qua non though he had the gravest possible doubts not that he wanted in the smallest to pump stephen about miss ferguson who was very possibly the particular lodestar who brought him down to irishtown so early in the morning as to whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi or triweekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentplaying and walking out leading up to fond lovers ways and flowers and chocs
to think of him house and homeless rooked by some landlady worse than any stepmother was really too bad at his age
the queer suddenly things he popped out with attracted the elder man who was several years the others senior or like his father but something substantial he certainly ought to eat even were it only an eggflip made on unadulterated maternal nutriment or failing that the homely humpty dumpty boiled
at what oclock did you dine
he questioned of the slim form and tired though unwrinkled face
some time yesterday stephen said
yesterday
exclaimed bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow friday
ah you mean its after twelve
the day before yesterday stephen said improving on himself
literally astounded at this piece of intelligence bloom reflected
though they didnt see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there somehow was as if both their minds were travelling so to speak in the one train of thought
at his age when dabbling in politics roughly some score of years previously when he had been a quasi aspirant to parliamentary honours in the buckshot foster days he too recollected in retrospect which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself he had a sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas
for instance when the evicted tenants question then at its first inception bulked largely in peoples mind though it goes without saying not contributing a copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums some of which wouldnt exactly hold water he at the outset in principle at all events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the trend of modern opinion a partiality however which realising his mistake he was subsequently partially cured of and even was twitted with going a step farther than michael davitt in the striking views he at one time inculcated as a backtothelander which was one reason he strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion by our friend at the gathering of the clans in barney kiernans so that he though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of mortals be it repeated departed from his customary habit to give him metaphorically one in the gizzard though so far as politics themselves were concerned he was only too conscious of the casualties invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on fine young fellows chiefly destruction of the fittest in a word
anyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons getting on for one as it was it was high time to be retiring for the night
the crux was it was a bit risky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue somebody having a temper of her own sometimes and spoil the hash altogether as on the night he misguidedly brought home a dog breed unknown with a lame paw not that the cases were either identical or the reverse though he had hurt his hand too to ontario terrace as he very distinctly remembered having been there so to speak
on the other hand it was altogether far and away too late for the sandymount or sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which of the two alternatives
everything pointed to the fact that it behoved him to avail himself to the full of the opportunity all things considered
his initial impression was he was a shade standoffish or not over effusive but it grew on him someway
for one thing he mightnt what you call jump at the idea if approached and what mostly worried him was he didnt know how to lead up to it or word it exactly supposing he did entertain the proposal as it would afford him very great personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some wardrobe if found suitable
at all events he wound up by concluding eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent a cup of eppss cocoa and a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat doubled into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast on a trivet he failed to perceive any very vast amount of harm in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked up
a move had to be made because that merry old soul the grasswidower in question who appeared to be glued to the spot didnt appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly beloved queenstown and it was highly likely some spongers bawdyhouse of retired beauties where age was no bar off sheriff street lower would be the best clue to that equivocal characters whereabouts for a few days to come alternately racking their feelings the mermaids with sixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to freeze the marrow of anybodys bones and mauling their largesized charms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment of large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for as to who he in reality was let x equal my right name and address as mr algebra remarks passim
at the same time he inwardly chuckled over his gentle repartee to the blood and ouns champion about his god being a jew
people could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what properly riled them was a bite from a sheep
the most vulnerable point too of tender achilles
your god was a jew
because mostly they appeared to imagine he came from carrickonshannon or somewhereabouts in the county sligo
i propose our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection while prudently pocketing her photo as its rather stuffy here you just come home with me and talk things over
my diggings are quite close in the vicinity
you cant drink that stuff
do you like cocoa
wait
ill just pay this lot
the best plan clearly being to clear out the remainder being plain sailing he beckoned while prudently pocketing the photo to the keeper of the shanty who didnt seem to
yes thats the best he assured stephen to whom for the matter of that brazen head or him or anywhere else was all more or less
all kinds of utopian plans were flashing through his bs busy brain education the genuine article literature journalism prize titbits up to date billing concert tours in english watering resorts packed with hydros and seaside theatres turning money away duets in italian with the accent perfectly true to nature and a quantity of other things no necessity of course to tell the world and his wife from the housetops about it and a slice of luck
an opening was all was wanted
because he more than suspected he had his fathers voice to bank his hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be just as well by the way no harm to trail the conversation in the direction of that particular red herring just to
the cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former viceroy earl cadogan had presided at the cabdrivers association dinner in london somewhere
silence with a yawn or two accompanied this thrilling announcement
then the old specimen in the corner who appeared to have some spark of vitality left read out that sir anthony macdonnell had left euston for the chief secretarys lodge or words to that effect
to which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered why
give us a squint at that literature grandfather the ancient mariner put in manifesting some natural impatience
and welcome answered the elderly party thus addressed
the sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles which he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears
are you bad in the eyes
the sympathetic personage like the townclerk queried
why answered the seafarer with the tartan beard who seemingly was a bit of a literary cove in his own small way staring out of seagreen portholes as you might well describe them as i uses goggles reading
sand in the red sea done that
one time i could read a book in the dark manner of speaking
the arabian nights entertainment was my favourite and red as a rose is she  hereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon lord only knows what found drowned or the exploits of king willow iremonger having made a hundred and something second wicket not out for notts during which time completely regardless of ire the keeper was intensely occupied loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched him as he muttered against whoever it was sold it all of them who were sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions that is to say either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial remark
to cut a long story short bloom grasping the situation was the first to rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first and foremost being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for the occasion taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine host as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were not looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming making a grand total of fourpence the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four coppers literally the last of the mohicans he having previously spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him in unmistakable figures coffee d confectionery do and honestly well worth twice the money once in a way as wetherup used to remark
come he counselled to close the sance
seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the shelter or shanty together and the lite society of oilskin and company whom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their dolce far niente
stephen who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged out paused at the for a moment the door
one thing i never understood he said to be original on the spur of the moment
why they put tables upside down at night i mean chairs upside down on the tables in cafs
to which impromptu the neverfailing bloom replied without a moments hesitation saying straight off  to sweep the floor in the morning
so saying he skipped around nimbly considering frankly at the same time apologetic to get on his companions right a habit of his by the bye his right side being in classical idiom his tender achilles
the night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though stephen was a bit weak on his pins
it will the air do you good bloom said meaning also the walk in a moment
the only thing is to walk then youll feel a different man
come
its not far
lean on me
accordingly he passed his left arm in stephens right and led him on accordingly
yes stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange kind of flesh of a different man approach him sinewless and wobbly and all that
anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones brazier etc
where the municipal supernumerary ex gumley was still to all intents and purposes wrapped in the arms of murphy as the adage has it dreaming of fresh fields and pastures new
and apropos of coffin of stones the analogy was not at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class probably the selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings
so they turned on to chatting about music a form of art for which bloom as a pure amateur possessed the greatest love as they made tracks arm in arm across beresford place
wagnerian music though confessedly grand in its way was a bit too heavy for bloom and hard to follow at the first gooff but the music of mercadantes huguenots meyerbeers seven last words on the cross and mozarts twelfth mass he simply revelled in the gloria in that being to his mind the acme of first class music as such literally knocking everything else into a cocked hat
he infinitely preferred the sacred music of the catholic church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line such as those moody and sankey hymns or bid me to live and i will live thy protestant to be
he also yielded to none in his admiration of rossinis stabat mater a work simply abounding in immortal numbers in which his wife madam marion tweedy made a hit a veritable sensation he might safely say greatly adding to her other laurels and putting the others totally in the shade in the jesuit fathers church in upper gardiner street the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with virtuosos or virtuosi rather
there was the unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and suffice it to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character there was a generally voiced desire for an encore
on the whole though favouring preferably light opera of the don giovanni description and martha a gem in its line he had a penchant though with only a surface knowledge for the severe classical school such as mendelssohn
and talking of that taking it for granted he knew all about the old favourites he mentioned par excellence lionels air in martha mappari which curiously enough he had heard or overheard to be more accurate on yesterday a privilege he keenly appreciated from the lips of stephens respected father sung to perfection a study of the number in fact which made all the others take a back seat
stephen in reply to a politely put query said he didnt sing it but launched out into praises of shakespeares songs at least of in or about that period the lutenist dowland who lived in fetter lane near gerard the herbalist who anno ludendo hausi doulandus an instrument he was contemplating purchasing from mr arnold dolmetsch whom b did not quite recall though the name certainly sounded familiar for sixtyfive guineas and farnaby and son with their dux and comes conceits and byrd william who played the virginals he said in the queens chapel or anywhere else he found them and one tomkins who made toys or airs and john bull
on the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond the swingchains a horse dragging a sweeper paced on the paven ground brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise bloom was not perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive guineas and john bull
he inquired if it was john bull the political celebrity of that ilk as it struck him the two identical names as a striking coincidence
by the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn which perceiving bloom who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual plucked the others sleeve gently jocosely remarking  our lives are in peril tonight
beware of the steamroller
they thereupon stopped
bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth anything like sixtyfive guineas suddenly in evidence in the dark quite near so that it seemed new a different grouping of bones and even flesh because palpably it was a fourwalker a hipshaker a blackbuttocker a taildangler a headhanger putting his hind foot foremost the while the lord of his creation sat on the perch busy with his thoughts
but such a good poor brute he was sorry he hadnt a lump of sugar but as he wisely reflected you could scarcely be prepared for every emergency that might crop up
he was just a big nervous foolish noodly kind of a horse without a second care in the world
but even a dog he reflected take that mongrel in barney kiernans of the same size would be a holy horror to face
but it was no animals fault in particular if he was built that way like the camel ship of the desert distilling grapes into potheen in his hump
nine tenths of them all could be caged or trained nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees
whale with a harpoon hairpin alligator tickle the small of his back and he sees the joke chalk a circle for a rooster tiger my eagle eye
these timely reflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind somewhat distracted from stephens words while the ship of the street was manuvring and stephen went on about the highly interesting old
whats this i was saying
ah yes
my wife he intimated plunging in medias res would have the greatest of pleasure in making your acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind
he looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of stephen image of his mother which was not quite the same as the usual handsome blackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after as he was perhaps not that way built
still supposing he had his fathers gift as he more than suspected it opened up new vistas in his mind such as lady fingalls irish industries concert on the preceding monday and aristocracy in general
exquisite variations he was now describing on an air youth here has end by jans pieter sweelinck a dutchman of amsterdam where the frows come from
even more he liked an old german song of johannes jeep about the clear sea and the voices of sirens sweet murderers of men which boggled bloom a bit       von der sirenen listigkeit      tun die poeten dichten
these opening bars he sang and translated extempore
bloom nodding said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which he did
a phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that the rarest of boons which bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out could easily if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production such as barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and procure for its fortunate possessor in the near future an entre into fashionable houses in the best residential quarters of financial magnates in a large way of business and titled people where with his university degree of b
a
a huge ad in its way and gentlemanly bearing to all the more influence the good impression he would infallibly score a distinct success being blessed with brains which also could be utilised for the purpose and other requisites if his clothes were properly attended to so as to the better worm his way into their good graces as he a youthful tyro in societys sartorial niceties hardly understood how a little thing like that could militate against you
it was in fact only a matter of months and he could easily foresee him participating in their musical and artistic conversaziones during the festivities of the christmas season for choice causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes of the fair sex and being made a lot of by ladies out for sensation cases of which as he happened to know were on recordin fact without giving the show away he himself once upon a time if he cared to could easily have
added to which of course would be the pecuniary emolument by no means to be sneezed at going hand in hand with his tuition fees
not he parenthesised that for the sake of filthy lucre he need necessarily embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of time
but a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or nay and both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped
besides though taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree original music like that different from the conventional rut would rapidly have a great vogue as it would be a decided novelty for dublins musical world after the usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a confiding public by ivan st austell and hilton st just and their genus omne
yes beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in his hand and he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high place in the citys esteem where he could command a stiff figure and booking ahead give a grand concert for the patrons of the king street house given a backerup if one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs so to speak a big if however with some impetus of the goahead sort to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often tripped up a too much fted prince of good fellows
and it need not detract from the other by one iota as being his own master he would have heaps of time to practise literature in his spare moments when desirous of so doing without its clashing with his vocal career or containing anything derogatory whatsoever as it was a matter for himself alone
in fact he had the ball at his feet and that was the very reason why the other possessed of a remarkably sharp nose for smelling a rat of any sort hung on to him at all
the horse was just then
and later on at a propitious opportunity he purposed bloom did without anyway prying into his private affairs on the fools step in where angels principle advising him to sever his connection with a certain budding practitioner who he noticed was prone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious pretext when not present deprecate him or whatever you like to call it which in blooms humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side of a persons character no pun intended
the horse having reached the end of his tether so to speak halted and rearing high a proud feathering tail added his quota by letting fall on the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish three smoking globes of turds
slowly three times one after another from a full crupper he mired
and humanely his driver waited till he or she had ended patient in his scythed car
side by side bloom profiting by the contretemps with stephen passed through the gap of the chains divided by the upright and stepping over a strand of mire went across towards gardiner street lower stephen singing more boldly but not loudly the end of the ballad
und alle schiffe brcken
the driver never said a word good bad or indifferent but merely watched the two figures as he sat on his lowbacked car both black one full one lean walk towards the railway bridge to be married by father maher
as they walked they at times stopped and walked again continuing their tte  tte which of course he was utterly out of about sirens enemies of mans reason mingled with a number of other topics of the same category usurpers historical cases of the kind while the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in the sleeper car who in any case couldnt possibly hear because they were too far simply sat in his seat near the end of lower gardiner street and looked after their lowbacked car
     what parallel courses did bloom and stephen follow returning
starting united both at normal walking pace from beresford place they followed in the order named lower and middle gardiner streets and mountjoy square west then at reduced pace each bearing left gardiners place by an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of temple street then at reduced pace with interruptions of halt bearing right temple street north as far as hardwicke place
approaching disparate at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the circus before georges church diametrically the chord in any circle being less than the arc which it subtends
of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary
music literature ireland dublin paris friendship woman prostitution diet the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and glowlamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees exposed corporation emergency dustbuckets the roman catholic church ecclesiastical celibacy the irish nation jesuit education careers the study of medicine the past day the maleficent influence of the presabbath stephens collapse
did bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective like and unlike reactions to experience
both were sensitive to artistic impressions musical in preference to plastic or pictorial
both preferred a continental to an insular manner of life a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence
both indurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of heterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox religious national social and ethical doctrines
both admitted the alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual magnetism
were their views on some points divergent
stephen dissented openly from blooms views on the importance of dietary and civic selfhelp while bloom dissented tacitly from stephens views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature
bloom assented covertly to stephens rectification of the anachronism involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the irish nation to christianity from druidism by patrick son of calpornus son of potitus son of odyssus sent by pope celestine i in the year  in the reign of leary to the year  or thereabouts in the reign of cormac macart   ad suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at sletty and interred at rossnaree
the collapse which bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength accelerated by mental exertion and the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere stephen attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud perceived by both from two different points of observation sandycove and dublin at first no bigger than a womans hand
was there one point on which their views were equal and negative
the influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees
had bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in the past
in  with owen goldberg and cecil turnbull at night on public thoroughfares between longwood avenue and leonards corner and leonards corner and synge street and synge street and bloomfield avenue
in  with percy apjohn in the evenings reclined against the wall between gibraltar villa and bloomfield house in crumlin barony of uppercross
in  occasionally with casual acquaintances and prospective purchasers on doorsteps in front parlours in third class railway carriages of suburban lines
in  frequently with major brian tweedy and his daughter miss marion tweedy together and separately on the lounge in matthew dillons house in roundtown
once in  and once in  with julius juda mastiansky on both occasions in the parlour of his blooms house in lombard street west
what reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates        did bloom make before their arrival at their destination
he reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction of the converse domain of interindividual relations
as in what ways
from inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received existence with existence he was with any as any with any from existence to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived
what act did bloom make on their arrival at their destination
at the housesteps of the th of the equidifferent uneven numbers number  eccles street he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket of his trousers to obtain his latchkey
was it there
it was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on the day but one preceding
why was he doubly irritated
because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded himself twice not to forget
what were then the alternatives before the premeditatedly respectively and inadvertently keyless couple
to enter or not to enter
to knock or not to knock
blooms decision
a stratagem
resting his feet on the dwarf wall he climbed over the area railings compressed his hat on his head grasped two points at the lower union of rails and stiles lowered his body gradually by its length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in space by separating himself from the railings and crouching in preparation for the impact of the fall
did he fall
by his bodys known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in avoirdupois measure as certified by the graduated machine for periodical selfweighing in the premises of francis froedman pharmaceutical chemist of  frederick street north on the last feast of the ascension to wit the twelfth day of may of the bissextile year one thousand nine hundred and four of the christian era jewish era five thousand six hundred and sixtyfour mohammadan era one thousand three hundred and twentytwo golden number  epact  solar cycle  dominical letters c b roman indiction  julian period  mcmiv
did he rise uninjured by concussion
regaining new stable equilibrium he rose uninjured though concussed by the impact raised the latch of the area door by the exertion of force at its freely moving flange and by leverage of the first kind applied at its fulcrum gained retarded access to the kitchen through the subadjacent scullery ignited a lucifer match by friction set free inflammable coal gas by turning on the ventcock lit a high flame which by regulating he reduced to quiescent candescence and lit finally a portable candle
what discrete succession of images did stephen meanwhile perceive
reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of  cp a man lighting a candle of  cp a man removing in turn each of his two boots a man leaving the kitchen holding a candle
did the man reappear elsewhere
after a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the halldoor
the halldoor turned gradually on its hinges
in the open space of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat with his candle
did stephen obey his sign
yes entering softly he helped to close and chain the door and followed softly along the hallway the mans back and listed feet and lighted candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down a turning staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of blooms house
what did bloom do
he extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its flame drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone one for stephen with its back to the area window the other for himself when necessary knelt on one knee composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons of best abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of messrs flower and mdonald of  dolier street kindled it at three projecting points of paper with one ignited lucifer match thereby releasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen of the air
of what similar apparitions did stephen think
of others elsewhere in other times who kneeling on one knee or on two had kindled fires for him of brother michael in the infirmary of the college of the society of jesus at clongowes wood sallins in the county of kildare of his father simon dedalus in an unfurnished room of his first residence in dublin number thirteen fitzgibbon street of his godmother miss kate morkan in the house of her dying sister miss julia morkan at  ushers island of his aunt sara wife of richie richard goulding in the kitchen of their lodgings at  clanbrassil street of his mother mary wife of simon dedalus in the kitchen of number twelve north richmond street on the morning of the feast of saint francis xavier  of the dean of studies father butt in the physics theatre of university college  stephens green north of his sister dilly delia in his fathers house in cabra
what did stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from the fire towards the opposite wall
under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope stretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the chimney pier from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs folded unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of ladies grey hose with lisle suspender tops and feet in their habitual position clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer extremities and the third at their point of junction
what did bloom see on the range
on the right smaller hob a blue enamelled saucepan on the left larger hob a black iron kettle
what did bloom do at the range
he removed the saucepan to the left hob rose and carried the iron kettle to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to let it flow
did it flow
yes

having set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals why did he return to the stillflowing tap
to wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of barringtons lemonflavoured soap to which paper still adhered bought thirteen hours previously for fourpence and still unpaid for in fresh cold neverchanging everchanging water and dry them face and hands in a long redbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller
what reason did stephen give for declining blooms offer
that he was hydrophobe hating partial contact by immersion or total by submersion in cold water his last bath having taken place in the month of october of the preceding year disliking the aqueous substances of glass and crystal distrusting aquacities of thought and language
what impeded bloom from giving stephen counsels of hygiene and prophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a preliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with rapid splashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region in case of sea or river bathing the parts of the human anatomy most sensitive to cold being the nape stomach and thenar or sole of foot
the incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius
what additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress
dietary concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric energy in bacon salt ling and butter the absence of the former in the lastnamed and the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed
which seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest
confidence in himself an equal and opposite power of abandonment and recuperation
what concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the agency of fire
the phenomenon of ebullition
fanned by a constant updraught of ventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue ignition was communicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral masses of bituminous coal containing in compressed mineral form the foliated fossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn derived their vegetative existence from the sun primal source of heat radiant transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous diathermanous ether
heat convected a mode of motion developed by such combustion was constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source of calorification to the liquid contained in the vessel being radiated through the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron in part reflected in part absorbed in part transmitted gradually raising the temperature of the water from normal to boiling point a rise in temperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of  thermal units needed to raise  pound of water from  to  fahrenheit
what announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature
a double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at both sides simultaneously
for what personal purpose could bloom have applied the water so boiled
to shave himself
what advantages attended shaving by night
a softer beard a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from shave to shave in its agglutinated lather a softer skin if unexpectedly encountering female acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours quiet reflections upon the course of the day a cleaner sensation when awaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal noises premonitions and perturbations a clattered milkcan a postmans double knock a paper read reread while lathering relathering the same spot a shock a shoot with thought of aught he sought though fraught with nought might cause a faster rate of shaving and a nick on which incision plaster with precision cut and humected and applied adhered which was to be done
why did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noise
because of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine feminine passive active hand
what quality did it his hand possess but with what counteracting influence
the operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human blood even when the end justified the means preferring in their natural order heliotherapy psychophysicotherapeutics osteopathic surgery
what lay under exposure on the lower middle and upper shelves of the kitchen dresser opened by bloom
on the lower shelf five vertical breakfast plates six horizontal breakfast saucers on which rested inverted breakfast cups a moustachecup uninverted and saucer of crown derby four white goldrimmed eggcups an open shammy purse displaying coins mostly copper and a phial of aromatic violet comfits
on the middle shelf a chipped eggcup containing pepper a drum of table salt four conglomerated black olives in oleaginous paper an empty pot of plumtrees potted meat an oval wicker basket bedded with fibre and containing one jersey pear a halfempty bottle of william gilbey and cos white invalid port half disrobed of its swathe of coralpink tissue paper a packet of eppss soluble cocoa five ounces of anne lynchs choice tea at  per lb in a crinkled leadpaper bag a cylindrical canister containing the best crystallised lump sugar two onions one the larger spanish entire the other smaller irish bisected with augmented surface and more redolent a jar of irish model dairys cream a jug of brown crockery containing a naggin and a quarter of soured adulterated milk converted by heat into water acidulous serum and semisolidified curds which added to the quantity subtracted for mr blooms and mrs flemings breakfasts made one imperial pint the total quantity originally delivered two cloves a halfpenny and a small dish containing a slice of fresh ribsteak
on the upper shelf a battery of jamjars empty of various sizes and proveniences
what attracted his attention lying on the apron of the dresser
four polygonal fragments of two lacerated scarlet betting tickets numbered    
what reminiscences temporarily corrugated his brow
reminiscences of coincidences truth stranger than fiction preindicative of the result of the gold cup flat handicap the official and definitive result of which he had read in the evening telegraph late pink edition in the cabmans shelter at butt bridge
where had previous intimations of the result effected or projected been received by him
in bernard kiernans licensed premises   and  little britain street in david byrnes licensed premises  duke street in oconnell street lower outside graham lemons when a dark man had placed in his hand a throwaway subsequently thrown away advertising elijah restorer of the church in zion in lincoln place outside the premises of f w sweny and co limited dispensing chemists when when frederick m bantam lyons had rapidly and successively requested perused and restituted the copy of the current issue of the freemans journal and national press which he had been about to throw away subsequently thrown away he had proceeded towards the oriental edifice of the turkish and warm baths  leinster street with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the secret of the race graven in the language of prediction
what qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations
the difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event followed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the electrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss by failure to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceeding originally from a successful interpretation
his mood
he had not risked he did not expect he had not been disappointed he was satisfied
what satisfied him
to have sustained no positive loss
to have brought a positive gain to others
light to the gentiles
how did bloom prepare a collation for a gentile
he poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls four in all of eppss soluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed on the label to each adding after sufficient time for infusion the prescribed ingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity prescribed
what supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his guest
relinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation crown derby presented to him by his only daughter millicent milly he substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served extraordinarily to his guest and in reduced measure to himself the viscous cream ordinarily reserved for the breakfast of his wife marion molly
was the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of hospitality
his attention was directed to them by his host jocosely and he accepted them seriously as they drank in jocoserious silence eppss massproduct the creature cocoa
were there marks of hospitality which he contemplated but suppressed reserving them for another and for himself on future occasions to complete the act begun
the reparation of a fissure of the length of   inches in the right side of his guests jacket
a gift to his guest of one of the four ladys handkerchiefs if and when ascertained to be in a presentable condition
who drank more quickly
bloom having the advantage of ten seconds at the initiation and taking from the concave surface of a spoon along the handle of which a steady flow of heat was conducted three sips to his opponents one six to two nine to three
what cerebration accompanied his frequentative act
concluding by inspection but erroneously that his silent companion was engaged in mental composition he reflected on the pleasures derived from literature of instruction rather than of amusement as he himself had applied to the works of william shakespeare more than once for the solution of difficult problems in imaginary or real life
had he found their solution
in spite of careful and repeated reading of certain classical passages aided by a glossary he had derived imperfect conviction from the text the answers not bearing in all points
what lines concluded his first piece of original verse written by him potential poet at the age of  in  on the occasion of the offering of three prizes of   and  respectively for competition by the shamrock a weekly newspaper
an ambition to squint      at my verses in print      makes me hope that for these youll find room
if you so condescend      then please place at the end      the name of yours truly l bloom
did he find four separating forces between his temporary guest and him
name age race creed
what anagrams had he made on his name in youth
leopold bloom ellpodbomool molldopeloob bollopedoom old ollebo m p  what acrostic upon the abbreviation of his first name had he kinetic poet sent to miss marion molly tweedy on the  february 
poets oft have sung in rhyme      of music sweet their praise divine
let them hymn it nine times nine
dearer far than song or wine

what had prevented him from completing a topical song music by r g johnston on the events of the past or fixtures for the actual years entitled if brian boru could but come back and see old dublin now commissioned by michael gunn lessee of the gaiety theatre     south king street and to be introduced into the sixth scene the valley of diamonds of the second edition  january  of the grand annual christmas pantomime sinbad the sailor produced by r shelton  december  written by greenleaf whittier scenery by george a jackson and cecil hicks costumes by mrs and miss whelan under the personal supervision of mrs michael gunn ballets by jessie noir harlequinade by thomas otto and sung by nelly bouverist principal girl
firstly oscillation between events of imperial and of local interest the anticipated diamond jubilee of queen victoria born  acceded  and the posticipated opening of the new municipal fish market secondly apprehension of opposition from extreme circles on the questions of the respective visits of their royal highnesses the duke and duchess of york real and of his majesty king brian boru imaginary thirdly a conflict between professional etiquette and professional emulation concerning the recent erections of the grand lyric hall on burgh quay and the theatre royal in hawkins street fourthly distraction resultant from compassion for nelly bouverists nonintellectual nonpolitical nontopical expression of countenance and concupiscence caused by nelly bouverists revelations of white articles of nonintellectual nonpolitical nontopical underclothing while she nelly bouverist was in the articles fifthly the difficulties of the selection of appropriate music and humorous allusions from everybodys book of jokes  pages and a laugh in every one sixthly the rhymes homophonous and cacophonous associated with the names of the new lord mayor daniel tallon the new high sheriff thomas pile and the new solicitorgeneral dunbar plunket barton
what relation existed between their ages
 years before in  when bloom was of stephens present age stephen was 
 years after in  when stephen would be of blooms present age bloom would be 
in  when bloom would be  and stephen  their ages initially in the ratio of  to  would be as   to   the proportion increasing and the disparity diminishing according as arbitrary future years were added for if the proportion existing in  had continued immutable conceiving that to be possible till then  when stephen was  bloom would be  and in  when stephen would be  as bloom then was bloom would be  while in  when stephen would have attained the maximum postdiluvian age of  bloom being  years alive having been born in the year  would have surpassed by  years the maximum antediluvian age that of methusalah  years while if stephen would continue to live until he would attain that age in the year  ad bloom would have been obliged to have been alive  years having been obliged to have been born in the year  bc
what events might nullify these calculations
the cessation of existence of both or either the inauguration of a new era or calendar the annihilation of the world and consequent extermination of the human species inevitable but impredictable
how many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance
two
the first in the lilacgarden of matthew dillons house medina villa kimmage road roundtown in  in the company of stephens mother stephen being then of the age of  and reluctant to give his hand in salutation
the second in the coffeeroom of breslins hotel on a rainy sunday in the january of  in the company of stephens father and stephens granduncle stephen being then  years older
did bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son and afterwards seconded by the father
very gratefully with grateful appreciation with sincere appreciative gratitude in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret he declined
did their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences reveal a third connecting link between them
mrs riordan dante a widow of independent means had resided in the house of stephens parents from  september  to  december  and had also resided during the years   and  in the city arms hotel owned by elizabeth odowd of  prussia street where during parts of the years  and  she had been a constant informant of bloom who resided also in the same hotel being at that time a clerk in the employment of joseph cuffe of  smithfield for the superintendence of sales in the adjacent dublin cattle market on the north circular road
had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her
he had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings an infirm widow of independent if limited means in her convalescent bathchair with slow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the north circular road opposite mr gavin lows place of business where she had remained for a certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular fieldglasses unrecognisable citizens on tramcars roadster bicycles equipped with inflated pneumatic tyres hackney carriages tandems private and hired landaus dogcarts ponytraps and brakes passing from the city to the phoenix park and vice versa
why could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity
because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel of bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with continual changes of the thoroughfare without pedestrians quadrupeds velocipedes vehicles passing slowly quickly evenly round and round and round the rim of a round and round precipitous globe
what distinct different memories had each of her now eight years deceased
the older her bezique cards and counters her skye terrier her suppositious wealth her lapses of responsiveness and incipient catarrhal deafness the younger her lamp of colza oil before the statue of the immaculate conception her green and maroon brushes for charles stewart parnell and for michael davitt her tissue papers
were there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenation which these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the more desirable
the indoor exercises formerly intermittently practised subsequently abandoned prescribed in eugen sandows physical strength and how to obtain it which designed particularly for commercial men engaged in sedentary occupations were to be made with mental concentration in front of a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of muscles and produce successively a pleasant rigidity a more pleasant relaxation and the most pleasant repristination of juvenile agility
had any special agility been his in earlier youth
though ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full circle gyration beyond his courage yet as a high school scholar he had excelled in his stable and protracted execution of the half lever movement on the parallel bars in consequence of his abnormally developed abdominal muscles
did either openly allude to their racial difference
neither
what reduced to their simplest reciprocal form were blooms thoughts about stephens thoughts about bloom and about stephens thoughts about blooms thoughts about stephen
he thought that he thought that he was a jew whereas he knew that he knew that he knew that he was not
what the enclosures of reticence removed were their respective parentages
bloom only born male transubstantial heir of rudolf virag subsequently rudolph bloom of szombathely vienna budapest milan london and dublin and of ellen higgins second daughter of julius higgins born karoly and fanny higgins born hegarty
stephen eldest surviving male consubstantial heir of simon dedalus of cork and dublin and of mary daughter of richard and christina goulding born grier
had bloom and stephen been baptised and where and by whom cleric or layman
bloom three times by the reverend mr gilmer johnston m a alone in the protestant church of saint nicholas without coombe by james oconnor philip gilligan and james fitzpatrick together under a pump in the village of swords and by the reverend charles malone c c in the church of the three patrons rathgar
stephen once by the reverend charles malone c c alone in the church of the three patrons rathgar
did they find their educational careers similar
substituting stephen for bloom stoom would have passed successively through a dames school and the high school
substituting bloom for stephen blephen would have passed successively through the preparatory junior middle and senior grades of the intermediate and through the matriculation first arts second arts and arts degree courses of the royal university
why did bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the university of life
because of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether this observation had or had not been already made by him to stephen or by stephen to him
what two temperaments did they individually represent
the scientific
the artistic
what proofs did bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was towards applied rather than towards pure science
certain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining in a state of supine repletion to aid digestion stimulated by his appreciation of the importance of inventions now common but once revolutionary for example the aeronautic parachute the reflecting telescope the spiral corkscrew the safety pin the mineral water siphon the canal lock with winch and sluice the suction pump
were these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of kindergarten
yes rendering obsolete popguns elastic airbladders games of hazard catapults
they comprised astronomical kaleidoscopes exhibiting the twelve constellations of the zodiac from aries to pisces miniature mechanical orreries arithmetical gelatine lozenges geometrical to correspond with zoological biscuits globemap playing balls historically costumed dolls
what also stimulated him in his cogitations
the financial success achieved by ephraim marks and charles a james the former by his d bazaar at  georges street south the latter at his  d shop and worlds fancy fair and waxwork exhibition at  henry street admission d children d and the infinite possibilities hitherto unexploited of the modern art of advertisement if condensed in triliteral monoideal symbols vertically of maximum visibility divined horizontally of maximum legibility deciphered and of magnetising efficacy to arrest involuntary attention to interest to convince to decide

which example did he adduce to induce stephen to deduce that originality though producing its own reward does not invariably conduce to success
his own ideated and rejected project of an illuminated showcart drawn by a beast of burden in which two smartly dressed girls were to be seated engaged in writing
what suggested scene was then constructed by stephen
solitary hotel in mountain pass

in sloping upright and backhands queens hotel queens hotel queens hotel
queens ho  what suggested scene was then reconstructed by bloom
the queens hotel ennis county clare where rudolph bloom rudolf virag died on the evening of the  june  at some hour unstated in consequence of an overdose of monkshood aconite selfadministered in the form of a neuralgic liniment composed of  parts of aconite liniment to  of chloroform liniment purchased by him at  am on the morning of  june  at the medical hall of francis dennehy  church street ennis after having though not in consequence of having purchased at  pm on the afternoon of  june  a new boater straw hat extra smart after having though not in consequence of having purchased at the hour and in the place aforesaid the toxin aforesaid at the general drapery store of james cullen  main street ennis
did he attribute this homonymity to information or coincidence or intuition
coincidence
did he depict the scene verbally for his guest to see
he preferred himself to see anothers face and listen to anothers words by which potential narration was realised and kinetic temperament relieved
did he see only a second coincidence in the second scene narrated to him described by the narrator as a pisgah sight of palestine or the parable of the plums
it with the preceding scene and with others unnarrated but existent by implication to which add essays on various subjects or moral apothegms eg
my favourite hero or procrastination is the thief of time composed during schoolyears seemed to him to contain in itself and in conjunction with the personal equation certain possibilities of financial social personal and sexual success whether specially collected and selected as model pedagogic themes of cent per cent merit for the use of preparatory and junior grade students or contributed in printed form following the precedent of philip beaufoy or doctor dick or heblons studies in blue to a publication of certified circulation and solvency or employed verbally as intellectual stimulation for sympathetic auditors tacitly appreciative of successful narrative and confidently augurative of successful achievement during the increasingly longer nights gradually following the summer solstice on the day but three following videlicet tuesday  june s aloysius gonzaga sunrise  am sunset  pm
which domestic problem as much as if not more than any other frequently engaged his mind
what to do with our wives
what had been his hypothetical singular solutions

what instances of deficient mental development in his wife inclined him in favour of the lastmentioned ninth solution
in disoccupied moments she had more than once covered a sheet of paper with signs and hieroglyphics which she stated were greek and irish and hebrew characters
she had interrogated constantly at varying intervals as to the correct method of writing the capital initial of the name of a city in canada quebec
she understood little of political complications internal or balance of power external
in calculating the addenda of bills she frequently had recourse to digital aid
after completion of laconic epistolary compositions she abandoned the implement of calligraphy in the encaustic pigment exposed to the corrosive action of copperas green vitriol and nutgall
unusual polysyllables of foreign origin she interpreted phonetically or by false analogy or by both metempsychosis met him pike hoses alias a mendacious person mentioned in sacred scripture
what compensated in the false balance of her intelligence for these and such deficiencies of judgment regarding persons places and things
the false apparent parallelism of all perpendicular arms of all balances proved true by construction
the counterbalance of her proficiency of judgment regarding one person proved true by experiment
how had he attempted to remedy this state of comparative ignorance
variously
by leaving in a conspicuous place a certain book open at a certain page by assuming in her when alluding explanatorily latent knowledge by open ridicule in her presence of some absent others ignorant lapse
with what success had he attempted direct instruction
she followed not all a part of the whole gave attention with interest comprehended with surprise with care repeated with greater difficulty remembered forgot with ease with misgiving reremembered rerepeated with error
what system had proved more effective
indirect suggestion implicating selfinterest
example
she disliked umbrella with rain he liked woman with umbrella she disliked new hat with rain he liked woman with new hat he bought new hat with rain she carried umbrella with new hat
accepting the analogy implied in his guests parable which examples of postexilic eminence did he adduce
three seekers of the pure truth moses of egypt moses maimonides author of more nebukim guide of the perplexed and moses mendelssohn of such eminence that from moses of egypt to moses mendelssohn there arose none like moses maimonides
what statement was made under correction by bloom concerning a fourth seeker of pure truth by name aristotle mentioned with permission by stephen
that the seeker mentioned had been a pupil of a rabbinical philosopher name uncertain
were other anapocryphal illustrious sons of the law and children of a selected or rejected race mentioned
felix bartholdy mendelssohn composer baruch spinoza philosopher mendoza pugilist ferdinand lassalle reformer duellist
what fragments of verse from the ancient hebrew and ancient irish languages were cited with modulations of voice and translation of texts by guest to host and by host to guest

by bloom kifeloch harimon rakatejch mbaad lzamatejch thy temple amid thy hair is as a slice of pomegranate
how was a glyphic comparison of the phonic symbols of both languages made in substantiation of the oral comparison
by juxtaposition
on the penultimate blank page of a book of inferior literary style entituled sweets of sin produced by bloom and so manipulated that its front cover came in contact with the surface of the table with a pencil supplied by stephen stephen wrote the irish characters for gee eh dee em simple and modified and bloom in turn wrote the hebrew characters ghimel aleph daleth and in the absence of mem a substituted qoph explaining their arithmetical values as ordinal and cardinal numbers videlicet    and 
was the knowledge possessed by both of each of these languages the extinct and the revived theoretical or practical
theoretical being confined to certain grammatical rules of accidence and syntax and practically excluding vocabulary
what points of contact existed between these languages and between the peoples who spoke them
the presence of guttural sounds diacritic aspirations epenthetic and servile letters in both languages their antiquity both having been taught on the plain of shinar  years after the deluge in the seminary instituted by fenius farsaigh descendant of noah progenitor of israel and ascendant of heber and heremon progenitors of ireland their archaeological genealogical hagiographical exegetical homiletic toponomastic historical and religious literatures comprising the works of rabbis and culdees torah talmud mischna and ghemara massor pentateuch book of the dun cow book of ballymote garland of howth book of kells their dispersal persecution survival and revival the isolation of their synagogical and ecclesiastical rites in ghetto s marys abbey and masshouse adam and eves tavern the proscription of their national costumes in penal laws and jewish dress acts the restoration in chanah david of zion and the possibility of irish political autonomy or devolution
what anthem did bloom chant partially in anticipation of that multiple ethnically irreducible consummation
kolod balejwaw pnimah      nefesch jehudi homijah
why was the chant arrested at the conclusion of this first distich
in consequence of defective mnemotechnic
how did the chanter compensate for this deficiency
by a periphrastic version of the general text
in what common study did their mutual reflections merge
the increasing simplification traceable from the egyptian epigraphic hieroglyphs to the greek and roman alphabets and the anticipation of modern stenography and telegraphic code in the cuneiform inscriptions semitic and the virgular quinquecostate ogham writing celtic
did the guest comply with his hosts request
doubly by appending his signature in irish and roman characters
what was stephens auditive sensation
he heard in a profound ancient male unfamiliar melody the accumulation of the past
what was blooms visual sensation
he saw in a quick young male familiar form the predestination of a future
what were stephens and blooms quasisimultaneous volitional quasisensations of concealed identities
visually stephens the traditional figure of hypostasis depicted by johannes damascenus lentulus romanus and epiphanius monachus as leucodermic sesquipedalian with winedark hair
auditively blooms the traditional accent of the ecstasy of catastrophe
what future careers had been possible for bloom in the past and with what exemplars
in the church roman anglican or nonconformist exemplars the very reverend john conmee s j the reverend t salmon d d provost of trinity college dr alexander j dowie
at the bar english or irish exemplars seymour bushe k c rufus isaacs k c on the stage modern or shakespearean exemplars charles wyndham high comedian osmond tearle   exponent of shakespeare
did the host encourage his guest to chant in a modulated voice a strange legend on an allied theme
reassuringly their place where none could hear them talk being secluded reassured the decocted beverages allowing for subsolid residual sediment of a mechanical mixture water plus sugar plus cream plus cocoa having been consumed
recite the first major part of this chanted legend
little harry hughes and his schoolfellows all      went out for to play ball
and the very first ball little harry hughes played      he drove it oer the jews garden wall
and the very second ball little harry hughes played      he broke the jews windows all
illustration  how did the son of rudolph receive this first part
with unmixed feeling
smiling a jew he heard with pleasure and saw the unbroken kitchen window
recite the second part minor of the legend
then out there came the jews daughter      and she all dressed in green
come back come back you pretty little boy      and play your ball again            i cant come back and i wont come back      without my schoolfellows all
for if my master he did hear      hed make it a sorry ball       she took him by the lilywhite hand      and led him along the hall      until she led him to a room      where none could hear him call
she took a penknife out of her pocket      and cut off his little head
and now hell play his ball no more      for he lies among the dead
illustration  how did the father of millicent receive this second part
with mixed feelings
unsmiling he heard and saw with wonder a jews daughter all dressed in green
condense stephens commentary
one of all the least of all is the victim predestined
once by inadvertence twice by design he challenges his destiny
it comes when he is abandoned and challenges him reluctant and as an apparition of hope and youth holds him unresisting
it leads him to a strange habitation to a secret infidel apartment and there implacable immolates him consenting
why was the host victim predestined sad
he wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him should by him not be told
why was the host reluctant unresisting still
in accordance with the law of the conservation of energy
why was the host secret infidel silent
he weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder the incitations of the hierarchy the superstition of the populace the propagation of rumour in continued fraction of veridicity the envy of opulence the influence of retaliation the sporadic reappearance of atavistic delinquency the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism hypnotic suggestion and somnambulism
from which if any of these mental or physical disorders was he not totally immune
from hypnotic suggestion once waking he had not recognised his sleeping apartment more than once waking he had been for an indefinite time incapable of moving or uttering sounds
from somnambulism once sleeping his body had risen crouched and crawled in the direction of a heatless fire and having attained its destination there curled unheated in night attire had lain sleeping
had this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member of his family
twice in holles street and in ontario terrace his daughter millicent milly at the ages of  and  years had uttered in sleep an exclamation of terror and had replied to the interrogations of two figures in night attire with a vacant mute expression
what other infantile memories had he of her
 june 
a querulous newborn female infant crying to cause and lessen congestion
a child renamed padney socks she shook with shocks her moneybox counted his three free moneypenny buttons one tloo tlee a doll a boy a sailor she cast away blond born of two dark she had blond ancestry remote a violation herr hauptmann hainau austrian army proximate a hallucination lieutenant mulvey british navy
what endemic characteristics were present
conversely the nasal and frontal formation was derived in a direct line of lineage which though interrupted would continue at distant intervals to more distant intervals to its most distant intervals
what memories had he of her adolescence
she relegated her hoop and skippingrope to a recess
on the dukes lawn entreated by an english visitor she declined to permit him to make and take away her photographic image objection not stated
on the south circular road in the company of elsa potter followed by an individual of sinister aspect she went half way down stamer street and turned abruptly back reason of change not stated
on the vigil of the th anniversary of her birth she wrote a letter from mullingar county westmeath making a brief allusion to a local student faculty and year not stated
did that first division portending a second division afflict him
less than he had imagined more than he had hoped
what second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly if differently
a temporary departure of his cat
why similarly why differently
similarly because actuated by a secret purpose the quest of a new male mullingar student or of a healing herb valerian
differently because of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the habitation
in other respects were their differences similar
in passivity in economy in the instinct of tradition in unexpectedness
as
inasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it for her cf neckarching cat
moreover on the free surface of the lake in stephens green amid inverted reflections of trees her uncommented spit describing concentric circles of waterrings indicated by the constancy of its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish cf mousewatching cat
again in order to remember the date combatants issue and consequences of a famous military engagement she pulled a plait of her hair cf earwashing cat
furthermore silly milly she dreamed of having had an unspoken unremembered conversation with a horse whose name had been joseph to whom which she had offered a tumblerful of lemonade which it he had appeared to have accepted cf hearthdreaming cat
hence in passivity in economy in the instinct of tradition in unexpectedness their differences were similar
in what way had he utilised gifts  an owl  a clock given as matrimonial auguries to interest and to instruct her
as object lessons to explain  the nature and habits of oviparous animals the possibility of aerial flight certain abnormalities of vision the secular process of imbalsamation  the principle of the pendulum exemplified in bob wheelgear and regulator the translation in terms of human or social regulation of the various positions of clockwise moveable indicators on an unmoving dial the exactitude of the recurrence per hour of an instant in each hour when the longer and the shorter indicator were at the same angle of inclination videlicet   minutes past each hour per hour in arithmetical progression
in what manners did she reciprocate
she remembered on the th anniversary of his birth she presented to him a breakfast moustachecup of imitation crown derby porcelain ware
she provided at quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases had been made by him not for her she showed herself attentive to his necessities anticipating his desires
she admired a natural phenomenon having been explained by him to her she expressed the immediate desire to possess without gradual acquisition a fraction of his science the moiety the quarter a thousandth part
what proposal did bloom diambulist father of milly somnambulist make to stephen noctambulist
to pass in repose the hours intervening between thursday proper and friday normal on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately above the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of his host and hostess
what various advantages would or might have resulted from a prolongation of such an extemporisation
for the guest security of domicile and seclusion of study
for the host rejuvenation of intelligence vicarious satisfaction
for the hostess disintegration of obsession acquisition of correct italian pronunciation
why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jews daughter
because the way to daughter led through mother the way to mother through daughter
to what inconsequent polysyllabic question of his host did the guest return a monosyllabic negative answer
if he had known the late mrs emily sinico accidentally killed at sydney parade railway station  october 
what inchoate corollary statement was consequently suppressed by the host
a statement explanatory of his absence on the occasion of the interment of mrs mary dedalus born goulding  june  vigil of the anniversary of the decease of rudolph bloom born virag
was the proposal of asylum accepted
promptly inexplicably with amicability gratefully it was declined
what exchange of money took place between host and guest
the former returned to the latter without interest a sum of money   one pound seven shillings sterling advanced by the latter to the former
what counterproposals were alternately advanced accepted modified declined restated in other terms reaccepted ratified reconfirmed
to inaugurate a prearranged course of italian instruction place the residence of the instructed
to inaugurate a course of vocal instruction place the residence of the instructress
to inaugurate a series of static semistatic and peripatetic intellectual dialogues places the residence of both speakers if both speakers were resident in the same place the ship hotel and tavern  lower abbey street w and e connery proprietors the national library of ireland  kildare street the national maternity hospital   and  holles street a public garden the vicinity of a place of worship a conjunction of two or more public thoroughfares the point of bisection of a right line drawn between their residences if both speakers were resident in different places
what rendered problematic for bloom the realisation of these mutually selfexcluding propositions
the irreparability of the past once at a performance of albert henglers circus in the rotunda rutland square dublin an intuitive particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring to a place in the auditorium where bloom solitary was seated and had publicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he bloom was his the clowns papa
the imprevidibility of the future once in the summer of  he bloom had marked a florin  with three notches on the milled edge and tendered it in payment of an account due to and received by j and t davy family grocers  charlemont mall grand canal for circulation on the waters of civic finance for possible circuitous or direct return
was the clown blooms son
no
had blooms coin returned
never
why would a recurrent frustration the more depress him
because at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to amend many social conditions the product of inequality and avarice and international animosity
he believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible eliminating these conditions
there remained the generic conditions imposed by natural as distinct from human law as integral parts of the human whole the necessity of destruction to procure alimentary sustenance the painful character of the ultimate functions of separate existence the agonies of birth and death the monotonous menstruation of simian and particularly human females extending from the age of puberty to the menopause inevitable accidents at sea in mines and factories certain very painful maladies and their resultant surgical operations innate lunacy and congenital criminality decimating epidemics catastrophic cataclysms which make terror the basis of human mentality seismic upheavals the epicentres of which are located in densely populated regions the fact of vital growth through convulsions of metamorphosis from infancy through maturity to decay
why did he desist from speculation
because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other more acceptable phenomena in the place of the less acceptable phenomena to be removed
did stephen participate in his dejection
he affirmed his significance as a conscious rational animal proceeding syllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rational reagent between a micro and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon the incertitude of the void
was this affirmation apprehended by bloom
not verbally
substantially
what comforted his misapprehension
that as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from the unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void
in what order of precedence with what attendant ceremony was the exodus from the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation effected
lighted candle in stick borne by bloom diaconal hat on ashplant borne by stephen  with what intonation secreto of what commemorative psalm
the th modus peregrinus in exitu isral de egypto domus jacob de populo barbaro
what did each do at the door of egress
bloom set the candlestick on the floor
stephen put the hat on his head
for what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress
for a cat
what spectacle confronted them when they first the host then the guest emerged silently doubly dark from obscurity by a passage from the rere of the house into the penumbra of the garden
the heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit
with what meditations did bloom accompany his demonstration to his companion of various constellations
meditations of evolution increasingly vaster of the moon invisible in incipient lunation approaching perigee of the infinite lattiginous scintillating uncondensed milky way discernible by daylight by an observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft  ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth of sirius alpha in canis maior  lightyears  miles distant and in volume  times the dimension of our planet of arcturus of the precession of equinoxes of orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and nebula in which  of our solar systems could be contained of moribund and of nascent new stars such as nova in  of our system plunging towards the constellation of hercules of the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars in reality evermoving wanderers from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with which the years threescore and ten of allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity
were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast
of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of the earth of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed in cavities of the earth beneath removable stones in hives and mounds of microbes germs bacteria bacilli spermatozoa of the incalculable trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single pinhead of the universe of human serum constellated with red and white bodies themselves universes of void space constellated with other bodies each in continuity its universe of divisible component bodies of which each was again divisible in divisions of redivisible component bodies dividends and divisors ever diminishing without actual division till if the progress were carried far enough nought nowhere was never reached
why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result
because some years previously in  when occupied with the problem of the quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a number computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such magnitude and of so many places eg the th power of the th power of  that the result having been obtained  closely printed volumes of  pages each of innumerable quires and reams of india paper would have to be requisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its printed integers of units tens hundreds thousands tens of thousands hundreds of thousands millions tens of millions hundreds of millions billions the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of every series containing succinctly the potentiality of being raised to the utmost kinetic elaboration of any power of any of its powers
did he find the problems of the inhabitability of the planets and their satellites by a race given in species and of the possible social and moral redemption of said race by a redeemer easier of solution
of a different order of difficulty
conscious that the human organism normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of  tons when elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity according as the line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was approximated from nasal hemorrhage impeded respiration and vertigo when proposing this problem for solution he had conjectured as a working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might subsist otherwise under martian mercurial veneral jovian saturnian neptunian or uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions though an apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to vanities to vanities of vanities and to all that is vanity
and the problem of possible redemption
the minor was proved by the major
which various features of the constellations were in turn considered
the various colours significant of various degrees of vitality white yellow crimson vermilion cinnabar their degrees of brilliancy their magnitudes revealed up to and including the th their positions the waggoners star walsingham way the chariot of david the annular cinctures of saturn the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns the interdependent gyrations of double suns the independent synchronous discoveries of galileo simon marius piazzi le verrier herschel galle the systematisations attempted by bode and kepler of cubes of distances and squares of times of revolution the almost infinite compressibility of hirsute comets and their vast elliptical egressive and reentrant orbits from perihelion to aphelion the sidereal origin of meteoric stones the libyan floods on mars about the period of the birth of the younger astroscopist the annual recurrence of meteoric showers about the period of the feast of s lawrence martyr  august the monthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon in her arms the posited influence of celestial on human bodies the appearance of a star st magnitude of exceeding brilliancy dominating by night and day a new luminous sun generated by the collision and amalgamation in incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns about the period of the birth of william shakespeare over delta in the recumbent neversetting constellation of cassiopeia and of a star nd magnitude of similar origin but of lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of the corona septentrionalis about the period of the birth of leopold bloom and of other stars of presumably similar origin which had effectively or presumably appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of andromeda about the period of the birth of stephen dedalus and in and from the constellation of auriga some years after the birth and death of rudolph bloom junior and in and from other constellations some years before or after the birth or death of other persons the attendant phenomena of eclipses solar and lunar from immersion to emersion abatement of wind transit of shadow taciturnity of winged creatures emergence of nocturnal or crepuscular animals persistence of infernal light obscurity of terrestrial waters pallor of human beings
his blooms logical conclusion having weighed the matter and allowing for possible error
that it was not a heaventree not a heavengrot not a heavenbeast not a heavenman
that it was a utopia there being no known method from the known to the unknown an infinity renderable equally finite by the suppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and of different magnitudes a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space remobilised in air a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a present before its probable spectators had entered actual present existence
was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle
indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the satellite of their planet
did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological influences upon sublunary disasters
it seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the nomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to verifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy the lake of dreams the sea of rains the gulf of dews the ocean of fecundity
what special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and woman
her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian generations her nocturnal predominance her satellitic dependence her luminary reflection her constancy under all her phases rising and setting by her appointed times waxing and waning the forced invariability of her aspect her indeterminate response to inaffirmative interrogation her potency over effluent and refluent waters her power to enamour to mortify to invest with beauty to render insane to incite to and aid delinquency the tranquil inscrutability of her visage the terribility of her isolated dominant implacable resplendent propinquity her omens of tempest and of calm the stimulation of her light her motion and her presence the admonition of her craters her arid seas her silence her splendour when visible her attraction when invisible
what visible luminous sign attracted blooms who attracted stephens gaze
in the second storey rere of his blooms house the light of a paraffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller blind supplied by frank ohara window blind curtain pole and revolving shutter manufacturer  aungier street
how did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible attractive person his wife marion molly bloom denoted by a visible splendid sign a lamp
with indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations with subdued affection and admiration with description with impediment with suggestion
both then were silent
silent each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal flesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces
were they indefinitely inactive
at stephens suggestion at blooms instigation both first stephen then bloom in penumbra urinated their sides contiguous their organs of micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual circumposition their gazes first blooms then stephens elevated to the projected luminous and semiluminous shadow
similarly
the trajectories of their first sequent then simultaneous urinations were dissimilar blooms longer less irruent in the incomplete form of the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter who in his ultimate year at high school  had been capable of attaining the point of greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the institution  scholars stephens higher more sibilant who in the ultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic consumption an insistent vesical pressure
what different problems presented themselves to each concerning the invisible audible collateral organ of the other
to bloom the problems of irritability tumescence rigidity reactivity dimension sanitariness pilosity
to stephen the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of jesus circumcised  january holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain from unnecessary servile work and the problem as to whether the divine prepuce the carnal bridal ring of the holy roman catholic apostolic church conserved in calcata were deserving of simple hyperduly or of the fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine excrescences as hair and toenails
what celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed
a star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament from vega in the lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the tress of berenice towards the zodiacal sign of leo
how did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal departer
by inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an unstable female lock obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and turning its wards from right to left withdrawing a bolt from its staple pulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and revealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress
how did they take leave one of the other in separation
standing perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its base the lines of their valedictory arms meeting at any point and forming any angle less than the sum of two right angles
what sound accompanied the union of their tangent the disunion of their respectively centrifugal and centripetal hands
the sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the bells in the church of saint george
what echoes of that sound were by both and each heard
by stephen       liliata rutilantium
turma circumdet
iubilantium te virginum
chorus excipiat
by bloom       heigho heigho      heigho heigho
where were the several members of the company which with bloom that day at the bidding of that peal had travelled from sandymount in the south to glasnevin in the north
martin cunningham in bed jack power in bed simon dedalus in bed ned lambert in bed tom kernan in bed joe hynes in bed john henry menton in bed bernard corrigan in bed patsy dignam in bed paddy dignam in the grave
alone what did bloom hear
the double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth the double vibration of a jews harp in the resonant lane
alone what did bloom feel
the cold of interstellar space thousands of degrees below freezing point or the absolute zero of fahrenheit centigrade or raumur the incipient intimations of proximate dawn
of what did bellchime and handtouch and footstep and lonechill remind him
of companions now in various manners in different places defunct percy apjohn killed in action modder river philip gilligan phthisis jervis street hospital matthew f kane accidental drowning dublin bay philip moisel pyemia heytesbury street michael hart phthisis mater misericordiae hospital patrick dignam apoplexy sandymount
what prospect of what phenomena inclined him to remain
the disparition of three final stars the diffusion of daybreak the apparition of a new solar disk
had he ever been a spectator of those phenomena
once in  after a protracted performance of charades in the house of luke doyle kimmage he had awaited with patience the apparition of the diurnal phenomenon seated on a wall his gaze turned in the direction of mizrach the east
he remembered the initial paraphenomena
more active air a matutinal distant cock ecclesiastical clocks at various points avine music the isolated tread of an early wayfarer the visible diffusion of the light of an invisible luminous body the first golden limb of the resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon
did he remain
with deep inspiration he returned retraversing the garden reentering the passage reclosing the door
with brief suspiration he reassumed the candle reascended the stairs reapproached the door of the front room hallfloor and reentered
what suddenly arrested his ingress
the right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into contact with a solid timber angle where an infinitesimal but sensible fraction of a second later a painful sensation was located in consequence of antecedent sensations transmitted and registered
describe the alterations effected in the disposition of the articles of furniture
a sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite the door to the ingleside near the compactly furled union jack an alteration which he had frequently intended to execute the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the door in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa the walnut sideboard a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress had been moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but more perilous position in front of the door two chairs had been moved from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally occupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table
describe them
one a squat stuffed easychair with stout arms extended and back slanted to the rere which repelled in recoil had then upturned an irregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply upholstered seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing discolouration
the other a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane curves placed directly opposite the former its frame from top to seat and from seat to base being varnished dark brown its seat being a bright circle of white plaited rush
what significances attached to these two chairs
significances of similitude of posture of symbolism of circumstantial evidence of testimonial supermanence
what occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard
a vertical piano cadby with exposed keyboard its closed coffin supporting a pair of long yellow ladies gloves and an emerald ashtray containing four consumed matches a partly consumed cigarette and two discoloured ends of cigarettes its musicrest supporting the music in the key of g natural for voice and piano of loves old sweet song words by g clifton bingham composed by j l molloy sung by madam antoinette sterling open at the last page with the final indications ad libitum forte pedal animato sustained pedal ritirando close
with what sensations did bloom contemplate in rotation these objects
with strain elevating a candlestick with pain feeling on his right temple a contused tumescence with attention focussing his gaze on a large dull passive and a slender bright active with solicitation bending and downturning the upturned rugfringe with amusement remembering dr malachi mulligans scheme of colour containing the gradation of green with pleasure repeating the words and antecedent act and perceiving through various channels of internal sensibility the consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual discolouration
his next proceeding
from an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black diminutive cone one inch in height placed it on its circular base on a small tin plate placed his candlestick on the right corner of the mantelpiece produced from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus illustrated entitled agendath netaim unfolded the same examined it superficially rolled it into a thin cylinder ignited it in the candleflame applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the latter reached the stage of rutilance placed the cylinder in the basin of the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to facilitate total combustion
what followed this operation
the truncated conical crater summit of the diminutive volcano emitted a vertical and serpentine fume redolent of aromatic oriental incense
what homothetic objects other than the candlestick stood on the mantelpiece
a timepiece of striated connemara marble stopped at the hour of  am on the  march  matrimonial gift of matthew dillon a dwarf tree of glacial arborescence under a transparent bellshade matrimonial gift of luke and caroline doyle an embalmed owl matrimonial gift of alderman john hooper
what interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and bloom
in the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the dwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl
before the mirror the matrimonial gift of alderman john hooper with a clear melancholy wise bright motionless compassionate gaze regarded bloom while bloom with obscure tranquil profound motionless compassionated gaze regarded the matrimonial gift of luke and caroline doyle
what composite asymmetrical image in the mirror then attracted his attention
the image of a solitary ipsorelative mutable aliorelative man
why solitary ipsorelative
brothers and sisters had he none
yet that mans father was his grandfathers son
why mutable aliorelative
from infancy to maturity he had resembled his maternal procreatrix
from maturity to senility he would increasingly resemble his paternal procreator
what final visual impression was communicated to him by the mirror
the optical reflection of several inverted volumes improperly arranged and not in the order of their common letters with scintillating titles on the two bookshelves opposite

what reflections occupied his mind during the process of reversion of the inverted volumes
the necessity of order a place for everything and everything in its place the deficient appreciation of literature possessed by females the incongruity of an apple incuneated in a tumbler and of an umbrella inclined in a closestool the insecurity of hiding any secret document behind beneath or between the pages of a book
which volume was the largest in bulk

why firstly and secondly did he not consult the work in question
firstly in order to exercise mnemotechnic secondly because after an interval of amnesia when seated at the central table about to consult the work in question he remembered by mnemotechnic the name of the military engagement plevna
what caused him consolation in his sitting posture
the candour nudity pose tranquility youth grace sex counsel of a statue erect in the centre of the table an image of narcissus purchased by auction from p a wren  bachelors walk
what caused him irritation in his sitting posture
inhibitory pressure of collar size  and waistcoat  buttons two articles of clothing superfluous in the costume of mature males and inelastic to alterations of mass by expansion
how was the irritation allayed
he removed his collar with contained black necktie and collapsible stud from his neck to a position on the left of the table
he unbuttoned successively in reversed direction waistcoat trousers shirt and vest along the medial line of irregular incrispated black hairs extending in triangular convergence from the pelvic basin over the circumference of the abdomen and umbilicular fossicle along the medial line of nodes to the intersection of the sixth pectoral vertebrae thence produced both ways at right angles and terminating in circles described about two equidistant points right and left on the summits of the mammary prominences
he unbraced successively each of six minus one braced trouser buttons arranged in pairs of which one incomplete
what involuntary actions followed

did the process of divestiture continue
sensible of a benignant persistent ache in his footsoles he extended his foot to one side and observed the creases protuberances and salient points caused by foot pressure in the course of walking repeatedly in several different directions then inclined he disnoded the laceknots unhooked and loosened the laces took off each of his two boots for the second time detached the partially moistened right sock through the fore part of which the nail of his great toe had again effracted raised his right foot and having unhooked a purple elastic sock suspender took off his right sock placed his unclothed right foot on the margin of the seat of his chair picked at and gently lacerated the protruding part of the great toenail raised the part lacerated to his nostrils and inhaled the odour of the quick then with satisfaction threw away the lacerated ungual fragment
why with satisfaction

blooms acts
he deposited the articles of clothing on a chair removed his remaining articles of clothing took from beneath the bolster at the head of the bed a folded long white nightshirt inserted his head and arms into the proper apertures of the nightshirt removed a pillow from the head to the foot of the bed prepared the bedlinen accordingly and entered the bed
how
with circumspection as invariably when entering an abode his own or not his own with solicitude the snakespiral springs of the mattress being old the brass quoits and pendent viper radii loose and tremulous under stress and strain prudently as entering a lair or ambush of lust or adders lightly the less to disturb reverently the bed of conception and of birth of consummation of marriage and of breach of marriage of sleep and of death
what did his limbs when gradually extended encounter
new clean bedlinen additional odours the presence of a human form female hers the imprint of a human form male not his some crumbs some flakes of potted meat recooked which he removed
if he had smiled why would he have smiled
to reflect that each one who enters imagines himself to be the first to enter whereas he is always the last term of a preceding series even if the first term of a succeeding one each imagining himself to be first last only and alone whereas he is neither first nor last nor only nor alone in a series originating in and repeated to infinity
what preceding series
assuming mulvey to be the first term of his series penrose bartell darcy professor goodwin julius mastiansky john henry menton father bernard corrigan a farmer at the royal dublin societys horse show maggot oreilly matthew dillon valentine blake dillon lord mayor of dublin christopher callinan lenehan an italian organgrinder an unknown gentleman in the gaiety theatre benjamin dollard simon dedalus andrew pisser burke joseph cuffe wisdom hely alderman john hooper dr francis brady father sebastian of mount argus a bootblack at the general post office hugh e blazes boylan and so each and so on to no last term
what were his reflections concerning the last member of this series and late occupant of the bed
reflections on his vigour a bounder corporal proportion a billsticker commercial ability a bester impressionability a boaster
why for the observer impressionability in addition to vigour corporal proportion and commercial ability

with what antagonistic sentiments were his subsequent reflections affected
envy jealousy abnegation equanimity
envy
of a bodily and mental male organism specially adapted for the superincumbent posture of energetic human copulation and energetic piston and cylinder movement necessary for the complete satisfaction of a constant but not acute concupiscence resident in a bodily and mental female organism passive but not obtuse
jealousy
because a nature full and volatile in its free state was alternately the agent and reagent of attraction
because attraction between agents and reagents at all instants varied with inverse proportion of increase and decrease with incessant circular extension and radial reentrance

by what reflections did he a conscious reactor against the void of incertitude justify to himself his sentiments
the preordained frangibility of the hymen the presupposed intangibility of the thing in itself the incongruity and disproportion between the selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and the selfabbreviating relaxation of the thing done the fallaciously inferred debility of the female the muscularity of the male the variations of ethical codes the natural grammatical transition by inversion involving no alteration of sense of an aorist preterite proposition parsed as masculine subject monosyllabic onomatopoeic transitive verb with direct feminine object from the active voice into its correlative aorist preterite proposition parsed as feminine subject auxiliary verb and quasimonosyllabic onomatopoeic past participle with complementary masculine agent in the passive voice the continued product of seminators by generation the continual production of semen by distillation the futility of triumph or protest or vindication the inanity of extolled virtue the lethargy of nescient matter the apathy of the stars
in what final satisfaction did these antagonistic sentiments and reflections reduced to their simplest forms converge
satisfaction at the ubiquity in eastern and western terrestrial hemispheres in all habitable lands and islands explored or unexplored the land of the midnight sun the islands of the blessed the isles of greece the land of promise of adipose anterior and posterior female hemispheres redolent of milk and honey and of excretory sanguine and seminal warmth reminiscent of secular families of curves of amplitude insusceptible of moods of impression or of contrarieties of expression expressive of mute immutable mature animality

going to dark bed there was a square round sinbad the sailor rocs auks egg in the night of the bed of all the auks of the rocs of darkinbad the brightdayler
where
          yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the city arms hotel when he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his highness to make himself interesting for that old faggot mrs riordan that he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing all for masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was actually afraid to lay out d for her methylated spirit telling me all her ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and earthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first god help the world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and lownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them i suppose she was pious because no man would look at her twice i hope ill never be like her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a welleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about mr riordan here and mr riordan there i suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her dog smelling my fur and always edging to get up under my petticoats especially then still i like that in him polite to old women like that and waiters and beggars too hes not proud out of nothing but not always if ever he got anything really serious the matter with him its much better for them to go into a hospital where everything is clean but i suppose id have to dring it into him for a month yes and then wed have a hospital nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying there till they throw him out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as much a nun as im not yes because theyre so weak and puling when theyre sick they want a woman to get well if his nose bleeds youd think it was o tragic and that dyinglooking one off the south circular when he sprained his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf mountain the day i wore that dress miss stack bringing him flowers the worst old ones she could find at the bottom of the basket anything at all to get into a mans bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying on account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more like a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same besides i hate bandaging and dosing when he cut his toe with the razor paring his corns afraid hed get bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing i was sick then wed see what attention only of course the woman hides it not to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhere im sure by his appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her so either it was one of those night women if it was down there he was really and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it planning it hynes kept me who did i meet ah yes i met do you remember menton and who else who let me see that big babbyface i saw him and he not long married flirting with a young girl at pooles myriorama and turned my back on him when he slinked out looking quite conscious what harm but he had the impudence to make up to me one time well done to him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all the big stupoes i ever met and thats called a solicitor only for i hate having a long wrangle in bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as well as i do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a letter when i came into the front room to show him dignams death in the paper as if something told me and he covered it up with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is now so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that i care two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way though id like to find out so long as i dont have the two of them under my nose all the time like that slut that mary we had in ontario terrace padding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell of those painted women off him once or twice i had a suspicion by getting him to come near me when i found the long hair on his coat without that one when i went into the kitchen pretending he was drinking water  woman is not enough for them it was all his fault of course ruining servants then proposing that she could eat at our table on christmas day if you please o no thank you not in my house stealing my potatoes and the oysters  per doz going out to see her aunt if you please common robbery so it was but i was sure he had something on with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you have no proof it was her proof o yes her aunt was very fond of oysters but i told her what i thought of her suggesting me to go out to be alone with her i wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters i found in her room the friday she was out that was enough for me a little bit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when i gave her her weeks notice i saw to that better do without them altogether do out the rooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out the dirt i gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house i couldnt even touch him if i thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar and sloven like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the place in the w c too because she knew she was too well off yes because he couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere and the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night boylan gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the tolka in my hand there steals another i just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb to squeeze back singing the young may moon shes beaming love because he has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said im dining out and going to the gaiety though im not going to give him the satisfaction in any case god knows hes a change in a way not to be always and ever wearing the same old hat unless i paid some nicelooking boy to do it since i cant do it myself a young boy would like me id confuse him a little alone with him if we were id let him see my garters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him seduce him i know what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that frigging drawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this that and the other with the coalman yes with a bishop yes i would because i told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in the jews temples gardens when i was knitting that woollen thing a stranger to dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and he tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it tell me his name who tell me who the german emperor is it yes imagine im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the world about it people make its only the first time after that its just the ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man without going and marrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself i wish some man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul almost paralyses you then i hate that confession when i used to go to father corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did where and i said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person my child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where you sit down yes o lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put it i forget no father and i always think of the real father what did he want to know for when i already confessed it to god he had a nice fat hand the palm moist always i wouldnt mind feeling it neither would he id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar i wonder did he know me in the box i could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them id like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre married hes too careful about himself then give something to h h the pope for a penance i wonder was he satisfied with me one thing i didnt like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall though i laughed im not a horse or an ass am i i suppose he was thinking of his fathers i wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am i in it who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they stick their bills up with some liqueur id like to sip those richlooking green and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with the opera hats i tasted once with my finger dipped out of that american that had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took the port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because i felt lovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment i popped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up god be merciful to us i thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when i blessed myself and said a hail mary like those awful thunderbolts in gibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and tell you theres no god what could you do if it was running and rushing about nothing only make an act of contrition the candle i lit that evening in whitefriars street chapel for the month of may see it brought its luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to church mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only grey matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when i lit the lamp because he must have come  or  times with that tremendous big red brute of a thing he has i thought the vein or whatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is not so big after i took off all my things with the blinds down after my hours dressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a thick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters i think a few dozen he was in great singing voice no i never in all my life felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must have eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with a big hole in the middle of us or like a stallion driving it up into you because thats all they want out of you with that determined vicious look in his eye i had to halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a tremendous amount of spunk in him when i made him pull out and do it on me considering how big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt washed out properly the last time i let him finish it in me nice invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but if someone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what i went through with milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and mina purefoys husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up with a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a smell of children off her the one they called budgers or something like a nigger with a shock of hair on it jesusjack the child is a black the last time i was there a squad of them falling over one another and bawling you couldnt hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied till they have us swollen out like elephants or i dont know what supposing i risked having another not off him though still if he was married im sure hed have a fine strong child but i dont know poldy has more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly i suppose it was meeting josie powell and the funeral and thinking about me and boylan set him off well he can think what he likes now if thatll do him any good i know they were spooning a bit when i came on the scene he was dancing and sitting out with her the night of georgina simpsons housewarming and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account of not liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup row over politics he began it not me when he said about our lord being a carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive about everything i was fuming with myself after for giving in only for i knew he was gone on me and the first socialist he said he was he annoyed me so much i couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot of mixedup things especially about the body and the inside i often wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family physician i could always hear his voice talking when the room was crowded and watch him after that i pretended i had a coolness on with her over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going to and i said over to floey and he made me the present of byrons poems and the three pairs of gloves so that finished that i could quite easily get him to make it up any time i know how id even supposing he got in with her again and was going out to see her somewhere id know if he refused to eat the onions i know plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch him with my veil and gloves on going out  kiss then would send them all spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she of course would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him that i wouldnt so much mind id just go to her and ask her do you love him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might imagine he was and make a declaration to her with his plabbery kind of a manner like he did to me though i had the devils own job to get it out of him though i liked him for that it showed he could hold in and wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the night in the kitchen i was rolling the potato cake theres something i want to say to you only for i put him off letting on i was in a temper with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case i let out too much the night before talking of dreams so i didnt want to let him know more than was good for him she used to be always embracing me josie whenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and when i said i washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did you wash possible the women are always egging on to that putting it on thick when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the indifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what spoils him i dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at that time trying to look like lord byron i said i liked though he was too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged afterwards though she didnt like it so much the day i was in fits of laughing with the giggles i couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling out one after another with the mass of hair i had youre always in great humour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it meant because i used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault she didnt darken the door much after we were married i wonder what shes got like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time i saw her she must have been just after a row with him because i saw on the moment she was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk about him to run him down what was it she told me o yes that sometimes he used to go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him just imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that that might murder you any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes mad poldy anyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when he comes in wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he always takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and now hes going about in his slippers to look for   for a postcard u p up o sweetheart may wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff to extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what could you make of a man like that id rather die  times over than marry another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like me to put up with him the way i do know me come sleep with me yes and he knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that mrs maybrick that poisoned her husband for what i wonder in love with some other man yes it was found out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and do a thing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating drive you mad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask us to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because they cant get on without us white arsenic she put in his tea off flypaper wasnt it i wonder why they call it that if i asked him hed say its from the greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have been madly in love with the other fellow to run the chance of being hanged o she didnt care if that was her nature what could she do besides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they  theyre all so different boylan talking about the shape of my foot he noticed at once even before he was introduced when i was in the d b c with poldy laughing and trying to listen i was waggling my foot we both ordered  teas and plain bread and butter i saw him looking with his two old maids of sisters when i stood up and asked the girl where it was what do i care with it dropping out of me and that black closed breeches he made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting all myself always with some brandnew fad every other week such a long one i did i forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that i never got after some robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the irish times lost in the ladies lavatory d b c dame street finder return to mrs marion bloom and i saw his eyes on my feet going out through the turning door he was looking when i looked back and i went there for tea  days after in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him because i was crossing them when we were in the other room first he meant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that if i only had a ring with the stone for my month a nice aquamarine ill stick him for one and a gold bracelet i dont like my foot so much still i made him spend once with my foot the night after goodwins botchup of a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to mull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my stockings lying on the hearthrug in lombard street west and another time it was my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung i could find but of course hes not natural like the rest of the world that i what did he say i could give  points in  to katty lanner and beat her what does that mean i asked him i forget what he said because the stoppress edition just passed and the man with the curly hair in the lucan dairy thats so polite i think i saw his face before somewhere i noticed him when i was tasting the butter so i took my time bartell darcy too that he used to make fun of when he commenced kissing me on the choir stairs after i sang gounods ave maria what are we waiting for o my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown part he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too my low notes he was always raving about if you can believe him i liked the way he used his mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a place like that i dont see anything so terrible about it ill tell him about that some day not now and surprise him ay and ill take him there and show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like it or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an idea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got me so cheap as he did he was  times worse himself anyhow begging me to give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming along kenilworth square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and i had to take it off asking me questions is it permitted to enquire the shape of my bedroom so i let him keep it as if i forgot it to think of me when i saw him slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject of drawers thats plain to be seen always skeezing at those brazenfaced things on the bicycles with their skirts blowing up to their navels even when milly and i were out with him at the open air fete that one in the cream muslin standing right against the sun so he could see every atom she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain i saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner of the harolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in the zingari colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat looking slyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they can go and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on it and were not to ask any questions but they want to know where were you where are you going i could feel him coming along skulking after me his eyes on my neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it was getting too warm for him so i halfturned and stopped then he pestered me to say yes till i took off my glove slowly watching him he said my openwork sleeves were too cold for the rain anything for an excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers the whole blessed time till i promised to give him the pair off my doll to carry about in his waistcoat pocket o maria santisima he did look a big fool dreeping in the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat i had on with the sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in the wet if i didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new raincoat you never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for it if anyone was passing so i lifted them a bit and touched his trousers outside the way i used to gardner after with my ring hand to keep him from doing worse where it was too public i was dying to find out was he circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do everything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting all the time for his dinner he told me to say i left my purse in the butchers and had to go back for it what a deceiver then he wrote me that letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to any woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we met asking me have i offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw i wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool henny doyle he was always breaking or tearing something in the charades i hate an unlucky man and if i knew what it meant of course i had to say no for form sake dont understand you i said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it used to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in gibraltar with that word i couldnt find anywhere only for children seeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice a day i liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman when he sent me the  big poppies because mine was the th then i wrote the night he kissed my heart at dolphins barn i couldnt describe it simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to embrace well like gardner i hope hell come on monday as he said at the same time four i hate people who come at all hours answer the door you think its the vegetables then its somebody and you all undressed or the door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old frostyface goodwin called about the concert in lombard street and i just after dinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me professor i had to say im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in his way it was impossible to be more respectful nobody to say youre out you have to peep out through the blind like the messengerboy today i thought it was a putoff first him sending the port and the peaches first and i was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was trying to make a fool of me when i knew his tattarrattat at the door he must have been a bit late because it was  after  when i saw the  dedalus girls coming from school i never know the time even that watch he gave me never seems to go properly id want to get it looked after when i threw the penny to that lame sailor for england home and beauty when i was whistling there is a charming girl i love and i hadnt even put on my clean shift or powdered myself or a thing then this day week were to go to belfast just as well he has to go to ennis his fathers anniversary the th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms at the hotel were beside each other and any fooling went on in the new bed i couldnt tell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next room or perhaps some protestant clergyman with a cough knocking on the wall then hed never believe the next day we didnt do something its all very well a husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we never did anything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes going where he is besides something always happens with him the time going to the mallow concert at maryborough ordering boiling soup for the two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with the soup splashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and the waiter after him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion for the engine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two gentlemen in the rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was too hes so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a good job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd have taken us on to cork i suppose that was done out of revenge on him o i love jaunting in a train or a car with lovely soft cushions i wonder will he take a st class for me he might want to do it in the train by tipping the guard well o i suppose therell be the usual idiots of men gaping at us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly be that was an exceptional man that common workman that left us alone in the carriage that day going to howth id like to find out something about him  or  tunnels perhaps then you have to look out of the window all the nicer then coming back suppose i never came back what would they say eloped with him that gets you on on the stage the last concert i sang at where its over a year ago when was it st teresas hall clarendon st little chits of missies they have now singing kathleen kearney and her like on account of father being in the army and my singing the absentminded beggar and wearing a brooch for lord roberts when i had the map of it all and poldy not irish enough was it him managed it this time i wouldnt put it past him like he got me on to sing in the stabat mater by going around saying he was putting lead kindly light to music i put him up to that till the jesuits found out he was a freemason thumping the piano lead thou me on copied from some old opera yes and he was going about with some of them sinner fein lately or whatever they call themselves talking his usual trash and nonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck is very intelligent the coming man griffiths is he well he doesnt look it thats all i can say still it must have been him he knew there was a boycott i hate the mention of their politics after the war that pretoria and ladysmith and bloemfontein where gardner lieut stanley g th bn nd east lancs rgt of enteric fever he was a lovely fellow in khaki and just the right height over me im sure he was brave too he said i was lovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock my irish beauty he was pale with excitement about going away or wed be seen from the road he couldnt stand properly and i so hot as i never felt they could have made their peace in the beginning or old oom paul and the rest of the other old krugers go and fight it out between them instead of dragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were with their fever if he was even decently shot it wouldnt have been so bad i love to see a regiment pass in review the first time i saw the spanish cavalry at la roque it was lovely after looking across the bay from algeciras all the lights of the rock like fireflies or those sham battles on the  acres the black watch with their kilts in time at the march past the th hussars the prince of wales own or the lancers o the lancers theyre grand or the dublins that won tugela his father made his money over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me a nice present up in belfast after what i gave him theyve lovely linen up there or one of those nice kimono things i must buy a mothball like i had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting going round with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the knuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or tell the police on me but theyd think were married o let them all go and smother themselves for the fat lot i care he has plenty of money and hes not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if i could find out whether he likes me i looked a bit washy of course when i looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the expression besides scrooching down on me like that all the time with his big hipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat always having to lie down for them better for him put it into me from behind the way mrs mastiansky told me her husband made her like the dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so quiet and mild with his tingating cither can you ever be up to men the way it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish tie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly welloff i know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he was like a perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back with the stoppress tearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost  quid he said he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for me on account of lenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits that sponger he was making free with me after the glencree dinner coming back that long joult over the featherbed mountain after the lord mayor looking at me with his dirty eyes val dillon that big heathen i first noticed him at dessert when i was cracking the nuts with my teeth i wished i could have picked every morsel of that chicken out of my fingers it was so tasty and browned and as tender as anything only for i didnt want to eat everything on my plate those forks and fishslicers were hallmarked silver too i wish i had some i could easily have slipped a couple into my muff when i was playing with them then always hanging out of them for money in a restaurant for the bit you put down your throat we have to be thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself as a great compliment to be noticed the way the world is divided in any case if its going to go on i want at least two other good chemises for one thing and but i dont know what kind of drawers he likes none at all i think didnt he say yes and half the girls in gibraltar never wore them either naked as god made them that andalusian singing her manola she didnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the second pair of silkette stockings is laddered after one days wear i could have brought them back to lewers this morning and kicked up a row and made that one change them only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into him and ruining the whole thing and one of those kidfitting corsets id want advertised cheap in the gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips he saved the one i have but thats no good what did they say they give a delightful figure line  obviating that unsightly broad appearance across the lower back to reduce flesh my belly is a bit too big ill have to knock off the stout at dinner or am i getting too fond of it the last they sent from orourkes was as flat as a pancake he makes his money easy larry they call him the old mangy parcel he sent at xmas a cottage cake and a bottle of hogwash he tried to palm off as claret that he couldnt get anyone to drink god spare his spit for fear hed die of the drouth or i must do a few breathing exercises i wonder is that antifat any good might overdo it the thin ones are not so much the fashion now garters that much i have the violet pair i wore today thats all he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first o no there was the face lotion i finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like new i told him over and over again get that made up in the same place and dont forget it god only knows whether he did after all i said to him ill know by the bottle anyway if not i suppose ill only have to wash in my piss like beeftea or chickensoup with some of that opoponax and violet i thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the skin underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger after the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry handkerchiefs about  in all sure you cant get on in this world without style all going in food and rent when i get it ill lash it around i tell you in fine style i always want to throw a handful of tea into the pot measuring and mincing if i buy a pair of old brogues itself do you like those new shoes yes were they ive no clothes at all the brown costume and the skirt and jacket and the one at the cleaners  whats that for any woman cutting up this old hat and patching up the other the men wont look at you and women try to walk on you because they know youve no man then with all the things getting dearer every day for the  years more i have of life up to  no im what am i at all ill be  in september will i what o well look at that mrs galbraith shes much older than me i saw her when i was out last week her beautys on the wane she was a lovely woman magnificent head of hair on her down to her waist tossing it back like that like kitty oshea in grantham street st thing i did every morning to look across see her combing it as if she loved it and was full of it pity i only got to know her the day before we left and that mrs langtry the jersey lily the prince of wales was in love with i suppose hes like the first man going the roads only for the name of a king theyre all made the one way only a black mans id like to try a beauty up to what was she  there was some funny story about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster knife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and the prince of wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing like that like some of those books he brings me the works of master francois somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her ear because her bumgut fell out a nice word for any priest to write and her ae as if any fool wouldnt know what that meant i hate that pretending of all things with that old blackguards face on him anybody can see its not true and that ruby and fair tyrants he brought me that twice i remember when i came to page  the part about where she hangs him up out of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres nothing for a woman in that all invention made up about he drinking the champagne out of her slipper after the ball was over like the infant jesus in the crib at inchicore in the blessed virgins arms sure no woman could have a child that big taken out of her and i thought first it came out of her side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and she a rich lady of course she felt honoured h r h he was in gibraltar the year i was born i bet he found lilies there too where he planted the tree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me too if hed come a bit sooner then i wouldnt be here as i am he ought to chuck that freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it and go into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank where they could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day of course he prefers plottering about the house so you cant stir with him any side whats your programme today i wish hed even smoke a pipe like father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching about for advertisements when he could have been in mr cuffes still only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up i could have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great mirada once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly mrs bloom only i felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that i lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming into fashion again i bought it simply to please him i knew it was no good by the finish pity i changed my mind of going to todd and burns as i said and not lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a lot of trash i hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and cooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if i went by his advices every blessed hat i put on does that suit me yes take that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles off my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my backside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in grafton street i had the misfortune to bring him into and she as insolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying im afraid were giving you too much trouble what shes there for but i stared it out of her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second time he looked poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but i could see him looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for me it was nice of him to show me out in any case im extremely sorry mrs bloom believe me without making it too marked the first time after him being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife i just half smiled i know my chest was out that way at the door when he said im extremely sorry and im sure you were  yes i think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he made me thirsty titties he calls them i had to laugh yes this one anyhow stiff the nipple gets for the least thing ill get him to keep that up and ill take those eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out for him what are all those veins and things curious the way its made  the same in case of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up there like those statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide it with her hand are they so beautiful of course compared with what a man looks like with his two bags full and his other thing hanging down out of him or sticking up at you like a hatrack no wonder they hide it with a cabbageleaf that disgusting cameron highlander behind the meat market or that other wretch with the red head behind the tree where the statue of the fish used to be when i was passing pretending he was pissing standing out for me to see it with his babyclothes up to one side the queens own they were a nice lot its well the surreys relieved them theyre always trying to show it to you every time nearly i passed outside the mens greenhouse near the harcourt street station just to try some fellow or other trying to catch my eye as if it was  of the  wonders of the world o and the stink of those rotten places the night coming home with poldy after the comerfords party oranges and lemonade to make you feel nice and watery i went into  of them it was so biting cold i couldnt keep it when was that  the canal was frozen yes it was a few months after a pity a couple of the camerons werent there to see me squatting in the mens place meadero i tried to draw a picture of it before i tore it up like a sausage or something i wonder theyre not afraid going about of getting a kick or a bang of something there the woman is beauty of course thats admitted when he said i could pose for a picture naked to some rich fellow in holles street when he lost the job in helys and i was selling the clothes and strumming in the coffee palace would i be like that bath of the nymph with my hair down yes only shes younger or im a little like that dirty bitch in that spanish photo he has nymphs used they go about like that i asked him about her and that word met something with hoses in it and he came out with some jawbreakers about the incarnation he never can explain a thing simply the way a body can understand then he goes and burns the bottom out of the pan all for his kidney this one not so much theres the mark of his teeth still where he tried to bite the nipple i had to scream out arent they fearful trying to hurt you i had a great breast of milk with milly enough for two what was the reason of that he said i could have got a pound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning that delicate looking student that stopped in no  with the citrons penrose nearly caught me washing through the window only for i snapped up the towel to my face that was his studenting hurt me they used to weaning her till he got doctor brady to give me the belladonna prescription i had to get him to suck them they were so hard he said it was sweeter and thicker than cows then he wanted to milk me into the tea well hes beyond everything i declare somebody ought to put him in the budget if i only could remember the one half of the things and write a book out of it the works of master poldy yes and its so much smoother the skin much an hour he was at them im sure by the clock like some kind of a big infant i had at me they want everything in their mouth all the pleasure those men get out of a woman i can feel his mouth o lord i must stretch myself i wished he was here or somebody to let myself go with and come again like that i feel all fire inside me or if i could dream it when he made me spend the nd time tickling me behind with his finger i was coming for about  minutes with my legs round him i had to hug him after o lord i wanted to shout out all sorts of things fuck or shit or anything at all only not to look ugly or those lines from the strain who knows the way hed take it you want to feel your way with a man theyre not all like him thank god some of them want you to be so nice about it i noticed the contrast he does it and doesnt talk i gave my eyes that look with my hair a bit loose from the tumbling and my tongue between my lips up to him the savage brute thursday friday one saturday two sunday three o lord i cant wait till monday  frseeeeeeeefronnnng train somewhere whistling the strength those engines have in them like big giants and the water rolling all over and out of them all sides like the end of loves old sweeeetsonnnng the poor men that have to be out all the night from their wives and families in those roasting engines stifling it was today im glad i burned the half of those old freemans and photo bits leaving things like that lying about hes getting very careless and threw the rest of them up in the w c ill get him to cut them tomorrow for me instead of having them there for the next year to get a few pence for them have him asking wheres last januarys paper and all those old overcoats i bundled out of the hall making the place hotter than it is that rain was lovely and refreshing just after my beauty sleep i thought it was going to get like gibraltar my goodness the heat there before the levanter came on black as night and the glare of the rock standing up in it like a big giant compared with their  rock mountain they think is so great with the red sentries here and there the poplars and they all whitehot and the smell of the rainwater in those tanks watching the sun all the time weltering down on you faded all that lovely frock fathers friend mrs stanhope sent me from the b marche paris what a shame my dearest doggerina she wrote on it she was very nice whats this her other name was just a p c to tell you i sent the little present have just had a jolly warm bath and feel a very clean dog now enjoyed it wogger she called him wogger wd give anything to be back in gib and hear you sing waiting and in old madrid

grove with love yrs affly hester x x x x x she didnt look a bit married just like a girl he was years older than her wogger he was awfully fond of me when he held down the wire with his foot for me to step over at the bullfight at la linea when that matador gomez was given the bulls ear these clothes we have to wear whoever invented them expecting you to walk up killiney hill then for example at that picnic all staysed up you cant do a blessed thing in them in a crowd run or jump out of the way thats why i was afraid when that other ferocious old bull began to charge the banderilleros with the sashes and the  things in their hats and the brutes of men shouting bravo toro sure the women were as bad in their nice white mantillas ripping all the whole insides out of those poor horses i never heard of such a thing in all my life yes he used to break his heart at me taking off the dog barking in bell lane poor brute and it sick what became of them ever i suppose theyre dead long ago the  of them its like all through a mist makes you feel so old i made the scones of course i had everything all to myself then a girl hester we used to compare our hair mine was thicker than hers she showed me how to settle it at the back when i put it up and whats this else how to make a knot on a thread with the one hand we were like cousins what age was i then the night of the storm i slept in her bed she had her arms round me then we were fighting in the morning with the pillow what fun he was watching me whenever he got an opportunity at the band on the alameda esplanade when i was with father and captain grove i looked up at the church first and then at the windows then down and our eyes met i felt something go through me like all needles my eyes were dancing i remember after when i looked at myself in the glass hardly recognised myself the change he was attractive to a girl in spite of his being a little bald intelligent looking disappointed and gay at the same time he was like thomas in the shadow of ashlydyat i had a splendid skin from the sun and the excitement like a rose i didnt get a wink of sleep it wouldnt have been nice on account of her but i could have stopped it in time she gave me the moonstone to read that was the first i read of wilkie collins east lynne i read and the shadow of ashlydyat mrs henry wood henry dunbar by that other woman i lent him afterwards with mulveys photo in it so as he see i wasnt without and lord lytton eugene aram molly bawn she gave me by mrs hungerford on account of the name i dont like books with a molly in them like that one he brought me about the one from flanders a whore always shoplifting anything she could cloth and stuff and yards of it o this blanket is too heavy on me thats better i havent even one decent nightdress this thing gets all rolled under me besides him and his fooling thats better i used to be weltering then in the heat my shift drenched with the sweat stuck in the cheeks of my bottom on the chair when i stood up they were so fattish and firm when i got up on the sofa cushions to see with my clothes up and the bugs tons of them at night and the mosquito nets i couldnt read a line lord how long ago it seems centuries of course they never came back and she didnt put her address right on it either she may have noticed her wogger people were always going away and we never i remember that day with the waves and the boats with their high heads rocking and the smell of ship those officers uniforms on shore leave made me seasick he didnt say anything he was very serious i had the high buttoned boots on and my skirt was blowing she kissed me six or seven times didnt i cry yes i believe i did or near it my lips were taittering when i said goodbye she had a gorgeous wrap of some special kind of blue colour on her for the voyage made very peculiarly to one side like and it was extremely pretty it got as dull as the devil after they went i was almost planning to run away mad out of it somewhere were never easy where we are father or aunt or marriage waiting always waiting to guiiiide him toooo me waiting nor speeeed his flying feet their damn guns bursting and booming all over the shop especially the queens birthday and throwing everything down in all directions if you didnt open the windows when general ulysses grant whoever he was or did supposed to be some great fellow landed off the ship and old sprague the consul that was there from before the flood dressed up poor man and he in mourning for the son then the same old bugles for reveille in the morning and drums rolling and the unfortunate poor devils of soldiers walking about with messtins smelling the place more than the old longbearded jews in their jellibees and levites assembly and sound clear and gunfire for the men to cross the lines and the warden marching with his keys to lock the gates and the bagpipes and only captain groves and father talking about rorkes drift and plevna and sir garnet wolseley and gordon at khartoum lighting their pipes for them everytime they went out drunken old devil with his grog on the windowsill catch him leaving any of it picking his nose trying to think of some other dirty story to tell up in a corner but he never forgot himself when i was there sending me out of the room on some blind excuse paying his compliments the bushmills whisky talking of course but hed do the same to the next woman that came along i suppose he died of galloping drink ages ago the days like years not a letter from a living soul except the odd few i posted to myself with bits of paper in them so bored sometimes i could fight with my nails listening to that old arab with the one eye and his heass of an instrument singing his heah heah aheah all my compriment on your hotchapotch of your heass as bad as now with the hands hanging off me looking out of the window if there was a nice fellow even in the opposite house that medical in holles street the nurse was after when i put on my gloves and hat at the window to show i was going out not a notion what i meant arent they thick never understand what you say even youd want to print it up on a big poster for them not even if you shake hands twice with the left he didnt recognise me either when i half frowned at him outside westland row chapel where does their great intelligence come in id like to know grey matter they have it all in their tail if you ask me those country gougers up in the city arms intelligence they had a damn sight less than the bulls and cows they were selling the meat and the coalmans bell that noisy bugger trying to swindle me with the wrong bill he took out of his hat what a pair of paws and pots and pans and kettles to mend any broken bottles for a poor man today and no visitors or post ever except his cheques or some advertisement like that wonderworker they sent him addressed dear madam only his letter and the card from milly this morning see she wrote a letter to him who did i get the last letter from o mrs dwenn now what possessed her to write from canada after so many years to know the recipe i had for pisto madrileno floey dillon since she wrote to say she

jilted her after out of the ladies letterwriter when i told her to say a few simple words he could twist how he liked not acting with precipat precipitancy with equal candour the greatest earthly happiness answer to a gentlemans proposal affirmatively my goodness theres nothing else its all very fine for them but as for being a woman as soon as youre old they might as well throw you out in the bottom of the ashpit
mulveys was the first when i was in bed that morning and mrs rubio brought it in with the coffee she stood there standing when i asked her to hand me and i pointing at them i couldnt think of the word a hairpin to open it with ah horquilla disobliging old thing and it staring her in the face with her switch of false hair on her and vain about her appearance ugly as she was near  or a  her face a mass of wrinkles with all her religion domineering because she never could get over the atlantic fleet coming in half the ships of the world and the union jack flying with all her carabineros because  drunken english sailors took all the rock from them and because i didnt run into mass often enough in santa maria to please her with her shawl up on her except when there was a marriage on with all her miracles of the saints and her black blessed virgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing  times on easter sunday morning and when the priest was going by with the bell bringing the vatican to the dying blessing herself for his majestad an admirer he signed it i near jumped out of my skin i wanted to pick him up when i saw him following me along the calle real in the shop window then he tipped me just in passing but i never thought hed write making an appointment i had it inside my petticoat bodice all day reading it up in every hole and corner while father was up at the drill instructing to find out by the handwriting or the language of stamps singing i remember shall i wear a white rose and i wanted to put on the old stupid clock to near the time he was the first man kissed me under the moorish wall my sweetheart when a boy it never entered my head what kissing meant till he put his tongue in my mouth his mouth was sweetlike young i put my knee up to him a few times to learn the way what did i tell him i was engaged for for fun to the son of a spanish nobleman named don miguel de la flora and he believed me that i was to be married to him in  years time theres many a true word spoken in jest there is a flower that bloometh a few things i told him true about myself just for him to be imagining the spanish girls he didnt like i suppose one of them wouldnt have him i got him excited he crushed all the flowers on my bosom he brought me he couldnt count the pesetas and the perragordas till i taught him cappoquin he came from he said on the black water but it was too short then the day before he left may yes it was may when the infant king of spain was born im always like that in the spring id like a new fellow every year up on the tiptop under the rockgun near oharas tower i told him it was struck by lightning and all about the old barbary apes they sent to clapham without a tail careering all over the show on each others back mrs rubio said she was a regular old rock scorpion robbing the chickens out of inces farm and throw stones at you if you went anear he was looking at me i had that white blouse on open in the front to encourage him as much as i could without too openly they were just beginning to be plump i said i was tired we lay over the firtree cove a wild place i suppose it must be the highest rock in existence the galleries and casemates and those frightful rocks and saint michaels cave with the icicles or whatever they call them hanging down and ladders all the mud plotching my boots im sure thats the way down the monkeys go under the sea to africa when they die the ships out far like chips that was the malta boat passing yes the sea and the sky you could do what you liked lie there for ever he caressed them outside they love doing that its the roundness there i was leaning over him with my white ricestraw hat to take the newness out of it the left side of my face the best my blouse open for his last day transparent kind of shirt he had i could see his chest pink he wanted to touch mine with his for a moment but i wouldnt let him he was awfully put out first for fear you never know consumption or leave me with a child embarazada that old servant ines told me that one drop even if it got into you at all after i tried with the banana but i was afraid it might break and get lost up in me somewhere because they once took something down out of a woman that was up there for years covered with limesalts theyre all mad to get in there where they come out of youd think they could never go far enough up and then theyre done with you in a way till the next time yes because theres a wonderful feeling there so tender all the time how did we finish it off yes o yes i pulled him off into my handkerchief pretending not to be excited but i opened my legs i wouldnt let him touch me inside my petticoat because i had a skirt opening up the side i tormented the life out of him first tickling him i loved rousing that dog in the hotel rrrsssstt awokwokawok his eyes shut and a bird flying below us he was shy all the same i liked him like that moaning i made him blush a little when i got over him that way when i unbuttoned him and took his out and drew back the skin it had a kind of eye in it theyre all buttons men down the middle on the wrong side of them molly darling he called me what was his name jack joe harry mulvey was it yes i think a lieutenant he was rather fair he had a laughing kind of a voice so i went round to the whatyoucallit everything was whatyoucallit moustache had he he said hed come back lord its just like yesterday to me and if i was married hed do it to me and i promised him yes faithfully id let him block me now flying perhaps hes dead or killed or a captain or admiral its nearly  years if i said firtree cove he would if he came up behind me and put his hands over my eyes to guess who i might recognise him hes young still about  perhaps hes married some girl on the black water and is quite changed they all do they havent half the character a woman has she little knows what i did with her beloved husband before he ever dreamt of her in broad daylight too in the sight of the whole world you might say they could have put an article about it in the chronicle i was a bit wild after when i blew out the old bag the biscuits were in from benady bros and exploded it lord what a bang all the woodcocks and pigeons screaming coming back the same way that we went over middle hill round by the old guardhouse and the jews burialplace pretending to read out the hebrew on them i wanted to fire his pistol he said he hadnt one he didnt know what to make of me with his peak cap on that he always wore crooked as often as i settled it straight h m s calypso swinging my hat that old bishop that spoke off the altar his long preach about womans higher functions about girls now riding the bicycle and wearing peak caps and the new woman bloomers god send him sense and me more money i suppose theyre called after him i never thought that would be my name bloom when i used to write it in print to see how it looked on a visiting card or practising for the butcher and oblige m bloom youre looking blooming josie used to say after i married him well its better than breen or briggs does brig or those awful names with bottom in them mrs ramsbottom or some other kind of a bottom mulvey i wouldnt go mad about either or suppose i divorced him mrs boylan my mother whoever she was might have given me a nicer name the lord knows after the lovely one she had lunita laredo the fun we had running along williss road to europa point twisting in and out all round the other side of jersey they were shaking and dancing about in my blouse like millys little ones now when she runs up the stairs i loved looking down at them i was jumping up at the pepper trees and the white poplars pulling the leaves off and throwing them at him he went to india he was to write the voyages those men have to make to the ends of the world and back its the least they might get a squeeze or two at a woman while they can going out to be drowned or blown up somewhere i went up windmill hill to the flats that sunday morning with captain rubios that was dead spyglass like the sentry had he said hed have one or two from on board i wore that frock from the b marche paris and the coral necklace the straits shining i could see over to morocco almost the bay of tangier white and the atlas mountain with snow on it and the straits like a river so clear harry molly darling i was thinking of him on the sea all the time after at mass when my petticoat began to slip down at the elevation weeks and weeks i kept the handkerchief under my pillow for the smell of him there was no decent perfume to be got in that gibraltar only that cheap peau despagne that faded and left a stink on you more than anything else i wanted to give him a memento he gave me that clumsy claddagh ring for luck that i gave gardner going to south africa where those boers killed him with their war and fever but they were well beaten all the same as if it brought its bad luck with it like an opal or pearl still it must have been pure  carrot gold because it was very heavy but what could you get in a place like that the sandfrog shower from africa and that derelict ship that

with my cup of tea after was quite good with the heat i couldnt smell anything off it im sure that queerlooking man in the porkbutchers is a great rogue i hope that lamp is not smoking fill my nose up with smuts better than having him leaving the gas on all night i couldnt rest easy in my bed in gibraltar even getting up to see why am i so damned nervous about that though i like it in the winter its more company o lord it was rotten cold too that winter when i was only about ten was i yes i had the big doll with all the funny clothes dressing her up and undressing that icy wind skeeting across from those mountains the something nevada sierra nevada standing at the fire with the little bit of a short shift i had up to heat myself i loved dancing about in it then make a race back into bed im sure that fellow opposite used to be there the whole time watching with the lights out in the summer and i in my skin hopping around i used to love myself then stripped at the washstand dabbing and creaming only when it came to the chamber performance i put out the light too so then there were  of us goodbye to my sleep for this night anyhow i hope hes not going to get in with those medicals leading him astray to imagine hes young again coming in at  in the morning it must be if not more still he had the manners not to wake me what do they find to gabber about all night squandering money and getting drunker and drunker couldnt they drink water then he starts giving us his orders for eggs and tea and findon haddy and hot buttered toast i suppose well have him sitting up like the king of the country pumping the wrong end of the spoon up and down in his egg wherever he learned that from and i love to hear him falling up the stairs of a morning with the cups rattling on the tray and then play with the cat she rubs up against you for her own sake i wonder has she fleas shes as bad as a woman always licking and lecking but i hate their claws i wonder do they see anything that we cant staring like that when she sits at the top of the stairs so long and listening as i wait always what a robber too that lovely fresh plaice i bought i think ill get a bit of fish tomorrow or today is it friday yes i will with some blancmange with black currant jam like long ago not those  lb pots of mixed plum and apple from the london and newcastle williams and woods goes twice as far only for the bones i hate those eels cod yes ill get a nice piece of cod im always getting enough for  forgetting anyway im sick of that everlasting butchers meat from buckleys loin chops and leg beef and rib steak and scrag of mutton and calfs pluck the very name is enough or a picnic suppose we all gave  each and or let him pay it and invite some other woman for him who mrs fleming and drove out to the furry glen or the strawberry beds wed have him examining all the horses toenails first like he does with the letters no not with boylan there yes with some cold veal and ham mixed sandwiches there are little houses down at the bottom of the banks there on purpose but its as hot as blazes he says not a bank holiday anyhow i hate those ruck of mary ann coalboxes out for the day whit monday is a cursed day too no wonder that bee bit him better the seaside but id never again in this life get into a boat with him after him at bray telling the boatman he knew how to row if anyone asked could he ride the steeplechase for the gold cup hed say yes then it came on to get rough the old thing crookeding about and the weight all down my side telling me pull the right reins now pull the left and the tide all swamping in floods in through the bottom and his oar slipping out of the stirrup its a mercy we werent all drowned he can swim of course me no theres no danger whatsoever keep yourself calm in his flannel trousers id like to have tattered them down off him before all the people and give him what that one calls flagellate till he was black and blue do him all the good in the world only for that longnosed chap i dont know who he is with that other beauty burke out of the city arms hotel was there spying around as usual on the slip always where he wasnt wanted if there was a row on youd vomit a better face there was no love lost between us thats  consolation i wonder what kind is that book he brought me sweets of sin by a gentleman of fashion some other mr de kock i suppose the people gave him that nickname going about with his tube from one woman to another i couldnt even change my new white shoes all ruined with the saltwater and the hat i had with that feather all blowy and tossed on me how annoying and provoking because the smell of the sea excited me of course the sardines and the bream in catalan bay round the back of the rock they were fine all silver in the fishermens baskets old luigi near a hundred they said came from genoa and the tall old chap with the earrings i dont like a man you have to climb up to to get at i suppose theyre all dead and rotten long ago besides i dont like being alone in this big barracks of a place at night i suppose ill have to put up with it i never brought a bit of salt in even when we moved in the confusion musical academy he was going to make on the first floor drawingroom with a brassplate or blooms private hotel he suggested go and ruin himself altogether the way his father did down in ennis like all the things he told father he was going to do and me but i saw through him telling me all the lovely places we could go for the honeymoon venice by moonlight with the gondolas and the lake of como he had a picture cut out of some paper of and mandolines and lanterns o how nice i said whatever i liked he was going to do immediately if not sooner will you be my man will you carry my can he ought to get a leather medal with a putty rim for all the plans he invents then leaving us here all day youd never know what old beggar at the door for a crust with his long story might be a tramp and put his foot in the way to prevent me shutting it like that picture of that hardened criminal he was called in lloyds weekly news  years in jail then he comes out and murders an old woman for her money imagine his poor wife or mother or whoever she is such a face youd run miles away from i couldnt rest easy till i bolted all the doors and windows to make sure but its worse again being locked up like in a prison or a madhouse they ought to be all shot or the cat of nine tails a big brute like that that would attack a poor old woman to murder her in her bed id cut them off him so i would not that hed be much use still better than nothing the night i was sure i heard burglars in the kitchen and he went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was looking for a mouse as white as a sheet frightened out of his wits making as much noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit there isnt much to steal indeed the lord knows still its the feeling especially now with milly away such an idea for him to send the girl down there to learn to take photographs on account of his grandfather instead of sending her to skerrys academy where shed have to learn not like me getting all at school only hed do a thing like that all the same on account of me and boylan thats why he did it im certain the way he plots and plans everything out i couldnt turn round with her in the place lately unless i bolted the door first gave me the fidgets coming in without knocking first when i put the chair against the door just as i was washing myself there below with the glove get on your nerves then doing the loglady all day put her in a glasscase with two at a time to look at her if he knew she broke off the hand off that little gimcrack statue with her roughness and carelessness before she left that i got that little italian boy to mend so that you cant see the join for  shillings wouldnt even teem the potatoes for you of course shes right not to ruin her hands i noticed he was always talking to her lately at the table explaining things in the paper and she pretending to understand sly of course that comes from his side of the house he cant say i pretend things can he im too honest as a matter of fact and helping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her its me shed tell not him i suppose he thinks im finished out and laid on the shelf well im not no nor anything like it well see well see now shes well on for flirting too with tom devans two sons imitating me whistling with those romps of murray girls calling for her can milly come out please shes in great demand to pick what they can out of her round in nelson street riding harry devans bicycle at night its as well he sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting to go on the skatingrink and smoking their cigarettes through their nose i smelt it off her dress when i was biting off the thread of the button i sewed on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me i tell you only i oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a parting and the last plumpudding too split in  halves see it comes out no matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste your blouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle blackbottom and i had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on show on the windowsill before all the people passing they all look at her like me when i was her age of course any old rag looks well on you then a great touchmenot too in her own way at the only way in the theatre royal take your foot away out of that i hate people touching me afraid of her life id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that touching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always trying to wiggle up to you that fellow in the pit at the gaiety for beerbohm tree in trilby the last time ill ever go there to be squashed like that for any trilby or her barebum every two minutes tipping me there and looking away hes a bit daft i think i saw him after trying to get near two stylishdressed ladies outside switzers window at the same little game i recognised him on the moment the face and everything but he didnt remember me yes and she didnt even want me to kiss her at the broadstone going away well i hope shell get someone to dance attendance on her the way i did when she was down with the mumps and her glands swollen wheres this and wheres that of course she cant feel anything deep yet i never came properly till i was what  or so it went into the wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that conny connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with sealingwax though she clapped when the curtain came down because he looked so handsome then we had martin harvey for breakfast dinner and supper i thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man gives up his life for her that way for nothing i suppose there are a few men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it really happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love in their natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each other that would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit foolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer to go and poison himself after her still poor old man i suppose he felt lost shes always making love to my things too the few old rags i have wanting to put her hair up at  my powder too only ruin her skin on her shes time enough for that all her life after of course shes restless knowing shes pretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay that way i was too but theres no use going to the fair with the thing answering me like a fishwoman when i asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we met mrs joe gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to see us in her trap with friery the solicitor we werent grand enough till i gave her  damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that now for answering me like that and that for your impudence she had me that exasperated of course contradicting i was badtempered too because how was it there was a weed in the tea or i didnt sleep the night before cheese i ate was it and i told her over and over again not to leave knives crossed like that because she has nobody to command her as she said herself well if he doesnt correct her faith i will that was the last time she turned on the teartap i was just like that myself they darent order me about the place its his fault of course having the two of us slaving here instead of getting in a woman long ago am i ever going to have a proper servant again of course then shed see him coming id have to let her know or shed revenge it arent they a nuisance that old mrs fleming you have to be walking round after her putting the things into her hands sneezing and farting into the pots well of course shes old she cant help it a good job i found that rotten old smelly dishcloth that got lost behind the dresser i knew there was something and opened the area window to let out the smell bringing in his friends to entertain them like the night he walked home with a dog if you please that might have been mad especially simon dedalus son his father such a criticiser with his glasses up with his tall hat on him at the cricket match and a great big hole in his sock one thing laughing at the other and his son that got all those prizes for whatever he won them in the intermediate imagine climbing over the railings if anybody saw him that knew us i wonder he didnt tear a big hole in his grand funeral trousers as if the one nature gave wasnt enough for anybody hawking him down into the dirty old kitchen now is he right in his head i ask pity it wasnt washing day my old pair of drawers might have been hanging up too on the line on exhibition for all hed ever care with the ironmould mark the stupid old bundle burned on them he might think was something else and she never even rendered down the fat i told her and now shes going such as she was on account of her paralysed husband getting worse theres always something wrong with them disease or they have to go under an operation or if its not that its drink and he beats her ill have to hunt around again for someone every day i get up theres some new thing on sweet god sweet god well when im stretched out dead in my grave i suppose ill have some peace i want to get up a minute if im let wait o jesus wait yes that thing has come on me yes now wouldnt that afflict you of course all the poking and rooting and ploughing he had up in me now what am i to do friday saturday sunday wouldnt that pester the soul out of a body unless he likes it some men do god knows theres always something wrong with us  days every  or  weeks usual monthly auction isnt it simply sickening that night it came on me like that the one and only time we were in a box that michael gunn gave him to see mrs kendal and her husband at the gaiety something he did about insurance for him in drimmies i was fit to be tied though i wouldnt give in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at me with his glasses and him the other side of me talking about spinoza and his soul thats dead i suppose millions of years ago i smiled the best i could all in a swamp leaning forward as if i was interested having to sit it out then to the last tag i wont forget that wife of scarli in a hurry supposed to be a fast play about adultery that idiot in the gallery hissing the woman adulteress he shouted i suppose he went and had a woman in the next lane running round all the back ways after to make up for it i wish he had what i had then hed boo i bet the cat itself is better off than us have we too much blood up in us or what o patience above its pouring out of me like the sea anyhow he didnt make me pregnant as big as he is i dont want to ruin the clean sheets i just put on i suppose the clean linen i wore brought it on too damn it damn it and they always want to see a stain on the bed to know youre a virgin for them all thats troubling them theyre such fools too you could be a widow or divorced  times over a daub of red ink would do or blackberry juice no thats too purply o jamesy let me up out of this pooh sweets of sin whoever suggested that business for women what between clothes and cooking and children this damned old bed too jingling like the dickens i suppose they could hear us away over the other side of the park till i suggested to put the quilt on the floor with the pillow under my bottom i wonder is it nicer in the day i think it is easy i think ill cut all this hair off me there scalding me i might look like a young girl wouldnt he get the great suckin the next time he turned up my clothes on me id give anything to see his face wheres the chamber gone easy ive a holy horror of its breaking under me after that old commode i wonder was i too heavy sitting on his knee i made him sit on the easychair purposely when i took off only my blouse and skirt first in the other room he was so busy where he oughtnt to be he never felt me i hope my breath was sweet after those kissing comfits easy god i remember one time i could scout it out straight whistling like a man almost easy o lord how noisy i hope theyre bubbles on it for a wad of money from some fellow ill have to perfume it in the morning dont forget i bet he never saw a better pair of thighs than that look how white they are the smoothest place is right there between this bit here how soft like a peach easy god i wouldnt mind being a man and get up on a lovely woman o lord what a row youre making like the jersey lily easy easy o how the waters come down at lahore  who knows is there anything the matter with my insides or have i something growing in me getting that thing like that every week when was it last i whit monday yes its only about  weeks i ought to go to the doctor only it would be like before i married him when i had that white thing coming from me and floey made me go to that dry old stick dr collins for womens diseases on pembroke road your vagina he called it i suppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets getting round those rich ones off stephens green running up to him for every little fiddlefaddle her vagina and her cochinchina theyve money of course so theyre all right i wouldnt marry him not if he was the last man in the world besides theres something queer about their children always smelling around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what i did had an offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one thing gold maybe what a question if i smathered it all over his wrinkly old face for him with all my compriments i suppose hed know then and could you pass it easily pass what i thought he was talking about the rock of gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by the way only i like letting myself down after in the hole as far as i can squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and needles still theres something in it i suppose i always used to know by millys when she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the same paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and asking me had i frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all the words they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked sideways i wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or god knows what else still i liked him when he sat down to write the thing out frowning so severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you lying strap o anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever enough to spot that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad crazy letters my precious one everything connected with your glorious body everything underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and of joy for ever something he got out of some nonsensical book that he had me always at myself  and  times a day sometimes and i said i hadnt are you sure o yes i said i am quite sure in a way that shut him up i knew what was coming next only natural weakness it was he excited me i dont know how the first night ever we met when i was living in rehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another for about  minutes as if we met somewhere i suppose on account of my being jewess looking after my mother he used to amuse me the things he said with the half sloothering smile on him and all the doyles said he was going to stand for a member of parliament o wasnt i the born fool to believe all his blather about home rule and the land league sending me that long strool of a song out of the huguenots to sing in french to be more classy o beau pays de la touraine that i never even sang once explaining and rigmaroling about religion and persecution he wont let you enjoy anything naturally then might he as a great favour the very st opportunity he got a chance in brighton square running into my bedroom pretending the ink got on his hands to wash it off with the albion milk and sulphur soap i used to use and the gelatine still round it o i laughed myself sick at him that day i better not make an alnight sitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a natural size so that a woman could sit on it properly he kneels down to do it i suppose there isnt in all creation another man with the habits he has look at the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he without a hard bolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth breathing with his hand on his nose like that indian god he took me to show one wet sunday in the museum in kildare street all yellow in a pinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and our lords both put together all over asia imitating him as hes always imitating everybody i suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big square feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking thing anyway wheres this those napkins are ah yes i know i hope the old press doesnt creak ah i knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time somewhere still she must have given him great value for his money of course he has to pay for it from her o this nuisance of a thing i hope theyll have something better for us in the other world tying ourselves up god help us thats all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly bed always reminds me of old cohen i suppose he scratched himself in it often enough and he thinks father bought it from lord napier that i used to admire when i was a little girl because i told him easy piano o i like my bed god here we are as bad as ever after  years how many houses were we in at all raymond terrace and ontario terrace and lombard street and holles street and he goes about whistling every time were on the run again his huguenots or the frogs march pretending to help the men with our  sticks of furniture and then the city arms hotel worse and worse says warden daly that charming place on the landing always somebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them always know who was in there last every time were just getting on right something happens or he puts his big foot in it thoms and helys and mr cuffes and drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over his old lottery tickets that was to be all our salvations or he goes and gives impudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the freeman too like the rest on account of those sinner fein or the freemasons then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling along in the wet all by himself round by coadys lane will give him much consolation that he says is so capable and sincerely irish he is indeed judging by the sincerity of the trousers i saw on him wait theres georges church bells wait  quarters the hour wait two oclock well thats a nice hour of the night for him to be coming home at to anybody climbing down into the area if anybody saw him ill knock him off that little habit tomorrow first ill look at his shirt to see or ill see if he has that french letter still in his pocketbook i suppose he thinks i dont know deceitful men all their  pockets arent enough for their lies then why should we tell them even if its the truth they dont believe you then tucked up in bed like those babies in the aristocrats masterpiece he brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in real life without some old aristocrat or whatever his name is disgusting you more with those rotten pictures children with two heads and no legs thats the kind of villainy theyre always dreaming about with not another thing in their empty heads they ought to get slow poison the half of them then tea and toast for him buttered on both sides and newlaid eggs i suppose im nothing any more when i wouldnt let him lick me in holles street one night man man tyrant as ever for the one thing he slept on the floor half the night naked the way the jews used when somebody dies belonged to them and wouldnt eat any breakfast or speak a word wanting to be petted so i thought i stood out enough for one time and let him he does it all wrong too thinking only of his own pleasure his tongue is too flat or i dont know what he forgets that wethen i dont ill make him do it again if he doesnt mind himself and lock him down to sleep in the coalcellar with the blackbeetles i wonder was it her josie off her head with my castoffs hes such a born liar too no hed never have the courage with a married woman thats why he wants me and boylan though as for her denis as she calls him that forlornlooking spectacle you couldnt call him a husband yes its some little bitch hes got in with even when i was with him with milly at the college races that hornblower with the childs bonnet on the top of his nob let us into by the back way he was throwing his sheeps eyes at those two doing skirt duty up and down i tried to wink at him first no use of course and thats the way his money goes this is the fruits of mr paddy dignam yes they were all in great style at the grand funeral in the paper boylan brought in if they saw a real officers funeral thatd be something reversed arms muffled drums the poor horse walking behind in black l boom and tom kernan that drunken little barrelly man that bit his tongue off falling down the mens w c drunk in some place or other and martin cunningham and the two dedaluses and fanny mcoys husband white head of cabbage skinny thing with a turn in her eye trying to sing my songs shed want to be born all over again and her old green dress with the lowneck as she cant attract them any other way like dabbling on a rainy day i see it all now plainly and they call that friendship killing and then burying one another and they all with their wives and families at home more especially jack power keeping that barmaid he does of course his wife is always sick or going to be sick or just getting better of it and hes a goodlooking man still though hes getting a bit grey over the ears theyre a nice lot all of them well theyre not going to get my husband again into their clutches if i can help it making fun of him then behind his back i know well when he goes on with his idiotics because he has sense enough not to squander every penny piece he earns down their gullets and looks after his wife and family goodfornothings poor paddy dignam all the same im sorry in a way for him what are his wife and  children going to do unless he was insured comical little teetotum always stuck up in some pub corner and her or her son waiting bill bailey wont you please come home her widows weeds wont improve her appearance theyre awfully becoming though if youre goodlooking what men wasnt he yes he was at the glencree dinner and ben dollard base barreltone the night he borrowed the swallowtail to sing out of in holles street squeezed and squashed into them and grinning all over his big dolly face like a wellwhipped childs botty didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough that must have been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying  in the preserved seats for that to see him trotting off in his trowlers and simon dedalus too he was always turning up half screwed singing the second verse first the old love is the new was one of his so sweetly sang the maiden on the hawthorn bough he was always on for flirtyfying too when i sang maritana with him at freddy mayers private opera he had a delicious glorious voice phoebe dearest goodbye sweetheart sweetheart he always sang it not like bartell darcy sweet tart goodbye of course he had the gift of the voice so there was no art in it all over you like a warm showerbath o maritana wildwood flower we sang splendidly though it was a bit too high for my register even transposed and he was married at the time to may goulding but then hed say or do something to knock the good out of it hes a widower now i wonder what sort is his son he says hes an author and going to be a university professor of italian and im to take lessons what is he driving at now showing him my photo its not good of me i ought to have got it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion still i look young in it i wonder he didnt make him a present of it altogether and me too after all why not i saw him driving down to the kingsbridge station with his father and mother i was in mourning thats  years ago now yes hed be  though what was the good in going into mourning for what was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was enough for me i heard the deathwatch too ticking in the wall of course he insisted hed go into mourning for the cat i suppose hes a man now by this time he was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord fauntleroy suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when i saw him at mat dillons he liked me too i remember they all do wait by god yes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when i laid out the deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met before i thought it meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either besides my face was turned the other way what was the th card after that the  of spades for a journey by land then there was a letter on its way and scandals too the  queens and the  of diamonds for a rise in society yes wait it all came out and  red s for new garments look at that and didnt i dream something too yes there was something about poetry in it i hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or standing up like a red indian what do they go about like that for only getting themselves and their poetry laughed at i always liked poetry when i was a girl first i thought he was a poet like lord byron and not an ounce of it in his composition i thought he was quite different i wonder is he too young hes about wait  i was married  milly is  yesterday  what age was he then at dillons  or  about  i suppose hes  or more im not too old for him if hes  or  i hope hes not that stuckup university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting down in the old kitchen with him taking eppss cocoa and talking of course he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was out of trinity college hes very young to be a professor i hope hes not a professor like goodwin was he was a potent professor of john jameson they all write about some woman in their poetry well i suppose he wont find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully coming back on the nightboat from tarifa the lighthouse at europa point the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will i ever go back there again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid ill sing that for him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly bright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young star itll be a change the lord knows to have an intelligent person to talk to about yourself not always listening to him and billy prescotts ad and keyess ad and tom the devils ad then if anything goes wrong in their business we have to suffer im sure hes very distinguished id like to meet a man like that god not those other ruck besides hes young those fine young men i could see down in margate strand bathingplace from the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a god or something and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men like that thered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely little statue he bought i could look at him all day long curly head and his shoulders his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and poetry for you i often felt i wanted to kiss him all over also his lovely young cock there so simple i wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth if nobody was looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and white he looks with his boyish face i would too in  a minute even if some of it went down what its only like gruel or the dew theres no danger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs of men i suppose never dream of washing it from  years end to the other the most of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches im sure itll be grand if i can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age ill throw them the st thing in the morning till i see if the wishcard comes out or ill try pairing the lady herself and see if he comes out ill read and study all i can find or learn a bit off by heart if i knew who he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the same and i can teach him the other part ill make him feel all over him till he half faints under me then hell write about me lover and mistress publicly too with our  photographs in all the papers when he becomes famous o but then what am i going to do about him though  no thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no nothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because i didnt call him hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know poetry from a cabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place pulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so barefaced without even asking permission and standing out that vulgar way in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a butcher or those old hypocrites in the time of julius caesar of course hes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might as well be in bed with what with a lion god im sure hed have something better to say for himself an old lion would o well i suppose its because they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he couldnt resist they excite myself sometimes its well for men all the amount of pleasure they get off a womans body were so round and white for them always i wished i was one myself for a change just to try with that thing they have swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so soft when you touch it my uncle john has a thing long i heard those cornerboys saying passing the comer of marrowbone lane my aunt mary has a thing hairy because it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it didnt make me blush why should it either its only nature and he puts his thing long into my aunt marys hairy etcetera and turns out to be you put the handle in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick and choose what they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl for their different tastes like those houses round behind irish street no but were to be always chained up theyre not going to be chaining me up no damn fear once i start i tell you for their stupid husbands jealousy why cant we all remain friends over it instead of quarrelling her husband found it out what they did together well naturally and if he did can he undo it hes coronado anyway whatever he does and then he going to the other mad extreme about the wife in fair tyrants of course the man never even casts a nd thought on the husband or wife either its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we given all those desires for id like to know i cant help it if im young still can i its a wonder im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with him so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the wrong end of me not knowing i suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a womans bottom id throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything unnatural where we havent  atom of any kind of expression in us all of us the same  lumps of lard before ever id do that to a man pfooh the dirty brutes the mere thought is enough i kiss the feet of you senorita theres some sense in that didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a madman nobody understands his cracked ideas but me still of course a woman wants to be embraced  times a day almost to make her look young no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the lord god i was thinking would i go around by the quays there some dark evening where nobodyd know me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not care a pin whose i was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of those wildlooking gipsies in rathfarnham had their camp pitched near the bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if they could i only sent mine there a few times for the name model laundry sending me back over and over some old ones odd stockings that blackguardlooking fellow with the fine eyes peeling a switch attack me in the dark and ride me up against the wall without a word or a murderer anybody what they do themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that k c lives up somewhere this way coming out of hardwicke lane the night he gave us the fish supper on account of winning over the boxing match of course it was for me he gave it i knew him by his gaiters and the walk and when i turned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after coming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his wife after that only i suppose the half of those sailors are rotten again with disease o move over your big carcass out of that for the love of mike listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well he may sleep and sigh the great suggester don poldo de la flora if he knew how he came out on the cards this morning hed have something to sigh for a dark man in some perplexity between  s too in prison for lord knows what he does that i dont know and im to be slooching around down in the kitchen to get his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled up like a mummy will i indeed did you ever see me running id just like to see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt i dont care what anybody says itd be much better for the world to be governed by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one another and slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling around drunk like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on horses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop sure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know what it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they all of them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what i never had thats why i suppose hes running wild now out at night away from his books and studies and not living at home on account of the usual rowy house i suppose well its a poor case that those that have a fine son like that theyre not satisfied and i none was he not able to make one it wasnt my fault we came together when i was watching the two dogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that disheartened me altogether i suppose i oughtnt to have buried him in that little woolly jacket i knitted crying as i was but give it to some poor child but i knew well id never have another our st death too it was we were never the same since o im not going to think myself into the glooms about that any more i wonder why he wouldnt stay the night i felt all the time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of roving around the city meeting god knows who nightwalkers and pickpockets his poor mother wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining himself for life perhaps still its a lovely hour so silent i used to love coming home after dances the air of the night they have friends they can talk to weve none either he wants what he wont get or its some woman ready to stick her knife in you i hate that in women no wonder they treat us the way they do we are a dreadful lot of bitches i suppose its all the troubles we have makes us so snappy im not like that he could easy have slept in there on the sofa in the other room i suppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young hardly  of me in the next room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah what harm dedalus i wonder its like those names in gibraltar delapaz delagracia they had the devils queer names there father vilaplana of santa maria that gave me the rosary rosales y oreilly in the calle las siete revueltas and pisimbo and mrs opisso in governor street o what a name id go and drown myself in the first river if i had a name like her o my and all the bits of streets paradise ramp and bedlam ramp and rodgers ramp and crutchetts ramp and the devils gap steps well small blame to me if i am a harumscarum i know i am a bit i declare to god i dont feel a day older than then i wonder could i get my tongue round any of the spanish como esta usted muy bien gracias y usted see i havent forgotten it all i thought i had only for the grammar a noun is the name of any person place or thing pity i never tried to read that novel cantankerous mrs rubio lent me by valera with the questions in it all upside down the two ways i always knew wed go away in the end i can tell him the spanish and he tell me the italian then hell see im not so ignorant what a pity he didnt stay im sure the poor fellow was dead tired and wanted a good sleep badly i could have brought him in his breakfast in bed with a bit of toast so long as i didnt do it on the knife for bad luck or if the woman was going her rounds with the watercress and something nice and tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might like i never could bear the look of them in abrines i could do the criada the room looks all right since i changed it the other way you see something was telling me all the time id have to introduce myself not knowing me from adam very funny wouldnt it im his wife or pretend we were in spain with him half awake without a gods notion where he is dos huevos estrellados senor lord the cracked things come into my head sometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed with us why not theres the room upstairs empty and millys bed in the back room he could do his writing and studies at the table in there for all the scribbling he does at it and if he wants to read in bed in the morning like me as hes making the breakfast for  he can make it for  im sure im not going to take in lodgers off the street for him if he takes a gesabo of a house like this id love to have a long talk with an intelligent welleducated person id have to get a nice pair of red slippers like those turks with the fez used to sell or yellow and a nice semitransparent morning gown that i badly want or a peachblossom dressing jacket like the one long ago in walpoles only  or  ill just give him one more chance ill get up early in the morning im sick of cohens old bed in any case i might go over to the markets to see all the vegetables and cabbages and tomatoes and carrots and all kinds of splendid fruits all coming in lovely and fresh who knows whod be the st man id meet theyre out looking for it in the morning mamy dillon used to say they are and the night too that was her massgoing id love a big juicy pear now to melt in your mouth like when i used to be in the longing way then ill throw him up his eggs and tea in the moustachecup she gave him to make his mouth bigger i suppose hed like my nice cream too i know what ill do ill go about rather gay not too much singing a bit now and then mi fa pieta masetto then ill start dressing myself to go out presto non son piu forte ill put on my best shift and drawers let him have a good eyeful out of that to make his micky stand for him ill let him know if thats what he wanted that his wife is fucked yes and damn well fucked too up to my neck nearly not by him  or  times handrunning theres the mark of his spunk on the clean sheet i wouldnt bother to even iron it out that ought to satisfy him if you dont believe me feel my belly unless i made him stand there and put him into me ive a mind to tell him every scrap and make him do it out in front of me serve him right its all his own fault if i am an adulteress as the thing in the gallery said o much about it if thats all the harm ever we did in this vale of tears god knows its not much doesnt everybody only they hide it i suppose thats what a woman is supposed to be there for or he wouldnt have made us the way he did so attractive to men then if he wants to kiss my bottom ill drag open my drawers and bulge it right out in his face as large as life he can stick his tongue  miles up my hole as hes there my brown part then ill tell him i want   or perhaps  ill tell him i want to buy underclothes then if he gives me that well he wont be too bad i dont want to soak it all out of him like other women do i could often have written out a fine cheque for myself and write his name on it for a couple of pounds a few times he forgot to lock it up besides he wont spend it ill let him do it off on me behind provided he doesnt smear all my good drawers o i suppose that cant be helped ill do the indifferent  or  questions ill know by the answers when hes like that he cant keep a thing back i know every turn in him ill tighten my bottom well and let out a few smutty words smellrump or lick my shit or the first mad thing comes into my head then ill suggest about yes o wait now sonny my turn is coming ill be quite gay and friendly over it o but i was forgetting this bloody pest of a thing pfooh you wouldnt know which to laugh or cry were such a mixture of plum and apple no ill have to wear the old things so much the better itll be more pointed hell never know whether he did it or not there thats good enough for you any old thing at all then ill wipe him off me just like a business his omission then ill go out ill have him eying up at the ceiling where is she gone now make him want me thats the only way a quarter after what an unearthly hour i suppose theyre just getting up in china now combing out their pigtails for the day well soon have the nuns ringing the angelus theyve nobody coming in to spoil their sleep except an odd priest or two for his night office or the alarmclock next door at cockshout clattering the brains out of itself let me see if i can doze off      what kind of flowers are those they invented like the stars the wallpaper in lombard street was much nicer the apron he gave me was like that something only i only wore it twice better lower this lamp and try again so as i can get up early ill go to lambes there beside findlaters and get them to send us some flowers to put about the place in case he brings him home tomorrow today i mean no no fridays an unlucky day first i want to do the place up someway the dust grows in it i think while im asleep then we can have music and cigarettes i can accompany him first i must clean the keys of the piano with milk whatll i wear shall i wear a white rose or those fairy cakes in liptons i love the smell of a rich big shop at  d a lb or the other ones with the cherries in them and the pinky sugar d a couple of lbs of those a nice plant for the middle of the table id get that cheaper in wait wheres this i saw them not long ago i love flowers id love to have the whole place swimming in roses god of heaven theres nothing like nature the wild mountains then the sea and the waves rushing then the beautiful country with the fields of oats and wheat and all kinds of things and all the fine cattle going about that would do your heart good to see rivers and lakes and flowers all sorts of shapes and smells and colours springing up even out of the ditches primroses and violets nature it is as for them saying theres no god i wouldnt give a snap of my two fingers for all their learning why dont they go and create something i often asked him atheists or whatever they call themselves go and wash the cobbles off themselves first then they go howling for the priest and they dying and why why because theyre afraid of hell on account of their bad conscience ah yes i know them well who was the first person in the universe before there was anybody that made it all who ah that they dont know neither do i so there you are they might as well try to stop the sun from rising tomorrow the sun shines for you he said the day we were lying among the rhododendrons on howth head in the grey tweed suit and his straw hat the day i got him to propose to me yes first i gave him the bit of seedcake out of my mouth and it was leapyear like now yes  years ago my god after that long kiss i near lost my breath yes he said i was a flower of the mountain yes so we are flowers all a womans body yes that was one true thing he said in his life and the sun shines for you today yes that was why i liked him because i saw he understood or felt what a woman is and i knew i could always get round him and i gave him all the pleasure i could leading him on till he asked me to say yes and i wouldnt answer first only looked out over the sea and the sky i was thinking of so many things he didnt know of mulvey and mr stanhope and hester and father and old captain groves and the sailors playing all birds fly and i say stoop and washing up dishes they called it on the pier and the sentry in front of the governors house with the thing round his white helmet poor devil half roasted and the spanish girls laughing in their shawls and their tall combs and the auctions in the morning the greeks and the jews and the arabs and the devil knows who else from all the ends of europe and duke street and the fowl market all clucking outside larby sharons and the poor donkeys slipping half asleep and the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the steps and the big wheels of the carts of the bulls and the old castle thousands of years old yes and those handsome moors all in white and turbans like kings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a shop and ronda with the old windows of the posadas  glancing eyes a lattice hid for her lover to kiss the iron and the wineshops half open at night and the castanets and the night we missed the boat at algeciras the watchman going about serene with his lamp and o that awful deepdown torrent o and the sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and the glorious sunsets and the figtrees in the alameda gardens yes and all the queer little streets and the pink and blue and yellow houses and the rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and gibraltar as a girl where i was a flower of the mountain yes when i put the rose in my hair like the andalusian girls used or shall i wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the moorish wall and i thought well as well him as another and then i asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would i yes to say yes my mountain flower and first i put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes i said yes i will yes
