the departure     introductory note the house of the seven gables
in september of the year during the february of which hawthorne had completed the scarlet letter he began the house of the seven gables meanwhile he had removed from salem to lenox in berkshire county massachusetts where he occupied with his family a small red wooden house still standing at the date of this edition near the stockbridge bowl
i shant have the new story ready by november he explained to his publisher on the st of october for i am never good for anything in the literary way till after the first autumnal frost which has somewhat such an effect on my imagination that it does on the foliage here about memultiplying and brightening its hues but by vigorous application he was able to complete the new work about the middle of the january following
since research has disclosed the manner in which the romance is interwoven with incidents from the history of the hawthorne family the house of the seven gables has acquired an interest apart from that by which it first appealed to the public
john hathorne as the name was then spelled the greatgrandfather of nathaniel hawthorne was a magistrate at salem in the latter part of the seventeenth century and officiated at the famous trials for witchcraft held there
it is of record that he used peculiar severity towards a certain woman who was among the accused and the husband of this woman prophesied that god would take revenge upon his wifes persecutors
this circumstance doubtless furnished a hint for that piece of tradition in the book which represents a pyncheon of a former generation as having persecuted one maule who declared that god would give his enemy blood to drink it became a conviction with the hawthorne family that a curse had been pronounced upon its members which continued in force in the time of the romancer a conviction perhaps derived from the recorded prophecy of the injured womans husband just mentioned and here again we have a correspondence with maules malediction in the story
furthermore there occurs in the american notebooks august   a reminiscence of the authors family to the following effect
philip english a character wellknown in early salem annals was among those who suffered from john hathornes magisterial harshness and he maintained in consequence a lasting feud with the old puritan official
but at his death english left daughters one of whom is said to have married the son of justice john hathorne whom english had declared he would never forgive
it is scarcely necessary to point out how clearly this foreshadows the final union of those hereditary foes the pyncheons and maules through the marriage of phbe and holgrave
the romance however describes the maules as possessing some of the traits known to have been characteristic of the hawthornes for example so long as any of the race were to be found they had been marked out from other mennot strikingly nor as with a sharp line but with an effect that was felt rather than spoken ofby an hereditary characteristic of reserve thus while the general suggestion of the hawthorne line and its fortunes was followed in the romance the pyncheons taking the place of the authors family certain distinguishing marks of the hawthornes were assigned to the imaginary maule posterity
there are one or two other points which indicate hawthornes method of basing his compositions the result in the main of pure invention on the solid ground of particular facts
allusion is made in the first chapter of the seven gables to a grant of lands in waldo county maine owned by the pyncheon family
in the american notebooks there is an entry dated august   which speaks of the revolutionary general knox and his landgrant in waldo county by virtue of which the owner had hoped to establish an estate on the english plan with a tenantry to make it profitable for him
an incident of much greater importance in the story is the supposed murder of one of the pyncheons by his nephew to whom we are introduced as clifford pyncheon
in all probability hawthorne connected with this in his mind the murder of mr white a wealthy gentleman of salem killed by a man whom his nephew had hired
this took place a few years after hawthornes graduation from college and was one of the celebrated cases of the day daniel webster taking part prominently in the trial
but it should be observed here that such resemblances as these between sundry elements in the work of hawthornes fancy and details of reality are only fragmentary and are rearranged to suit the authors purposes
in the same way he has made his description of hepzibah pyncheons sevengabled mansion conform so nearly to several old dwellings formerly or still extant in salem that strenuous efforts have been made to fix upon some one of them as the veritable edifice of the romance
a paragraph in the opening chapter has perhaps assisted this delusion that there must have been a single original house of the seven gables framed by fleshandblood carpenters for it runs thus  familiar as it stands in the writers recollectionfor it has been an object of curiosity with him from boyhood both as a specimen of the best and stateliest architecture of a longpast epoch and as the scene of events more full of interest perhaps than those of a gray feudal castlefamiliar as it stands in its rusty old age it is therefore only the more difficult to imagine the bright novelty with which it first caught the sunshine  hundreds of pilgrims annually visit a house in salem belonging to one branch of the ingersoll family of that place which is stoutly maintained to have been the model for hawthornes visionary dwelling
others have supposed that the now vanished house of the identical philip english whose blood as we have already noticed became mingled with that of the hawthornes supplied the pattern and still a third building known as the curwen mansion has been declared the only genuine establishment
notwithstanding persistent popular belief the authenticity of all these must positively be denied although it is possible that isolated reminiscences of all three may have blended with the ideal image in the mind of hawthorne
he it will be seen remarks in the preface alluding to himself in the third person that he trusts not to be condemned for laying out a street that infringes upon nobodys private rights and building a house of materials long in use for constructing castles in the air more than this he stated to persons still living that the house of the romance was not copied from any actual edifice but was simply a general reproduction of a style of architecture belonging to colonial days examples of which survived into the period of his youth but have since been radically modified or destroyed
here as elsewhere he exercised the liberty of a creative mind to heighten the probability of his pictures without confining himself to a literal description of something he had seen
while hawthorne remained at lenox and during the composition of this romance various other literary personages settled or stayed for a time in the vicinity among them herman melville whose intercourse hawthorne greatly enjoyed henry james sr doctor holmes j t headley james russell lowell edwin p whipple frederika bremer and j t fields so that there was no lack of intellectual society in the midst of the beautiful and inspiring mountain scenery of the place
in the afternoons nowadays he records shortly before beginning the work this valley in which i dwell seems like a vast basin filled with golden sunshine as with wine and happy in the companionship of his wife and their three children he led a simple refined idyllic life despite the restrictions of a scanty and uncertain income
a letter written by mrs hawthorne at this time to a member of her family gives incidentally a glimpse of the scene which may properly find a place here
she says i delight to think that you also can look forth as i do now upon a broad valley and a fine amphitheater of hills and are about to watch the stately ceremony of the sunset from your piazza
but you have not this lovely lake nor i suppose the delicate purple mist which folds these slumbering mountains in airy veils
mr hawthorne has been lying down in the sun shine slightly fleckered with the shadows of a tree and una and julian have been making him look like the mighty pan by covering his chin and breast with long grassblades that looked like a verdant and venerable beard the pleasantness and peace of his surroundings and of his modest home in lenox may be taken into account as harmonizing with the mellow serenity of the romance then produced
of the work when it appeared in the early spring of  he wrote to horatio bridge these words now published for the first time  the house of the seven gables in my opinion is better than the scarlet letter but i should not wonder if i had refined upon the principal character a little too much for popular appreciation nor if the romance of the book should be somewhat at odds with the humble and familiar scenery in which i invest it
but i feel that portions of it are as good as anything i can hope to write and the publisher speaks encouragingly of its success  from england especially came many warm expressions of praisea fact which mrs hawthorne in a private letter commented on as the fulfillment of a possibility which hawthorne writing in boyhood to his mother had looked forward to
he had asked her if she would not like him to become an author and have his books read in england
g p l     preface
when a writer calls his work a romance it need hardly be observed that he wishes to claim a certain latitude both as to its fashion and material which he would not have felt himself entitled to assume had he professed to be writing a novel
the latter form of composition is presumed to aim at a very minute fidelity not merely to the possible but to the probable and ordinary course of mans experience
the formerwhile as a work of art it must rigidly subject itself to laws and while it sins unpardonably so far as it may swerve aside from the truth of the human hearthas fairly a right to present that truth under circumstances to a great extent of the writers own choosing or creation
if he think fit also he may so manage his atmospherical medium as to bring out or mellow the lights and deepen and enrich the shadows of the picture
he will be wise no doubt to make a very moderate use of the privileges here stated and especially to mingle the marvelous rather as a slight delicate and evanescent flavor than as any portion of the actual substance of the dish offered to the public
he can hardly be said however to commit a literary crime even if he disregard this caution
in the present work the author has proposed to himselfbut with what success fortunately it is not for him to judgeto keep undeviatingly within his immunities
the point of view in which this tale comes under the romantic definition lies in the attempt to connect a bygone time with the very present that is flitting away from us
it is a legend prolonging itself from an epoch now gray in the distance down into our own broad daylight and bringing along with it some of its legendary mist which the reader according to his pleasure may either disregard or allow it to float almost imperceptibly about the characters and events for the sake of a picturesque effect
the narrative it may be is woven of so humble a texture as to require this advantage and at the same time to render it the more difficult of attainment
many writers lay very great stress upon some definite moral purpose at which they profess to aim their works
not to be deficient in this particular the author has provided himself with a moralthe truth namely that the wrongdoing of one generation lives into the successive ones and divesting itself of every temporary advantage becomes a pure and uncontrollable mischief and he would feel it a singular gratification if this romance might effectually convince mankindor indeed any one manof the folly of tumbling down an avalanche of illgotten gold or real estate on the heads of an unfortunate posterity thereby to maim and crush them until the accumulated mass shall be scattered abroad in its original atoms
in good faith however he is not sufficiently imaginative to flatter himself with the slightest hope of this kind
when romances do really teach anything or produce any effective operation it is usually through a far more subtile process than the ostensible one
the author has considered it hardly worth his while therefore relentlessly to impale the story with its moral as with an iron rodor rather as by sticking a pin through a butterflythus at once depriving it of life and causing it to stiffen in an ungainly and unnatural attitude
a high truth indeed fairly finely and skilfully wrought out brightening at every step and crowning the final development of a work of fiction may add an artistic glory but is never any truer and seldom any more evident at the last page than at the first
the reader may perhaps choose to assign an actual locality to the imaginary events of this narrative
if permitted by the historical connectionwhich though slight was essential to his planthe author would very willingly have avoided anything of this nature
not to speak of other objections it exposes the romance to an inflexible and exceedingly dangerous species of criticism by bringing his fancypictures almost into positive contact with the realities of the moment
it has been no part of his object however to describe local manners nor in any way to meddle with the characteristics of a community for whom he cherishes a proper respect and a natural regard
he trusts not to be considered as unpardonably offending by laying out a street that infringes upon nobodys private rights and appropriating a lot of land which had no visible owner and building a house of materials long in use for constructing castles in the air
the personages of the talethough they give themselves out to be of ancient stability and considerable prominenceare really of the authors own making or at all events of his own mixing their virtues can shed no lustre nor their defects redound in the remotest degree to the discredit of the venerable town of which they profess to be inhabitants
he would be glad therefore ifespecially in the quarter to which he alludesthe book may be read strictly as a romance having a great deal more to do with the clouds overhead than with any portion of the actual soil of the county of essex
lenox january  
the house of the seven gables     i
the old pyncheon family   halfway down a bystreet of one of our new england towns stands a rusty wooden house with seven acutely peaked gables facing towards various points of the compass and a huge clustered chimney in the midst
the street is pyncheon street the house is the old pyncheon house and an elmtree of wide circumference rooted before the door is familiar to every townborn child by the title of the pyncheon elm
on my occasional visits to the town aforesaid i seldom failed to turn down pyncheon street for the sake of passing through the shadow of these two antiquitiesthe great elmtree and the weatherbeaten edifice
the aspect of the venerable mansion has always affected me like a human countenance bearing the traces not merely of outward storm and sunshine but expressive also of the long lapse of mortal life and accompanying vicissitudes that have passed within
were these to be worthily recounted they would form a narrative of no small interest and instruction and possessing moreover a certain remarkable unity which might almost seem the result of artistic arrangement
but the story would include a chain of events extending over the better part of two centuries and written out with reasonable amplitude would fill a bigger folio volume or a longer series of duodecimos than could prudently be appropriated to the annals of all new england during a similar period
it consequently becomes imperative to make short work with most of the traditionary lore of which the old pyncheon house otherwise known as the house of the seven gables has been the theme
with a brief sketch therefore of the circumstances amid which the foundation of the house was laid and a rapid glimpse at its quaint exterior as it grew black in the prevalent east windpointing too here and there at some spot of more verdant mossiness on its roof and wallswe shall commence the real action of our tale at an epoch not very remote from the present day
still there will be a connection with the long pasta reference to forgotten events and personages and to manners feelings and opinions almost or wholly obsoletewhich if adequately translated to the reader would serve to illustrate how much of old material goes to make up the freshest novelty of human life
hence too might be drawn a weighty lesson from the littleregarded truth that the act of the passing generation is the germ which may and must produce good or evil fruit in a fardistant time that together with the seed of the merely temporary crop which mortals term expediency they inevitably sow the acorns of a more enduring growth which may darkly overshadow their posterity
the house of the seven gables antique as it now looks was not the first habitation erected by civilized man on precisely the same spot of ground
pyncheon street formerly bore the humbler appellation of maules lane from the name of the original occupant of the soil before whose cottagedoor it was a cowpath
a natural spring of soft and pleasant watera rare treasure on the seagirt peninsula where the puritan settlement was madehad early induced matthew maule to build a hut shaggy with thatch at this point although somewhat too remote from what was then the centre of the village
in the growth of the town however after some thirty or forty years the site covered by this rude hovel had become exceedingly desirable in the eyes of a prominent and powerful personage who asserted plausible claims to the proprietorship of this and a large adjacent tract of land on the strength of a grant from the legislature
colonel pyncheon the claimant as we gather from whatever traits of him are preserved was characterized by an iron energy of purpose
matthew maule on the other hand though an obscure man was stubborn in the defence of what he considered his right and for several years he succeeded in protecting the acre or two of earth which with his own toil he had hewn out of the primeval forest to be his garden ground and homestead
no written record of this dispute is known to be in existence
our acquaintance with the whole subject is derived chiefly from tradition
it would be bold therefore and possibly unjust to venture a decisive opinion as to its merits although it appears to have been at least a matter of doubt whether colonel pyncheons claim were not unduly stretched in order to make it cover the small metes and bounds of matthew maule
what greatly strengthens such a suspicion is the fact that this controversy between two illmatched antagonistsat a period moreover laud it as we may when personal influence had far more weight than nowremained for years undecided and came to a close only with the death of the party occupying the disputed soil
the mode of his death too affects the mind differently in our day from what it did a century and a half ago
it was a death that blasted with strange horror the humble name of the dweller in the cottage and made it seem almost a religious act to drive the plough over the little area of his habitation and obliterate his place and memory from among men
old matthew maule in a word was executed for the crime of witchcraft
he was one of the martyrs to that terrible delusion which should teach us among its other morals that the influential classes and those who take upon themselves to be leaders of the people are fully liable to all the passionate error that has ever characterized the maddest mob
clergymen judges statesmenthe wisest calmest holiest persons of their day stood in the inner circle round about the gallows loudest to applaud the work of blood latest to confess themselves miserably deceived
if any one part of their proceedings can be said to deserve less blame than another it was the singular indiscrimination with which they persecuted not merely the poor and aged as in former judicial massacres but people of all ranks their own equals brethren and wives
amid the disorder of such various ruin it is not strange that a man of inconsiderable note like maule should have trodden the martyrs path to the hill of execution almost unremarked in the throng of his fellow sufferers
but in after days when the frenzy of that hideous epoch had subsided it was remembered how loudly colonel pyncheon had joined in the general cry to purge the land from witchcraft nor did it fail to be whispered that there was an invidious acrimony in the zeal with which he had sought the condemnation of matthew maule
it was well known that the victim had recognized the bitterness of personal enmity in his persecutors conduct towards him and that he declared himself hunted to death for his spoil
at the moment of executionwith the halter about his neck and while colonel pyncheon sat on horseback grimly gazing at the scene maule had addressed him from the scaffold and uttered a prophecy of which history as well as fireside tradition has preserved the very words
god said the dying man pointing his finger with a ghastly look at the undismayed countenance of his enemygod will give him blood to drink  after the reputed wizards death his humble homestead had fallen an easy spoil into colonel pyncheons grasp
when it was understood however that the colonel intended to erect a family mansionspacious ponderously framed of oaken timber and calculated to endure for many generations of his posterity over the spot first covered by the logbuilt hut of matthew maule there was much shaking of the head among the village gossips
without absolutely expressing a doubt whether the stalwart puritan had acted as a man of conscience and integrity throughout the proceedings which have been sketched they nevertheless hinted that he was about to build his house over an unquiet grave
his home would include the home of the dead and buried wizard and would thus afford the ghost of the latter a kind of privilege to haunt its new apartments and the chambers into which future bridegrooms were to lead their brides and where children of the pyncheon blood were to be born
the terror and ugliness of maules crime and the wretchedness of his punishment would darken the freshly plastered walls and infect them early with the scent of an old and melancholy house
why thenwhile so much of the soil around him was bestrewn with the virgin forest leaveswhy should colonel pyncheon prefer a site that had already been accurst
but the puritan soldier and magistrate was not a man to be turned aside from his wellconsidered scheme either by dread of the wizards ghost or by flimsy sentimentalities of any kind however specious
had he been told of a bad air it might have moved him somewhat but he was ready to encounter an evil spirit on his own ground
endowed with commonsense as massive and hard as blocks of granite fastened together by stern rigidity of purpose as with iron clamps he followed out his original design probably without so much as imagining an objection to it
on the score of delicacy or any scrupulousness which a finer sensibility might have taught him the colonel like most of his breed and generation was impenetrable
he therefore dug his cellar and laid the deep foundations of his mansion on the square of earth whence matthew maule forty years before had first swept away the fallen leaves
it was a curious and as some people thought an ominous fact that very soon after the workmen began their operations the spring of water above mentioned entirely lost the deliciousness of its pristine quality
whether its sources were disturbed by the depth of the new cellar or whatever subtler cause might lurk at the bottom it is certain that the water of maules well as it continued to be called grew hard and brackish
even such we find it now and any old woman of the neighborhood will certify that it is productive of intestinal mischief to those who quench their thirst there
the reader may deem it singular that the head carpenter of the new edifice was no other than the son of the very man from whose dead gripe the property of the soil had been wrested
not improbably he was the best workman of his time or perhaps the colonel thought it expedient or was impelled by some better feeling thus openly to cast aside all animosity against the race of his fallen antagonist
nor was it out of keeping with the general coarseness and matteroffact character of the age that the son should be willing to earn an honest penny or rather a weighty amount of sterling pounds from the purse of his fathers deadly enemy
at all events thomas maule became the architect of the house of the seven gables and performed his duty so faithfully that the timber framework fastened by his hands still holds together
thus the great house was built
familiar as it stands in the writers recollectionfor it has been an object of curiosity with him from boyhood both as a specimen of the best and stateliest architecture of a longpast epoch and as the scene of events more full of human interest perhaps than those of a gray feudal castlefamiliar as it stands in its rusty old age it is therefore only the more difficult to imagine the bright novelty with which it first caught the sunshine
the impression of its actual state at this distance of a hundred and sixty years darkens inevitably through the picture which we would fain give of its appearance on the morning when the puritan magnate bade all the town to be his guests
a ceremony of consecration festive as well as religious was now to be performed
a prayer and discourse from the rev
mr higginson and the outpouring of a psalm from the general throat of the community was to be made acceptable to the grosser sense by ale cider wine and brandy in copious effusion and as some authorities aver by an ox roasted whole or at least by the weight and substance of an ox in more manageable joints and sirloins
the carcass of a deer shot within twenty miles had supplied material for the vast circumference of a pasty
a codfish of sixty pounds caught in the bay had been dissolved into the rich liquid of a chowder
the chimney of the new house in short belching forth its kitchen smoke impregnated the whole air with the scent of meats fowls and fishes spicily concocted with odoriferous herbs and onions in abundance
the mere smell of such festivity making its way to everybodys nostrils was at once an invitation and an appetite
maules lane or pyncheon street as it were now more decorous to call it was thronged at the appointed hour as with a congregation on its way to church
all as they approached looked upward at the imposing edifice which was henceforth to assume its rank among the habitations of mankind
there it rose a little withdrawn from the line of the street but in pride not modesty
its whole visible exterior was ornamented with quaint figures conceived in the grotesqueness of a gothic fancy and drawn or stamped in the glittering plaster composed of lime pebbles and bits of glass with which the woodwork of the walls was overspread
on every side the seven gables pointed sharply towards the sky and presented the aspect of a whole sisterhood of edifices breathing through the spiracles of one great chimney
the many lattices with their small diamondshaped panes admitted the sunlight into hall and chamber while nevertheless the second story projecting far over the base and itself retiring beneath the third threw a shadowy and thoughtful gloom into the lower rooms
carved globes of wood were affixed under the jutting stories
little spiral rods of iron beautified each of the seven peaks
on the triangular portion of the gable that fronted next the street was a dial put up that very morning and on which the sun was still marking the passage of the first bright hour in a history that was not destined to be all so bright
all around were scattered shavings chips shingles and broken halves of bricks these together with the lately turned earth on which the grass had not begun to grow contributed to the impression of strangeness and novelty proper to a house that had yet its place to make among mens daily interests
the principal entrance which had almost the breadth of a churchdoor was in the angle between the two front gables and was covered by an open porch with benches beneath its shelter
under this arched doorway scraping their feet on the unworn threshold now trod the clergymen the elders the magistrates the deacons and whatever of aristocracy there was in town or county
thither too thronged the plebeian classes as freely as their betters and in larger number
just within the entrance however stood two servingmen pointing some of the guests to the neighborhood of the kitchen and ushering others into the statelier roomshospitable alike to all but still with a scrutinizing regard to the high or low degree of each
velvet garments sombre but rich stiffly plaited ruffs and bands embroidered gloves venerable beards the mien and countenance of authority made it easy to distinguish the gentleman of worship at that period from the tradesman with his plodding air or the laborer in his leathern jerkin stealing awestricken into the house which he had perhaps helped to build
one inauspicious circumstance there was which awakened a hardly concealed displeasure in the breasts of a few of the more punctilious visitors
the founder of this stately mansiona gentleman noted for the square and ponderous courtesy of his demeanor ought surely to have stood in his own hall and to have offered the first welcome to so many eminent personages as here presented themselves in honor of his solemn festival
he was as yet invisible the most favored of the guests had not beheld him
this sluggishness on colonel pyncheons part became still more unaccountable when the second dignitary of the province made his appearance and found no more ceremonious a reception
the lieutenantgovernor although his visit was one of the anticipated glories of the day had alighted from his horse and assisted his lady from her sidesaddle and crossed the colonels threshold without other greeting than that of the principal domestic
this persona grayheaded man of quiet and most respectful deportmentfound it necessary to explain that his master still remained in his study or private apartment on entering which an hour before he had expressed a wish on no account to be disturbed
do not you see fellow said the highsheriff of the county taking the servant aside that this is no less a man than the lieutenantgovernor
summon colonel pyncheon at once
i know that he received letters from england this morning and in the perusal and consideration of them an hour may have passed away without his noticing it
but he will be illpleased i judge if you suffer him to neglect the courtesy due to one of our chief rulers and who may be said to represent king william in the absence of the governor himself
call your master instantly  nay please your worship answered the man in much perplexity but with a backwardness that strikingly indicated the hard and severe character of colonel pyncheons domestic rule my masters orders were exceeding strict and as your worship knows he permits of no discretion in the obedience of those who owe him service
let who list open yonder door i dare not though the governors own voice should bid me do it  pooh pooh master high sheriff cried the lieutenantgovernor who had overheard the foregoing discussion and felt himself high enough in station to play a little with his dignity
i will take the matter into my own hands
it is time that the good colonel came forth to greet his friends else we shall be apt to suspect that he has taken a sip too much of his canary wine in his extreme deliberation which cask it were best to broach in honor of the day
but since he is so much behindhand i will give him a remembrancer myself  accordingly with such a tramp of his ponderous ridingboots as might of itself have been audible in the remotest of the seven gables he advanced to the door which the servant pointed out and made its new panels reecho with a loud free knock
then looking round with a smile to the spectators he awaited a response
as none came however he knocked again but with the same unsatisfactory result as at first
and now being a trifle choleric in his temperament the lieutenantgovernor uplifted the heavy hilt of his sword wherewith he so beat and banged upon the door that as some of the bystanders whispered the racket might have disturbed the dead
be that as it might it seemed to produce no awakening effect on colonel pyncheon
when the sound subsided the silence through the house was deep dreary and oppressive notwithstanding that the tongues of many of the guests had already been loosened by a surreptitious cup or two of wine or spirits
strange forsoothvery strange cried the lieutenantgovernor whose smile was changed to a frown
but seeing that our host sets us the good example of forgetting ceremony i shall likewise throw it aside and make free to intrude on his privacy  he tried the door which yielded to his hand and was flung wide open by a sudden gust of wind that passed as with a loud sigh from the outermost portal through all the passages and apartments of the new house
it rustled the silken garments of the ladies and waved the long curls of the gentlemens wigs and shook the windowhangings and the curtains of the bedchambers causing everywhere a singular stir which yet was more like a hush
a shadow of awe and halffearful anticipationnobody knew wherefore nor of whathad all at once fallen over the company
they thronged however to the now open door pressing the lieutenantgovernor in the eagerness of their curiosity into the room in advance of them
at the first glimpse they beheld nothing extraordinary a handsomely furnished room of moderate size somewhat darkened by curtains books arranged on shelves a large map on the wall and likewise a portrait of colonel pyncheon beneath which sat the original colonel himself in an oaken elbowchair with a pen in his hand
letters parchments and blank sheets of paper were on the table before him
he appeared to gaze at the curious crowd in front of which stood the lieutenantgovernor and there was a frown on his dark and massive countenance as if sternly resentful of the boldness that had impelled them into his private retirement
a little boythe colonels grandchild and the only human being that ever dared to be familiar with himnow made his way among the guests and ran towards the seated figure then pausing halfway he began to shriek with terror
the company tremulous as the leaves of a tree when all are shaking together drew nearer and perceived that there was an unnatural distortion in the fixedness of colonel pyncheons stare that there was blood on his ruff and that his hoary beard was saturated with it
it was too late to give assistance
the ironhearted puritan the relentless persecutor the grasping and strongwilled man was dead
dead in his new house
there is a tradition only worth alluding to as lending a tinge of superstitious awe to a scene perhaps gloomy enough without it that a voice spoke loudly among the guests the tones of which were like those of old matthew maule the executed wizardgod hath given him blood to drink  thus early had that one guestthe only guest who is certain at one time or another to find his way into every human dwellingthus early had death stepped across the threshold of the house of the seven gables
colonel pyncheons sudden and mysterious end made a vast deal of noise in its day
there were many rumors some of which have vaguely drifted down to the present time how that appearances indicated violence that there were the marks of fingers on his throat and the print of a bloody hand on his plaited ruff and that his peaked beard was dishevelled as if it had been fiercely clutched and pulled
it was averred likewise that the lattice window near the colonels chair was open and that only a few minutes before the fatal occurrence the figure of a man had been seen clambering over the garden fence in the rear of the house
but it were folly to lay any stress on stories of this kind which are sure to spring up around such an event as that now related and which as in the present case sometimes prolong themselves for ages afterwards like the toadstools that indicate where the fallen and buried trunk of a tree has long since mouldered into the earth
for our own part we allow them just as little credence as to that other fable of the skeleton hand which the lieutenantgovernor was said to have seen at the colonels throat but which vanished away as he advanced farther into the room
certain it is however that there was a great consultation and dispute of doctors over the dead body
onejohn swinnerton by namewho appears to have been a man of eminence upheld it if we have rightly understood his terms of art to be a case of apoplexy
his professional brethren each for himself adopted various hypotheses more or less plausible but all dressed out in a perplexing mystery of phrase which if it do not show a bewilderment of mind in these erudite physicians certainly causes it in the unlearned peruser of their opinions
the coroners jury sat upon the corpse and like sensible men returned an unassailable verdict of sudden death  it is indeed difficult to imagine that there could have been a serious suspicion of murder or the slightest grounds for implicating any particular individual as the perpetrator
the rank wealth and eminent character of the deceased must have insured the strictest scrutiny into every ambiguous circumstance
as none such is on record it is safe to assume that none existed
traditionwhich sometimes brings down truth that history has let slip but is oftener the wild babble of the time such as was formerly spoken at the fireside and now congeals in newspaperstradition is responsible for all contrary averments
in colonel pyncheons funeral sermon which was printed and is still extant the rev
mr higginson enumerates among the many felicities of his distinguished parishioners earthly career the happy seasonableness of his death
his duties all performedthe highest prosperity attainedhis race and future generations fixed on a stable basis and with a stately roof to shelter them for centuries to comewhat other upward step remained for this good man to take save the final step from earth to the golden gate of heaven
the pious clergyman surely would not have uttered words like these had he in the least suspected that the colonel had been thrust into the other world with the clutch of violence upon his throat
the family of colonel pyncheon at the epoch of his death seemed destined to as fortunate a permanence as can anywise consist with the inherent instability of human affairs
it might fairly be anticipated that the progress of time would rather increase and ripen their prosperity than wear away and destroy it
for not only had his son and heir come into immediate enjoyment of a rich estate but there was a claim through an indian deed confirmed by a subsequent grant of the general court to a vast and as yet unexplored and unmeasured tract of eastern lands
these possessionsfor as such they might almost certainly be reckonedcomprised the greater part of what is now known as waldo county in the state of maine and were more extensive than many a dukedom or even a reigning princes territory on european soil
when the pathless forest that still covered this wild principality should give placeas it inevitably must though perhaps not till ages henceto the golden fertility of human culture it would be the source of incalculable wealth to the pyncheon blood
had the colonel survived only a few weeks longer it is probable that his great political influence and powerful connections at home and abroad would have consummated all that was necessary to render the claim available
but in spite of good mr higginsons congratulatory eloquence this appeared to be the one thing which colonel pyncheon provident and sagacious as he was had allowed to go at loose ends
so far as the prospective territory was concerned he unquestionably died too soon
his son lacked not merely the fathers eminent position but the talent and force of character to achieve it he could therefore effect nothing by dint of political interest and the bare justice or legality of the claim was not so apparent after the colonels decease as it had been pronounced in his lifetime
some connecting link had slipped out of the evidence and could not anywhere be found
efforts it is true were made by the pyncheons not only then but at various periods for nearly a hundred years afterwards to obtain what they stubbornly persisted in deeming their right
but in course of time the territory was partly regranted to more favored individuals and partly cleared and occupied by actual settlers
these last if they ever heard of the pyncheon title would have laughed at the idea of any mans asserting a righton the strength of mouldy parchments signed with the faded autographs of governors and legislators long dead and forgottento the lands which they or their fathers had wrested from the wild hand of nature by their own sturdy toil
this impalpable claim therefore resulted in nothing more solid than to cherish from generation to generation an absurd delusion of family importance which all along characterized the pyncheons
it caused the poorest member of the race to feel as if he inherited a kind of nobility and might yet come into the possession of princely wealth to support it
in the better specimens of the breed this peculiarity threw an ideal grace over the hard material of human life without stealing away any truly valuable quality
in the baser sort its effect was to increase the liability to sluggishness and dependence and induce the victim of a shadowy hope to remit all selfeffort while awaiting the realization of his dreams
years and years after their claim had passed out of the public memory the pyncheons were accustomed to consult the colonels ancient map which had been projected while waldo county was still an unbroken wilderness
where the old land surveyor had put down woods lakes and rivers they marked out the cleared spaces and dotted the villages and towns and calculated the progressively increasing value of the territory as if there were yet a prospect of its ultimately forming a princedom for themselves
in almost every generation nevertheless there happened to be some one descendant of the family gifted with a portion of the hard keen sense and practical energy that had so remarkably distinguished the original founder
his character indeed might be traced all the way down as distinctly as if the colonel himself a little diluted had been gifted with a sort of intermittent immortality on earth
at two or three epochs when the fortunes of the family were low this representative of hereditary qualities had made his appearance and caused the traditionary gossips of the town to whisper among themselves here is the old pyncheon come again
now the seven gables will be newshingled from father to son they clung to the ancestral house with singular tenacity of home attachment
for various reasons however and from impressions often too vaguely founded to be put on paper the writer cherishes the belief that many if not most of the successive proprietors of this estate were troubled with doubts as to their moral right to hold it
of their legal tenure there could be no question but old matthew maule it is to be feared trode downward from his own age to a far later one planting a heavy footstep all the way on the conscience of a pyncheon
if so we are left to dispose of the awful query whether each inheritor of the propertyconscious of wrong and failing to rectify itdid not commit anew the great guilt of his ancestor and incur all its original responsibilities
and supposing such to be the case would it not be a far truer mode of expression to say of the pyncheon family that they inherited a great misfortune than the reverse
we have already hinted that it is not our purpose to trace down the history of the pyncheon family in its unbroken connection with the house of the seven gables nor to show as in a magic picture how the rustiness and infirmity of age gathered over the venerable house itself
as regards its interior life a large dim lookingglass used to hang in one of the rooms and was fabled to contain within its depths all the shapes that had ever been reflected therethe old colonel himself and his many descendants some in the garb of antique babyhood and others in the bloom of feminine beauty or manly prime or saddened with the wrinkles of frosty age
had we the secret of that mirror we would gladly sit down before it and transfer its revelations to our page
but there was a story for which it is difficult to conceive any foundation that the posterity of matthew maule had some connection with the mystery of the lookingglass and that by what appears to have been a sort of mesmeric process they could make its inner region all alive with the departed pyncheons not as they had shown themselves to the world nor in their better and happier hours but as doing over again some deed of sin or in the crisis of lifes bitterest sorrow
the popular imagination indeed long kept itself busy with the affair of the old puritan pyncheon and the wizard maule the curse which the latter flung from his scaffold was remembered with the very important addition that it had become a part of the pyncheon inheritance
if one of the family did but gurgle in his throat a bystander would be likely enough to whisper between jest and earnest he has maules blood to drink the sudden death of a pyncheon about a hundred years ago with circumstances very similar to what have been related of the colonels exit was held as giving additional probability to the received opinion on this topic
it was considered moreover an ugly and ominous circumstance that colonel pyncheons picturein obedience it was said to a provision of his willremained affixed to the wall of the room in which he died
those stern immitigable features seemed to symbolize an evil influence and so darkly to mingle the shadow of their presence with the sunshine of the passing hour that no good thoughts or purposes could ever spring up and blossom there
to the thoughtful mind there will be no tinge of superstition in what we figuratively express by affirming that the ghost of a dead progenitorperhaps as a portion of his own punishmentis often doomed to become the evil genius of his family
the pyncheons in brief lived along for the better part of two centuries with perhaps less of outward vicissitude than has attended most other new england families during the same period of time
possessing very distinctive traits of their own they nevertheless took the general characteristics of the little community in which they dwelt a town noted for its frugal discreet wellordered and homeloving inhabitants as well as for the somewhat confined scope of its sympathies but in which be it said there are odder individuals and now and then stranger occurrences than one meets with almost anywhere else
during the revolution the pyncheon of that epoch adopting the royal side became a refugee but repented and made his reappearance just at the point of time to preserve the house of the seven gables from confiscation
for the last seventy years the most noted event in the pyncheon annals had been likewise the heaviest calamity that ever befell the race no less than the violent deathfor so it was adjudgedof one member of the family by the criminal act of another
certain circumstances attending this fatal occurrence had brought the deed irresistibly home to a nephew of the deceased pyncheon
the young man was tried and convicted of the crime but either the circumstantial nature of the evidence and possibly some lurking doubts in the breast of the executive or lastlyan argument of greater weight in a republic than it could have been under a monarchythe high respectability and political influence of the criminals connections had availed to mitigate his doom from death to perpetual imprisonment
this sad affair had chanced about thirty years before the action of our story commences
latterly there were rumors which few believed and only one or two felt greatly interested in that this longburied man was likely for some reason or other to be summoned forth from his living tomb
it is essential to say a few words respecting the victim of this now almost forgotten murder
he was an old bachelor and possessed of great wealth in addition to the house and real estate which constituted what remained of the ancient pyncheon property
being of an eccentric and melancholy turn of mind and greatly given to rummaging old records and hearkening to old traditions he had brought himself it is averred to the conclusion that matthew maule the wizard had been foully wronged out of his homestead if not out of his life
such being the case and he the old bachelor in possession of the illgotten spoilwith the black stain of blood sunken deep into it and still to be scented by conscientious nostrilsthe question occurred whether it were not imperative upon him even at this late hour to make restitution to maules posterity
to a man living so much in the past and so little in the present as the secluded and antiquarian old bachelor a century and a half seemed not so vast a period as to obviate the propriety of substituting right for wrong
it was the belief of those who knew him best that he would positively have taken the very singular step of giving up the house of the seven gables to the representative of matthew maule but for the unspeakable tumult which a suspicion of the old gentlemans project awakened among his pyncheon relatives
their exertions had the effect of suspending his purpose but it was feared that he would perform after death by the operation of his last will what he had so hardly been prevented from doing in his proper lifetime
but there is no one thing which men so rarely do whatever the provocation or inducement as to bequeath patrimonial property away from their own blood
they may love other individuals far better than their relativesthey may even cherish dislike or positive hatred to the latter but yet in view of death the strong prejudice of propinquity revives and impels the testator to send down his estate in the line marked out by custom so immemorial that it looks like nature
in all the pyncheons this feeling had the energy of disease
it was too powerful for the conscientious scruples of the old bachelor at whose death accordingly the mansionhouse together with most of his other riches passed into the possession of his next legal representative
this was a nephew the cousin of the miserable young man who had been convicted of the uncles murder
the new heir up to the period of his accession was reckoned rather a dissipated youth but had at once reformed and made himself an exceedingly respectable member of society
in fact he showed more of the pyncheon quality and had won higher eminence in the world than any of his race since the time of the original puritan
applying himself in earlier manhood to the study of the law and having a natural tendency towards office he had attained many years ago to a judicial situation in some inferior court which gave him for life the very desirable and imposing title of judge
later he had engaged in politics and served a part of two terms in congress besides making a considerable figure in both branches of the state legislature
judge pyncheon was unquestionably an honor to his race
he had built himself a countryseat within a few miles of his native town and there spent such portions of his time as could be spared from public service in the display of every grace and virtueas a newspaper phrased it on the eve of an electionbefitting the christian the good citizen the horticulturist and the gentleman
there were few of the pyncheons left to sun themselves in the glow of the judges prosperity
in respect to natural increase the breed had not thriven it appeared rather to be dying out
the only members of the family known to be extant were first the judge himself and a single surviving son who was now travelling in europe next the thirty years prisoner already alluded to and a sister of the latter who occupied in an extremely retired manner the house of the seven gables in which she had a lifeestate by the will of the old bachelor
she was understood to be wretchedly poor and seemed to make it her choice to remain so inasmuch as her affluent cousin the judge had repeatedly offered her all the comforts of life either in the old mansion or his own modern residence
the last and youngest pyncheon was a little countrygirl of seventeen the daughter of another of the judges cousins who had married a young woman of no family or property and died early and in poor circumstances
his widow had recently taken another husband
as for matthew maules posterity it was supposed now to be extinct
for a very long period after the witchcraft delusion however the maules had continued to inhabit the town where their progenitor had suffered so unjust a death
to all appearance they were a quiet honest wellmeaning race of people cherishing no malice against individuals or the public for the wrong which had been done them or if at their own fireside they transmitted from father to child any hostile recollection of the wizards fate and their lost patrimony it was never acted upon nor openly expressed
nor would it have been singular had they ceased to remember that the house of the seven gables was resting its heavy framework on a foundation that was rightfully their own
there is something so massive stable and almost irresistibly imposing in the exterior presentment of established rank and great possessions that their very existence seems to give them a right to exist at least so excellent a counterfeit of right that few poor and humble men have moral force enough to question it even in their secret minds
such is the case now after so many ancient prejudices have been overthrown and it was far more so in anterevolutionary days when the aristocracy could venture to be proud and the low were content to be abased
thus the maules at all events kept their resentments within their own breasts
they were generally povertystricken always plebeian and obscure working with unsuccessful diligence at handicrafts laboring on the wharves or following the sea as sailors before the mast living here and there about the town in hired tenements and coming finally to the almshouse as the natural home of their old age
at last after creeping as it were for such a length of time along the utmost verge of the opaque puddle of obscurity they had taken that downright plunge which sooner or later is the destiny of all families whether princely or plebeian
for thirty years past neither townrecord nor gravestone nor the directory nor the knowledge or memory of man bore any trace of matthew maules descendants
his blood might possibly exist elsewhere here where its lowly current could be traced so far back it had ceased to keep an onward course
so long as any of the race were to be found they had been marked out from other mennot strikingly nor as with a sharp line but with an effect that was felt rather than spoken ofby an hereditary character of reserve
their companions or those who endeavored to become such grew conscious of a circle round about the maules within the sanctity or the spell of which in spite of an exterior of sufficient frankness and goodfellowship it was impossible for any man to step
it was this indefinable peculiarity perhaps that by insulating them from human aid kept them always so unfortunate in life
it certainly operated to prolong in their case and to confirm to them as their only inheritance those feelings of repugnance and superstitious terror with which the people of the town even after awakening from their frenzy continued to regard the memory of the reputed witches
the mantle or rather the ragged cloak of old matthew maule had fallen upon his children
they were half believed to inherit mysterious attributes the family eye was said to possess strange power
among other goodfornothing properties and privileges one was especially assigned themthat of exercising an influence over peoples dreams
the pyncheons if all stories were true haughtily as they bore themselves in the noonday streets of their native town were no better than bondservants to these plebeian maules on entering the topsyturvy commonwealth of sleep
modern psychology it may be will endeavor to reduce these alleged necromancies within a system instead of rejecting them as altogether fabulous
a descriptive paragraph or two treating of the sevengabled mansion in its more recent aspect will bring this preliminary chapter to a close
the street in which it upreared its venerable peaks has long ceased to be a fashionable quarter of the town so that though the old edifice was surrounded by habitations of modern date they were mostly small built entirely of wood and typical of the most plodding uniformity of common life
doubtless however the whole story of human existence may be latent in each of them but with no picturesqueness externally that can attract the imagination or sympathy to seek it there
but as for the old structure of our story its whiteoak frame and its boards shingles and crumbling plaster and even the huge clustered chimney in the midst seemed to constitute only the least and meanest part of its reality
so much of mankinds varied experience had passed thereso much had been suffered and something too enjoyedthat the very timbers were oozy as with the moisture of a heart
it was itself like a great human heart with a life of its own and full of rich and sombre reminiscences
the deep projection of the second story gave the house such a meditative look that you could not pass it without the idea that it had secrets to keep and an eventful history to moralize upon
in front just on the edge of the unpaved sidewalk grew the pyncheon elm which in reference to such trees as one usually meets with might well be termed gigantic
it had been planted by a greatgrandson of the first pyncheon and though now fourscore years of age or perhaps nearer a hundred was still in its strong and broad maturity throwing its shadow from side to side of the street overtopping the seven gables and sweeping the whole black roof with its pendant foliage
it gave beauty to the old edifice and seemed to make it a part of nature
the street having been widened about forty years ago the front gable was now precisely on a line with it
on either side extended a ruinous wooden fence of open latticework through which could be seen a grassy yard and especially in the angles of the building an enormous fertility of burdocks with leaves it is hardly an exaggeration to say two or three feet long
behind the house there appeared to be a garden which undoubtedly had once been extensive but was now infringed upon by other enclosures or shut in by habitations and outbuildings that stood on another street
it would be an omission trifling indeed but unpardonable were we to forget the green moss that had long since gathered over the projections of the windows and on the slopes of the roof nor must we fail to direct the readers eye to a crop not of weeds but flowershrubs which were growing aloft in the air not a great way from the chimney in the nook between two of the gables
they were called alices posies
the tradition was that a certain alice pyncheon had flung up the seeds in sport and that the dust of the street and the decay of the roof gradually formed a kind of soil for them out of which they grew when alice had long been in her grave
however the flowers might have come there it was both sad and sweet to observe how nature adopted to herself this desolate decaying gusty rusty old house of the pyncheon family and how the everreturning summer did her best to gladden it with tender beauty and grew melancholy in the effort
there is one other feature very essential to be noticed but which we greatly fear may damage any picturesque and romantic impression which we have been willing to throw over our sketch of this respectable edifice
in the front gable under the impending brow of the second story and contiguous to the street was a shopdoor divided horizontally in the midst and with a window for its upper segment such as is often seen in dwellings of a somewhat ancient date
this same shopdoor had been a subject of no slight mortification to the present occupant of the august pyncheon house as well as to some of her predecessors
the matter is disagreeably delicate to handle but since the reader must needs be let into the secret he will please to understand that about a century ago the head of the pyncheons found himself involved in serious financial difficulties
the fellow gentleman as he styled himself can hardly have been other than a spurious interloper for instead of seeking office from the king or the royal governor or urging his hereditary claim to eastern lands he bethought himself of no better avenue to wealth than by cutting a shopdoor through the side of his ancestral residence
it was the custom of the time indeed for merchants to store their goods and transact business in their own dwellings
but there was something pitifully small in this old pyncheons mode of setting about his commercial operations it was whispered that with his own hands all beruffled as they were he used to give change for a shilling and would turn a halfpenny twice over to make sure that it was a good one
beyond all question he had the blood of a petty huckster in his veins through whatever channel it may have found its way there
immediately on his death the shopdoor had been locked bolted and barred and down to the period of our story had probably never once been opened
the old counter shelves and other fixtures of the little shop remained just as he had left them
it used to be affirmed that the dead shopkeeper in a white wig a faded velvet coat an apron at his waist and his ruffles carefully turned back from his wrists might be seen through the chinks of the shutters any night of the year ransacking his till or poring over the dingy pages of his daybook
from the look of unutterable woe upon his face it appeared to be his doom to spend eternity in a vain effort to make his accounts balance
and nowin a very humble way as will be seenwe proceed to open our narrative
ii
the little shopwindow   it still lacked half an hour of sunrise when miss hepzibah pyncheonwe will not say awoke it being doubtful whether the poor lady had so much as closed her eyes during the brief night of midsummerbut at all events arose from her solitary pillow and began what it would be mockery to term the adornment of her person
far from us be the indecorum of assisting even in imagination at a maiden ladys toilet
our story must therefore await miss hepzibah at the threshold of her chamber only presuming meanwhile to note some of the heavy sighs that labored from her bosom with little restraint as to their lugubrious depth and volume of sound inasmuch as they could be audible to nobody save a disembodied listener like ourself
the old maid was alone in the old house
alone except for a certain respectable and orderly young man an artist in the daguerreotype line who for about three months back had been a lodger in a remote gablequite a house by itself indeedwith locks bolts and oaken bars on all the intervening doors
inaudible consequently were poor miss hepzibahs gusty sighs
inaudible the creaking joints of her stiffened knees as she knelt down by the bedside
and inaudible too by mortal ear but heard with allcomprehending love and pity in the farthest heaven that almost agony of prayernow whispered now a groan now a struggling silencewherewith she besought the divine assistance through the day
evidently this is to be a day of more than ordinary trial to miss hepzibah who for above a quarter of a century gone by has dwelt in strict seclusion taking no part in the business of life and just as little in its intercourse and pleasures
not with such fervor prays the torpid recluse looking forward to the cold sunless stagnant calm of a day that is to be like innumerable yesterdays
the maiden ladys devotions are concluded
will she now issue forth over the threshold of our story
not yet by many moments
first every drawer in the tall oldfashioned bureau is to be opened with difficulty and with a succession of spasmodic jerks then all must close again with the same fidgety reluctance
there is a rustling of stiff silks a tread of backward and forward footsteps to and fro across the chamber
we suspect miss hepzibah moreover of taking a step upward into a chair in order to give heedful regard to her appearance on all sides and at full length in the oval dingyframed toiletglass that hangs above her table
truly
well indeed
who would have thought it
is all this precious time to be lavished on the matutinal repair and beautifying of an elderly person who never goes abroad whom nobody ever visits and from whom when she shall have done her utmost it were the best charity to turn ones eyes another way
now she is almost ready
let us pardon her one other pause for it is given to the sole sentiment or we might better sayheightened and rendered intense as it has been by sorrow and seclusionto the strong passion of her life
we heard the turning of a key in a small lock she has opened a secret drawer of an escritoire and is probably looking at a certain miniature done in malbones most perfect style and representing a face worthy of no less delicate a pencil
it was once our good fortune to see this picture
it is a likeness of a young man in a silken dressinggown of an old fashion the soft richness of which is well adapted to the countenance of reverie with its full tender lips and beautiful eyes that seem to indicate not so much capacity of thought as gentle and voluptuous emotion
of the possessor of such features we shall have a right to ask nothing except that he would take the rude world easily and make himself happy in it
can it have been an early lover of miss hepzibah
no she never had a loverpoor thing how could shenor ever knew by her own experience what love technically means
and yet her undying faith and trust her fresh remembrance and continual devotedness towards the original of that miniature have been the only substance for her heart to feed upon
she seems to have put aside the miniature and is standing again before the toiletglass
there are tears to be wiped off
a few more footsteps to and fro and here at lastwith another pitiful sigh like a gust of chill damp wind out of a longclosed vault the door of which has accidentally been set ajarhere comes miss hepzibah pyncheon
forth she steps into the dusky timedarkened passage a tall figure clad in black silk with a long and shrunken waist feeling her way towards the stairs like a nearsighted person as in truth she is
the sun meanwhile if not already above the horizon was ascending nearer and nearer to its verge
a few clouds floating high upward caught some of the earliest light and threw down its golden gleam on the windows of all the houses in the street not forgetting the house of the seven gables whichmany such sunrises as it had witnessedlooked cheerfully at the present one
the reflected radiance served to show pretty distinctly the aspect and arrangement of the room which hepzibah entered after descending the stairs
it was a lowstudded room with a beam across the ceiling panelled with dark wood and having a large chimneypiece set round with pictured tiles but now closed by an iron fireboard through which ran the funnel of a modern stove
there was a carpet on the floor originally of rich texture but so worn and faded in these latter years that its once brilliant figure had quite vanished into one indistinguishable hue
in the way of furniture there were two tables one constructed with perplexing intricacy and exhibiting as many feet as a centipede the other most delicately wrought with four long and slender legs so apparently frail that it was almost incredible what a length of time the ancient teatable had stood upon them
half a dozen chairs stood about the room straight and stiff and so ingeniously contrived for the discomfort of the human person that they were irksome even to sight and conveyed the ugliest possible idea of the state of society to which they could have been adapted
one exception there was however in a very antique elbowchair with a high back carved elaborately in oak and a roomy depth within its arms that made up by its spacious comprehensiveness for the lack of any of those artistic curves which abound in a modern chair
as for ornamental articles of furniture we recollect but two if such they may be called
one was a map of the pyncheon territory at the eastward not engraved but the handiwork of some skilful old draughtsman and grotesquely illuminated with pictures of indians and wild beasts among which was seen a lion the natural history of the region being as little known as its geography which was put down most fantastically awry
the other adornment was the portrait of old colonel pyncheon at two thirds length representing the stern features of a puritaniclooking personage in a skullcap with a laced band and a grizzly beard holding a bible with one hand and in the other uplifting an iron swordhilt
the latter object being more successfully depicted by the artist stood out in far greater prominence than the sacred volume
face to face with this picture on entering the apartment miss hepzibah pyncheon came to a pause regarding it with a singular scowl a strange contortion of the brow which by people who did not know her would probably have been interpreted as an expression of bitter anger and illwill
but it was no such thing
she in fact felt a reverence for the pictured visage of which only a fardescended and timestricken virgin could be susceptible and this forbidding scowl was the innocent result of her nearsightedness and an effort so to concentrate her powers of vision as to substitute a firm outline of the object instead of a vague one
we must linger a moment on this unfortunate expression of poor hepzibahs brow
her scowlas the world or such part of it as sometimes caught a transitory glimpse of her at the window wickedly persisted in calling ither scowl had done miss hepzibah a very ill office in establishing her character as an illtempered old maid nor does it appear improbable that by often gazing at herself in a dim lookingglass and perpetually encountering her own frown with its ghostly sphere she had been led to interpret the expression almost as unjustly as the world did
how miserably cross i look she must often have whispered to herself and ultimately have fancied herself so by a sense of inevitable doom
but her heart never frowned
it was naturally tender sensitive and full of little tremors and palpitations all of which weaknesses it retained while her visage was growing so perversely stern and even fierce
nor had hepzibah ever any hardihood except what came from the very warmest nook in her affections
all this time however we are loitering faintheartedly on the threshold of our story
in very truth we have an invincible reluctance to disclose what miss hepzibah pyncheon was about to do
it has already been observed that in the basement story of the gable fronting on the street an unworthy ancestor nearly a century ago had fitted up a shop
ever since the old gentleman retired from trade and fell asleep under his coffinlid not only the shopdoor but the inner arrangements had been suffered to remain unchanged while the dust of ages gathered inchdeep over the shelves and counter and partly filled an old pair of scales as if it were of value enough to be weighed
it treasured itself up too in the halfopen till where there still lingered a base sixpence worth neither more nor less than the hereditary pride which had here been put to shame
such had been the state and condition of the little shop in old hepzibahs childhood when she and her brother used to play at hideandseek in its forsaken precincts
so it had remained until within a few days past
but now though the shopwindow was still closely curtained from the public gaze a remarkable change had taken place in its interior
the rich and heavy festoons of cobweb which it had cost a long ancestral succession of spiders their lifes labor to spin and weave had been carefully brushed away from the ceiling
the counter shelves and floor had all been scoured and the latter was overstrewn with fresh blue sand
the brown scales too had evidently undergone rigid discipline in an unavailing effort to rub off the rust which alas
had eaten through and through their substance
neither was the little old shop any longer empty of merchantable goods
a curious eye privileged to take an account of stock and investigate behind the counter would have discovered a barrel yea two or three barrels and half dittoone containing flour another apples and a third perhaps indian meal
there was likewise a square box of pinewood full of soap in bars also another of the same size in which were tallow candles ten to the pound
a small stock of brown sugar some white beans and split peas and a few other commodities of low price and such as are constantly in demand made up the bulkier portion of the merchandise
it might have been taken for a ghostly or phantasmagoric reflection of the old shopkeeper pyncheons shabbily provided shelves save that some of the articles were of a description and outward form which could hardly have been known in his day
for instance there was a glass picklejar filled with fragments of gibraltar rock not indeed splinters of the veritable stone foundation of the famous fortress but bits of delectable candy neatly done up in white paper
jim crow moreover was seen executing his worldrenowned dance in gingerbread
a party of leaden dragoons were galloping along one of the shelves in equipments and uniform of modern cut and there were some sugar figures with no strong resemblance to the humanity of any epoch but less unsatisfactorily representing our own fashions than those of a hundred years ago
another phenomenon still more strikingly modern was a package of lucifer matches which in old times would have been thought actually to borrow their instantaneous flame from the nether fires of tophet
in short to bring the matter at once to a point it was incontrovertibly evident that somebody had taken the shop and fixtures of the longretired and forgotten mr pyncheon and was about to renew the enterprise of that departed worthy with a different set of customers
who could this bold adventurer be
and of all places in the world why had he chosen the house of the seven gables as the scene of his commercial speculations
we return to the elderly maiden
she at length withdrew her eyes from the dark countenance of the colonels portrait heaved a sighindeed her breast was a very cave of aolus that morningand stept across the room on tiptoe as is the customary gait of elderly women
passing through an intervening passage she opened a door that communicated with the shop just now so elaborately described
owing to the projection of the upper storyand still more to the thick shadow of the pyncheon elm which stood almost directly in front of the gablethe twilight here was still as much akin to night as morning
another heavy sigh from miss hepzibah
after a moments pause on the threshold peering towards the window with her nearsighted scowl as if frowning down some bitter enemy she suddenly projected herself into the shop
the haste and as it were the galvanic impulse of the movement were really quite startling
nervouslyin a sort of frenzy we might almost sayshe began to busy herself in arranging some childrens playthings and other little wares on the shelves and at the shopwindow
in the aspect of this darkarrayed palefaced ladylike old figure there was a deeply tragic character that contrasted irreconcilably with the ludicrous pettiness of her employment
it seemed a queer anomaly that so gaunt and dismal a personage should take a toy in hand a miracle that the toy did not vanish in her grasp a miserably absurd idea that she should go on perplexing her stiff and sombre intellect with the question how to tempt little boys into her premises
yet such is undoubtedly her object
now she places a gingerbread elephant against the window but with so tremulous a touch that it tumbles upon the floor with the dismemberment of three legs and its trunk it has ceased to be an elephant and has become a few bits of musty gingerbread
there again she has upset a tumbler of marbles all of which roll different ways and each individual marble devildirected into the most difficult obscurity that it can find
heaven help our poor old hepzibah and forgive us for taking a ludicrous view of her position
as her rigid and rusty frame goes down upon its hands and knees in quest of the absconding marbles we positively feel so much the more inclined to shed tears of sympathy from the very fact that we must needs turn aside and laugh at her
for hereand if we fail to impress it suitably upon the reader it is our own fault not that of the theme here is one of the truest points of melancholy interest that occur in ordinary life
it was the final throe of what called itself old gentility
a ladywho had fed herself from childhood with the shadowy food of aristocratic reminiscences and whose religion it was that a ladys hand soils itself irremediably by doing aught for breadthis born lady after sixty years of narrowing means is fain to step down from her pedestal of imaginary rank
poverty treading closely at her heels for a lifetime has come up with her at last
she must earn her own food or starve
and we have stolen upon miss hepzibah pyncheon too irreverently at the instant of time when the patrician lady is to be transformed into the plebeian woman
in this republican country amid the fluctuating waves of our social life somebody is always at the drowningpoint
the tragedy is enacted with as continual a repetition as that of a popular drama on a holiday and nevertheless is felt as deeply perhaps as when an hereditary noble sinks below his order
more deeply since with us rank is the grosser substance of wealth and a splendid establishment and has no spiritual existence after the death of these but dies hopelessly along with them
and therefore since we have been unfortunate enough to introduce our heroine at so inauspicious a juncture we would entreat for a mood of due solemnity in the spectators of her fate
let us behold in poor hepzibah the immemorial ladytwo hundred years old on this side of the water and thrice as many on the otherwith her antique portraits pedigrees coats of arms records and traditions and her claim as joint heiress to that princely territory at the eastward no longer a wilderness but a populous fertilityborn too in pyncheon street under the pyncheon elm and in the pyncheon house where she has spent all her daysreduced
now in that very house to be the hucksteress of a centshop
this business of setting up a petty shop is almost the only resource of women in circumstances at all similar to those of our unfortunate recluse
with her nearsightedness and those tremulous fingers of hers at once inflexible and delicate she could not be a seamstress although her sampler of fifty years gone by exhibited some of the most recondite specimens of ornamental needlework
a school for little children had been often in her thoughts and at one time she had begun a review of her early studies in the new england primer with a view to prepare herself for the office of instructress
but the love of children had never been quickened in hepzibahs heart and was now torpid if not extinct she watched the little people of the neighborhood from her chamberwindow and doubted whether she could tolerate a more intimate acquaintance with them
besides in our day the very abc has become a science greatly too abstruse to be any longer taught by pointing a pin from letter to letter
a modern child could teach old hepzibah more than old hepzibah could teach the child
sowith many a cold deep heartquake at the idea of at last coming into sordid contact with the world from which she had so long kept aloof while every added day of seclusion had rolled another stone against the cavern door of her hermitagethe poor thing bethought herself of the ancient shopwindow the rusty scales and dusty till
she might have held back a little longer but another circumstance not yet hinted at had somewhat hastened her decision
her humble preparations therefore were duly made and the enterprise was now to be commenced
nor was she entitled to complain of any remarkable singularity in her fate for in the town of her nativity we might point to several little shops of a similar description some of them in houses as ancient as that of the seven gables and one or two it may be where a decayed gentlewoman stands behind the counter as grim an image of family pride as miss hepzibah pyncheon herself
it was overpoweringly ridiculouswe must honestly confess itthe deportment of the maiden lady while setting her shop in order for the public eye
she stole on tiptoe to the window as cautiously as if she conceived some bloodyminded villain to be watching behind the elmtree with intent to take her life
stretching out her long lank arm she put a paper of pearlbuttons a jewsharp or whatever the small article might be in its destined place and straightway vanished back into the dusk as if the world need never hope for another glimpse of her
it might have been fancied indeed that she expected to minister to the wants of the community unseen like a disembodied divinity or enchantress holding forth her bargains to the reverential and awestricken purchaser in an invisible hand
but hepzibah had no such flattering dream
she was well aware that she must ultimately come forward and stand revealed in her proper individuality but like other sensitive persons she could not bear to be observed in the gradual process and chose rather to flash forth on the worlds astonished gaze at once
the inevitable moment was not much longer to be delayed
the sunshine might now be seen stealing down the front of the opposite house from the windows of which came a reflected gleam struggling through the boughs of the elmtree and enlightening the interior of the shop more distinctly than heretofore
the town appeared to be waking up
a bakers cart had already rattled through the street chasing away the latest vestige of nights sanctity with the jinglejangle of its dissonant bells
a milkman was distributing the contents of his cans from door to door and the harsh peal of a fishermans conch shell was heard far off around the corner
none of these tokens escaped hepzibahs notice
the moment had arrived
to delay longer would be only to lengthen out her misery
nothing remained except to take down the bar from the shopdoor leaving the entrance freemore than freewelcome as if all were household friendsto every passerby whose eyes might be attracted by the commodities at the window
this last act hepzibah now performed letting the bar fall with what smote upon her excited nerves as a most astounding clatter
thenas if the only barrier betwixt herself and the world had been thrown down and a flood of evil consequences would come tumbling through the gapshe fled into the inner parlor threw herself into the ancestral elbowchair and wept
our miserable old hepzibah
it is a heavy annoyance to a writer who endeavors to represent nature its various attitudes and circumstances in a reasonably correct outline and true coloring that so much of the mean and ludicrous should be hopelessly mixed up with the purest pathos which life anywhere supplies to him
what tragic dignity for example can be wrought into a scene like this
how can we elevate our history of retribution for the sin of long ago when as one of our most prominent figures we are compelled to introducenot a young and lovely woman nor even the stately remains of beauty stormshattered by afflictionbut a gaunt sallow rustyjointed maiden in a longwaisted silk gown and with the strange horror of a turban on her head
her visage is not even ugly
it is redeemed from insignificance only by the contraction of her eyebrows into a nearsighted scowl
and finally her great lifetrial seems to be that after sixty years of idleness she finds it convenient to earn comfortable bread by setting up a shop in a small way
nevertheless if we look through all the heroic fortunes of mankind we shall find this same entanglement of something mean and trivial with whatever is noblest in joy or sorrow
life is made up of marble and mud
and without all the deeper trust in a comprehensive sympathy above us we might hence be led to suspect the insult of a sneer as well as an immitigable frown on the iron countenance of fate
what is called poetic insight is the gift of discerning in this sphere of strangely mingled elements the beauty and the majesty which are compelled to assume a garb so sordid
iii
the first customer   miss hepzibah pyncheon sat in the oaken elbowchair with her hands over her face giving way to that heavy downsinking of the heart which most persons have experienced when the image of hope itself seems ponderously moulded of lead on the eve of an enterprise at once doubtful and momentous
she was suddenly startled by the tinkling alarumhigh sharp and irregularof a little bell
the maiden lady arose upon her feet as pale as a ghost at cockcrow for she was an enslaved spirit and this the talisman to which she owed obedience
this little bellto speak in plainer termsbeing fastened over the shopdoor was so contrived as to vibrate by means of a steel spring and thus convey notice to the inner regions of the house when any customer should cross the threshold
its ugly and spiteful little din heard now for the first time perhaps since hepzibahs periwigged predecessor had retired from trade at once set every nerve of her body in responsive and tumultuous vibration
the crisis was upon her
her first customer was at the door
without giving herself time for a second thought she rushed into the shop pale wild desperate in gesture and expression scowling portentously and looking far better qualified to do fierce battle with a housebreaker than to stand smiling behind the counter bartering small wares for a copper recompense
any ordinary customer indeed would have turned his back and fled
and yet there was nothing fierce in hepzibahs poor old heart nor had she at the moment a single bitter thought against the world at large or one individual man or woman
she wished them all well but wished too that she herself were done with them and in her quiet grave
the applicant by this time stood within the doorway
coming freshly as he did out of the morning light he appeared to have brought some of its cheery influences into the shop along with him
it was a slender young man not more than one or two and twenty years old with rather a grave and thoughtful expression for his years but likewise a springy alacrity and vigor
these qualities were not only perceptible physically in his make and motions but made themselves felt almost immediately in his character
a brown beard not too silken in its texture fringed his chin but as yet without completely hiding it he wore a short mustache too and his dark highfeatured countenance looked all the better for these natural ornaments
as for his dress it was of the simplest kind a summer sack of cheap and ordinary material thin checkered pantaloons and a straw hat by no means of the finest braid
oak hall might have supplied his entire equipment
he was chiefly marked as a gentlemanif such indeed he made any claim to beby the rather remarkable whiteness and nicety of his clean linen
he met the scowl of old hepzibah without apparent alarm as having heretofore encountered it and found it harmless
so my dear miss pyncheon said the daguerreotypistfor it was that sole other occupant of the sevengabled mansioni am glad to see that you have not shrunk from your good purpose
i merely look in to offer my best wishes and to ask if i can assist you any further in your preparations  people in difficulty and distress or in any manner at odds with the world can endure a vast amount of harsh treatment and perhaps be only the stronger for it whereas they give way at once before the simplest expression of what they perceive to be genuine sympathy
so it proved with poor hepzibah for when she saw the young mans smilelooking so much the brighter on a thoughtful faceand heard his kindly tone she broke first into a hysteric giggle and then began to sob
ah mr holgrave cried she as soon as she could speak i never can go through with it
never never never
i wish i were dead and in the old family tomb with all my forefathers
with my father and my mother and my sister
yes and with my brother who had far better find me there than here
the world is too chill and hardand i am too old and too feeble and too hopeless  oh believe me miss hepzibah said the young man quietly these feelings will not trouble you any longer after you are once fairly in the midst of your enterprise
they are unavoidable at this moment standing as you do on the outer verge of your long seclusion and peopling the world with ugly shapes which you will soon find to be as unreal as the giants and ogres of a childs storybook
i find nothing so singular in life as that everything appears to lose its substance the instant one actually grapples with it
so it will be with what you think so terrible  but i am a woman said hepzibah piteously
i was going to say a ladybut i consider that as past  well no matter if it be past answered the artist a strange gleam of halfhidden sarcasm flashing through the kindliness of his manner
let it go
you are the better without it
i speak frankly my dear miss pyncheonfor are we not friends
i look upon this as one of the fortunate days of your life
it ends an epoch and begins one
hitherto the lifeblood has been gradually chilling in your veins as you sat aloof within your circle of gentility while the rest of the world was fighting out its battle with one kind of necessity or another
henceforth you will at least have the sense of healthy and natural effort for a purpose and of lending your strength be it great or smallto the united struggle of mankind
this is successall the success that anybody meets with  it is natural enough mr holgrave that you should have ideas like these rejoined hepzibah drawing up her gaunt figure with slightly offended dignity
you are a man a young man and brought up i suppose as almost everybody is nowadays with a view to seeking your fortune
but i was born a lady and have always lived one no matter in what narrowness of means always a lady  but i was not born a gentleman neither have i lived like one said holgrave slightly smiling so my dear madam you will hardly expect me to sympathize with sensibilities of this kind though unless i deceive myself i have some imperfect comprehension of them
these names of gentleman and lady had a meaning in the past history of the world and conferred privileges desirable or otherwise on those entitled to bear them
in the presentand still more in the future condition of societythey imply not privilege but restriction  these are new notions said the old gentlewoman shaking her head
i shall never understand them neither do i wish it  we will cease to speak of them then replied the artist with a friendlier smile than his last one and i will leave you to feel whether it is not better to be a true woman than a lady
do you really think miss hepzibah that any lady of your family has ever done a more heroic thing since this house was built than you are performing in it today
never and if the pyncheons had always acted so nobly i doubt whether an old wizard maules anathema of which you told me once would have had much weight with providence against them  ahno no said hepzibah not displeased at this allusion to the sombre dignity of an inherited curse
if old maules ghost or a descendant of his could see me behind the counter today he would call it the fulfillment of his worst wishes
but i thank you for your kindness mr holgrave and will do my utmost to be a good shopkeeper  pray do said holgrave and let me have the pleasure of being your first customer
i am about taking a walk to the seashore before going to my rooms where i misuse heavens blessed sunshine by tracing out human features through its agency
a few of those biscuits dipt in seawater will be just what i need for breakfast
what is the price of half a dozen  let me be a lady a moment longer replied hepzibah with a manner of antique stateliness to which a melancholy smile lent a kind of grace
she put the biscuits into his hand but rejected the compensation
a pyncheon must not at all events under her forefathers roof receive money for a morsel of bread from her only friend  holgrave took his departure leaving her for the moment with spirits not quite so much depressed
soon however they had subsided nearly to their former dead level
with a beating heart she listened to the footsteps of early passengers which now began to be frequent along the street
once or twice they seemed to linger these strangers or neighbors as the case might be were looking at the display of toys and petty commodities in hepzibahs shopwindow
she was doubly tortured in part with a sense of overwhelming shame that strange and unloving eyes should have the privilege of gazing and partly because the idea occurred to her with ridiculous importunity that the window was not arranged so skilfully nor nearly to so much advantage as it might have been
it seemed as if the whole fortune or failure of her shop might depend on the display of a different set of articles or substituting a fairer apple for one which appeared to be specked
so she made the change and straightway fancied that everything was spoiled by it not recognizing that it was the nervousness of the juncture and her own native squeamishness as an old maid that wrought all the seeming mischief
anon there was an encounter just at the doorstep betwixt two laboring men as their rough voices denoted them to be
after some slight talk about their own affairs one of them chanced to notice the shopwindow and directed the others attention to it
see here cried he what do you think of this
trade seems to be looking up in pyncheon street  well well this is a sight to be sure exclaimed the other
in the old pyncheon house and underneath the pyncheon elm
who would have thought it
old maid pyncheon is setting up a centshop  will she make it go think you dixey said his friend
i dont call it a very good stand
theres another shop just round the corner  make it go cried dixey with a most contemptuous expression as if the very idea were impossible to be conceived
not a bit of it
why her faceive seen it for i dug her garden for her one yearher face is enough to frighten the old nick himself if he had ever so great a mind to trade with her
people cant stand it i tell you
she scowls dreadfully reason or none out of pure ugliness of temper  well thats not so much matter remarked the other man
these sourtempered folks are mostly handy at business and know pretty well what they are about
but as you say i dont think shell do much
this business of keeping centshops is overdone like all other kinds of trade handicraft and bodily labor
i know it to my cost
my wife kept a centshop three months and lost five dollars on her outlay  poor business responded dixey in a tone as if he were shaking his headpoor business  for some reason or other not very easy to analyze there had hardly been so bitter a pang in all her previous misery about the matter as what thrilled hepzibahs heart on overhearing the above conversation
the testimony in regard to her scowl was frightfully important it seemed to hold up her image wholly relieved from the false light of her selfpartialities and so hideous that she dared not look at it
she was absurdly hurt moreover by the slight and idle effect that her setting up shopan event of such breathless interest to herselfappeared to have upon the public of which these two men were the nearest representatives
a glance a passing word or two a coarse laugh and she was doubtless forgotten before they turned the corner
they cared nothing for her dignity and just as little for her degradation
then also the augury of illsuccess uttered from the sure wisdom of experience fell upon her halfdead hope like a clod into a grave
the mans wife had already tried the same experiment and failed
how could the born ladythe recluse of half a lifetime utterly unpractised in the world at sixty years of agehow could she ever dream of succeeding when the hard vulgar keen busy hackneyed new england woman had lost five dollars on her little outlay
success presented itself as an impossibility and the hope of it as a wild hallucination
some malevolent spirit doing his utmost to drive hepzibah mad unrolled before her imagination a kind of panorama representing the great thoroughfare of a city all astir with customers
so many and so magnificent shops as there were
groceries toyshops drygoods stores with their immense panes of plateglass their gorgeous fixtures their vast and complete assortments of merchandise in which fortunes had been invested and those noble mirrors at the farther end of each establishment doubling all this wealth by a brightly burnished vista of unrealities
on one side of the street this splendid bazaar with a multitude of perfumed and glossy salesmen smirking smiling bowing and measuring out the goods
on the other the dusky old house of the seven gables with the antiquated shopwindow under its projecting story and hepzibah herself in a gown of rusty black silk behind the counter scowling at the world as it went by
this mighty contrast thrust itself forward as a fair expression of the odds against which she was to begin her struggle for a subsistence
success
preposterous
she would never think of it again
the house might just as well be buried in an eternal fog while all other houses had the sunshine on them for not a foot would ever cross the threshold nor a hand so much as try the door
but at this instant the shopbell right over her head tinkled as if it were bewitched
the old gentlewomans heart seemed to be attached to the same steel spring for it went through a series of sharp jerks in unison with the sound
the door was thrust open although no human form was perceptible on the other side of the halfwindow
hepzibah nevertheless stood at a gaze with her hands clasped looking very much as if she had summoned up an evil spirit and were afraid yet resolved to hazard the encounter
heaven help me she groaned mentally
now is my hour of need  the door which moved with difficulty on its creaking and rusty hinges being forced quite open a square and sturdy little urchin became apparent with cheeks as red as an apple
he was clad rather shabbily but as it seemed more owing to his mothers carelessness than his fathers poverty in a blue apron very wide and short trousers shoes somewhat out at the toes and a chip hat with the frizzles of his curly hair sticking through its crevices
a book and a small slate under his arm indicated that he was on his way to school
he stared at hepzibah a moment as an elder customer than himself would have been likely enough to do not knowing what to make of the tragic attitude and queer scowl wherewith she regarded him
well child said she taking heart at sight of a personage so little formidablewell my child what did you wish for  that jim crow there in the window answered the urchin holding out a cent and pointing to the gingerbread figure that had attracted his notice as he loitered along to school the one that has not a broken foot  so hepzibah put forth her lank arm and taking the effigy from the shopwindow delivered it to her first customer
no matter for the money said she giving him a little push towards the door for her old gentility was contumaciously squeamish at sight of the copper coin and besides it seemed such pitiful meanness to take the childs pocketmoney in exchange for a bit of stale gingerbread
no matter for the cent
you are welcome to jim crow  the child staring with round eyes at this instance of liberality wholly unprecedented in his large experience of centshops took the man of gingerbread and quitted the premises
no sooner had he reached the sidewalk little cannibal that he was
than jim crows head was in his mouth
as he had not been careful to shut the door hepzibah was at the pains of closing it after him with a pettish ejaculation or two about the troublesomeness of young people and particularly of small boys
she had just placed another representative of the renowned jim crow at the window when again the shopbell tinkled clamorously and again the door being thrust open with its characteristic jerk and jar disclosed the same sturdy little urchin who precisely two minutes ago had made his exit
the crumbs and discoloration of the cannibal feast as yet hardly consummated were exceedingly visible about his mouth
what is it now child asked the maiden lady rather impatiently did you come back to shut the door  no answered the urchin pointing to the figure that had just been put up i want that other jim crow  well here it is for you said hepzibah reaching it down but recognizing that this pertinacious customer would not quit her on any other terms so long as she had a gingerbread figure in her shop she partly drew back her extended hand where is the cent  the little boy had the cent ready but like a trueborn yankee would have preferred the better bargain to the worse
looking somewhat chagrined he put the coin into hepzibahs hand and departed sending the second jim crow in quest of the former one
the new shopkeeper dropped the first solid result of her commercial enterprise into the till
it was done
the sordid stain of that copper coin could never be washed away from her palm
the little schoolboy aided by the impish figure of the negro dancer had wrought an irreparable ruin
the structure of ancient aristocracy had been demolished by him even as if his childish gripe had torn down the sevengabled mansion
now let hepzibah turn the old pyncheon portraits with their faces to the wall and take the map of her eastern territory to kindle the kitchen fire and blow up the flame with the empty breath of her ancestral traditions
what had she to do with ancestry
nothing no more than with posterity
no lady now but simply hepzibah pyncheon a forlorn old maid and keeper of a centshop
nevertheless even while she paraded these ideas somewhat ostentatiously through her mind it is altogether surprising what a calmness had come over her
the anxiety and misgivings which had tormented her whether asleep or in melancholy daydreams ever since her project began to take an aspect of solidity had now vanished quite away
she felt the novelty of her position indeed but no longer with disturbance or affright
now and then there came a thrill of almost youthful enjoyment
it was the invigorating breath of a fresh outward atmosphere after the long torpor and monotonous seclusion of her life
so wholesome is effort
so miraculous the strength that we do not know of
the healthiest glow that hepzibah had known for years had come now in the dreaded crisis when for the first time she had put forth her hand to help herself
the little circlet of the schoolboys copper coindim and lustreless though it was with the small services which it had been doing here and there about the worldhad proved a talisman fragrant with good and deserving to be set in gold and worn next her heart
it was as potent and perhaps endowed with the same kind of efficacy as a galvanic ring
hepzibah at all events was indebted to its subtile operation both in body and spirit so much the more as it inspired her with energy to get some breakfast at which still the better to keep up her courage she allowed herself an extra spoonful in her infusion of black tea
her introductory day of shopkeeping did not run on however without many and serious interruptions of this mood of cheerful vigor
as a general rule providence seldom vouchsafes to mortals any more than just that degree of encouragement which suffices to keep them at a reasonably full exertion of their powers
in the case of our old gentlewoman after the excitement of new effort had subsided the despondency of her whole life threatened ever and anon to return
it was like the heavy mass of clouds which we may often see obscuring the sky and making a gray twilight everywhere until towards nightfall it yields temporarily to a glimpse of sunshine
but always the envious cloud strives to gather again across the streak of celestial azure
customers came in as the forenoon advanced but rather slowly in some cases too it must be owned with little satisfaction either to themselves or miss hepzibah nor on the whole with an aggregate of very rich emolument to the till
a little girl sent by her mother to match a skein of cotton thread of a peculiar hue took one that the nearsighted old lady pronounced extremely like but soon came running back with a blunt and cross message that it would not do and besides was very rotten
then there was a pale carewrinkled woman not old but haggard and already with streaks of gray among her hair like silver ribbons one of those women naturally delicate whom you at once recognize as worn to death by a bruteprobably a drunken bruteof a husband and at least nine children
she wanted a few pounds of flour and offered the money which the decayed gentlewoman silently rejected and gave the poor soul better measure than if she had taken it
shortly afterwards a man in a blue cotton frock much soiled came in and bought a pipe filling the whole shop meanwhile with the hot odor of strong drink not only exhaled in the torrid atmosphere of his breath but oozing out of his entire system like an inflammable gas
it was impressed on hepzibahs mind that this was the husband of the carewrinkled woman
he asked for a paper of tobacco and as she had neglected to provide herself with the article her brutal customer dashed down his newlybought pipe and left the shop muttering some unintelligible words which had the tone and bitterness of a curse
hereupon hepzibah threw up her eyes unintentionally scowling in the face of providence
no less than five persons during the forenoon inquired for gingerbeer or rootbeer or any drink of a similar brewage and obtaining nothing of the kind went off in an exceedingly bad humor
three of them left the door open and the other two pulled it so spitefully in going out that the little bell played the very deuce with hepzibahs nerves
a round bustling fireruddy housewife of the neighborhood burst breathless into the shop fiercely demanding yeast and when the poor gentlewoman with her cold shyness of manner gave her hot customer to understand that she did not keep the article this very capable housewife took upon herself to administer a regular rebuke
a centshop and no yeast quoth she that will never do
who ever heard of such a thing
your loaf will never rise no more than mine will today
you had better shut up shop at once  well said hepzibah heaving a deep sigh perhaps i had  several times moreover besides the above instance her ladylike sensibilities were seriously infringed upon by the familiar if not rude tone with which people addressed her
they evidently considered themselves not merely her equals but her patrons and superiors
now hepzibah had unconsciously flattered herself with the idea that there would be a gleam or halo of some kind or other about her person which would insure an obeisance to her sterling gentility or at least a tacit recognition of it
on the other hand nothing tortured her more intolerably than when this recognition was too prominently expressed
to one or two rather officious offers of sympathy her responses were little short of acrimonious and we regret to say hepzibah was thrown into a positively unchristian state of mind by the suspicion that one of her customers was drawn to the shop not by any real need of the article which she pretended to seek but by a wicked wish to stare at her
the vulgar creature was determined to see for herself what sort of a figure a mildewed piece of aristocracy after wasting all the bloom and much of the decline of her life apart from the world would cut behind a counter
in this particular case however mechanical and innocuous it might be at other times hepzibahs contortion of brow served her in good stead
i never was so frightened in my life said the curious customer in describing the incident to one of her acquaintances
shes a real old vixen take my word of it
she says little to be sure but if you could only see the mischief in her eye  on the whole therefore her new experience led our decayed gentlewoman to very disagreeable conclusions as to the temper and manners of what she termed the lower classes whom heretofore she had looked down upon with a gentle and pitying complaisance as herself occupying a sphere of unquestionable superiority
but unfortunately she had likewise to struggle against a bitter emotion of a directly opposite kind a sentiment of virulence we mean towards the idle aristocracy to which it had so recently been her pride to belong
when a lady in a delicate and costly summer garb with a floating veil and gracefully swaying gown and altogether an ethereal lightness that made you look at her beautifully slippered feet to see whether she trod on the dust or floated in the airwhen such a vision happened to pass through this retired street leaving it tenderly and delusively fragrant with her passage as if a bouquet of tearoses had been borne alongthen again it is to be feared old hepzibahs scowl could no longer vindicate itself entirely on the plea of nearsightedness
for what end thought she giving vent to that feeling of hostility which is the only real abasement of the poor in presence of the richfor what good end in the wisdom of providence does that woman live
must the whole world toil that the palms of her hands may be kept white and delicate  then ashamed and penitent she hid her face
may god forgive me said she
doubtless god did forgive her
but taking the inward and outward history of the first halfday into consideration hepzibah began to fear that the shop would prove her ruin in a moral and religious point of view without contributing very essentially towards even her temporal welfare
iv
a day behind the counter   towards noon hepzibah saw an elderly gentleman large and portly and of remarkably dignified demeanor passing slowly along on the opposite side of the white and dusty street
on coming within the shadow of the pyncheon elm he stopt and taking off his hat meanwhile to wipe the perspiration from his brow seemed to scrutinize with especial interest the dilapidated and rustyvisaged house of the seven gables
he himself in a very different style was as well worth looking at as the house
no better model need be sought nor could have been found of a very high order of respectability which by some indescribable magic not merely expressed itself in his looks and gestures but even governed the fashion of his garments and rendered them all proper and essential to the man
without appearing to differ in any tangible way from other peoples clothes there was yet a wide and rich gravity about them that must have been a characteristic of the wearer since it could not be defined as pertaining either to the cut or material
his goldheaded cane tooa serviceable staff of dark polished woodhad similar traits and had it chosen to take a walk by itself would have been recognized anywhere as a tolerably adequate representative of its master
this characterwhich showed itself so strikingly in everything about him and the effect of which we seek to convey to the readerwent no deeper than his station habits of life and external circumstances
one perceived him to be a personage of marked influence and authority and especially you could feel just as certain that he was opulent as if he had exhibited his bank account or as if you had seen him touching the twigs of the pyncheon elm and midaslike transmuting them to gold
in his youth he had probably been considered a handsome man at his present age his brow was too heavy his temples too bare his remaining hair too gray his eye too cold his lips too closely compressed to bear any relation to mere personal beauty
he would have made a good and massive portrait better now perhaps than at any previous period of his life although his look might grow positively harsh in the process of being fixed upon the canvas
the artist would have found it desirable to study his face and prove its capacity for varied expression to darken it with a frownto kindle it up with a smile
while the elderly gentleman stood looking at the pyncheon house both the frown and the smile passed successively over his countenance
his eye rested on the shopwindow and putting up a pair of goldbowed spectacles which he held in his hand he minutely surveyed hepzibahs little arrangement of toys and commodities
at first it seemed not to please himnay to cause him exceeding displeasureand yet the very next moment he smiled
while the latter expression was yet on his lips he caught a glimpse of hepzibah who had involuntarily bent forward to the window and then the smile changed from acrid and disagreeable to the sunniest complacency and benevolence
he bowed with a happy mixture of dignity and courteous kindliness and pursued his way
there he is said hepzibah to herself gulping down a very bitter emotion and since she could not rid herself of it trying to drive it back into her heart
what does he think of it i wonder
does it please him
ah
he is looking back  the gentleman had paused in the street and turned himself half about still with his eyes fixed on the shopwindow
in fact he wheeled wholly round and commenced a step or two as if designing to enter the shop but as it chanced his purpose was anticipated by hepzibahs first customer the little cannibal of jim crow who staring up at the window was irresistibly attracted by an elephant of gingerbread
what a grand appetite had this small urchintwo jim crows immediately after breakfastand now an elephant as a preliminary whet before dinner
by the time this latter purchase was completed the elderly gentleman had resumed his way and turned the street corner
take it as you like cousin jaffrey muttered the maiden lady as she drew back after cautiously thrusting out her head and looking up and down the streettake it as you like
you have seen my little shopwindow
wellwhat have you to sayis not the pyncheon house my own while im alive  after this incident hepzibah retreated to the back parlor where she at first caught up a halffinished stocking and began knitting at it with nervous and irregular jerks but quickly finding herself at odds with the stitches she threw it aside and walked hurriedly about the room
at length she paused before the portrait of the stern old puritan her ancestor and the founder of the house
in one sense this picture had almost faded into the canvas and hidden itself behind the duskiness of age in another she could not but fancy that it had been growing more prominent and strikingly expressive ever since her earliest familiarity with it as a child
for while the physical outline and substance were darkening away from the beholders eye the bold hard and at the same time indirect character of the man seemed to be brought out in a kind of spiritual relief
such an effect may occasionally be observed in pictures of antique date
they acquire a look which an artist if he have anything like the complacency of artists nowadays would never dream of presenting to a patron as his own characteristic expression but which nevertheless we at once recognize as reflecting the unlovely truth of a human soul
in such cases the painters deep conception of his subjects inward traits has wrought itself into the essence of the picture and is seen after the superficial coloring has been rubbed off by time
while gazing at the portrait hepzibah trembled under its eye
her hereditary reverence made her afraid to judge the character of the original so harshly as a perception of the truth compelled her to do
but still she gazed because the face of the picture enabled herat least she fancied soto read more accurately and to a greater depth the face which she had just seen in the street
this is the very man murmured she to herself
let jaffrey pyncheon smile as he will there is that look beneath
put on him a skullcap and a band and a black cloak and a bible in one hand and a sword in the otherthen let jaffrey smile as he mightnobody would doubt that it was the old pyncheon come again
he has proved himself the very man to build up a new house
perhaps too to draw down a new curse  thus did hepzibah bewilder herself with these fantasies of the old time
she had dwelt too much alonetoo long in the pyncheon houseuntil her very brain was impregnated with the dryrot of its timbers
she needed a walk along the noonday street to keep her sane
by the spell of contrast another portrait rose up before her painted with more daring flattery than any artist would have ventured upon but yet so delicately touched that the likeness remained perfect
malbones miniature though from the same original was far inferior to hepzibahs airdrawn picture at which affection and sorrowful remembrance wrought together
soft mildly and cheerfully contemplative with full red lips just on the verge of a smile which the eyes seemed to herald by a gentle kindlingup of their orbs
feminine traits moulded inseparably with those of the other sex
the miniature likewise had this last peculiarity so that you inevitably thought of the original as resembling his mother and she a lovely and lovable woman with perhaps some beautiful infirmity of character that made it all the pleasanter to know and easier to love her
yes thought hepzibah with grief of which it was only the more tolerable portion that welled up from her heart to her eyelids they persecuted his mother in him
he never was a pyncheon  but here the shopbell rang it was like a sound from a remote distanceso far had hepzibah descended into the sepulchral depths of her reminiscences
on entering the shop she found an old man there a humble resident of pyncheon street and whom for a great many years past she had suffered to be a kind of familiar of the house
he was an immemorial personage who seemed always to have had a white head and wrinkles and never to have possessed but a single tooth and that a halfdecayed one in the front of the upper jaw
well advanced as hepzibah was she could not remember when uncle venner as the neighborhood called him had not gone up and down the street stooping a little and drawing his feet heavily over the gravel or pavement
but still there was something tough and vigorous about him that not only kept him in daily breath but enabled him to fill a place which would else have been vacant in the apparently crowded world
to go of errands with his slow and shuffling gait which made you doubt how he ever was to arrive anywhere to saw a small households foot or two of firewood or knock to pieces an old barrel or split up a pine board for kindlingstuff in summer to dig the few yards of garden ground appertaining to a lowrented tenement and share the produce of his labor at the halves in winter to shovel away the snow from the sidewalk or open paths to the woodshed or along the clothesline such were some of the essential offices which uncle venner performed among at least a score of families
within that circle he claimed the same sort of privilege and probably felt as much warmth of interest as a clergyman does in the range of his parishioners
not that he laid claim to the tithe pig but as an analogous mode of reverence he went his rounds every morning to gather up the crumbs of the table and overflowings of the dinnerpot as food for a pig of his own
in his younger daysfor after all there was a dim tradition that he had been not young but youngeruncle venner was commonly regarded as rather deficient than otherwise in his wits
in truth he had virtually pleaded guilty to the charge by scarcely aiming at such success as other men seek and by taking only that humble and modest part in the intercourse of life which belongs to the alleged deficiency
but now in his extreme old agewhether it were that his long and hard experience had actually brightened him or that his decaying judgment rendered him less capable of fairly measuring himselfthe venerable man made pretensions to no little wisdom and really enjoyed the credit of it
there was likewise at times a vein of something like poetry in him it was the moss or wallflower of his mind in its small dilapidation and gave a charm to what might have been vulgar and commonplace in his earlier and middle life
hepzibah had a regard for him because his name was ancient in the town and had formerly been respectable
it was a still better reason for awarding him a species of familiar reverence that uncle venner was himself the most ancient existence whether of man or thing in pyncheon street except the house of the seven gables and perhaps the elm that overshadowed it
this patriarch now presented himself before hepzibah clad in an old blue coat which had a fashionable air and must have accrued to him from the castoff wardrobe of some dashing clerk
as for his trousers they were of towcloth very short in the legs and bagging down strangely in the rear but yet having a suitableness to his figure which his other garment entirely lacked
his hat had relation to no other part of his dress and but very little to the head that wore it
thus uncle venner was a miscellaneous old gentleman partly himself but in good measure somebody else patched together too of different epochs an epitome of times and fashions
so you have really begun trade said hereally begun trade
well im glad to see it
young people should never live idle in the world nor old ones neither unless when the rheumatize gets hold of them
it has given me warning already and in two or three years longer i shall think of putting aside business and retiring to my farm
thats yonderthe great brick house you knowthe workhouse most folks call it but i mean to do my work first and go there to be idle and enjoy myself
and im glad to see you beginning to do your work miss hepzibah  thank you uncle venner said hepzibah smiling for she always felt kindly towards the simple and talkative old man
had he been an old woman she might probably have repelled the freedom which she now took in good part
it is time for me to begin work indeed
or to speak the truth i have just begun when i ought to be giving it up  oh never say that miss hepzibah answered the old man
you are a young woman yet
why i hardly thought myself younger than i am now it seems so little while ago since i used to see you playing about the door of the old house quite a small child
oftener though you used to be sitting at the threshold and looking gravely into the street for you had always a grave kind of way with youa grownup air when you were only the height of my knee
it seems as if i saw you now and your grandfather with his red cloak and his white wig and his cocked hat and his cane coming out of the house and stepping so grandly up the street
those old gentlemen that grew up before the revolution used to put on grand airs
in my young days the great man of the town was commonly called king and his wife not queen to be sure but lady
nowadays a man would not dare to be called king and if he feels himself a little above common folks he only stoops so much the lower to them
i met your cousin the judge ten minutes ago and in my old towcloth trousers as you see the judge raised his hat to me i do believe
at any rate the judge bowed and smiled  yes said hepzibah with something bitter stealing unawares into her tone my cousin jaffrey is thought to have a very pleasant smile  and so he has replied uncle venner
and thats rather remarkable in a pyncheon for begging your pardon miss hepzibah they never had the name of being an easy and agreeable set of folks
there was no getting close to them
but now miss hepzibah if an old man may be bold to ask why dont judge pyncheon with his great means step forward and tell his cousin to shut up her little shop at once
its for your credit to be doing something but its not for the judges credit to let you  we wont talk of this if you please uncle venner said hepzibah coldly
i ought to say however that if i choose to earn bread for myself it is not judge pyncheons fault
neither will he deserve the blame added she more kindly remembering uncle venners privileges of age and humble familiarity if i should by and by find it convenient to retire with you to your farm  and its no bad place either that farm of mine cried the old man cheerily as if there were something positively delightful in the prospect
no bad place is the great brick farmhouse especially for them that will find a good many old cronies there as will be my case
i quite long to be among them sometimes of the winter evenings for it is but dull business for a lonesome elderly man like me to be nodding by the hour together with no company but his airtight stove
summer or winter theres a great deal to be said in favor of my farm
and take it in the autumn what can be pleasanter than to spend a whole day on the sunny side of a barn or a woodpile chatting with somebody as old as ones self or perhaps idling away the time with a naturalborn simpleton who knows how to be idle because even our busy yankees never have found out how to put him to any use
upon my word miss hepzibah i doubt whether ive ever been so comfortable as i mean to be at my farm which most folks call the workhouse
but youyoure a young woman yetyou never need go there
something still better will turn up for you
im sure of it  hepzibah fancied that there was something peculiar in her venerable friends look and tone insomuch that she gazed into his face with considerable earnestness endeavoring to discover what secret meaning if any might be lurking there
individuals whose affairs have reached an utterly desperate crisis almost invariably keep themselves alive with hopes so much the more airily magnificent as they have the less of solid matter within their grasp whereof to mould any judicious and moderate expectation of good
thus all the while hepzibah was perfecting the scheme of her little shop she had cherished an unacknowledged idea that some harlequin trick of fortune would intervene in her favor
for example an unclewho had sailed for india fifty years before and never been heard of sincemight yet return and adopt her to be the comfort of his very extreme and decrepit age and adorn her with pearls diamonds and oriental shawls and turbans and make her the ultimate heiress of his unreckonable riches
or the member of parliament now at the head of the english branch of the familywith which the elder stock on this side of the atlantic had held little or no intercourse for the last two centuriesthis eminent gentleman might invite hepzibah to quit the ruinous house of the seven gables and come over to dwell with her kindred at pyncheon hall
but for reasons the most imperative she could not yield to his request
it was more probable therefore that the descendants of a pyncheon who had emigrated to virginia in some past generation and became a great planter therehearing of hepzibahs destitution and impelled by the splendid generosity of character with which their virginian mixture must have enriched the new england bloodwould send her a remittance of a thousand dollars with a hint of repeating the favor annually
orand surely anything so undeniably just could not be beyond the limits of reasonable anticipationthe great claim to the heritage of waldo county might finally be decided in favor of the pyncheons so that instead of keeping a centshop hepzibah would build a palace and look down from its highest tower on hill dale forest field and town as her own share of the ancestral territory
these were some of the fantasies which she had long dreamed about and aided by these uncle venners casual attempt at encouragement kindled a strange festal glory in the poor bare melancholy chambers of her brain as if that inner world were suddenly lighted up with gas
but either he knew nothing of her castles in the airas how should heor else her earnest scowl disturbed his recollection as it might a more courageous mans
instead of pursuing any weightier topic uncle venner was pleased to favor hepzibah with some sage counsel in her shopkeeping capacity
give no creditthese were some of his golden maximsnever take papermoney
look well to your change
ring the silver on the fourpound weight
shove back all english halfpence and base copper tokens such as are very plenty about town
at your leisure hours knit childrens woollen socks and mittens
brew your own yeast and make your own gingerbeer  and while hepzibah was doing her utmost to digest the hard little pellets of his already uttered wisdom he gave vent to his final and what he declared to be his allimportant advice as follows  put on a bright face for your customers and smile pleasantly as you hand them what they ask for
a stale article if you dip it in a good warm sunny smile will go off better than a fresh one that youve scowled upon  to this last apothegm poor hepzibah responded with a sigh so deep and heavy that it almost rustled uncle venner quite away like a withered leafas he wasbefore an autumnal gale
recovering himself however he bent forward and with a good deal of feeling in his ancient visage beckoned her nearer to him
when do you expect him home whispered he
whom do you mean asked hepzibah turning pale
ahyou dont love to talk about it said uncle venner
well well
well say no more though theres word of it all over town
i remember him miss hepzibah before he could run alone  during the remainder of the day poor hepzibah acquitted herself even less creditably as a shopkeeper than in her earlier efforts
she appeared to be walking in a dream or more truly the vivid life and reality assumed by her emotions made all outward occurrences unsubstantial like the teasing phantasms of a halfconscious slumber
she still responded mechanically to the frequent summons of the shopbell and at the demand of her customers went prying with vague eyes about the shop proffering them one article after another and thrusting asideperversely as most of them supposedthe identical thing they asked for
there is sad confusion indeed when the spirit thus flits away into the past or into the more awful future or in any manner steps across the spaceless boundary betwixt its own region and the actual world where the body remains to guide itself as best it may with little more than the mechanism of animal life
it is like death without deaths quiet privilegeits freedom from mortal care
worst of all when the actual duties are comprised in such petty details as now vexed the brooding soul of the old gentlewoman
as the animosity of fate would have it there was a great influx of custom in the course of the afternoon
hepzibah blundered to and fro about her small place of business committing the most unheardof errors now stringing up twelve and now seven tallowcandles instead of ten to the pound selling ginger for scotch snuff pins for needles and needles for pins misreckoning her change sometimes to the public detriment and much oftener to her own and thus she went on doing her utmost to bring chaos back again until at the close of the days labor to her inexplicable astonishment she found the moneydrawer almost destitute of coin
after all her painful traffic the whole proceeds were perhaps half a dozen coppers and a questionable ninepence which ultimately proved to be copper likewise
at this price or at whatever price she rejoiced that the day had reached its end
never before had she had such a sense of the intolerable length of time that creeps between dawn and sunset and of the miserable irksomeness of having aught to do and of the better wisdom that it would be to lie down at once in sullen resignation and let life and its toils and vexations trample over ones prostrate body as they may
hepzibahs final operation was with the little devourer of jim crow and the elephant who now proposed to eat a camel
in her bewilderment she offered him first a wooden dragoon and next a handful of marbles neither of which being adapted to his else omnivorous appetite she hastily held out her whole remaining stock of natural history in gingerbread and huddled the small customer out of the shop
she then muffled the bell in an unfinished stocking and put up the oaken bar across the door
during the latter process an omnibus came to a standstill under the branches of the elmtree
hepzibahs heart was in her mouth
remote and dusky and with no sunshine on all the intervening space was that region of the past whence her only guest might be expected to arrive
was she to meet him now
somebody at all events was passing from the farthest interior of the omnibus towards its entrance
a gentleman alighted but it was only to offer his hand to a young girl whose slender figure nowise needing such assistance now lightly descended the steps and made an airy little jump from the final one to the sidewalk
she rewarded her cavalier with a smile the cheery glow of which was seen reflected on his own face as he reentered the vehicle
the girl then turned towards the house of the seven gables to the door of which meanwhilenot the shopdoor but the antique portalthe omnibusman had carried a light trunk and a bandbox
first giving a sharp rap of the old iron knocker he left his passenger and her luggage at the doorstep and departed
who can it be thought hepzibah who had been screwing her visual organs into the acutest focus of which they were capable
the girl must have mistaken the house she stole softly into the hall and herself invisible gazed through the dusty sidelights of the portal at the young blooming and very cheerful face which presented itself for admittance into the gloomy old mansion
it was a face to which almost any door would have opened of its own accord
the young girl so fresh so unconventional and yet so orderly and obedient to common rules as you at once recognized her to be was widely in contrast at that moment with everything about her
the sordid and ugly luxuriance of gigantic weeds that grew in the angle of the house and the heavy projection that overshadowed her and the timeworn framework of the doornone of these things belonged to her sphere
but even as a ray of sunshine fall into what dismal place it may instantaneously creates for itself a propriety in being there so did it seem altogether fit that the girl should be standing at the threshold
it was no less evidently proper that the door should swing open to admit her
the maiden lady herself sternly inhospitable in her first purposes soon began to feel that the door ought to be shoved back and the rusty key be turned in the reluctant lock
can it be phbe questioned she within herself
it must be little phbe for it can be nobody elseand there is a look of her father about her too
but what does she want here
and how like a country cousin to come down upon a poor body in this way without so much as a days notice or asking whether she would be welcome
well she must have a nights lodging i suppose and tomorrow the child shall go back to her mother  phbe it must be understood was that one little offshoot of the pyncheon race to whom we have already referred as a native of a rural part of new england where the old fashions and feelings of relationship are still partially kept up
in her own circle it was regarded as by no means improper for kinsfolk to visit one another without invitation or preliminary and ceremonious warning
yet in consideration of miss hepzibahs recluse way of life a letter had actually been written and despatched conveying information of phbes projected visit
this epistle for three or four days past had been in the pocket of the pennypostman who happening to have no other business in pyncheon street had not yet made it convenient to call at the house of the seven gables
noshe can stay only one night said hepzibah unbolting the door
if clifford were to find her here it might disturb him     v may and november   phbe pyncheon slept on the night of her arrival in a chamber that looked down on the garden of the old house
it fronted towards the east so that at a very seasonable hour a glow of crimson light came flooding through the window and bathed the dingy ceiling and paperhangings in its own hue
there were curtains to phbes bed a dark antique canopy and ponderous festoons of a stuff which had been rich and even magnificent in its time but which now brooded over the girl like a cloud making a night in that one corner while elsewhere it was beginning to be day
the morning light however soon stole into the aperture at the foot of the bed betwixt those faded curtains
finding the new guest therewith a bloom on her cheeks like the mornings own and a gentle stir of departing slumber in her limbs as when an early breeze moves the foliagethe dawn kissed her brow
it was the caress which a dewy maidensuch as the dawn is immortallygives to her sleeping sister partly from the impulse of irresistible fondness and partly as a pretty hint that it is time now to unclose her eyes
at the touch of those lips of light phbe quietly awoke and for a moment did not recognize where she was nor how those heavy curtains chanced to be festooned around her
nothing indeed was absolutely plain to her except that it was now early morning and that whatever might happen next it was proper first of all to get up and say her prayers
she was the more inclined to devotion from the grim aspect of the chamber and its furniture especially the tall stiff chairs one of which stood close by her bedside and looked as if some oldfashioned personage had been sitting there all night and had vanished only just in season to escape discovery
when phbe was quite dressed she peeped out of the window and saw a rosebush in the garden
being a very tall one and of luxuriant growth it had been propped up against the side of the house and was literally covered with a rare and very beautiful species of white rose
a large portion of them as the girl afterwards discovered had blight or mildew at their hearts but viewed at a fair distance the whole rosebush looked as if it had been brought from eden that very summer together with the mould in which it grew
the truth was nevertheless that it had been planted by alice pyncheonshe was phbes greatgreatgrandauntin soil which reckoning only its cultivation as a gardenplat was now unctuous with nearly two hundred years of vegetable decay
growing as they did however out of the old earth the flowers still sent a fresh and sweet incense up to their creator nor could it have been the less pure and acceptable because phbes young breath mingled with it as the fragrance floated past the window
hastening down the creaking and carpetless staircase she found her way into the garden gathered some of the most perfect of the roses and brought them to her chamber
little phbe was one of those persons who possess as their exclusive patrimony the gift of practical arrangement
it is a kind of natural magic that enables these favored ones to bring out the hidden capabilities of things around them and particularly to give a look of comfort and habitableness to any place which for however brief a period may happen to be their home
a wild hut of underbrush tossed together by wayfarers through the primitive forest would acquire the home aspect by one nights lodging of such a woman and would retain it long after her quiet figure had disappeared into the surrounding shade
no less a portion of such homely witchcraft was requisite to reclaim as it were phbes waste cheerless and dusky chamber which had been untenanted so longexcept by spiders and mice and rats and ghoststhat it was all overgrown with the desolation which watches to obliterate every trace of mans happier hours
what was precisely phbes process we find it impossible to say
she appeared to have no preliminary design but gave a touch here and another there brought some articles of furniture to light and dragged others into the shadow looped up or let down a windowcurtain and in the course of half an hour had fully succeeded in throwing a kindly and hospitable smile over the apartment
no longer ago than the night before it had resembled nothing so much as the old maids heart for there was neither sunshine nor household fire in one nor the other and save for ghosts and ghostly reminiscences not a guest for many years gone by had entered the heart or the chamber
there was still another peculiarity of this inscrutable charm
the bedchamber no doubt was a chamber of very great and varied experience as a scene of human life the joy of bridal nights had throbbed itself away here new immortals had first drawn earthly breath here and here old people had died
butwhether it were the white roses or whatever the subtile influence might bea person of delicate instinct would have known at once that it was now a maidens bedchamber and had been purified of all former evil and sorrow by her sweet breath and happy thoughts
her dreams of the past night being such cheerful ones had exorcised the gloom and now haunted the chamber in its stead
after arranging matters to her satisfaction phbe emerged from her chamber with a purpose to descend again into the garden
besides the rosebush she had observed several other species of flowers growing there in a wilderness of neglect and obstructing one anothers development as is often the parallel case in human society by their uneducated entanglement and confusion
at the head of the stairs however she met hepzibah who it being still early invited her into a room which she would probably have called her boudoir had her education embraced any such french phrase
it was strewn about with a few old books and a workbasket and a dusty writingdesk and had on one side a large black article of furniture of very strange appearance which the old gentlewoman told phbe was a harpsichord
it looked more like a coffin than anything else and indeednot having been played upon or opened for yearsthere must have been a vast deal of dead music in it stifled for want of air
human finger was hardly known to have touched its chords since the days of alice pyncheon who had learned the sweet accomplishment of melody in europe
hepzibah bade her young guest sit down and herself taking a chair near by looked as earnestly at phbes trim little figure as if she expected to see right into its springs and motive secrets
cousin phbe said she at last i really cant see my way clear to keep you with me  these words however had not the inhospitable bluntness with which they may strike the reader for the two relatives in a talk before bedtime had arrived at a certain degree of mutual understanding
hepzibah knew enough to enable her to appreciate the circumstances resulting from the second marriage of the girls mother which made it desirable for phbe to establish herself in another home
nor did she misinterpret phbes character and the genial activity pervading itone of the most valuable traits of the true new england womanwhich had impelled her forth as might be said to seek her fortune but with a selfrespecting purpose to confer as much benefit as she could anywise receive
as one of her nearest kindred she had naturally betaken herself to hepzibah with no idea of forcing herself on her cousins protection but only for a visit of a week or two which might be indefinitely extended should it prove for the happiness of both
to hepzibahs blunt observation therefore phbe replied as frankly and more cheerfully
dear cousin i cannot tell how it will be said she
but i really think we may suit one another much better than you suppose  you are a nice girli see it plainly continued hepzibah and it is not any question as to that point which makes me hesitate
but phbe this house of mine is but a melancholy place for a young person to be in
it lets in the wind and rain and the snow too in the garret and upper chambers in wintertime but it never lets in the sunshine
and as for myself you see what i ama dismal and lonesome old woman for i begin to call myself old phbe whose temper i am afraid is none of the best and whose spirits are as bad as can be
i cannot make your life pleasant cousin phbe neither can i so much as give you bread to eat  you will find me a cheerful little body answered phbe smiling and yet with a kind of gentle dignity and i mean to earn my bread
you know i have not been brought up a pyncheon
a girl learns many things in a new england village  ah
phbe said hepzibah sighing your knowledge would do but little for you here
and then it is a wretched thought that you should fling away your young days in a place like this
those cheeks would not be so rosy after a month or two
look at my face and indeed the contrast was very strikingyou see how pale i am
it is my idea that the dust and continual decay of these old houses are unwholesome for the lungs  there is the gardenthe flowers to be taken care of observed phbe
i should keep myself healthy with exercise in the open air  and after all child exclaimed hepzibah suddenly rising as if to dismiss the subject it is not for me to say who shall be a guest or inhabitant of the old pyncheon house
its master is coming  do you mean judge pyncheon asked phbe in surprise
judge pyncheon answered her cousin angrily
he will hardly cross the threshold while i live
no no
but phbe you shall see the face of him i speak of  she went in quest of the miniature already described and returned with it in her hand
giving it to phbe she watched her features narrowly and with a certain jealousy as to the mode in which the girl would show herself affected by the picture
how do you like the face asked hepzibah
it is handsomeit is very beautiful said phbe admiringly
it is as sweet a face as a mans can be or ought to be
it has something of a childs expressionand yet not childishonly one feels so very kindly towards him
he ought never to suffer anything
one would bear much for the sake of sparing him toil or sorrow
who is it cousin hepzibah  did you never hear whispered her cousin bending towards her of clifford pyncheon  never
i thought there were no pyncheons left except yourself and our cousin jaffrey answered phbe
and yet i seem to have heard the name of clifford pyncheon
yesfrom my father or my mother but has he not been a long while dead  well well child perhaps he has said hepzibah with a sad hollow laugh but in old houses like this you know dead people are very apt to come back again
we shall see
and cousin phbe since after all that i have said your courage does not fail you we will not part so soon
you are welcome my child for the present to such a home as your kinswoman can offer you  with this measured but not exactly cold assurance of a hospitable purpose hepzibah kissed her cheek
they now went below stairs where phbenot so much assuming the office as attracting it to herself by the magnetism of innate fitnesstook the most active part in preparing breakfast
the mistress of the house meanwhile as is usual with persons of her stiff and unmalleable cast stood mostly aside willing to lend her aid yet conscious that her natural inaptitude would be likely to impede the business in hand
phbe and the fire that boiled the teakettle were equally bright cheerful and efficient in their respective offices
hepzibah gazed forth from her habitual sluggishness the necessary result of long solitude as from another sphere
she could not help being interested however and even amused at the readiness with which her new inmate adapted herself to the circumstances and brought the house moreover and all its rusty old appliances into a suitableness for her purposes
whatever she did too was done without conscious effort and with frequent outbreaks of song which were exceedingly pleasant to the ear
this natural tunefulness made phbe seem like a bird in a shadowy tree or conveyed the idea that the stream of life warbled through her heart as a brook sometimes warbles through a pleasant little dell
it betokened the cheeriness of an active temperament finding joy in its activity and therefore rendering it beautiful it was a new england traitthe stern old stuff of puritanism with a gold thread in the web
hepzibah brought out some old silver spoons with the family crest upon them and a china teaset painted over with grotesque figures of man bird and beast in as grotesque a landscape
these pictured people were odd humorists in a world of their owna world of vivid brilliancy so far as color went and still unfaded although the teapot and small cups were as ancient as the custom itself of teadrinking
your greatgreatgreatgreatgrandmother had these cups when she was married said hepzibah to phbe
she was a davenport of a good family
they were almost the first teacups ever seen in the colony and if one of them were to be broken my heart would break with it
but it is nonsense to speak so about a brittle teacup when i remember what my heart has gone through without breaking  the cupsnot having been used perhaps since hepzibahs youthhad contracted no small burden of dust which phbe washed away with so much care and delicacy as to satisfy even the proprietor of this invaluable china
what a nice little housewife you are exclaimed the latter smiling and at the same time frowning so prodigiously that the smile was sunshine under a thundercloud
do you do other things as well
are you as good at your book as you are at washing teacups  not quite i am afraid said phbe laughing at the form of hepzibahs question
but i was schoolmistress for the little children in our district last summer and might have been so still  ah
tis all very well observed the maiden lady drawing herself up
but these things must have come to you with your mothers blood
i never knew a pyncheon that had any turn for them  it is very queer but not the less true that people are generally quite as vain or even more so of their deficiencies than of their available gifts as was hepzibah of this native inapplicability so to speak of the pyncheons to any useful purpose
she regarded it as an hereditary trait and so perhaps it was but unfortunately a morbid one such as is often generated in families that remain long above the surface of society
before they left the breakfasttable the shopbell rang sharply and hepzibah set down the remnant of her final cup of tea with a look of sallow despair that was truly piteous to behold
in cases of distasteful occupation the second day is generally worse than the first
we return to the rack with all the soreness of the preceding torture in our limbs
at all events hepzibah had fully satisfied herself of the impossibility of ever becoming wonted to this peevishly obstreperous little bell
ring as often as it might the sound always smote upon her nervous system rudely and suddenly
and especially now while with her crested teaspoons and antique china she was flattering herself with ideas of gentility she felt an unspeakable disinclination to confront a customer
do not trouble yourself dear cousin cried phbe starting lightly up
i am shopkeeper today  you child exclaimed hepzibah
what can a little country girl know of such matters  oh i have done all the shopping for the family at our village store said phbe
and i have had a table at a fancy fair and made better sales than anybody
these things are not to be learnt they depend upon a knack that comes i suppose added she smiling with ones mothers blood
you shall see that i am as nice a little saleswoman as i am a housewife  the old gentlewoman stole behind phbe and peeped from the passageway into the shop to note how she would manage her undertaking
it was a case of some intricacy
a very ancient woman in a white short gown and a green petticoat with a string of gold beads about her neck and what looked like a nightcap on her head had brought a quantity of yarn to barter for the commodities of the shop
she was probably the very last person in town who still kept the timehonored spinningwheel in constant revolution
it was worth while to hear the croaking and hollow tones of the old lady and the pleasant voice of phbe mingling in one twisted thread of talk and still better to contrast their figuresso light and bloomyso decrepit and duskywith only the counter betwixt them in one sense but more than threescore years in another
as for the bargain it was wrinkled slyness and craft pitted against native truth and sagacity
was not that well done asked phbe laughing when the customer was gone
nicely done indeed child answered hepzibah
i could not have gone through with it nearly so well
as you say it must be a knack that belongs to you on the mothers side  it is a very genuine admiration that with which persons too shy or too awkward to take a due part in the bustling world regard the real actors in lifes stirring scenes so genuine in fact that the former are usually fain to make it palatable to their selflove by assuming that these active and forcible qualities are incompatible with others which they choose to deem higher and more important
thus hepzibah was well content to acknowledge phbes vastly superior gifts as a shopkeeper she listened with compliant ear to her suggestion of various methods whereby the influx of trade might be increased and rendered profitable without a hazardous outlay of capital
she consented that the village maiden should manufacture yeast both liquid and in cakes and should brew a certain kind of beer nectareous to the palate and of rare stomachic virtues and moreover should bake and exhibit for sale some little spicecakes which whosoever tasted would longingly desire to taste again
all such proofs of a ready mind and skilful handiwork were highly acceptable to the aristocratic hucksteress so long as she could murmur to herself with a grim smile and a halfnatural sigh and a sentiment of mixed wonder pity and growing affection  what a nice little body she is
if she only could be a lady toobut thats impossible
phbe is no pyncheon
she takes everything from her mother  as to phbes not being a lady or whether she were a lady or no it was a point perhaps difficult to decide but which could hardly have come up for judgment at all in any fair and healthy mind
out of new england it would be impossible to meet with a person combining so many ladylike attributes with so many others that form no necessary if compatible part of the character
she shocked no canon of taste she was admirably in keeping with herself and never jarred against surrounding circumstances
her figure to be sureso small as to be almost childlike and so elastic that motion seemed as easy or easier to it than rest would hardly have suited ones idea of a countess
neither did her facewith the brown ringlets on either side and the slightly piquant nose and the wholesome bloom and the clear shade of tan and the half dozen freckles friendly remembrances of the april sun and breezeprecisely give us a right to call her beautiful
but there was both lustre and depth in her eyes
she was very pretty as graceful as a bird and graceful much in the same way as pleasant about the house as a gleam of sunshine falling on the floor through a shadow of twinkling leaves or as a ray of firelight that dances on the wall while evening is drawing nigh
instead of discussing her claim to rank among ladies it would be preferable to regard phbe as the example of feminine grace and availability combined in a state of society if there were any such where ladies did not exist
there it should be womans office to move in the midst of practical affairs and to gild them all the very homeliestwere it even the scouring of pots and kettleswith an atmosphere of loveliness and joy
such was the sphere of phbe
to find the born and educated lady on the other hand we need look no farther than hepzibah our forlorn old maid in her rustling and rusty silks with her deeply cherished and ridiculous consciousness of long descent her shadowy claims to princely territory and in the way of accomplishment her recollections it may be of having formerly thrummed on a harpsichord and walked a minuet and worked an antique tapestrystitch on her sampler
it was a fair parallel between new plebeianism and old gentility
it really seemed as if the battered visage of the house of the seven gables black and heavybrowed as it still certainly looked must have shown a kind of cheerfulness glimmering through its dusky windows as phbe passed to and fro in the interior
otherwise it is impossible to explain how the people of the neighborhood so soon became aware of the girls presence
there was a great run of custom setting steadily in from about ten oclock until towards noonrelaxing somewhat at dinnertime but recommencing in the afternoon and finally dying away a half an hour or so before the long days sunset
one of the stanchest patrons was little ned higgins the devourer of jim crow and the elephant who today signalized his omnivorous prowess by swallowing two dromedaries and a locomotive
phbe laughed as she summed up her aggregate of sales upon the slate while hepzibah first drawing on a pair of silk gloves reckoned over the sordid accumulation of copper coin not without silver intermixed that had jingled into the till
we must renew our stock cousin hepzibah cried the little saleswoman
the gingerbread figures are all gone and so are those dutch wooden milkmaids and most of our other playthings
there has been constant inquiry for cheap raisins and a great cry for whistles and trumpets and jewsharps and at least a dozen little boys have asked for molassescandy
and we must contrive to get a peck of russet apples late in the season as it is
but dear cousin what an enormous heap of copper
positively a copper mountain  well done
well done
well done quoth uncle venner who had taken occasion to shuffle in and out of the shop several times in the course of the day
heres a girl that will never end her days at my farm
bless my eyes what a brisk little soul  yes phbe is a nice girl said hepzibah with a scowl of austere approbation
but uncle venner you have known the family a great many years
can you tell me whether there ever was a pyncheon whom she takes after  i dont believe there ever was answered the venerable man
at any rate it never was my luck to see her like among them nor for that matter anywhere else
ive seen a great deal of the world not only in peoples kitchens and backyards but at the streetcorners and on the wharves and in other places where my business calls me and im free to say miss hepzibah that i never knew a human creature do her work so much like one of gods angels as this child phbe does  uncle venners eulogium if it appear rather too highstrained for the person and occasion had nevertheless a sense in which it was both subtile and true
there was a spiritual quality in phbes activity
the life of the long and busy dayspent in occupations that might so easily have taken a squalid and ugly aspecthad been made pleasant and even lovely by the spontaneous grace with which these homely duties seemed to bloom out of her character so that labor while she dealt with it had the easy and flexible charm of play
angels do not toil but let their good works grow out of them and so did phbe
the two relativesthe young maid and the old onefound time before nightfall in the intervals of trade to make rapid advances towards affection and confidence
a recluse like hepzibah usually displays remarkable frankness and at least temporary affability on being absolutely cornered and brought to the point of personal intercourse like the angel whom jacob wrestled with she is ready to bless you when once overcome
the old gentlewoman took a dreary and proud satisfaction in leading phbe from room to room of the house and recounting the traditions with which as we may say the walls were lugubriously frescoed
she showed the indentations made by the lieutenantgovernors swordhilt in the doorpanels of the apartment where old colonel pyncheon a dead host had received his affrighted visitors with an awful frown
the dusky terror of that frown hepzibah observed was thought to be lingering ever since in the passageway
she bade phbe step into one of the tall chairs and inspect the ancient map of the pyncheon territory at the eastward
in a tract of land on which she laid her finger there existed a silver mine the locality of which was precisely pointed out in some memoranda of colonel pyncheon himself but only to be made known when the family claim should be recognized by government
thus it was for the interest of all new england that the pyncheons should have justice done them
she told too how that there was undoubtedly an immense treasure of english guineas hidden somewhere about the house or in the cellar or possibly in the garden
if you should happen to find it phbe said hepzibah glancing aside at her with a grim yet kindly smile we will tie up the shopbell for good and all  yes dear cousin answered phbe but in the mean time i hear somebody ringing it  when the customer was gone hepzibah talked rather vaguely and at great length about a certain alice pyncheon who had been exceedingly beautiful and accomplished in her lifetime a hundred years ago
the fragrance of her rich and delightful character still lingered about the place where she had lived as a dried rosebud scents the drawer where it has withered and perished
this lovely alice had met with some great and mysterious calamity and had grown thin and white and gradually faded out of the world
but even now she was supposed to haunt the house of the seven gables and a great many timesespecially when one of the pyncheons was to dieshe had been heard playing sadly and beautifully on the harpsichord
one of these tunes just as it had sounded from her spiritual touch had been written down by an amateur of music it was so exquisitely mournful that nobody to this day could bear to hear it played unless when a great sorrow had made them know the still profounder sweetness of it
was it the same harpsichord that you showed me inquired phbe
the very same said hepzibah
it was alice pyncheons harpsichord
when i was learning music my father would never let me open it
so as i could only play on my teachers instrument i have forgotten all my music long ago  leaving these antique themes the old lady began to talk about the daguerreotypist whom as he seemed to be a wellmeaning and orderly young man and in narrow circumstances she had permitted to take up his residence in one of the seven gables
but on seeing more of mr holgrave she hardly knew what to make of him
he had the strangest companions imaginable men with long beards and dressed in linen blouses and other such newfangled and illfitting garments reformers temperance lecturers and all manner of crosslooking philanthropists communitymen and comeouters as hepzibah believed who acknowledged no law and ate no solid food but lived on the scent of other peoples cookery and turned up their noses at the fare
as for the daguerreotypist she had read a paragraph in a penny paper the other day accusing him of making a speech full of wild and disorganizing matter at a meeting of his bandittilike associates
for her own part she had reason to believe that he practised animal magnetism and if such things were in fashion nowadays should be apt to suspect him of studying the black art up there in his lonesome chamber
but dear cousin said phbe if the young man is so dangerous why do you let him stay
if he does nothing worse he may set the house on fire  why sometimes answered hepzibah i have seriously made it a question whether i ought not to send him away
but with all his oddities he is a quiet kind of a person and has such a way of taking hold of ones mind that without exactly liking him for i dont know enough of the young man i should be sorry to lose sight of him entirely
a woman clings to slight acquaintances when she lives so much alone as i do  but if mr holgrave is a lawless person remonstrated phbe a part of whose essence it was to keep within the limits of law
oh said hepzibah carelesslyfor formal as she was still in her lifes experience she had gnashed her teeth against human lawi suppose he has a law of his own     vi
maules well   after an early tea the little countrygirl strayed into the garden
the enclosure had formerly been very extensive but was now contracted within small compass and hemmed about partly by high wooden fences and partly by the outbuildings of houses that stood on another street
in its centre was a grassplat surrounding a ruinous little structure which showed just enough of its original design to indicate that it had once been a summerhouse
a hopvine springing from last years root was beginning to clamber over it but would be long in covering the roof with its green mantle
three of the seven gables either fronted or looked sideways with a dark solemnity of aspect down into the garden
the black rich soil had fed itself with the decay of a long period of time such as fallen leaves the petals of flowers and the stalks and seedvessels of vagrant and lawless plants more useful after their death than ever while flaunting in the sun
the evil of these departed years would naturally have sprung up again in such rank weeds symbolic of the transmitted vices of society as are always prone to root themselves about human dwellings
phbe saw however that their growth must have been checked by a degree of careful labor bestowed daily and systematically on the garden
the white double rosebush had evidently been propped up anew against the house since the commencement of the season and a peartree and three damsontrees which except a row of currantbushes constituted the only varieties of fruit bore marks of the recent amputation of several superfluous or defective limbs
there were also a few species of antique and hereditary flowers in no very flourishing condition but scrupulously weeded as if some person either out of love or curiosity had been anxious to bring them to such perfection as they were capable of attaining
the remainder of the garden presented a wellselected assortment of esculent vegetables in a praiseworthy state of advancement
summer squashes almost in their golden blossom cucumbers now evincing a tendency to spread away from the main stock and ramble far and wide two or three rows of stringbeans and as many more that were about to festoon themselves on poles tomatoes occupying a site so sheltered and sunny that the plants were already gigantic and promised an early and abundant harvest
phbe wondered whose care and toil it could have been that had planted these vegetables and kept the soil so clean and orderly
not surely her cousin hepzibahs who had no taste nor spirits for the ladylike employment of cultivating flowers andwith her recluse habits and tendency to shelter herself within the dismal shadow of the housewould hardly have come forth under the speck of open sky to weed and hoe among the fraternity of beans and squashes
it being her first day of complete estrangement from rural objects phbe found an unexpected charm in this little nook of grass and foliage and aristocratic flowers and plebeian vegetables
the eye of heaven seemed to look down into it pleasantly and with a peculiar smile as if glad to perceive that nature elsewhere overwhelmed and driven out of the dusty town had here been able to retain a breathingplace
the spot acquired a somewhat wilder grace and yet a very gentle one from the fact that a pair of robins had built their nest in the peartree and were making themselves exceedingly busy and happy in the dark intricacy of its boughs
bees toostrange to sayhad thought it worth their while to come hither possibly from the range of hives beside some farmhouse miles away
how many aerial voyages might they have made in quest of honey or honeyladen betwixt dawn and sunset
yet late as it now was there still arose a pleasant hum out of one or two of the squashblossoms in the depths of which these bees were plying their golden labor
there was one other object in the garden which nature might fairly claim as her inalienable property in spite of whatever man could do to render it his own
this was a fountain set round with a rim of old mossy stones and paved in its bed with what appeared to be a sort of mosaicwork of variously colored pebbles
the play and slight agitation of the water in its upward gush wrought magically with these variegated pebbles and made a continually shifting apparition of quaint figures vanishing too suddenly to be definable
thence swelling over the rim of mossgrown stones the water stole away under the fence through what we regret to call a gutter rather than a channel
nor must we forget to mention a hencoop of very reverend antiquity that stood in the farther corner of the garden not a great way from the fountain
it now contained only chanticleer his two wives and a solitary chicken
all of them were pure specimens of a breed which had been transmitted down as an heirloom in the pyncheon family and were said while in their prime to have attained almost the size of turkeys and on the score of delicate flesh to be fit for a princes table
in proof of the authenticity of this legendary renown hepzibah could have exhibited the shell of a great egg which an ostrich need hardly have been ashamed of
be that as it might the hens were now scarcely larger than pigeons and had a queer rusty withered aspect and a gouty kind of movement and a sleepy and melancholy tone throughout all the variations of their clucking and cackling
it was evident that the race had degenerated like many a noble race besides in consequence of too strict a watchfulness to keep it pure
these feathered people had existed too long in their distinct variety a fact of which the present representatives judging by their lugubrious deportment seemed to be aware
they kept themselves alive unquestionably and laid now and then an egg and hatched a chicken not for any pleasure of their own but that the world might not absolutely lose what had once been so admirable a breed of fowls
the distinguishing mark of the hens was a crest of lamentably scanty growth in these latter days but so oddly and wickedly analogous to hepzibahs turban that phbeto the poignant distress of her conscience but inevitablywas led to fancy a general resemblance betwixt these forlorn bipeds and her respectable relative
the girl ran into the house to get some crumbs of bread cold potatoes and other such scraps as were suitable to the accommodating appetite of fowls
returning she gave a peculiar call which they seemed to recognize
the chicken crept through the pales of the coop and ran with some show of liveliness to her feet while chanticleer and the ladies of his household regarded her with queer sidelong glances and then croaked one to another as if communicating their sage opinions of her character
so wise as well as antique was their aspect as to give color to the idea not merely that they were the descendants of a timehonored race but that they had existed in their individual capacity ever since the house of the seven gables was founded and were somehow mixed up with its destiny
they were a species of tutelary sprite or banshee although winged and feathered differently from most other guardian angels
here you odd little chicken said phbe here are some nice crumbs for you  the chicken hereupon though almost as venerable in appearance as its motherpossessing indeed the whole antiquity of its progenitors in miniaturemustered vivacity enough to flutter upward and alight on phbes shoulder
that little fowl pays you a high compliment said a voice behind phbe
turning quickly she was surprised at sight of a young man who had found access into the garden by a door opening out of another gable than that whence she had emerged
he held a hoe in his hand and while phbe was gone in quest of the crumbs had begun to busy himself with drawing up fresh earth about the roots of the tomatoes
the chicken really treats you like an old acquaintance continued he in a quiet way while a smile made his face pleasanter than phbe at first fancied it
those venerable personages in the coop too seem very affably disposed
you are lucky to be in their good graces so soon
they have known me much longer but never honor me with any familiarity though hardly a day passes without my bringing them food
miss hepzibah i suppose will interweave the fact with her other traditions and set it down that the fowls know you to be a pyncheon  the secret is said phbe smiling that i have learned how to talk with hens and chickens  ah but these hens answered the young manthese hens of aristocratic lineage would scorn to understand the vulgar language of a barnyard fowl
i prefer to thinkand so would miss hepzibahthat they recognize the family tone
for you are a pyncheon  my name is phbe pyncheon said the girl with a manner of some reserve for she was aware that her new acquaintance could be no other than the daguerreotypist of whose lawless propensities the old maid had given her a disagreeable idea
i did not know that my cousin hepzibahs garden was under another persons care  yes said holgrave i dig and hoe and weed in this black old earth for the sake of refreshing myself with what little nature and simplicity may be left in it after men have so long sown and reaped here
i turn up the earth by way of pastime
my sober occupation so far as i have any is with a lighter material
in short i make pictures out of sunshine and not to be too much dazzled with my own trade i have prevailed with miss hepzibah to let me lodge in one of these dusky gables
it is like a bandage over ones eyes to come into it
but would you like to see a specimen of my productions  a daguerreotype likeness do you mean asked phbe with less reserve for in spite of prejudice her own youthfulness sprang forward to meet his
i dont much like pictures of that sortthey are so hard and stern besides dodging away from the eye and trying to escape altogether
they are conscious of looking very unamiable i suppose and therefore hate to be seen  if you would permit me said the artist looking at phbe i should like to try whether the daguerreotype can bring out disagreeable traits on a perfectly amiable face
but there certainly is truth in what you have said
most of my likenesses do look unamiable but the very sufficient reason i fancy is because the originals are so
there is a wonderful insight in heavens broad and simple sunshine
while we give it credit only for depicting the merest surface it actually brings out the secret character with a truth that no painter would ever venture upon even could he detect it
there is at least no flattery in my humble line of art
now here is a likeness which i have taken over and over again and still with no better result
yet the original wears to common eyes a very different expression
it would gratify me to have your judgment on this character  he exhibited a daguerreotype miniature in a morocco case
phbe merely glanced at it and gave it back
i know the face she replied for its stern eye has been following me about all day
it is my puritan ancestor who hangs yonder in the parlor
to be sure you have found some way of copying the portrait without its black velvet cap and gray beard and have given him a modern coat and satin cravat instead of his cloak and band
i dont think him improved by your alterations  you would have seen other differences had you looked a little longer said holgrave laughing yet apparently much struck
i can assure you that this is a modern face and one which you will very probably meet
now the remarkable point is that the original wears to the worlds eyeand for aught i know to his most intimate friendsan exceedingly pleasant countenance indicative of benevolence openness of heart sunny goodhumor and other praiseworthy qualities of that cast
the sun as you see tells quite another story and will not be coaxed out of it after half a dozen patient attempts on my part
here we have the man sly subtle hard imperious and withal cold as ice
look at that eye
would you like to be at its mercy
at that mouth
could it ever smile
and yet if you could only see the benign smile of the original
it is so much the more unfortunate as he is a public character of some eminence and the likeness was intended to be engraved  well i dont wish to see it any more observed phbe turning away her eyes
it is certainly very like the old portrait
but my cousin hepzibah has another picturea miniature
if the original is still in the world i think he might defy the sun to make him look stern and hard  you have seen that picture then exclaimed the artist with an expression of much interest
i never did but have a great curiosity to do so
and you judge favorably of the face  there never was a sweeter one said phbe
it is almost too soft and gentle for a mans  is there nothing wild in the eye continued holgrave so earnestly that it embarrassed phbe as did also the quiet freedom with which he presumed on their so recent acquaintance
is there nothing dark or sinister anywhere
could you not conceive the original to have been guilty of a great crime  it is nonsense said phbe a little impatiently for us to talk about a picture which you have never seen
you mistake it for some other
a crime indeed
since you are a friend of my cousin hepzibahs you should ask her to show you the picture  it will suit my purpose still better to see the original replied the daguerreotypist coolly
as to his character we need not discuss its points they have already been settled by a competent tribunal or one which called itself competent
but stay
do not go yet if you please
i have a proposition to make you  phbe was on the point of retreating but turned back with some hesitation for she did not exactly comprehend his manner although on better observation its feature seemed rather to be lack of ceremony than any approach to offensive rudeness
there was an odd kind of authority too in what he now proceeded to say rather as if the garden were his own than a place to which he was admitted merely by hepzibahs courtesy
if agreeable to you he observed it would give me pleasure to turn over these flowers and those ancient and respectable fowls to your care
coming fresh from country air and occupations you will soon feel the need of some such outofdoor employment
my own sphere does not so much lie among flowers
you can trim and tend them therefore as you please and i will ask only the least trifle of a blossom now and then in exchange for all the good honest kitchen vegetables with which i propose to enrich miss hepzibahs table
so we will be fellowlaborers somewhat on the community system  silently and rather surprised at her own compliance phbe accordingly betook herself to weeding a flowerbed but busied herself still more with cogitations respecting this young man with whom she so unexpectedly found herself on terms approaching to familiarity
she did not altogether like him
his character perplexed the little countrygirl as it might a more practised observer for while the tone of his conversation had generally been playful the impression left on her mind was that of gravity and except as his youth modified it almost sternness
she rebelled as it were against a certain magnetic element in the artists nature which he exercised towards her possibly without being conscious of it
after a little while the twilight deepened by the shadows of the fruittrees and the surrounding buildings threw an obscurity over the garden
there said holgrave it is time to give over work
that last stroke of the hoe has cut off a beanstalk
goodnight miss phbe pyncheon
any bright day if you will put one of those rosebuds in your hair and come to my rooms in central street i will seize the purest ray of sunshine and make a picture of the flower and its wearer he retired towards his own solitary gable but turned his head on reaching the door and called to phbe with a tone which certainly had laughter in it yet which seemed to be more than half in earnest
be careful not to drink at maules well said he
neither drink nor bathe your face in it  maules well answered phbe
is that it with the rim of mossy stones
i have no thought of drinking therebut why not  oh rejoined the daguerreotypist because like an old ladys cup of tea it is water bewitched  he vanished and phbe lingering a moment saw a glimmering light and then the steady beam of a lamp in a chamber of the gable
on returning into hepzibahs apartment of the house she found the lowstudded parlor so dim and dusky that her eyes could not penetrate the interior
she was indistinctly aware however that the gaunt figure of the old gentlewoman was sitting in one of the straightbacked chairs a little withdrawn from the window the faint gleam of which showed the blanched paleness of her cheek turned sideways towards a corner
shall i light a lamp cousin hepzibah she asked
do if you please my dear child answered hepzibah
but put it on the table in the corner of the passage
my eyes are weak and i can seldom bear the lamplight on them  what an instrument is the human voice
how wonderfully responsive to every emotion of the human soul
in hepzibahs tone at that moment there was a certain rich depth and moisture as if the words commonplace as they were had been steeped in the warmth of her heart
again while lighting the lamp in the kitchen phbe fancied that her cousin spoke to her
in a moment cousin answered the girl
these matches just glimmer and go out  but instead of a response from hepzibah she seemed to hear the murmur of an unknown voice
it was strangely indistinct however and less like articulate words than an unshaped sound such as would be the utterance of feeling and sympathy rather than of the intellect
so vague was it that its impression or echo in phbes mind was that of unreality
she concluded that she must have mistaken some other sound for that of the human voice or else that it was altogether in her fancy
she set the lighted lamp in the passage and again entered the parlor
hepzibahs form though its sable outline mingled with the dusk was now less imperfectly visible
in the remoter parts of the room however its walls being so ill adapted to reflect light there was nearly the same obscurity as before
cousin said phbe did you speak to me just now  no child replied hepzibah
fewer words than before but with the same mysterious music in them
mellow melancholy yet not mournful the tone seemed to gush up out of the deep well of hepzibahs heart all steeped in its profoundest emotion
there was a tremor in it too thatas all strong feeling is electricpartly communicated itself to phbe
the girl sat silently for a moment
but soon her senses being very acute she became conscious of an irregular respiration in an obscure corner of the room
her physical organization moreover being at once delicate and healthy gave her a perception operating with almost the effect of a spiritual medium that somebody was near at hand
my dear cousin asked she overcoming an indefinable reluctance is there not some one in the room with us  phbe my dear little girl said hepzibah after a moments pause you were up betimes and have been busy all day
pray go to bed for i am sure you must need rest
i will sit in the parlor awhile and collect my thoughts
it has been my custom for more years child than you have lived while thus dismissing her the maiden lady stept forward kissed phbe and pressed her to her heart which beat against the girls bosom with a strong high and tumultuous swell
how came there to be so much love in this desolate old heart that it could afford to well over thus abundantly
goodnight cousin said phbe strangely affected by hepzibahs manner
if you begin to love me i am glad  she retired to her chamber but did not soon fall asleep nor then very profoundly
at some uncertain period in the depths of night and as it were through the thin veil of a dream she was conscious of a footstep mounting the stairs heavily but not with force and decision
the voice of hepzibah with a hush through it was going up along with the footsteps and again responsive to her cousins voice phbe heard that strange vague murmur which might be likened to an indistinct shadow of human utterance
vii
the guest   when phbe awokewhich she did with the early twittering of the conjugal couple of robins in the peartreeshe heard movements below stairs and hastening down found hepzibah already in the kitchen
she stood by a window holding a book in close contiguity to her nose as if with the hope of gaining an olfactory acquaintance with its contents since her imperfect vision made it not very easy to read them
if any volume could have manifested its essential wisdom in the mode suggested it would certainly have been the one now in hepzibahs hand and the kitchen in such an event would forthwith have streamed with the fragrance of venison turkeys capons larded partridges puddings cakes and christmas pies in all manner of elaborate mixture and concoction
it was a cookery book full of innumerable old fashions of english dishes and illustrated with engravings which represented the arrangements of the table at such banquets as it might have befitted a nobleman to give in the great hall of his castle
and amid these rich and potent devices of the culinary art not one of which probably had been tested within the memory of any mans grandfather poor hepzibah was seeking for some nimble little titbit which with what skill she had and such materials as were at hand she might toss up for breakfast
soon with a deep sigh she put aside the savory volume and inquired of phbe whether old speckle as she called one of the hens had laid an egg the preceding day
phbe ran to see but returned without the expected treasure in her hand
at that instant however the blast of a fishdealers conch was heard announcing his approach along the street
with energetic raps at the shopwindow hepzibah summoned the man in and made purchase of what he warranted as the finest mackerel in his cart and as fat a one as ever he felt with his finger so early in the season
requesting phbe to roast some coffeewhich she casually observed was the real mocha and so long kept that each of the small berries ought to be worth its weight in goldthe maiden lady heaped fuel into the vast receptacle of the ancient fireplace in such quantity as soon to drive the lingering dusk out of the kitchen
the countrygirl willing to give her utmost assistance proposed to make an indian cake after her mothers peculiar method of easy manufacture and which she could vouch for as possessing a richness and if rightly prepared a delicacy unequalled by any other mode of breakfastcake
hepzibah gladly assenting the kitchen was soon the scene of savory preparation
perchance amid their proper element of smoke which eddied forth from the illconstructed chimney the ghosts of departed cookmaids looked wonderingly on or peeped down the great breadth of the flue despising the simplicity of the projected meal yet ineffectually pining to thrust their shadowy hands into each inchoate dish
the halfstarved rats at any rate stole visibly out of their hidingplaces and sat on their hindlegs snuffing the fumy atmosphere and wistfully awaiting an opportunity to nibble
hepzibah had no natural turn for cookery and to say the truth had fairly incurred her present meagreness by often choosing to go without her dinner rather than be attendant on the rotation of the spit or ebullition of the pot
her zeal over the fire therefore was quite an heroic test of sentiment
it was touching and positively worthy of tears if phbe the only spectator except the rats and ghosts aforesaid had not been better employed than in shedding them to see her rake out a bed of fresh and glowing coals and proceed to broil the mackerel
her usually pale cheeks were all ablaze with heat and hurry
she watched the fish with as much tender care and minuteness of attention as ifwe know not how to express it otherwiseas if her own heart were on the gridiron and her immortal happiness were involved in its being done precisely to a turn
life within doors has few pleasanter prospects than a neatly arranged and wellprovisioned breakfasttable
we come to it freshly in the dewy youth of the day and when our spiritual and sensual elements are in better accord than at a later period so that the material delights of the morning meal are capable of being fully enjoyed without any very grievous reproaches whether gastric or conscientious for yielding even a trifle overmuch to the animal department of our nature
the thoughts too that run around the ring of familiar guests have a piquancy and mirthfulness and oftentimes a vivid truth which more rarely find their way into the elaborate intercourse of dinner
hepzibahs small and ancient table supported on its slender and graceful legs and covered with a cloth of the richest damask looked worthy to be the scene and centre of one of the cheerfullest of parties
the vapor of the broiled fish arose like incense from the shrine of a barbarian idol while the fragrance of the mocha might have gratified the nostrils of a tutelary lar or whatever power has scope over a modern breakfasttable
phbes indian cakes were the sweetest offering of allin their hue befitting the rustic altars of the innocent and golden ageor so brightly yellow were they resembling some of the bread which was changed to glistening gold when midas tried to eat it
the butter must not be forgottenbutter which phbe herself had churned in her own rural home and brought it to her cousin as a propitiatory giftsmelling of cloverblossoms and diffusing the charm of pastoral scenery through the darkpanelled parlor
all this with the quaint gorgeousness of the old china cups and saucers and the crested spoons and a silver creamjug hepzibahs only other article of plate and shaped like the rudest porringer set out a board at which the stateliest of old colonel pyncheons guests need not have scorned to take his place
but the puritans face scowled down out of the picture as if nothing on the table pleased his appetite
by way of contributing what grace she could phbe gathered some roses and a few other flowers possessing either scent or beauty and arranged them in a glass pitcher which having long ago lost its handle was so much the fitter for a flowervase
the early sunshineas fresh as that which peeped into eves bower while she and adam sat at breakfast therecame twinkling through the branches of the peartree and fell quite across the table
all was now ready
there were chairs and plates for three
a chair and plate for hepzibahthe same for phbebut what other guest did her cousin look for
throughout this preparation there had been a constant tremor in hepzibahs frame an agitation so powerful that phbe could see the quivering of her gaunt shadow as thrown by the firelight on the kitchen wall or by the sunshine on the parlor floor
its manifestations were so various and agreed so little with one another that the girl knew not what to make of it
sometimes it seemed an ecstasy of delight and happiness
at such moments hepzibah would fling out her arms and infold phbe in them and kiss her cheek as tenderly as ever her mother had she appeared to do so by an inevitable impulse and as if her bosom were oppressed with tenderness of which she must needs pour out a little in order to gain breathingroom
the next moment without any visible cause for the change her unwonted joy shrank back appalled as it were and clothed itself in mourning or it ran and hid itself so to speak in the dungeon of her heart where it had long lain chained while a cold spectral sorrow took the place of the imprisoned joy that was afraid to be enfranchiseda sorrow as black as that was bright
she often broke into a little nervous hysteric laugh more touching than any tears could be and forthwith as if to try which was the most touching a gush of tears would follow or perhaps the laughter and tears came both at once and surrounded our poor hepzibah in a moral sense with a kind of pale dim rainbow
towards phbe as we have said she was affectionatefar tenderer than ever before in their brief acquaintance except for that one kiss on the preceding nightyet with a continually recurring pettishness and irritability
she would speak sharply to her then throwing aside all the starched reserve of her ordinary manner ask pardon and the next instant renew the justforgiven injury
at last when their mutual labor was all finished she took phbes hand in her own trembling one
bear with me my dear child she cried for truly my heart is full to the brim
bear with me for i love you phbe though i speak so roughly
think nothing of it dearest child
by and by i shall be kind and only kind  my dearest cousin cannot you tell me what has happened asked phbe with a sunny and tearful sympathy
what is it that moves you so  hush
hush
he is coming whispered hepzibah hastily wiping her eyes
let him see you first phbe for you are young and rosy and cannot help letting a smile break out whether or no
he always liked bright faces
and mine is old now and the tears are hardly dry on it
he never could abide tears
there draw the curtain a little so that the shadow may fall across his side of the table
but let there be a good deal of sunshine too for he never was fond of gloom as some people are
he has had but little sunshine in his lifepoor cliffordand oh what a black shadow
poor poor clifford  thus murmuring in an undertone as if speaking rather to her own heart than to phbe the old gentlewoman stepped on tiptoe about the room making such arrangements as suggested themselves at the crisis
meanwhile there was a step in the passageway above stairs
phbe recognized it as the same which had passed upward as through her dream in the nighttime
the approaching guest whoever it might be appeared to pause at the head of the staircase he paused twice or thrice in the descent he paused again at the foot
each time the delay seemed to be without purpose but rather from a forgetfulness of the purpose which had set him in motion or as if the persons feet came involuntarily to a standstill because the motivepower was too feeble to sustain his progress
finally he made a long pause at the threshold of the parlor
he took hold of the knob of the door then loosened his grasp without opening it
hepzibah her hands convulsively clasped stood gazing at the entrance
dear cousin hepzibah pray dont look so said phbe trembling for her cousins emotion and this mysteriously reluctant step made her feel as if a ghost were coming into the room
you really frighten me
is something awful going to happen  hush whispered hepzibah
be cheerful
whatever may happen be nothing but cheerful  the final pause at the threshold proved so long that hepzibah unable to endure the suspense rushed forward threw open the door and led in the stranger by the hand
at the first glance phbe saw an elderly personage in an oldfashioned dressinggown of faded damask and wearing his gray or almost white hair of an unusual length
it quite overshadowed his forehead except when he thrust it back and stared vaguely about the room
after a very brief inspection of his face it was easy to conceive that his footstep must necessarily be such an one as that which slowly and with as indefinite an aim as a childs first journey across a floor had just brought him hitherward
yet there were no tokens that his physical strength might not have sufficed for a free and determined gait
it was the spirit of the man that could not walk
the expression of his countenancewhile notwithstanding it had the light of reason in itseemed to waver and glimmer and nearly to die away and feebly to recover itself again
it was like a flame which we see twinkling among halfextinguished embers we gaze at it more intently than if it were a positive blaze gushing vividly upwardmore intently but with a certain impatience as if it ought either to kindle itself into satisfactory splendor or be at once extinguished
for an instant after entering the room the guest stood still retaining hepzibahs hand instinctively as a child does that of the grown person who guides it
he saw phbe however and caught an illumination from her youthful and pleasant aspect which indeed threw a cheerfulness about the parlor like the circle of reflected brilliancy around the glass vase of flowers that was standing in the sunshine
he made a salutation or to speak nearer the truth an illdefined abortive attempt at curtsy
imperfect as it was however it conveyed an idea or at least gave a hint of indescribable grace such as no practised art of external manners could have attained
it was too slight to seize upon at the instant yet as recollected afterwards seemed to transfigure the whole man
dear clifford said hepzibah in the tone with which one soothes a wayward infant this is our cousin phbelittle phbe pyncheonarthurs only child you know
she has come from the country to stay with us awhile for our old house has grown to be very lonely now  phbephbe pyncheonphbe repeated the guest with a strange sluggish illdefined utterance
arthurs child
ah i forget
no matter
she is very welcome  come dear clifford take this chair said hepzibah leading him to his place
pray phbe lower the curtain a very little more
now let us begin breakfast  the guest seated himself in the place assigned him and looked strangely around
he was evidently trying to grapple with the present scene and bring it home to his mind with a more satisfactory distinctness
he desired to be certain at least that he was here in the lowstudded crossbeamed oakenpanelled parlor and not in some other spot which had stereotyped itself into his senses
but the effort was too great to be sustained with more than a fragmentary success
continually as we may express it he faded away out of his place or in other words his mind and consciousness took their departure leaving his wasted gray and melancholy figurea substantial emptiness a material ghostto occupy his seat at table
again after a blank moment there would be a flickering tapergleam in his eyeballs
it betokened that his spiritual part had returned and was doing its best to kindle the hearts household fire and light up intellectual lamps in the dark and ruinous mansion where it was doomed to be a forlorn inhabitant
at one of these moments of less torpid yet still imperfect animation phbe became convinced of what she had at first rejected as too extravagant and startling an idea
she saw that the person before her must have been the original of the beautiful miniature in her cousin hepzibahs possession
indeed with a feminine eye for costume she had at once identified the damask dressinggown which enveloped him as the same in figure material and fashion with that so elaborately represented in the picture
this old faded garment with all its pristine brilliancy extinct seemed in some indescribable way to translate the wearers untold misfortune and make it perceptible to the beholders eye
it was the better to be discerned by this exterior type how worn and old were the souls more immediate garments that form and countenance the beauty and grace of which had almost transcended the skill of the most exquisite of artists
it could the more adequately be known that the soul of the man must have suffered some miserable wrong from its earthly experience
there he seemed to sit with a dim veil of decay and ruin betwixt him and the world but through which at flitting intervals might be caught the same expression so refined so softly imaginative which malboneventuring a happy touch with suspended breathhad imparted to the miniature
there had been something so innately characteristic in this look that all the dusky years and the burden of unfit calamity which had fallen upon him did not suffice utterly to destroy it
hepzibah had now poured out a cup of deliciously fragrant coffee and presented it to her guest
as his eyes met hers he seemed bewildered and disquieted
is this you hepzibah he murmured sadly then more apart and perhaps unconscious that he was overheard how changed
how changed
and is she angry with me
why does she bend her brow so  poor hepzibah
it was that wretched scowl which time and her nearsightedness and the fret of inward discomfort had rendered so habitual that any vehemence of mood invariably evoked it
but at the indistinct murmur of his words her whole face grew tender and even lovely with sorrowful affection the harshness of her features disappeared as it were behind the warm and misty glow
angry she repeated angry with you clifford  her tone as she uttered the exclamation had a plaintive and really exquisite melody thrilling through it yet without subduing a certain something which an obtuse auditor might still have mistaken for asperity
it was as if some transcendent musician should draw a soulthrilling sweetness out of a cracked instrument which makes its physical imperfection heard in the midst of ethereal harmonyso deep was the sensibility that found an organ in hepzibahs voice
there is nothing but love here clifford she addednothing but love
you are at home  the guest responded to her tone by a smile which did not half light up his face
feeble as it was however and gone in a moment it had a charm of wonderful beauty
it was followed by a coarser expression or one that had the effect of coarseness on the fine mould and outline of his countenance because there was nothing intellectual to temper it
it was a look of appetite
he ate food with what might almost be termed voracity and seemed to forget himself hepzibah the young girl and everything else around him in the sensual enjoyment which the bountifully spread table afforded
in his natural system though highwrought and delicately refined a sensibility to the delights of the palate was probably inherent
it would have been kept in check however and even converted into an accomplishment and one of the thousand modes of intellectual culture had his more ethereal characteristics retained their vigor
but as it existed now the effect was painful and made phbe droop her eyes
in a little while the guest became sensible of the fragrance of the yet untasted coffee
he quaffed it eagerly
the subtle essence acted on him like a charmed draught and caused the opaque substance of his animal being to grow transparent or at least translucent so that a spiritual gleam was transmitted through it with a clearer lustre than hitherto
more more he cried with nervous haste in his utterance as if anxious to retain his grasp of what sought to escape him
this is what i need
give me more  under this delicate and powerful influence he sat more erect and looked out from his eyes with a glance that took note of what it rested on
it was not so much that his expression grew more intellectual this though it had its share was not the most peculiar effect
neither was what we call the moral nature so forcibly awakened as to present itself in remarkable prominence
but a certain fine temper of being was now not brought out in full relief but changeably and imperfectly betrayed of which it was the function to deal with all beautiful and enjoyable things
in a character where it should exist as the chief attribute it would bestow on its possessor an exquisite taste and an enviable susceptibility of happiness
beauty would be his life his aspirations would all tend toward it and allowing his frame and physical organs to be in consonance his own developments would likewise be beautiful
such a man should have nothing to do with sorrow nothing with strife nothing with the martyrdom which in an infinite variety of shapes awaits those who have the heart and will and conscience to fight a battle with the world
to these heroic tempers such martyrdom is the richest meed in the worlds gift
to the individual before us it could only be a grief intense in due proportion with the severity of the infliction
he had no right to be a martyr and beholding him so fit to be happy and so feeble for all other purposes a generous strong and noble spirit would methinks have been ready to sacrifice what little enjoyment it might have planned for itselfit would have flung down the hopes so paltry in its regardif thereby the wintry blasts of our rude sphere might come tempered to such a man
not to speak it harshly or scornfully it seemed cliffords nature to be a sybarite
it was perceptible even there in the dark old parlor in the inevitable polarity with which his eyes were attracted towards the quivering play of sunbeams through the shadowy foliage
it was seen in his appreciating notice of the vase of flowers the scent of which he inhaled with a zest almost peculiar to a physical organization so refined that spiritual ingredients are moulded in with it
it was betrayed in the unconscious smile with which he regarded phbe whose fresh and maidenly figure was both sunshine and flowerstheir essence in a prettier and more agreeable mode of manifestation
not less evident was this love and necessity for the beautiful in the instinctive caution with which even so soon his eyes turned away from his hostess and wandered to any quarter rather than come back
it was hepzibahs misfortunenot cliffords fault
how could heso yellow as she was so wrinkled so sad of mien with that odd uncouthness of a turban on her head and that most perverse of scowls contorting her browhow could he love to gaze at her
but did he owe her no affection for so much as she had silently given
he owed her nothing
a nature like cliffords can contract no debts of that kind
it iswe say it without censure nor in diminution of the claim which it indefeasibly possesses on beings of another mouldit is always selfish in its essence and we must give it leave to be so and heap up our heroic and disinterested love upon it so much the more without a recompense
poor hepzibah knew this truth or at least acted on the instinct of it
so long estranged from what was lovely as clifford had been she rejoicedrejoiced though with a present sigh and a secret purpose to shed tears in her own chamber that he had brighter objects now before his eyes than her aged and uncomely features
they never possessed a charm and if they had the canker of her grief for him would long since have destroyed it
the guest leaned back in his chair
mingled in his countenance with a dreamy delight there was a troubled look of effort and unrest
he was seeking to make himself more fully sensible of the scene around him or perhaps dreading it to be a dream or a play of imagination was vexing the fair moment with a struggle for some added brilliancy and more durable illusion
how pleasanthow delightful he murmured but not as if addressing any one
will it last
how balmy the atmosphere through that open window
an open window
how beautiful that play of sunshine
those flowers how very fragrant
that young girls face how cheerful how bloominga flower with the dew on it and sunbeams in the dewdrops
ah
this must be all a dream
a dream
a dream
but it has quite hidden the four stone walls  then his face darkened as if the shadow of a cavern or a dungeon had come over it there was no more light in its expression than might have come through the iron grates of a prisonwindowstill lessening too as if he were sinking farther into the depths
phbe being of that quickness and activity of temperament that she seldom long refrained from taking a part and generally a good one in what was going forward now felt herself moved to address the stranger
here is a new kind of rose which i found this morning in the garden said she choosing a small crimson one from among the flowers in the vase
there will be but five or six on the bush this season
this is the most perfect of them all not a speck of blight or mildew in it
and how sweet it issweet like no other rose
one can never forget that scent  ahlet me seelet me hold it cried the guest eagerly seizing the flower which by the spell peculiar to remembered odors brought innumerable associations along with the fragrance that it exhaled
thank you
this has done me good
i remember how i used to prize this flowerlong ago i suppose very long agoor was it only yesterday
it makes me feel young again
am i young
either this remembrance is singularly distinct or this consciousness strangely dim
but how kind of the fair young girl
thank you
thank you  the favorable excitement derived from this little crimson rose afforded clifford the brightest moment which he enjoyed at the breakfasttable
it might have lasted longer but that his eyes happened soon afterwards to rest on the face of the old puritan who out of his dingy frame and lustreless canvas was looking down on the scene like a ghost and a most illtempered and ungenial one
the guest made an impatient gesture of the hand and addressed hepzibah with what might easily be recognized as the licensed irritability of a petted member of the family
hepzibahhepzibah cried he with no little force and distinctness why do you keep that odious picture on the wall
yes yesthat is precisely your taste
i have told you a thousand times that it was the evil genius of the housemy evil genius particularly
take it down at once  dear clifford said hepzibah sadly you know it cannot be  then at all events continued he still speaking with some energy pray cover it with a crimson curtain broad enough to hang in folds and with a golden border and tassels
i cannot bear it
it must not stare me in the face  yes dear clifford the picture shall be covered said hepzibah soothingly
there is a crimson curtain in a trunk above stairsa little faded and motheaten im afraidbut phbe and i will do wonders with it  this very day remember said he and then added in a low selfcommuning voice why should we live in this dismal house at all
why not go to the south of franceto italyparis naples venice rome
hepzibah will say we have not the means
a droll idea that  he smiled to himself and threw a glance of fine sarcastic meaning towards hepzibah
but the several moods of feeling faintly as they were marked through which he had passed occurring in so brief an interval of time had evidently wearied the stranger
he was probably accustomed to a sad monotony of life not so much flowing in a stream however sluggish as stagnating in a pool around his feet
a slumberous veil diffused itself over his countenance and had an effect morally speaking on its naturally delicate and elegant outline like that which a brooding mist with no sunshine in it throws over the features of a landscape
he appeared to become grosseralmost cloddish
if aught of interest or beautyeven ruined beautyhad heretofore been visible in this man the beholder might now begin to doubt it and to accuse his own imagination of deluding him with whatever grace had flickered over that visage and whatever exquisite lustre had gleamed in those filmy eyes
before he had quite sunken away however the sharp and peevish tinkle of the shopbell made itself audible
striking most disagreeably on cliffords auditory organs and the characteristic sensibility of his nerves it caused him to start upright out of his chair
good heavens hepzibah
what horrible disturbance have we now in the house cried he wreaking his resentful impatienceas a matter of course and a custom of oldon the one person in the world that loved him
i have never heard such a hateful clamor
why do you permit it
in the name of all dissonance what can it be  it was very remarkable into what prominent reliefeven as if a dim picture should leap suddenly from its canvascliffords character was thrown by this apparently trifling annoyance
the secret was that an individual of his temper can always be pricked more acutely through his sense of the beautiful and harmonious than through his heart
it is even possiblefor similar cases have often happenedthat if clifford in his foregoing life had enjoyed the means of cultivating his taste to its utmost perfectibility that subtile attribute might before this period have completely eaten out or filed away his affections
shall we venture to pronounce therefore that his long and black calamity may not have had a redeeming drop of mercy at the bottom
dear clifford i wish i could keep the sound from your ears said hepzibah patiently but reddening with a painful suffusion of shame
it is very disagreeable even to me
but do you know clifford i have something to tell you
this ugly noisepray run phbe and see who is therethis naughty little tinkle is nothing but our shopbell  shopbell repeated clifford with a bewildered stare
yes our shopbell said hepzibah a certain natural dignity mingled with deep emotion now asserting itself in her manner
for you must know dearest clifford that we are very poor
and there was no other resource but either to accept assistance from a hand that i would push aside and so would you
were it to offer bread when we were dying for itno help save from him or else to earn our subsistence with my own hands
alone i might have been content to starve
but you were to be given back to me
do you think then dear clifford added she with a wretched smile that i have brought an irretrievable disgrace on the old house by opening a little shop in the front gable
our greatgreatgrandfather did the same when there was far less need
are you ashamed of me  shame
disgrace
do you speak these words to me hepzibah said cliffordnot angrily however for when a mans spirit has been thoroughly crushed he may be peevish at small offences but never resentful of great ones
so he spoke with only a grieved emotion
it was not kind to say so hepzibah
what shame can befall me now  and then the unnerved manhe that had been born for enjoyment but had met a doom so very wretchedburst into a womans passion of tears
it was but of brief continuance however soon leaving him in a quiescent and to judge by his countenance not an uncomfortable state
from this mood too he partially rallied for an instant and looked at hepzibah with a smile the keen halfderisory purport of which was a puzzle to her
are we so very poor hepzibah said he
finally his chair being deep and softly cushioned clifford fell asleep
hearing the more regular rise and fall of his breath which however even then instead of being strong and full had a feeble kind of tremor corresponding with the lack of vigor in his characterhearing these tokens of settled slumber hepzibah seized the opportunity to peruse his face more attentively than she had yet dared to do
her heart melted away in tears her profoundest spirit sent forth a moaning voice low gentle but inexpressibly sad
in this depth of grief and pity she felt that there was no irreverence in gazing at his altered aged faded ruined face
but no sooner was she a little relieved than her conscience smote her for gazing curiously at him now that he was so changed and turning hastily away hepzibah let down the curtain over the sunny window and left clifford to slumber there
viii
the pyncheon of today   phbe on entering the shop beheld there the already familiar face of the little devourerif we can reckon his mighty deeds arightof jim crow the elephant the camel the dromedaries and the locomotive
having expended his private fortune on the two preceding days in the purchase of the above unheardof luxuries the young gentlemans present errand was on the part of his mother in quest of three eggs and half a pound of raisins
these articles phbe accordingly supplied and as a mark of gratitude for his previous patronage and a slight superadded morsel after breakfast put likewise into his hand a whale
the great fish reversing his experience with the prophet of nineveh immediately began his progress down the same red pathway of fate whither so varied a caravan had preceded him
this remarkable urchin in truth was the very emblem of old father time both in respect of his alldevouring appetite for men and things and because he as well as time after ingulfing thus much of creation looked almost as youthful as if he had been just that moment made
after partly closing the door the child turned back and mumbled something to phbe which as the whale was but half disposed of she could not perfectly understand
what did you say my little fellow asked she
mother wants to know repeated ned higgins more distinctly how old maid pyncheons brother does
folks say he has got home  my cousin hepzibahs brother exclaimed phbe surprised at this sudden explanation of the relationship between hepzibah and her guest
her brother
and where can he have been  the little boy only put his thumb to his broad snubnose with that look of shrewdness which a child spending much of his time in the street so soon learns to throw over his features however unintelligent in themselves
then as phbe continued to gaze at him without answering his mothers message he took his departure
as the child went down the steps a gentleman ascended them and made his entrance into the shop
it was the portly and had it possessed the advantage of a little more height would have been the stately figure of a man considerably in the decline of life dressed in a black suit of some thin stuff resembling broadcloth as closely as possible
a goldheaded cane of rare oriental wood added materially to the high respectability of his aspect as did also a neckcloth of the utmost snowy purity and the conscientious polish of his boots
his dark square countenance with its almost shaggy depth of eyebrows was naturally impressive and would perhaps have been rather stern had not the gentleman considerately taken upon himself to mitigate the harsh effect by a look of exceeding goodhumor and benevolence
owing however to a somewhat massive accumulation of animal substance about the lower region of his face the look was perhaps unctuous rather than spiritual and had so to speak a kind of fleshly effulgence not altogether so satisfactory as he doubtless intended it to be
a susceptible observer at any rate might have regarded it as affording very little evidence of the general benignity of soul whereof it purported to be the outward reflection
and if the observer chanced to be illnatured as well as acute and susceptible he would probably suspect that the smile on the gentlemans face was a good deal akin to the shine on his boots and that each must have cost him and his bootblack respectively a good deal of hard labor to bring out and preserve them
as the stranger entered the little shop where the projection of the second story and the thick foliage of the elmtree as well as the commodities at the window created a sort of gray medium his smile grew as intense as if he had set his heart on counteracting the whole gloom of the atmosphere besides any moral gloom pertaining to hepzibah and her inmates by the unassisted light of his countenance
on perceiving a young rosebud of a girl instead of the gaunt presence of the old maid a look of surprise was manifest
he at first knit his brows then smiled with more unctuous benignity than ever
ah i see how it is said he in a deep voicea voice which had it come from the throat of an uncultivated man would have been gruff but by dint of careful training was now sufficiently agreeablei was not aware that miss hepzibah pyncheon had commenced business under such favorable auspices
you are her assistant i suppose  i certainly am answered phbe and added with a little air of ladylike assumption for civil as the gentleman was he evidently took her to be a young person serving for wages i am a cousin of miss hepzibah on a visit to her  her cousinand from the country
pray pardon me then said the gentleman bowing and smiling as phbe never had been bowed to nor smiled on before in that case we must be better acquainted for unless i am sadly mistaken you are my own little kinswoman likewise
let me seemarydollyphbeyes phbe is the name
is it possible that you are phbe pyncheon only child of my dear cousin and classmate arthur
ah i see your father now about your mouth
yes yes
we must be better acquainted
i am your kinsman my dear
surely you must have heard of judge pyncheon  as phbe curtsied in reply the judge bent forward with the pardonable and even praiseworthy purposeconsidering the nearness of blood and the difference of ageof bestowing on his young relative a kiss of acknowledged kindred and natural affection
unfortunately without design or only with such instinctive design as gives no account of itself to the intellect phbe just at the critical moment drew back so that her highly respectable kinsman with his body bent over the counter and his lips protruded was betrayed into the rather absurd predicament of kissing the empty air
it was a modern parallel to the case of ixion embracing a cloud and was so much the more ridiculous as the judge prided himself on eschewing all airy matter and never mistaking a shadow for a substance
the truth wasand it is phbes only excusethat although judge pyncheons glowing benignity might not be absolutely unpleasant to the feminine beholder with the width of a street or even an ordinarysized room interposed between yet it became quite too intense when this dark fullfed physiognomy so roughly bearded too that no razor could ever make it smooth sought to bring itself into actual contact with the object of its regards
the man the sex somehow or other was entirely too prominent in the judges demonstrations of that sort
phbes eyes sank and without knowing why she felt herself blushing deeply under his look
yet she had been kissed before and without any particular squeamishness by perhaps half a dozen different cousins younger as well as older than this darkbrowned grislybearded whiteneckclothed and unctuouslybenevolent judge
then why not by him
on raising her eyes phbe was startled by the change in judge pyncheons face
it was quite as striking allowing for the difference of scale as that betwixt a landscape under a broad sunshine and just before a thunderstorm not that it had the passionate intensity of the latter aspect but was cold hard immitigable like a daylong brooding cloud
dear me
what is to be done now thought the countrygirl to herself
he looks as if there were nothing softer in him than a rock nor milder than the east wind
i meant no harm
since he is really my cousin i would have let him kiss me if i could  then all at once it struck phbe that this very judge pyncheon was the original of the miniature which the daguerreotypist had shown her in the garden and that the hard stern relentless look now on his face was the same that the sun had so inflexibly persisted in bringing out
was it therefore no momentary mood but however skilfully concealed the settled temper of his life
and not merely so but was it hereditary in him and transmitted down as a precious heirloom from that bearded ancestor in whose picture both the expression and to a singular degree the features of the modern judge were shown as by a kind of prophecy
a deeper philosopher than phbe might have found something very terrible in this idea
it implied that the weaknesses and defects the bad passions the mean tendencies and the moral diseases which lead to crime are handed down from one generation to another by a far surer process of transmission than human law has been able to establish in respect to the riches and honors which it seeks to entail upon posterity
but as it happened scarcely had phbes eyes rested again on the judges countenance than all its ugly sternness vanished and she found herself quite overpowered by the sultry dogday heat as it were of benevolence which this excellent man diffused out of his great heart into the surrounding atmospherevery much like a serpent which as a preliminary to fascination is said to fill the air with his peculiar odor
i like that cousin phbe cried he with an emphatic nod of approbation
i like it much my little cousin
you are a good child and know how to take care of yourself
a young girlespecially if she be a very pretty onecan never be too chary of her lips  indeed sir said phbe trying to laugh the matter off i did not mean to be unkind  nevertheless whether or no it were entirely owing to the inauspicious commencement of their acquaintance she still acted under a certain reserve which was by no means customary to her frank and genial nature
the fantasy would not quit her that the original puritan of whom she had heard so many sombre traditionsthe progenitor of the whole race of new england pyncheons the founder of the house of the seven gables and who had died so strangely in ithad now stept into the shop
in these days of offhand equipment the matter was easily enough arranged
on his arrival from the other world he had merely found it necessary to spend a quarter of an hour at a barbers who had trimmed down the puritans full beard into a pair of grizzled whiskers then patronizing a readymade clothing establishment he had exchanged his velvet doublet and sable cloak with the richly worked band under his chin for a white collar and cravat coat vest and pantaloons and lastly putting aside his steelhilted broadsword to take up a goldheaded cane the colonel pyncheon of two centuries ago steps forward as the judge of the passing moment
of course phbe was far too sensible a girl to entertain this idea in any other way than as matter for a smile
possibly also could the two personages have stood together before her eye many points of difference would have been perceptible and perhaps only a general resemblance
the long lapse of intervening years in a climate so unlike that which had fostered the ancestral englishman must inevitably have wrought important changes in the physical system of his descendant
the judges volume of muscle could hardly be the same as the colonels there was undoubtedly less beef in him
though looked upon as a weighty man among his contemporaries in respect of animal substance and as favored with a remarkable degree of fundamental development well adapting him for the judicial bench we conceive that the modern judge pyncheon if weighed in the same balance with his ancestor would have required at least an oldfashioned fiftysix to keep the scale in equilibrio
then the judges face had lost the ruddy english hue that showed its warmth through all the duskiness of the colonels weatherbeaten cheek and had taken a sallow shade the established complexion of his countrymen
if we mistake not moreover a certain quality of nervousness had become more or less manifest even in so solid a specimen of puritan descent as the gentleman now under discussion
as one of its effects it bestowed on his countenance a quicker mobility than the old englishmans had possessed and keener vivacity but at the expense of a sturdier something on which these acute endowments seemed to act like dissolving acids
this process for aught we know may belong to the great system of human progress which with every ascending footstep as it diminishes the necessity for animal force may be destined gradually to spiritualize us by refining away our grosser attributes of body
if so judge pyncheon could endure a century or two more of such refinement as well as most other men
the similarity intellectual and moral between the judge and his ancestor appears to have been at least as strong as the resemblance of mien and feature would afford reason to anticipate
in old colonel pyncheons funeral discourse the clergyman absolutely canonized his deceased parishioner and opening as it were a vista through the roof of the church and thence through the firmament above showed him seated harp in hand among the crowned choristers of the spiritual world
on his tombstone too the record is highly eulogistic nor does history so far as he holds a place upon its page assail the consistency and uprightness of his character
so also as regards the judge pyncheon of today neither clergyman nor legal critic nor inscriber of tombstones nor historian of general or local politics would venture a word against this eminent persons sincerity as a christian or respectability as a man or integrity as a judge or courage and faithfulness as the oftentried representative of his political party
but besides these cold formal and empty words of the chisel that inscribes the voice that speaks and the pen that writes for the public eye and for distant timeand which inevitably lose much of their truth and freedom by the fatal consciousness of so doingthere were traditions about the ancestor and private diurnal gossip about the judge remarkably accordant in their testimony
it is often instructive to take the womans the private and domestic view of a public man nor can anything be more curious than the vast discrepancy between portraits intended for engraving and the pencilsketches that pass from hand to hand behind the originals back
for example tradition affirmed that the puritan had been greedy of wealth the judge too with all the show of liberal expenditure was said to be as closefisted as if his gripe were of iron
the ancestor had clothed himself in a grim assumption of kindliness a rough heartiness of word and manner which most people took to be the genuine warmth of nature making its way through the thick and inflexible hide of a manly character
his descendant in compliance with the requirements of a nicer age had etherealized this rude benevolence into that broad benignity of smile wherewith he shone like a noonday sun along the streets or glowed like a household fire in the drawingrooms of his private acquaintance
the puritanif not belied by some singular stories murmured even at this day under the narrators breathhad fallen into certain transgressions to which men of his great animal development whatever their faith or principles must continue liable until they put off impurity along with the gross earthly substance that involves it
we must not stain our page with any contemporary scandal to a similar purport that may have been whispered against the judge
the puritan again an autocrat in his own household had worn out three wives and merely by the remorseless weight and hardness of his character in the conjugal relation had sent them one after another brokenhearted to their graves
here the parallel in some sort fails
the judge had wedded but a single wife and lost her in the third or fourth year of their marriage
there was a fable howeverfor such we choose to consider it though not impossibly typical of judge pyncheons marital deportmentthat the lady got her deathblow in the honeymoon and never smiled again because her husband compelled her to serve him with coffee every morning at his bedside in token of fealty to her liegelord and master
but it is too fruitful a subject this of hereditary resemblancesthe frequent recurrence of which in a direct line is truly unaccountable when we consider how large an accumulation of ancestry lies behind every man at the distance of one or two centuries
we shall only add therefore that the puritanso at least says chimneycorner tradition which often preserves traits of character with marvellous fidelitywas bold imperious relentless crafty laying his purposes deep and following them out with an inveteracy of pursuit that knew neither rest nor conscience trampling on the weak and when essential to his ends doing his utmost to beat down the strong
whether the judge in any degree resembled him the further progress of our narrative may show
scarcely any of the items in the abovedrawn parallel occurred to phbe whose country birth and residence in truth had left her pitifully ignorant of most of the family traditions which lingered like cobwebs and incrustations of smoke about the rooms and chimneycorners of the house of the seven gables
yet there was a circumstance very trifling in itself which impressed her with an odd degree of horror
she had heard of the anathema flung by maule the executed wizard against colonel pyncheon and his posteritythat god would give them blood to drinkand likewise of the popular notion that this miraculous blood might now and then be heard gurgling in their throats
the latter scandalas became a person of sense and more especially a member of the pyncheon familyphbe had set down for the absurdity which it unquestionably was
but ancient superstitions after being steeped in human hearts and embodied in human breath and passing from lip to ear in manifold repetition through a series of generations become imbued with an effect of homely truth
the smoke of the domestic hearth has scented them through and through
by long transmission among household facts they grow to look like them and have such a familiar way of making themselves at home that their influence is usually greater than we suspect
thus it happened that when phbe heard a certain noise in judge pyncheons throatrather habitual with him not altogether voluntary yet indicative of nothing unless it were a slight bronchial complaint or as some people hinted an apoplectic symptomwhen the girl heard this queer and awkward ingurgitation which the writer never did hear and therefore cannot describe she very foolishly started and clasped her hands
of course it was exceedingly ridiculous in phbe to be discomposed by such a trifle and still more unpardonable to show her discomposure to the individual most concerned in it
but the incident chimed in so oddly with her previous fancies about the colonel and the judge that for the moment it seemed quite to mingle their identity
what is the matter with you young woman said judge pyncheon giving her one of his harsh looks
are you afraid of anything  oh nothing sirnothing in the world answered phbe with a little laugh of vexation at herself
but perhaps you wish to speak with my cousin hepzibah
shall i call her  stay a moment if you please said the judge again beaming sunshine out of his face
you seem to be a little nervous this morning
the town air cousin phbe does not agree with your good wholesome country habits
or has anything happened to disturb youanything remarkable in cousin hepzibahs family an arrival eh
i thought so
no wonder you are out of sorts my little cousin
to be an inmate with such a guest may well startle an innocent young girl  you quite puzzle me sir replied phbe gazing inquiringly at the judge
there is no frightful guest in the house but only a poor gentle childlike man whom i believe to be cousin hepzibahs brother
i am afraid but you sir will know better than i that he is not quite in his sound senses but so mild and quiet he seems to be that a mother might trust her baby with him and i think he would play with the baby as if he were only a few years older than itself
he startle meoh no indeed  i rejoice to hear so favorable and so ingenuous an account of my cousin clifford said the benevolent judge
many years ago when we were boys and young men together i had a great affection for him and still feel a tender interest in all his concerns
you say cousin phbe he appears to be weak minded
heaven grant him at least enough of intellect to repent of his past sins  nobody i fancy observed phbe can have fewer to repent of  and is it possible my dear rejoined the judge with a commiserating look that you have never heard of clifford pyncheonthat you know nothing of his history
well it is all right and your mother has shown a very proper regard for the good name of the family with which she connected herself
believe the best you can of this unfortunate person and hope the best
it is a rule which christians should always follow in their judgments of one another and especially is it right and wise among near relatives whose characters have necessarily a degree of mutual dependence
but is clifford in the parlor
i will just step in and see  perhaps sir i had better call my cousin hepzibah said phbe hardly knowing however whether she ought to obstruct the entrance of so affectionate a kinsman into the private regions of the house
her brother seemed to be just falling asleep after breakfast and i am sure she would not like him to be disturbed
pray sir let me give her notice  but the judge showed a singular determination to enter unannounced and as phbe with the vivacity of a person whose movements unconsciously answer to her thoughts had stepped towards the door he used little or no ceremony in putting her aside
no no miss phbe said judge pyncheon in a voice as deep as a thundergrowl and with a frown as black as the cloud whence it issues
stay you here
i know the house and know my cousin hepzibah and know her brother clifford likewisenor need my little country cousin put herself to the trouble of announcing mein these latter words by the bye there were symptoms of a change from his sudden harshness into his previous benignity of manner
i am at home here phbe you must recollect and you are the stranger
i will just step in therefore and see for myself how clifford is and assure him and hepzibah of my kindly feelings and best wishes
it is right at this juncture that they should both hear from my own lips how much i desire to serve them
ha
here is hepzibah herself  such was the case
the vibrations of the judges voice had reached the old gentlewoman in the parlor where she sat with face averted waiting on her brothers slumber
she now issued forth as would appear to defend the entrance looking we must needs say amazingly like the dragon which in fairy tales is wont to be the guardian over an enchanted beauty
the habitual scowl of her brow was undeniably too fierce at this moment to pass itself off on the innocent score of nearsightedness and it was bent on judge pyncheon in a way that seemed to confound if not alarm him so inadequately had he estimated the moral force of a deeply grounded antipathy
she made a repelling gesture with her hand and stood a perfect picture of prohibition at full length in the dark frame of the doorway
but we must betray hepzibahs secret and confess that the native timorousness of her character even now developed itself in a quick tremor which to her own perception set each of her joints at variance with its fellows
possibly the judge was aware how little true hardihood lay behind hepzibahs formidable front
at any rate being a gentleman of steady nerves he soon recovered himself and failed not to approach his cousin with outstretched hand adopting the sensible precaution however to cover his advance with a smile so broad and sultry that had it been only half as warm as it looked a trellis of grapes might at once have turned purple under its summerlike exposure
it may have been his purpose indeed to melt poor hepzibah on the spot as if she were a figure of yellow wax
hepzibah my beloved cousin i am rejoiced exclaimed the judge most emphatically
now at length you have something to live for
yes and all of us let me say your friends and kindred have more to live for than we had yesterday
i have lost no time in hastening to offer any assistance in my power towards making clifford comfortable
he belongs to us all
i know how much he requireshow much he used to requirewith his delicate taste and his love of the beautiful
anything in my housepictures books wine luxuries of the tablehe may command them all
it would afford me most heartfelt gratification to see him
shall i step in this moment  no replied hepzibah her voice quivering too painfully to allow of many words
he cannot see visitors  a visitor my dear cousindo you call me so cried the judge whose sensibility it seems was hurt by the coldness of the phrase
nay then let me be cliffords host and your own likewise
come at once to my house
the country air and all the conveniencesi may say luxuriesthat i have gathered about me will do wonders for him
and you and i dear hepzibah will consult together and watch together and labor together to make our dear clifford happy
come
why should we make more words about what is both a duty and a pleasure on my part
come to me at once  on hearing these so hospitable offers and such generous recognition of the claims of kindred phbe felt very much in the mood of running up to judge pyncheon and giving him of her own accord the kiss from which she had so recently shrunk away
it was quite otherwise with hepzibah the judges smile seemed to operate on her acerbity of heart like sunshine upon vinegar making it ten times sourer than ever
clifford said shestill too agitated to utter more than an abrupt sentenceclifford has a home here  may heaven forgive you hepzibah said judge pyncheonreverently lifting his eyes towards that high court of equity to which he appealedif you suffer any ancient prejudice or animosity to weigh with you in this matter
i stand here with an open heart willing and anxious to receive yourself and clifford into it
do not refuse my good officesmy earnest propositions for your welfare
they are such in all respects as it behooves your nearest kinsman to make
it will be a heavy responsibility cousin if you confine your brother to this dismal house and stifled air when the delightful freedom of my countryseat is at his command  it would never suit clifford said hepzibah as briefly as before
woman broke forth the judge giving way to his resentment what is the meaning of all this
have you other resources
nay i suspected as much
take care hepzibah take care
clifford is on the brink of as black a ruin as ever befell him yet
but why do i talk with you woman as you are
make wayi must see clifford  hepzibah spread out her gaunt figure across the door and seemed really to increase in bulk looking the more terrible also because there was so much terror and agitation in her heart
but judge pyncheons evident purpose of forcing a passage was interrupted by a voice from the inner room a weak tremulous wailing voice indicating helpless alarm with no more energy for selfdefence than belongs to a frightened infant
hepzibah hepzibah cried the voice go down on your knees to him
kiss his feet
entreat him not to come in
oh let him have mercy on me
mercy
mercy  for the instant it appeared doubtful whether it were not the judges resolute purpose to set hepzibah aside and step across the threshold into the parlor whence issued that broken and miserable murmur of entreaty
it was not pity that restrained him for at the first sound of the enfeebled voice a red fire kindled in his eyes and he made a quick pace forward with something inexpressibly fierce and grim darkening forth as it were out of the whole man
to know judge pyncheon was to see him at that moment
after such a revelation let him smile with what sultriness he would he could much sooner turn grapes purple or pumpkins yellow than melt the ironbranded impression out of the beholders memory
and it rendered his aspect not the less but more frightful that it seemed not to express wrath or hatred but a certain hot fellness of purpose which annihilated everything but itself
yet after all are we not slandering an excellent and amiable man
look at the judge now
he is apparently conscious of having erred in too energetically pressing his deeds of lovingkindness on persons unable to appreciate them
he will await their better mood and hold himself as ready to assist them then as at this moment
as he draws back from the door an allcomprehensive benignity blazes from his visage indicating that he gathers hepzibah little phbe and the invisible clifford all three together with the whole world besides into his immense heart and gives them a warm bath in its flood of affection
you do me great wrong dear cousin hepzibah said he first kindly offering her his hand and then drawing on his glove preparatory to departure
very great wrong
but i forgive it and will study to make you think better of me
of course our poor clifford being in so unhappy a state of mind i cannot think of urging an interview at present
but i shall watch over his welfare as if he were my own beloved brother nor do i at all despair my dear cousin of constraining both him and you to acknowledge your injustice
when that shall happen i desire no other revenge than your acceptance of the best offices in my power to do you  with a bow to hepzibah and a degree of paternal benevolence in his parting nod to phbe the judge left the shop and went smiling along the street
as is customary with the rich when they aim at the honors of a republic he apologized as it were to the people for his wealth prosperity and elevated station by a free and hearty manner towards those who knew him putting off the more of his dignity in due proportion with the humbleness of the man whom he saluted and thereby proving a haughty consciousness of his advantages as irrefragably as if he had marched forth preceded by a troop of lackeys to clear the way
on this particular forenoon so excessive was the warmth of judge pyncheons kindly aspect that such at least was the rumor about town an extra passage of the watercarts was found essential in order to lay the dust occasioned by so much extra sunshine
no sooner had he disappeared than hepzibah grew deadly white and staggering towards phbe let her head fall on the young girls shoulder
o phbe murmured she that man has been the horror of my life
shall i never never have the couragewill my voice never cease from trembling long enough to let me tell him what he is  is he so very wicked asked phbe
yet his offers were surely kind  do not speak of themhe has a heart of iron rejoined hepzibah
go now and talk to clifford
amuse and keep him quiet
it would disturb him wretchedly to see me so agitated as i am
there go dear child and i will try to look after the shop  phbe went accordingly but perplexed herself meanwhile with queries as to the purport of the scene which she had just witnessed and also whether judges clergymen and other characters of that eminent stamp and respectability could really in any single instance be otherwise than just and upright men
a doubt of this nature has a most disturbing influence and if shown to be a fact comes with fearful and startling effect on minds of the trim orderly and limitloving class in which we find our little countrygirl
dispositions more boldly speculative may derive a stern enjoyment from the discovery since there must be evil in the world that a high man is as likely to grasp his share of it as a low one
a wider scope of view and a deeper insight may see rank dignity and station all proved illusory so far as regards their claim to human reverence and yet not feel as if the universe were thereby tumbled headlong into chaos
but phbe in order to keep the universe in its old place was fain to smother in some degree her own intuitions as to judge pyncheons character
and as for her cousins testimony in disparagement of it she concluded that hepzibahs judgment was embittered by one of those family feuds which render hatred the more deadly by the dead and corrupted love that they intermingle with its native poison
ix
clifford and phbe   truly was there something high generous and noble in the native composition of our poor old hepzibah
or elseand it was quite as probably the caseshe had been enriched by poverty developed by sorrow elevated by the strong and solitary affection of her life and thus endowed with heroism which never could have characterized her in what are called happier circumstances
through dreary years hepzibah had looked forwardfor the most part despairingly never with any confidence of hope but always with the feeling that it was her brightest possibilityto the very position in which she now found herself
in her own behalf she had asked nothing of providence but the opportunity of devoting herself to this brother whom she had so lovedso admired for what he was or might have beenand to whom she had kept her faith alone of all the world wholly unfalteringly at every instant and throughout life
and here in his late decline the lost one had come back out of his long and strange misfortune and was thrown on her sympathy as it seemed not merely for the bread of his physical existence but for everything that should keep him morally alive
she had responded to the call
she had come forwardour poor gaunt hepzibah in her rusty silks with her rigid joints and the sad perversity of her scowlready to do her utmost and with affection enough if that were all to do a hundred times as much
there could be few more tearful sightsand heaven forgive us if a smile insist on mingling with our conception of itfew sights with truer pathos in them than hepzibah presented on that first afternoon
how patiently did she endeavor to wrap clifford up in her great warm love and make it all the world to him so that he should retain no torturing sense of the coldness and dreariness without
her little efforts to amuse him
how pitiful yet magnanimous they were
remembering his early love of poetry and fiction she unlocked a bookcase and took down several books that had been excellent reading in their day
there was a volume of pope with the rape of the lock in it and another of the tatler and an odd one of drydens miscellanies all with tarnished gilding on their covers and thoughts of tarnished brilliancy inside
they had no success with clifford
these and all such writers of society whose new works glow like the rich texture of a justwoven carpet must be content to relinquish their charm for every reader after an age or two and could hardly be supposed to retain any portion of it for a mind that had utterly lost its estimate of modes and manners
hepzibah then took up rasselas and began to read of the happy valley with a vague idea that some secret of a contented life had there been elaborated which might at least serve clifford and herself for this one day
but the happy valley had a cloud over it
hepzibah troubled her auditor moreover by innumerable sins of emphasis which he seemed to detect without any reference to the meaning nor in fact did he appear to take much note of the sense of what she read but evidently felt the tedium of the lecture without harvesting its profit
his sisters voice too naturally harsh had in the course of her sorrowful lifetime contracted a kind of croak which when it once gets into the human throat is as ineradicable as sin
in both sexes occasionally this lifelong croak accompanying each word of joy or sorrow is one of the symptoms of a settled melancholy and wherever it occurs the whole history of misfortune is conveyed in its slightest accent
the effect is as if the voice had been dyed black orif we must use a more moderate similethis miserable croak running through all the variations of the voice is like a black silken thread on which the crystal beads of speech are strung and whence they take their hue
such voices have put on mourning for dead hopes and they ought to die and be buried along with them
discerning that clifford was not gladdened by her efforts hepzibah searched about the house for the means of more exhilarating pastime
at one time her eyes chanced to rest on alice pyncheons harpsichord
it was a moment of great peril fordespite the traditionary awe that had gathered over this instrument of music and the dirges which spiritual fingers were said to play on itthe devoted sister had solemn thoughts of thrumming on its chords for cliffords benefit and accompanying the performance with her voice
poor clifford
poor hepzibah
poor harpsichord
all three would have been miserable together
by some good agencypossibly by the unrecognized interposition of the longburied alice herselfthe threatening calamity was averted
but the worst of allthe hardest stroke of fate for hepzibah to endure and perhaps for clifford too was his invincible distaste for her appearance
her features never the most agreeable and now harsh with age and grief and resentment against the world for his sake her dress and especially her turban the queer and quaint manners which had unconsciously grown upon her in solitudesuch being the poor gentlewomans outward characteristics it is no great marvel although the mournfullest of pities that the instinctive lover of the beautiful was fain to turn away his eyes
there was no help for it
it would be the latest impulse to die within him
in his last extremity the expiring breath stealing faintly through cliffords lips he would doubtless press hepzibahs hand in fervent recognition of all her lavished love and close his eyesbut not so much to die as to be constrained to look no longer on her face
poor hepzibah
she took counsel with herself what might be done and thought of putting ribbons on her turban but by the instant rush of several guardian angels was withheld from an experiment that could hardly have proved less than fatal to the beloved object of her anxiety
to be brief besides hepzibahs disadvantages of person there was an uncouthness pervading all her deeds a clumsy something that could but ill adapt itself for use and not at all for ornament
she was a grief to clifford and she knew it
in this extremity the antiquated virgin turned to phbe
no grovelling jealousy was in her heart
had it pleased heaven to crown the heroic fidelity of her life by making her personally the medium of cliffords happiness it would have rewarded her for all the past by a joy with no bright tints indeed but deep and true and worth a thousand gayer ecstasies
this could not be
she therefore turned to phbe and resigned the task into the young girls hands
the latter took it up cheerfully as she did everything but with no sense of a mission to perform and succeeding all the better for that same simplicity
by the involuntary effect of a genial temperament phbe soon grew to be absolutely essential to the daily comfort if not the daily life of her two forlorn companions
the grime and sordidness of the house of the seven gables seemed to have vanished since her appearance there the gnawing tooth of the dryrot was stayed among the old timbers of its skeleton frame the dust had ceased to settle down so densely from the antique ceilings upon the floors and furniture of the rooms belowor at any rate there was a little housewife as lightfooted as the breeze that sweeps a garden walk gliding hither and thither to brush it all away
the shadows of gloomy events that haunted the else lonely and desolate apartments the heavy breathless scent which death had left in more than one of the bedchambers ever since his visits of long agothese were less powerful than the purifying influence scattered throughout the atmosphere of the household by the presence of one youthful fresh and thoroughly wholesome heart
there was no morbidness in phbe if there had been the old pyncheon house was the very locality to ripen it into incurable disease
but now her spirit resembled in its potency a minute quantity of ottar of rose in one of hepzibahs huge ironbound trunks diffusing its fragrance through the various articles of linen and wroughtlace kerchiefs caps stockings folded dresses gloves and whatever else was treasured there
as every article in the great trunk was the sweeter for the rosescent so did all the thoughts and emotions of hepzibah and clifford sombre as they might seem acquire a subtle attribute of happiness from phbes intermixture with them
her activity of body intellect and heart impelled her continually to perform the ordinary little toils that offered themselves around her and to think the thought proper for the moment and to sympathizenow with the twittering gayety of the robins in the peartree and now to such a depth as she could with hepzibahs dark anxiety or the vague moan of her brother
this facile adaptation was at once the symptom of perfect health and its best preservative
a nature like phbes has invariably its due influence but is seldom regarded with due honor
its spiritual force however may be partially estimated by the fact of her having found a place for herself amid circumstances so stern as those which surrounded the mistress of the house and also by the effect which she produced on a character of so much more mass than her own
for the gaunt bony frame and limbs of hepzibah as compared with the tiny lightsomeness of phbes figure were perhaps in some fit proportion with the moral weight and substance respectively of the woman and the girl
to the guestto hepzibahs brotheror cousin clifford as phbe now began to call himshe was especially necessary
not that he could ever be said to converse with her or often manifest in any other very definite mode his sense of a charm in her society
but if she were a long while absent he became pettish and nervously restless pacing the room to and fro with the uncertainty that characterized all his movements or else would sit broodingly in his great chair resting his head on his hands and evincing life only by an electric sparkle of illhumor whenever hepzibah endeavored to arouse him
phbes presence and the contiguity of her fresh life to his blighted one was usually all that he required
indeed such was the native gush and play of her spirit that she was seldom perfectly quiet and undemonstrative any more than a fountain ever ceases to dimple and warble with its flow
she possessed the gift of song and that too so naturally that you would as little think of inquiring whence she had caught it or what master had taught her as of asking the same questions about a bird in whose small strain of music we recognize the voice of the creator as distinctly as in the loudest accents of his thunder
so long as phbe sang she might stray at her own will about the house
clifford was content whether the sweet airy homeliness of her tones came down from the upper chambers or along the passageway from the shop or was sprinkled through the foliage of the peartree inward from the garden with the twinkling sunbeams
he would sit quietly with a gentle pleasure gleaming over his face brighter now and now a little dimmer as the song happened to float near him or was more remotely heard
it pleased him best however when she sat on a low footstool at his knee
it is perhaps remarkable considering her temperament that phbe oftener chose a strain of pathos than of gayety
but the young and happy are not ill pleased to temper their life with a transparent shadow
the deepest pathos of phbes voice and song moreover came sifted through the golden texture of a cheery spirit and was somehow so interfused with the quality thence acquired that ones heart felt all the lighter for having wept at it
broad mirth in the sacred presence of dark misfortune would have jarred harshly and irreverently with the solemn symphony that rolled its undertone through hepzibahs and her brothers life
therefore it was well that phbe so often chose sad themes and not amiss that they ceased to be so sad while she was singing them
becoming habituated to her companionship clifford readily showed how capable of imbibing pleasant tints and gleams of cheerful light from all quarters his nature must originally have been
he grew youthful while she sat by him
a beautynot precisely real even in its utmost manifestation and which a painter would have watched long to seize and fix upon his canvas and after all in vainbeauty nevertheless that was not a mere dream would sometimes play upon and illuminate his face
it did more than to illuminate it transfigured him with an expression that could only be interpreted as the glow of an exquisite and happy spirit
that gray hair and those furrowswith their record of infinite sorrow so deeply written across his brow and so compressed as with a futile effort to crowd in all the tale that the whole inscription was made illegiblethese for the moment vanished
an eye at once tender and acute might have beheld in the man some shadow of what he was meant to be
anon as age came stealing like a sad twilight back over his figure you would have felt tempted to hold an argument with destiny and affirm that either this being should not have been made mortal or mortal existence should have been tempered to his qualities
there seemed no necessity for his having drawn breath at all the world never wanted him but as he had breathed it ought always to have been the balmiest of summer air
the same perplexity will invariably haunt us with regard to natures that tend to feed exclusively upon the beautiful let their earthly fate be as lenient as it may
phbe it is probable had but a very imperfect comprehension of the character over which she had thrown so beneficent a spell
nor was it necessary
the fire upon the hearth can gladden a whole semicircle of faces round about it but need not know the individuality of one among them all
indeed there was something too fine and delicate in cliffords traits to be perfectly appreciated by one whose sphere lay so much in the actual as phbes did
for clifford however the reality and simplicity and thorough homeliness of the girls nature were as powerful a charm as any that she possessed
beauty it is true and beauty almost perfect in its own style was indispensable
had phbe been coarse in feature shaped clumsily of a harsh voice and uncouthly mannered she might have been rich with all good gifts beneath this unfortunate exterior and still so long as she wore the guise of woman she would have shocked clifford and depressed him by her lack of beauty
but nothing more beautifulnothing prettier at leastwas ever made than phbe
and therefore to this manwhose whole poor and impalpable enjoyment of existence heretofore and until both his heart and fancy died within him had been a dreamwhose images of women had more and more lost their warmth and substance and been frozen like the pictures of secluded artists into the chillest idealityto him this little figure of the cheeriest household life was just what he required to bring him back into the breathing world
persons who have wandered or been expelled out of the common track of things even were it for a better system desire nothing so much as to be led back
they shiver in their loneliness be it on a mountaintop or in a dungeon
now phbes presence made a home about herthat very sphere which the outcast the prisoner the potentatethe wretch beneath mankind the wretch aside from it or the wretch above itinstinctively pines aftera home
she was real
holding her hand you felt something a tender something a substance and a warm one and so long as you should feel its grasp soft as it was you might be certain that your place was good in the whole sympathetic chain of human nature
the world was no longer a delusion
by looking a little further in this direction we might suggest an explanation of an oftensuggested mystery
why are poets so apt to choose their mates not for any similarity of poetic endowment but for qualities which might make the happiness of the rudest handicraftsman as well as that of the ideal craftsman of the spirit
because probably at his highest elevation the poet needs no human intercourse but he finds it dreary to descend and be a stranger
there was something very beautiful in the relation that grew up between this pair so closely and constantly linked together yet with such a waste of gloomy and mysterious years from his birthday to hers
on cliffords part it was the feeling of a man naturally endowed with the liveliest sensibility to feminine influence but who had never quaffed the cup of passionate love and knew that it was now too late
he knew it with the instinctive delicacy that had survived his intellectual decay
thus his sentiment for phbe without being paternal was not less chaste than if she had been his daughter
he was a man it is true and recognized her as a woman
she was his only representative of womankind
he took unfailing note of every charm that appertained to her sex and saw the ripeness of her lips and the virginal development of her bosom
all her little womanly ways budding out of her like blossoms on a young fruittree had their effect on him and sometimes caused his very heart to tingle with the keenest thrills of pleasure
at such momentsfor the effect was seldom more than momentarythe halftorpid man would be full of harmonious life just as a longsilent harp is full of sound when the musicians fingers sweep across it
but after all it seemed rather a perception or a sympathy than a sentiment belonging to himself as an individual
he read phbe as he would a sweet and simple story he listened to her as if she were a verse of household poetry which god in requital of his bleak and dismal lot had permitted some angel that most pitied him to warble through the house
she was not an actual fact for him but the interpretation of all that he lacked on earth brought warmly home to his conception so that this mere symbol or lifelike picture had almost the comfort of reality
but we strive in vain to put the idea into words
no adequate expression of the beauty and profound pathos with which it impresses us is attainable
this being made only for happiness and heretofore so miserably failing to be happyhis tendencies so hideously thwarted that some unknown time ago the delicate springs of his character never morally or intellectually strong had given way and he was now imbecilethis poor forlorn voyager from the islands of the blest in a frail bark on a tempestuous sea had been flung by the last mountainwave of his shipwreck into a quiet harbor
there as he lay more than half lifeless on the strand the fragrance of an earthly rosebud had come to his nostrils and as odors will had summoned up reminiscences or visions of all the living and breathing beauty amid which he should have had his home
with his native susceptibility of happy influences he inhales the slight ethereal rapture into his soul and expires
and how did phbe regard clifford
the girls was not one of those natures which are most attracted by what is strange and exceptional in human character
the path which would best have suited her was the wellworn track of ordinary life the companions in whom she would most have delighted were such as one encounters at every turn
the mystery which enveloped clifford so far as it affected her at all was an annoyance rather than the piquant charm which many women might have found in it
still her native kindliness was brought strongly into play not by what was darkly picturesque in his situation nor so much even by the finer graces of his character as by the simple appeal of a heart so forlorn as his to one so full of genuine sympathy as hers
she gave him an affectionate regard because he needed so much love and seemed to have received so little
with a ready tact the result of everactive and wholesome sensibility she discerned what was good for him and did it
whatever was morbid in his mind and experience she ignored and thereby kept their intercourse healthy by the incautious but as it were heavendirected freedom of her whole conduct
the sick in mind and perhaps in body are rendered more darkly and hopelessly so by the manifold reflection of their disease mirrored back from all quarters in the deportment of those about them they are compelled to inhale the poison of their own breath in infinite repetition
but phbe afforded her poor patient a supply of purer air
she impregnated it too not with a wildflower scentfor wildness was no trait of hersbut with the perfume of gardenroses pinks and other blossoms of much sweetness which nature and man have consented together in making grow from summer to summer and from century to century
such a flower was phbe in her relation with clifford and such the delight that he inhaled from her
yet it must be said her petals sometimes drooped a little in consequence of the heavy atmosphere about her
she grew more thoughtful than heretofore
looking aside at cliffords face and seeing the dim unsatisfactory elegance and the intellect almost quenched she would try to inquire what had been his life
was he always thus
had this veil been over him from his birththis veil under which far more of his spirit was hidden than revealed and through which he so imperfectly discerned the actual worldor was its gray texture woven of some dark calamity
phbe loved no riddles and would have been glad to escape the perplexity of this one
nevertheless there was so far a good result of her meditations on cliffords character that when her involuntary conjectures together with the tendency of every strange circumstance to tell its own story had gradually taught her the fact it had no terrible effect upon her
let the world have done him what vast wrong it might she knew cousin clifford too wellor fancied soever to shudder at the touch of his thin delicate fingers
within a few days after the appearance of this remarkable inmate the routine of life had established itself with a good deal of uniformity in the old house of our narrative
in the morning very shortly after breakfast it was cliffords custom to fall asleep in his chair nor unless accidentally disturbed would he emerge from a dense cloud of slumber or the thinner mists that flitted to and fro until well towards noonday
these hours of drowsihead were the season of the old gentlewomans attendance on her brother while phbe took charge of the shop an arrangement which the public speedily understood and evinced their decided preference of the younger shopwoman by the multiplicity of their calls during her administration of affairs
dinner over hepzibah took her knittingworka long stocking of gray yarn for her brothers winter wearand with a sigh and a scowl of affectionate farewell to clifford and a gesture enjoining watchfulness on phbe went to take her seat behind the counter
it was now the young girls turn to be the nursethe guardian the playmateor whatever is the fitter phraseof the grayhaired man
x
the pyncheon garden   clifford except for phbes more active instigation would ordinarily have yielded to the torpor which had crept through all his modes of being and which sluggishly counselled him to sit in his morning chair till eventide
but the girl seldom failed to propose a removal to the garden where uncle venner and the daguerreotypist had made such repairs on the roof of the ruinous arbor or summerhouse that it was now a sufficient shelter from sunshine and casual showers
the hopvine too had begun to grow luxuriantly over the sides of the little edifice and made an interior of verdant seclusion with innumerable peeps and glimpses into the wider solitude of the garden
here sometimes in this green playplace of flickering light phbe read to clifford
her acquaintance the artist who appeared to have a literary turn had supplied her with works of fiction in pamphlet formand a few volumes of poetry in altogether a different style and taste from those which hepzibah selected for his amusement
small thanks were due to the books however if the girls readings were in any degree more successful than her elderly cousins
phbes voice had always a pretty music in it and could either enliven clifford by its sparkle and gayety of tone or soothe him by a continued flow of pebbly and brooklike cadences
but the fictionsin which the countrygirl unused to works of that nature often became deeply absorbedinterested her strange auditor very little or not at all
pictures of life scenes of passion or sentiment wit humor and pathos were all thrown away or worse than thrown away on clifford either because he lacked an experience by which to test their truth or because his own griefs were a touchstone of reality that few feigned emotions could withstand
when phbe broke into a peal of merry laughter at what she read he would now and then laugh for sympathy but oftener respond with a troubled questioning look
if a teara maidens sunshiny tear over imaginary woedropped upon some melancholy page clifford either took it as a token of actual calamity or else grew peevish and angrily motioned her to close the volume
and wisely too
is not the world sad enough in genuine earnest without making a pastime of mock sorrows
with poetry it was rather better
he delighted in the swell and subsidence of the rhythm and the happily recurring rhyme
nor was clifford incapable of feeling the sentiment of poetrynot perhaps where it was highest or deepest but where it was most flitting and ethereal
it was impossible to foretell in what exquisite verse the awakening spell might lurk but on raising her eyes from the page to cliffords face phbe would be made aware by the light breaking through it that a more delicate intelligence than her own had caught a lambent flame from what she read
one glow of this kind however was often the precursor of gloom for many hours afterward because when the glow left him he seemed conscious of a missing sense and power and groped about for them as if a blind man should go seeking his lost eyesight
it pleased him more and was better for his inward welfare that phbe should talk and make passing occurrences vivid to his mind by her accompanying description and remarks
the life of the garden offered topics enough for such discourse as suited clifford best
he never failed to inquire what flowers had bloomed since yesterday
his feeling for flowers was very exquisite and seemed not so much a taste as an emotion he was fond of sitting with one in his hand intently observing it and looking from its petals into phbes face as if the garden flower were the sister of the household maiden
not merely was there a delight in the flowers perfume or pleasure in its beautiful form and the delicacy or brightness of its hue but cliffords enjoyment was accompanied with a perception of life character and individuality that made him love these blossoms of the garden as if they were endowed with sentiment and intelligence
this affection and sympathy for flowers is almost exclusively a womans trait
men if endowed with it by nature soon lose forget and learn to despise it in their contact with coarser things than flowers
clifford too had long forgotten it but found it again now as he slowly revived from the chill torpor of his life
it is wonderful how many pleasant incidents continually came to pass in that secluded gardenspot when once phbe had set herself to look for them
she had seen or heard a bee there on the first day of her acquaintance with the place
and oftenalmost continually indeedsince then the bees kept coming thither heaven knows why or by what pertinacious desire for farfetched sweets when no doubt there were broad cloverfields and all kinds of garden growth much nearer home than this
thither the bees came however and plunged into the squashblossoms as if there were no other squashvines within a long days flight or as if the soil of hepzibahs garden gave its productions just the very quality which these laborious little wizards wanted in order to impart the hymettus odor to their whole hive of new england honey
when clifford heard their sunny buzzing murmur in the heart of the great yellow blossoms he looked about him with a joyful sense of warmth and blue sky and green grass and of gods free air in the whole height from earth to heaven
after all there need be no question why the bees came to that one green nook in the dusty town
god sent them thither to gladden our poor clifford
they brought the rich summer with them in requital of a little honey
when the beanvines began to flower on the poles there was one particular variety which bore a vivid scarlet blossom
the daguerreotypist had found these beans in a garret over one of the seven gables treasured up in an old chest of drawers by some horticultural pyncheon of days gone by who doubtless meant to sow them the next summer but was himself first sown in deaths gardenground
by way of testing whether there were still a living germ in such ancient seeds holgrave had planted some of them and the result of his experiment was a splendid row of beanvines clambering early to the full height of the poles and arraying them from top to bottom in a spiral profusion of red blossoms
and ever since the unfolding of the first bud a multitude of hummingbirds had been attracted thither
at times it seemed as if for every one of the hundred blossoms there was one of these tiniest fowls of the aira thumbs bigness of burnished plumage hovering and vibrating about the beanpoles
it was with indescribable interest and even more than childish delight that clifford watched the hummingbirds
he used to thrust his head softly out of the arbor to see them the better all the while too motioning phbe to be quiet and snatching glimpses of the smile upon her face so as to heap his enjoyment up the higher with her sympathy
he had not merely grown younghe was a child again
hepzibah whenever she happened to witness one of these fits of miniature enthusiasm would shake her head with a strange mingling of the mother and sister and of pleasure and sadness in her aspect
she said that it had always been thus with clifford when the hummingbirds camealways from his babyhoodand that his delight in them had been one of the earliest tokens by which he showed his love for beautiful things
and it was a wonderful coincidence the good lady thought that the artist should have planted these scarletflowering beanswhich the hummingbirds sought far and wide and which had not grown in the pyncheon garden before for forty yearson the very summer of cliffords return
then would the tears stand in poor hepzibahs eyes or overflow them with a too abundant gush so that she was fain to betake herself into some corner lest clifford should espy her agitation
indeed all the enjoyments of this period were provocative of tears
coming so late as it did it was a kind of indian summer with a mist in its balmiest sunshine and decay and death in its gaudiest delight
the more clifford seemed to taste the happiness of a child the sadder was the difference to be recognized
with a mysterious and terrible past which had annihilated his memory and a blank future before him he had only this visionary and impalpable now which if you once look closely at it is nothing
he himself as was perceptible by many symptoms lay darkly behind his pleasure and knew it to be a babyplay which he was to toy and trifle with instead of thoroughly believing
clifford saw it may be in the mirror of his deeper consciousness that he was an example and representative of that great class of people whom an inexplicable providence is continually putting at crosspurposes with the world breaking what seems its own promise in their nature withholding their proper food and setting poison before them for a banquet and thuswhen it might so easily as one would think have been adjusted otherwisemaking their existence a strangeness a solitude and torment
all his life long he had been learning how to be wretched as one learns a foreign tongue and now with the lesson thoroughly by heart he could with difficulty comprehend his little airy happiness
frequently there was a dim shadow of doubt in his eyes
take my hand phbe he would say and pinch it hard with your little fingers
give me a rose that i may press its thorns and prove myself awake by the sharp touch of pain evidently he desired this prick of a trifling anguish in order to assure himself by that quality which he best knew to be real that the garden and the seven weatherbeaten gables and hepzibahs scowl and phbes smile were real likewise
without this signet in his flesh he could have attributed no more substance to them than to the empty confusion of imaginary scenes with which he had fed his spirit until even that poor sustenance was exhausted
the author needs great faith in his readers sympathy else he must hesitate to give details so minute and incidents apparently so trifling as are essential to make up the idea of this gardenlife
it was the eden of a thundersmitten adam who had fled for refuge thither out of the same dreary and perilous wilderness into which the original adam was expelled
one of the available means of amusement of which phbe made the most in cliffords behalf was that feathered society the hens a breed of whom as we have already said was an immemorial heirloom in the pyncheon family
in compliance with a whim of clifford as it troubled him to see them in confinement they had been set at liberty and now roamed at will about the garden doing some little mischief but hindered from escape by buildings on three sides and the difficult peaks of a wooden fence on the other
they spent much of their abundant leisure on the margin of maules well which was haunted by a kind of snail evidently a titbit to their palates and the brackish water itself however nauseous to the rest of the world was so greatly esteemed by these fowls that they might be seen tasting turning up their heads and smacking their bills with precisely the air of winebibbers round a probationary cask
their generally quiet yet often brisk and constantly diversified talk one to another or sometimes in soliloquyas they scratched worms out of the rich black soil or pecked at such plants as suited their tastehad such a domestic tone that it was almost a wonder why you could not establish a regular interchange of ideas about household matters human and gallinaceous
all hens are well worth studying for the piquancy and rich variety of their manners but by no possibility can there have been other fowls of such odd appearance and deportment as these ancestral ones
they probably embodied the traditionary peculiarities of their whole line of progenitors derived through an unbroken succession of eggs or else this individual chanticleer and his two wives had grown to be humorists and a little crackbrained withal on account of their solitary way of life and out of sympathy for hepzibah their ladypatroness
queer indeed they looked
chanticleer himself though stalking on two stiltlike legs with the dignity of interminable descent in all his gestures was hardly bigger than an ordinary partridge his two wives were about the size of quails and as for the one chicken it looked small enough to be still in the egg and at the same time sufficiently old withered wizened and experienced to have been founder of the antiquated race
instead of being the youngest of the family it rather seemed to have aggregated into itself the ages not only of these living specimens of the breed but of all its forefathers and foremothers whose united excellences and oddities were squeezed into its little body
its mother evidently regarded it as the one chicken of the world and as necessary in fact to the worlds continuance or at any rate to the equilibrium of the present system of affairs whether in church or state
no lesser sense of the infant fowls importance could have justified even in a mothers eyes the perseverance with which she watched over its safety ruffling her small person to twice its proper size and flying in everybodys face that so much as looked towards her hopeful progeny
no lower estimate could have vindicated the indefatigable zeal with which she scratched and her unscrupulousness in digging up the choicest flower or vegetable for the sake of the fat earthworm at its root
her nervous cluck when the chicken happened to be hidden in the long grass or under the squashleaves her gentle croak of satisfaction while sure of it beneath her wing her note of illconcealed fear and obstreperous defiance when she saw her archenemy a neighbors cat on the top of the high fenceone or other of these sounds was to be heard at almost every moment of the day
by degrees the observer came to feel nearly as much interest in this chicken of illustrious race as the motherhen did
phbe after getting well acquainted with the old hen was sometimes permitted to take the chicken in her hand which was quite capable of grasping its cubic inch or two of body
while she curiously examined its hereditary marksthe peculiar speckle of its plumage the funny tuft on its head and a knob on each of its legsthe little biped as she insisted kept giving her a sagacious wink
the daguerreotypist once whispered her that these marks betokened the oddities of the pyncheon family and that the chicken itself was a symbol of the life of the old house embodying its interpretation likewise although an unintelligible one as such clews generally are
it was a feathered riddle a mystery hatched out of an egg and just as mysterious as if the egg had been addle
the second of chanticleers two wives ever since phbes arrival had been in a state of heavy despondency caused as it afterwards appeared by her inability to lay an egg
one day however by her selfimportant gait the sideways turn of her head and the cock of her eye as she pried into one and another nook of the gardencroaking to herself all the while with inexpressible complacencyit was made evident that this identical hen much as mankind undervalued her carried something about her person the worth of which was not to be estimated either in gold or precious stones
shortly after there was a prodigious cackling and gratulation of chanticleer and all his family including the wizened chicken who appeared to understand the matter quite as well as did his sire his mother or his aunt
that afternoon phbe found a diminutive eggnot in the regular nest it was far too precious to be trusted therebut cunningly hidden under the currantbushes on some dry stalks of last years grass
hepzibah on learning the fact took possession of the egg and appropriated it to cliffords breakfast on account of a certain delicacy of flavor for which as she affirmed these eggs had always been famous
thus unscrupulously did the old gentlewoman sacrifice the continuance perhaps of an ancient feathered race with no better end than to supply her brother with a dainty that hardly filled the bowl of a teaspoon
it must have been in reference to this outrage that chanticleer the next day accompanied by the bereaved mother of the egg took his post in front of phbe and clifford and delivered himself of a harangue that might have proved as long as his own pedigree but for a fit of merriment on phbes part
hereupon the offended fowl stalked away on his long stilts and utterly withdrew his notice from phbe and the rest of human nature until she made her peace with an offering of spicecake which next to snails was the delicacy most in favor with his aristocratic taste
we linger too long no doubt beside this paltry rivulet of life that flowed through the garden of the pyncheon house
but we deem it pardonable to record these mean incidents and poor delights because they proved so greatly to cliffords benefit
they had the earthsmell in them and contributed to give him health and substance
some of his occupations wrought less desirably upon him
he had a singular propensity for example to hang over maules well and look at the constantly shifting phantasmagoria of figures produced by the agitation of the water over the mosaicwork of colored pebbles at the bottom
he said that faces looked upward to him therebeautiful faces arrayed in bewitching smileseach momentary face so fair and rosy and every smile so sunny that he felt wronged at its departure until the same flitting witchcraft made a new one
but sometimes he would suddenly cry out the dark face gazes at me and be miserable the whole day afterwards
phbe when she hung over the fountain by cliffords side could see nothing of all thisneither the beauty nor the uglinessbut only the colored pebbles looking as if the gush of the waters shook and disarranged them
and the dark face that so troubled clifford was no more than the shadow thrown from a branch of one of the damsontrees and breaking the inner light of maules well
the truth was however that his fancyreviving faster than his will and judgment and always stronger than theycreated shapes of loveliness that were symbolic of his native character and now and then a stern and dreadful shape that typified his fate
on sundays after phbe had been at churchfor the girl had a churchgoing conscience and would hardly have been at ease had she missed either prayer singing sermon or benedictionafter churchtime therefore there was ordinarily a sober little festival in the garden
in addition to clifford hepzibah and phbe two guests made up the company
one was the artist holgrave who in spite of his consociation with reformers and his other queer and questionable traits continued to hold an elevated place in hepzibahs regard
the other we are almost ashamed to say was the venerable uncle venner in a clean shirt and a broadcloth coat more respectable than his ordinary wear inasmuch as it was neatly patched on each elbow and might be called an entire garment except for a slight inequality in the length of its skirts
clifford on several occasions had seemed to enjoy the old mans intercourse for the sake of his mellow cheerful vein which was like the sweet flavor of a frostbitten apple such as one picks up under the tree in december
a man at the very lowest point of the social scale was easier and more agreeable for the fallen gentleman to encounter than a person at any of the intermediate degrees and moreover as cliffords young manhood had been lost he was fond of feeling himself comparatively youthful now in apposition with the patriarchal age of uncle venner
in fact it was sometimes observable that clifford half wilfully hid from himself the consciousness of being stricken in years and cherished visions of an earthly future still before him visions however too indistinctly drawn to be followed by disappointmentthough doubtless by depressionwhen any casual incident or recollection made him sensible of the withered leaf
so this oddly composed little social party used to assemble under the ruinous arbor
hepzibahstately as ever at heart and yielding not an inch of her old gentility but resting upon it so much the more as justifying a princesslike condescensionexhibited a not ungraceful hospitality
she talked kindly to the vagrant artist and took sage counsellady as she waswith the woodsawyer the messenger of everybodys petty errands the patched philosopher
and uncle venner who had studied the world at streetcorners and other posts equally well adapted for just observation was as ready to give out his wisdom as a townpump to give water
miss hepzibah maam said he once after they had all been cheerful together i really enjoy these quiet little meetings of a sabbath afternoon
they are very much like what i expect to have after i retire to my farm  uncle venner observed clifford in a drowsy inward tone is always talking about his farm
but i have a better scheme for him by and by
we shall see  ah mr clifford pyncheon said the man of patches you may scheme for me as much as you please but im not going to give up this one scheme of my own even if i never bring it really to pass
it does seem to me that men make a wonderful mistake in trying to heap up property upon property
if i had done so i should feel as if providence was not bound to take care of me and at all events the city wouldnt be
im one of those people who think that infinity is big enough for us alland eternity long enough  why so they are uncle venner remarked phbe after a pause for she had been trying to fathom the profundity and appositeness of this concluding apothegm
but for this short life of ours one would like a house and a moderate gardenspot of ones own  it appears to me said the daguerreotypist smiling that uncle venner has the principles of fourier at the bottom of his wisdom only they have not quite so much distinctness in his mind as in that of the systematizing frenchman  come phbe said hepzibah it is time to bring the currants  and then while the yellow richness of the declining sunshine still fell into the open space of the garden phbe brought out a loaf of bread and a china bowl of currants freshly gathered from the bushes and crushed with sugar
these with waterbut not from the fountain of ill omen close at handconstituted all the entertainment
meanwhile holgrave took some pains to establish an intercourse with clifford actuated it might seem entirely by an impulse of kindliness in order that the present hour might be cheerfuller than most which the poor recluse had spent or was destined yet to spend
nevertheless in the artists deep thoughtful allobservant eyes there was now and then an expression not sinister but questionable as if he had some other interest in the scene than a stranger a youthful and unconnected adventurer might be supposed to have
with great mobility of outward mood however he applied himself to the task of enlivening the party and with so much success that even darkhued hepzibah threw off one tint of melancholy and made what shift she could with the remaining portion
phbe said to herselfhow pleasant he can be as for uncle venner as a mark of friendship and approbation he readily consented to afford the young man his countenance in the way of his professionnot metaphorically be it understood but literally by allowing a daguerreotype of his face so familiar to the town to be exhibited at the entrance of holgraves studio
clifford as the company partook of their little banquet grew to be the gayest of them all
either it was one of those upquivering flashes of the spirit to which minds in an abnormal state are liable or else the artist had subtly touched some chord that made musical vibration
indeed what with the pleasant summer evening and the sympathy of this little circle of not unkindly souls it was perhaps natural that a character so susceptible as cliffords should become animated and show itself readily responsive to what was said around him
but he gave out his own thoughts likewise with an airy and fanciful glow so that they glistened as it were through the arbor and made their escape among the interstices of the foliage
he had been as cheerful no doubt while alone with phbe but never with such tokens of acute although partial intelligence
but as the sunlight left the peaks of the seven gables so did the excitement fade out of cliffords eyes
he gazed vaguely and mournfully about him as if he missed something precious and missed it the more drearily for not knowing precisely what it was
i want my happiness at last he murmured hoarsely and indistinctly hardly shaping out the words
many many years have i waited for it
it is late
it is late
i want my happiness  alas poor clifford
you are old and worn with troubles that ought never to have befallen you
you are partly crazy and partly imbecile a ruin a failure as almost everybody isthough some in less degree or less perceptibly than their fellows
fate has no happiness in store for you unless your quiet home in the old family residence with the faithful hepzibah and your long summer afternoons with phbe and these sabbath festivals with uncle venner and the daguerreotypist deserve to be called happiness
why not
if not the thing itself it is marvellously like it and the more so for that ethereal and intangible quality which causes it all to vanish at too close an introspection
take it therefore while you may
murmur notquestion notbut make the most of it
xi
the arched window   from the inertness or what we may term the vegetative character of his ordinary mood clifford would perhaps have been content to spend one day after another interminablyor at least throughout the summertimein just the kind of life described in the preceding pages
fancying however that it might be for his benefit occasionally to diversify the scene phbe sometimes suggested that he should look out upon the life of the street
for this purpose they used to mount the staircase together to the second story of the house where at the termination of a wide entry there was an arched window of uncommonly large dimensions shaded by a pair of curtains
it opened above the porch where there had formerly been a balcony the balustrade of which had long since gone to decay and been removed
at this arched window throwing it open but keeping himself in comparative obscurity by means of the curtain clifford had an opportunity of witnessing such a portion of the great worlds movement as might be supposed to roll through one of the retired streets of a not very populous city
but he and phbe made a sight as well worth seeing as any that the city could exhibit
the pale gray childish aged melancholy yet often simply cheerful and sometimes delicately intelligent aspect of clifford peering from behind the faded crimson of the curtainwatching the monotony of everyday occurrences with a kind of inconsequential interest and earnestness and at every petty throb of his sensibility turning for sympathy to the eyes of the bright young girl
if once he were fairly seated at the window even pyncheon street would hardly be so dull and lonely but that somewhere or other along its extent clifford might discover matter to occupy his eye and titillate if not engross his observation
things familiar to the youngest child that had begun its outlook at existence seemed strange to him
a cab an omnibus with its populous interior dropping here and there a passenger and picking up another and thus typifying that vast rolling vehicle the world the end of whose journey is everywhere and nowhere these objects he followed eagerly with his eyes but forgot them before the dust raised by the horses and wheels had settled along their track
as regarded novelties among which cabs and omnibuses were to be reckoned his mind appeared to have lost its proper gripe and retentiveness
twice or thrice for example during the sunny hours of the day a watercart went along by the pyncheon house leaving a broad wake of moistened earth instead of the white dust that had risen at a ladys lightest footfall it was like a summer shower which the city authorities had caught and tamed and compelled it into the commonest routine of their convenience
with the watercart clifford could never grow familiar it always affected him with just the same surprise as at first
his mind took an apparently sharp impression from it but lost the recollection of this perambulatory shower before its next reappearance as completely as did the street itself along which the heat so quickly strewed white dust again
it was the same with the railroad
clifford could hear the obstreperous howl of the steamdevil and by leaning a little way from the arched window could catch a glimpse of the trains of cars flashing a brief transit across the extremity of the street
the idea of terrible energy thus forced upon him was new at every recurrence and seemed to affect him as disagreeably and with almost as much surprise the hundredth time as the first
nothing gives a sadder sense of decay than this loss or suspension of the power to deal with unaccustomed things and to keep up with the swiftness of the passing moment
it can merely be a suspended animation for were the power actually to perish there would be little use of immortality
we are less than ghosts for the time being whenever this calamity befalls us
clifford was indeed the most inveterate of conservatives
all the antique fashions of the street were dear to him even such as were characterized by a rudeness that would naturally have annoyed his fastidious senses
he loved the old rumbling and jolting carts the former track of which he still found in his longburied remembrance as the observer of today finds the wheeltracks of ancient vehicles in herculaneum
the butchers cart with its snowy canopy was an acceptable object so was the fishcart heralded by its horn so likewise was the countrymans cart of vegetables plodding from door to door with long pauses of the patient horse while his owner drove a trade in turnips carrots summersquashes stringbeans green peas and new potatoes with half the housewives of the neighborhood
the bakers cart with the harsh music of its bells had a pleasant effect on clifford because as few things else did it jingled the very dissonance of yore
one afternoon a scissorgrinder chanced to set his wheel agoing under the pyncheon elm and just in front of the arched window
children came running with their mothers scissors or the carvingknife or the paternal razor or anything else that lacked an edge except indeed poor cliffords wits that the grinder might apply the article to his magic wheel and give it back as good as new
round went the busily revolving machinery kept in motion by the scissorgrinders foot and wore away the hard steel against the hard stone whence issued an intense and spiteful prolongation of a hiss as fierce as those emitted by satan and his compeers in pandemonium though squeezed into smaller compass
it was an ugly little venomous serpent of a noise as ever did petty violence to human ears
but clifford listened with rapturous delight
the sound however disagreeable had very brisk life in it and together with the circle of curious children watching the revolutions of the wheel appeared to give him a more vivid sense of active bustling and sunshiny existence than he had attained in almost any other way
nevertheless its charm lay chiefly in the past for the scissorgrinders wheel had hissed in his childish ears
he sometimes made doleful complaint that there were no stagecoaches nowadays
and he asked in an injured tone what had become of all those old squaretopped chaises with wings sticking out on either side that used to be drawn by a ploughhorse and driven by a farmers wife and daughter peddling whortleberries and blackberries about the town
their disappearance made him doubt he said whether the berries had not left off growing in the broad pastures and along the shady country lanes
but anything that appealed to the sense of beauty in however humble a way did not require to be recommended by these old associations
this was observable when one of those italian boys who are rather a modern feature of our streets came along with his barrelorgan and stopped under the wide and cool shadows of the elm
with his quick professional eye he took note of the two faces watching him from the arched window and opening his instrument began to scatter its melodies abroad
he had a monkey on his shoulder dressed in a highland plaid and to complete the sum of splendid attractions wherewith he presented himself to the public there was a company of little figures whose sphere and habitation was in the mahogany case of his organ and whose principle of life was the music which the italian made it his business to grind out
in all their variety of occupationthe cobbler the blacksmith the soldier the lady with her fan the toper with his bottle the milkmaid sitting by her cowthis fortunate little society might truly be said to enjoy a harmonious existence and to make life literally a dance
the italian turned a crank and behold
every one of these small individuals started into the most curious vivacity
the cobbler wrought upon a shoe the blacksmith hammered his iron the soldier waved his glittering blade the lady raised a tiny breeze with her fan the jolly toper swigged lustily at his bottle a scholar opened his book with eager thirst for knowledge and turned his head to and fro along the page the milkmaid energetically drained her cow and a miser counted gold into his strongboxall at the same turning of a crank
yes and moved by the selfsame impulse a lover saluted his mistress on her lips
possibly some cynic at once merry and bitter had desired to signify in this pantomimic scene that we mortals whatever our business or amusementhowever serious however triflingall dance to one identical tune and in spite of our ridiculous activity bring nothing finally to pass
for the most remarkable aspect of the affair was that at the cessation of the music everybody was petrified at once from the most extravagant life into a dead torpor
neither was the cobblers shoe finished nor the blacksmiths iron shaped out nor was there a drop less of brandy in the topers bottle nor a drop more of milk in the milkmaids pail nor one additional coin in the misers strongbox nor was the scholar a page deeper in his book
all were precisely in the same condition as before they made themselves so ridiculous by their haste to toil to enjoy to accumulate gold and to become wise
saddest of all moreover the lover was none the happier for the maidens granted kiss
but rather than swallow this last too acrid ingredient we reject the whole moral of the show
the monkey meanwhile with a thick tail curling out into preposterous prolixity from beneath his tartans took his station at the italians feet
he turned a wrinkled and abominable little visage to every passerby and to the circle of children that soon gathered round and to hepzibahs shopdoor and upward to the arched window whence phbe and clifford were looking down
every moment also he took off his highland bonnet and performed a bow and scrape
sometimes moreover he made personal application to individuals holding out his small black palm and otherwise plainly signifying his excessive desire for whatever filthy lucre might happen to be in anybodys pocket
the mean and low yet strangely manlike expression of his wilted countenance the prying and crafty glance that showed him ready to gripe at every miserable advantage his enormous tail too enormous to be decently concealed under his gabardine and the deviltry of nature which it betokenedtake this monkey just as he was in short and you could desire no better image of the mammon of copper coin symbolizing the grossest form of the love of money
neither was there any possibility of satisfying the covetous little devil
phbe threw down a whole handful of cents which he picked up with joyless eagerness handed them over to the italian for safekeeping and immediately recommenced a series of pantomimic petitions for more
doubtless more than one newenglanderor let him be of what country he might it is as likely to be the casepassed by and threw a look at the monkey and went on without imagining how nearly his own moral condition was here exemplified
clifford however was a being of another order
he had taken childish delight in the music and smiled too at the figures which it set in motion
but after looking awhile at the longtailed imp he was so shocked by his horrible ugliness spiritual as well as physical that he actually began to shed tears a weakness which men of merely delicate endowments and destitute of the fiercer deeper and more tragic power of laughter can hardly avoid when the worst and meanest aspect of life happens to be presented to them
pyncheon street was sometimes enlivened by spectacles of more imposing pretensions than the above and which brought the multitude along with them
with a shivering repugnance at the idea of personal contact with the world a powerful impulse still seized on clifford whenever the rush and roar of the human tide grew strongly audible to him
this was made evident one day when a political procession with hundreds of flaunting banners and drums fifes clarions and cymbals reverberating between the rows of buildings marched all through town and trailed its length of trampling footsteps and most infrequent uproar past the ordinarily quiet house of the seven gables
as a mere object of sight nothing is more deficient in picturesque features than a procession seen in its passage through narrow streets
the spectator feels it to be fools play when he can distinguish the tedious commonplace of each mans visage with the perspiration and weary selfimportance on it and the very cut of his pantaloons and the stiffness or laxity of his shirtcollar and the dust on the back of his black coat
in order to become majestic it should be viewed from some vantage point as it rolls its slow and long array through the centre of a wide plain or the stateliest public square of a city for then by its remoteness it melts all the petty personalities of which it is made up into one broad mass of existenceone great lifeone collected body of mankind with a vast homogeneous spirit animating it
but on the other hand if an impressible person standing alone over the brink of one of these processions should behold it not in its atoms but in its aggregateas a mighty river of life massive in its tide and black with mystery and out of its depths calling to the kindred depth within himthen the contiguity would add to the effect
it might so fascinate him that he would hardly be restrained from plunging into the surging stream of human sympathies
so it proved with clifford
he shuddered he grew pale he threw an appealing look at hepzibah and phbe who were with him at the window
they comprehended nothing of his emotions and supposed him merely disturbed by the unaccustomed tumult
at last with tremulous limbs he started up set his foot on the windowsill and in an instant more would have been in the unguarded balcony
as it was the whole procession might have seen him a wild haggard figure his gray locks floating in the wind that waved their banners a lonely being estranged from his race but now feeling himself man again by virtue of the irrepressible instinct that possessed him
had clifford attained the balcony he would probably have leaped into the street but whether impelled by the species of terror that sometimes urges its victim over the very precipice which he shrinks from or by a natural magnetism tending towards the great centre of humanity it were not easy to decide
both impulses might have wrought on him at once
but his companions affrighted by his gesturewhich was that of a man hurried away in spite of himselfseized cliffords garment and held him back
hepzibah shrieked
phbe to whom all extravagance was a horror burst into sobs and tears
clifford clifford
are you crazy cried his sister
i hardly know hepzibah said clifford drawing a long breath
fear nothingit is over nowbut had i taken that plunge and survived it methinks it would have made me another man  possibly in some sense clifford may have been right
he needed a shock or perhaps he required to take a deep deep plunge into the ocean of human life and to sink down and be covered by its profoundness and then to emerge sobered invigorated restored to the world and to himself
perhaps again he required nothing less than the great final remedydeath
a similar yearning to renew the broken links of brotherhood with his kind sometimes showed itself in a milder form and once it was made beautiful by the religion that lay even deeper than itself
in the incident now to be sketched there was a touching recognition on cliffords part of gods care and love towards himtowards this poor forsaken man who if any mortal could might have been pardoned for regarding himself as thrown aside forgotten and left to be the sport of some fiend whose playfulness was an ecstasy of mischief
it was the sabbath morning one of those bright calm sabbaths with its own hallowed atmosphere when heaven seems to diffuse itself over the earths face in a solemn smile no less sweet than solemn
on such a sabbath morn were we pure enough to be its medium we should be conscious of the earths natural worship ascending through our frames on whatever spot of ground we stood
the churchbells with various tones but all in harmony were calling out and responding to one anotherit is the sabbaththe sabbathyea the sabbathand over the whole city the bells scattered the blessed sounds now slowly now with livelier joy now one bell alone now all the bells together crying earnestlyit is the sabbathand flinging their accents afar off to melt into the air and pervade it with the holy word
the air with gods sweetest and tenderest sunshine in it was meet for mankind to breathe into their hearts and send it forth again as the utterance of prayer
clifford sat at the window with hepzibah watching the neighbors as they stepped into the street
all of them however unspiritual on other days were transfigured by the sabbath influence so that their very garmentswhether it were an old mans decent coat well brushed for the thousandth time or a little boys first sack and trousers finished yesterday by his mothers needlehad somewhat of the quality of ascensionrobes
forth likewise from the portal of the old house stepped phbe putting up her small green sunshade and throwing upward a glance and smile of parting kindness to the faces at the arched window
in her aspect there was a familiar gladness and a holiness that you could play with and yet reverence it as much as ever
she was like a prayer offered up in the homeliest beauty of ones mothertongue
fresh was phbe moreover and airy and sweet in her apparel as if nothing that she woreneither her gown nor her small straw bonnet nor her little kerchief any more than her snowy stockingshad ever been put on before or if worn were all the fresher for it and with a fragrance as if they had lain among the rosebuds
the girl waved her hand to hepzibah and clifford and went up the street a religion in herself warm simple true with a substance that could walk on earth and a spirit that was capable of heaven
hepzibah asked clifford after watching phbe to the corner do you never go to church  no clifford she repliednot these many many years  were i to be there he rejoined it seems to me that i could pray once more when so many human souls were praying all around me  she looked into cliffords face and beheld there a soft natural effusion for his heart gushed out as it were and ran over at his eyes in delightful reverence for god and kindly affection for his human brethren
the emotion communicated itself to hepzibah
she yearned to take him by the hand and go and kneel down they two togetherboth so long separate from the world and as she now recognized scarcely friends with him aboveto kneel down among the people and be reconciled to god and man at once
dear brother said she earnestly let us go
we belong nowhere
we have not a foot of space in any church to kneel upon but let us go to some place of worship even if we stand in the broad aisle
poor and forsaken as we are some pewdoor will be opened to us  so hepzibah and her brother made themselves readyas ready as they could in the best of their oldfashioned garments which had hung on pegs or been laid away in trunks so long that the dampness and mouldy smell of the past was on themmade themselves ready in their faded bettermost to go to church
they descended the staircase togethergaunt sallow hepzibah and pale emaciated agestricken clifford
they pulled open the front door and stepped across the threshold and felt both of them as if they were standing in the presence of the whole world and with mankinds great and terrible eye on them alone
the eye of their father seemed to be withdrawn and gave them no encouragement
the warm sunny air of the street made them shiver
their hearts quaked within them at the idea of taking one step farther
it cannot be hepzibahit is too late said clifford with deep sadness
we are ghosts
we have no right among human beingsno right anywhere but in this old house which has a curse on it and which therefore we are doomed to haunt
and besides he continued with a fastidious sensibility inalienably characteristic of the man it would not be fit nor beautiful to go
it is an ugly thought that i should be frightful to my fellowbeings and that children would cling to their mothers gowns at sight of me  they shrank back into the dusky passageway and closed the door
but going up the staircase again they found the whole interior of the house tenfold more dismal and the air closer and heavier for the glimpse and breath of freedom which they had just snatched
they could not flee their jailer had but left the door ajar in mockery and stood behind it to watch them stealing out
at the threshold they felt his pitiless gripe upon them
for what other dungeon is so dark as ones own heart
what jailer so inexorable as ones self
but it would be no fair picture of cliffords state of mind were we to represent him as continually or prevailingly wretched
on the contrary there was no other man in the city we are bold to affirm of so much as half his years who enjoyed so many lightsome and griefless moments as himself
he had no burden of care upon him there were none of those questions and contingencies with the future to be settled which wear away all other lives and render them not worth having by the very process of providing for their support
in this respect he was a childa child for the whole term of his existence be it long or short
indeed his life seemed to be standing still at a period little in advance of childhood and to cluster all his reminiscences about that epoch just as after the torpor of a heavy blow the sufferers reviving consciousness goes back to a moment considerably behind the accident that stupefied him
he sometimes told phbe and hepzibah his dreams in which he invariably played the part of a child or a very young man
so vivid were they in his relation of them that he once held a dispute with his sister as to the particular figure or print of a chintz morningdress which he had seen their mother wear in the dream of the preceding night
hepzibah piquing herself on a womans accuracy in such matters held it to be slightly different from what clifford described but producing the very gown from an old trunk it proved to be identical with his remembrance of it
had clifford every time that he emerged out of dreams so lifelike undergone the torture of transformation from a boy into an old and broken man the daily recurrence of the shock would have been too much to bear
it would have caused an acute agony to thrill from the morning twilight all the day through until bedtime and even then would have mingled a dull inscrutable pain and pallid hue of misfortune with the visionary bloom and adolescence of his slumber
but the nightly moonshine interwove itself with the morning mist and enveloped him as in a robe which he hugged about his person and seldom let realities pierce through he was not often quite awake but slept openeyed and perhaps fancied himself most dreaming then
thus lingering always so near his childhood he had sympathies with children and kept his heart the fresher thereby like a reservoir into which rivulets were pouring not far from the fountainhead
though prevented by a subtile sense of propriety from desiring to associate with them he loved few things better than to look out of the arched window and see a little girl driving her hoop along the sidewalk or schoolboys at a game of ball
their voices also were very pleasant to him heard at a distance all swarming and intermingling together as flies do in a sunny room
clifford would doubtless have been glad to share their sports
one afternoon he was seized with an irresistible desire to blow soapbubbles an amusement as hepzibah told phbe apart that had been a favorite one with her brother when they were both children
behold him therefore at the arched window with an earthen pipe in his mouth
behold him with his gray hair and a wan unreal smile over his countenance where still hovered a beautiful grace which his worst enemy must have acknowledged to be spiritual and immortal since it had survived so long
behold him scattering airy spheres abroad from the window into the street
little impalpable worlds were those soapbubbles with the big world depicted in hues bright as imagination on the nothing of their surface
it was curious to see how the passersby regarded these brilliant fantasies as they came floating down and made the dull atmosphere imaginative about them
some stopped to gaze and perhaps carried a pleasant recollection of the bubbles onward as far as the streetcorner some looked angrily upward as if poor clifford wronged them by setting an image of beauty afloat so near their dusty pathway
a great many put out their fingers or their walkingsticks to touch withal and were perversely gratified no doubt when the bubble with all its pictured earth and sky scene vanished as if it had never been
at length just as an elderly gentleman of very dignified presence happened to be passing a large bubble sailed majestically down and burst right against his nose
he looked upat first with a stern keen glance which penetrated at once into the obscurity behind the arched windowthen with a smile which might be conceived as diffusing a dogday sultriness for the space of several yards about him
aha cousin clifford cried judge pyncheon
what
still blowing soapbubbles  the tone seemed as if meant to be kind and soothing but yet had a bitterness of sarcasm in it
as for clifford an absolute palsy of fear came over him
apart from any definite cause of dread which his past experience might have given him he felt that native and original horror of the excellent judge which is proper to a weak delicate and apprehensive character in the presence of massive strength
strength is incomprehensible by weakness and therefore the more terrible
there is no greater bugbear than a strongwilled relative in the circle of his own connections
xii
the daguerreotypist   it must not be supposed that the life of a personage naturally so active as phbe could be wholly confined within the precincts of the old pyncheon house
cliffords demands upon her time were usually satisfied in those long days considerably earlier than sunset
quiet as his daily existence seemed it nevertheless drained all the resources by which he lived
it was not physical exercise that overwearied himfor except that he sometimes wrought a little with a hoe or paced the gardenwalk or in rainy weather traversed a large unoccupied roomit was his tendency to remain only too quiescent as regarded any toil of the limbs and muscles
but either there was a smouldering fire within him that consumed his vital energy or the monotony that would have dragged itself with benumbing effect over a mind differently situated was no monotony to clifford
possibly he was in a state of second growth and recovery and was constantly assimilating nutriment for his spirit and intellect from sights sounds and events which passed as a perfect void to persons more practised with the world
as all is activity and vicissitude to the new mind of a child so might it be likewise to a mind that had undergone a kind of new creation after its longsuspended life
be the cause what it might clifford commonly retired to rest thoroughly exhausted while the sunbeams were still melting through his windowcurtains or were thrown with late lustre on the chamber wall
and while he thus slept early as other children do and dreamed of childhood phbe was free to follow her own tastes for the remainder of the day and evening
this was a freedom essential to the health even of a character so little susceptible of morbid influences as that of phbe
the old house as we have already said had both the dryrot and the damprot in its walls it was not good to breathe no other atmosphere than that
hepzibah though she had her valuable and redeeming traits had grown to be a kind of lunatic by imprisoning herself so long in one place with no other company than a single series of ideas and but one affection and one bitter sense of wrong
clifford the reader may perhaps imagine was too inert to operate morally on his fellowcreatures however intimate and exclusive their relations with him
but the sympathy or magnetism among human beings is more subtile and universal than we think it exists indeed among different classes of organized life and vibrates from one to another
a flower for instance as phbe herself observed always began to droop sooner in cliffords hand or hepzibahs than in her own and by the same law converting her whole daily life into a flower fragrance for these two sickly spirits the blooming girl must inevitably droop and fade much sooner than if worn on a younger and happier breast
unless she had now and then indulged her brisk impulses and breathed rural air in a suburban walk or ocean breezes along the shorehad occasionally obeyed the impulse of nature in new england girls by attending a metaphysical or philosophical lecture or viewing a sevenmile panorama or listening to a concerthad gone shopping about the city ransacking entire depots of splendid merchandise and bringing home a ribbonhad employed likewise a little time to read the bible in her chamber and had stolen a little more to think of her mother and her native placeunless for such moral medicines as the above we should soon have beheld our poor phbe grow thin and put on a bleached unwholesome aspect and assume strange shy ways prophetic of oldmaidenhood and a cheerless future
even as it was a change grew visible a change partly to be regretted although whatever charm it infringed upon was repaired by another perhaps more precious
she was not so constantly gay but had her moods of thought which clifford on the whole liked better than her former phase of unmingled cheerfulness because now she understood him better and more delicately and sometimes even interpreted him to himself
her eyes looked larger and darker and deeper so deep at some silent moments that they seemed like artesian wells down down into the infinite
she was less girlish than when we first beheld her alighting from the omnibus less girlish but more a woman
the only youthful mind with which phbe had an opportunity of frequent intercourse was that of the daguerreotypist
inevitably by the pressure of the seclusion about them they had been brought into habits of some familiarity
had they met under different circumstances neither of these young persons would have been likely to bestow much thought upon the other unless indeed their extreme dissimilarity should have proved a principle of mutual attraction
both it is true were characters proper to new england life and possessing a common ground therefore in their more external developments but as unlike in their respective interiors as if their native climes had been at worldwide distance
during the early part of their acquaintance phbe had held back rather more than was customary with her frank and simple manners from holgraves not very marked advances
nor was she yet satisfied that she knew him well although they almost daily met and talked together in a kind friendly and what seemed to be a familiar way
the artist in a desultory manner had imparted to phbe something of his history
young as he was and had his career terminated at the point already attained there had been enough of incident to fill very creditably an autobiographic volume
a romance on the plan of gil blas adapted to american society and manners would cease to be a romance
the experience of many individuals among us who think it hardly worth the telling would equal the vicissitudes of the spaniards earlier life while their ultimate success or the point whither they tend may be incomparably higher than any that a novelist would imagine for his hero
holgrave as he told phbe somewhat proudly could not boast of his origin unless as being exceedingly humble nor of his education except that it had been the scantiest possible and obtained by a few wintermonths attendance at a district school
left early to his own guidance he had begun to be selfdependent while yet a boy and it was a condition aptly suited to his natural force of will
though now but twentytwo years old lacking some months which are years in such a life he had already been first a country schoolmaster next a salesman in a country store and either at the same time or afterwards the political editor of a country newspaper
he had subsequently travelled new england and the middle states as a peddler in the employment of a connecticut manufactory of colognewater and other essences
in an episodical way he had studied and practised dentistry and with very flattering success especially in many of the factorytowns along our inland streams
as a supernumerary official of some kind or other aboard a packetship he had visited europe and found means before his return to see italy and part of france and germany
at a later period he had spent some months in a community of fourierists
still more recently he had been a public lecturer on mesmerism for which science as he assured phbe and indeed satisfactorily proved by putting chanticleer who happened to be scratching near by to sleep he had very remarkable endowments
his present phase as a daguerreotypist was of no more importance in his own view nor likely to be more permanent than any of the preceding ones
it had been taken up with the careless alacrity of an adventurer who had his bread to earn
it would be thrown aside as carelessly whenever he should choose to earn his bread by some other equally digressive means
but what was most remarkable and perhaps showed a more than common poise in the young man was the fact that amid all these personal vicissitudes he had never lost his identity
homeless as he had beencontinually changing his whereabout and therefore responsible neither to public opinion nor to individualsputting off one exterior and snatching up another to be soon shifted for a thirdhe had never violated the innermost man but had carried his conscience along with him
it was impossible to know holgrave without recognizing this to be the fact
hepzibah had seen it
phbe soon saw it likewise and gave him the sort of confidence which such a certainty inspires
she was startled however and sometimes repellednot by any doubt of his integrity to whatever law he acknowledged but by a sense that his law differed from her own
he made her uneasy and seemed to unsettle everything around her by his lack of reverence for what was fixed unless at a moments warning it could establish its right to hold its ground
then moreover she scarcely thought him affectionate in his nature
he was too calm and cool an observer
phbe felt his eye often his heart seldom or never
he took a certain kind of interest in hepzibah and her brother and phbe herself
he studied them attentively and allowed no slightest circumstance of their individualities to escape him
he was ready to do them whatever good he might but after all he never exactly made common cause with them nor gave any reliable evidence that he loved them better in proportion as he knew them more
in his relations with them he seemed to be in quest of mental food not heartsustenance
phbe could not conceive what interested him so much in her friends and herself intellectually since he cared nothing for them or comparatively so little as objects of human affection
always in his interviews with phbe the artist made especial inquiry as to the welfare of clifford whom except at the sunday festival he seldom saw
does he still seem happy he asked one day
as happy as a child answered phbe butlike a child toovery easily disturbed  how disturbed inquired holgrave
by things without or by thoughts within  i cannot see his thoughts
how should i replied phbe with simple piquancy
very often his humor changes without any reason that can be guessed at just as a cloud comes over the sun
latterly since i have begun to know him better i feel it to be not quite right to look closely into his moods
he has had such a great sorrow that his heart is made all solemn and sacred by it
when he is cheerfulwhen the sun shines into his mindthen i venture to peep in just as far as the light reaches but no further
it is holy ground where the shadow falls  how prettily you express this sentiment said the artist
i can understand the feeling without possessing it
had i your opportunities no scruples would prevent me from fathoming clifford to the full depth of my plummetline  how strange that you should wish it remarked phbe involuntarily
what is cousin clifford to you  oh nothingof course nothing answered holgrave with a smile
only this is such an odd and incomprehensible world
the more i look at it the more it puzzles me and i begin to suspect that a mans bewilderment is the measure of his wisdom
men and women and children too are such strange creatures that one never can be certain that he really knows them nor ever guess what they have been from what he sees them to be now
judge pyncheon
clifford
what a complex riddlea complexity of complexitiesdo they present
it requires intuitive sympathy like a young girls to solve it
a mere observer like myself who never have any intuitions and am at best only subtile and acute is pretty certain to go astray  the artist now turned the conversation to themes less dark than that which they had touched upon
phbe and he were young together nor had holgrave in his premature experience of life wasted entirely that beautiful spirit of youth which gushing forth from one small heart and fancy may diffuse itself over the universe making it all as bright as on the first day of creation
mans own youth is the worlds youth at least he feels as if it were and imagines that the earths granite substance is something not yet hardened and which he can mould into whatever shape he likes
so it was with holgrave
he could talk sagely about the worlds old age but never actually believed what he said he was a young man still and therefore looked upon the worldthat graybearded and wrinkled profligate decrepit without being venerableas a tender stripling capable of being improved into all that it ought to be but scarcely yet had shown the remotest promise of becoming
he had that sense or inward prophecywhich a young man had better never have been born than not to have and a mature man had better die at once than utterly to relinquishthat we are not doomed to creep on forever in the old bad way but that this very now there are the harbingers abroad of a golden era to be accomplished in his own lifetime
it seemed to holgraveas doubtless it has seemed to the hopeful of every century since the epoch of adams grandchildrenthat in this age more than ever before the mossgrown and rotten past is to be torn down and lifeless institutions to be thrust out of the way and their dead corpses buried and everything to begin anew
as to the main pointmay we never live to doubt itas to the better centuries that are coming the artist was surely right
his error lay in supposing that this age more than any past or future one is destined to see the tattered garments of antiquity exchanged for a new suit instead of gradually renewing themselves by patchwork in applying his own little lifespan as the measure of an interminable achievement and more than all in fancying that it mattered anything to the great end in view whether he himself should contend for it or against it
yet it was well for him to think so
this enthusiasm infusing itself through the calmness of his character and thus taking an aspect of settled thought and wisdom would serve to keep his youth pure and make his aspirations high
and when with the years settling down more weightily upon him his early faith should be modified by inevitable experience it would be with no harsh and sudden revolution of his sentiments
he would still have faith in mans brightening destiny and perhaps love him all the better as he should recognize his helplessness in his own behalf and the haughty faith with which he began life would be well bartered for a far humbler one at its close in discerning that mans best directed effort accomplishes a kind of dream while god is the sole worker of realities
holgrave had read very little and that little in passing through the thoroughfare of life where the mystic language of his books was necessarily mixed up with the babble of the multitude so that both one and the other were apt to lose any sense that might have been properly their own
he considered himself a thinker and was certainly of a thoughtful turn but with his own path to discover had perhaps hardly yet reached the point where an educated man begins to think
the true value of his character lay in that deep consciousness of inward strength which made all his past vicissitudes seem merely like a change of garments in that enthusiasm so quiet that he scarcely knew of its existence but which gave a warmth to everything that he laid his hand on in that personal ambition hiddenfrom his own as well as other eyesamong his more generous impulses but in which lurked a certain efficacy that might solidify him from a theorist into the champion of some practicable cause
altogether in his culture and want of culturein his crude wild and misty philosophy and the practical experience that counteracted some of its tendencies in his magnanimous zeal for mans welfare and his recklessness of whatever the ages had established in mans behalf in his faith and in his infidelity in what he had and in what he lackedthe artist might fitly enough stand forth as the representative of many compeers in his native land
his career it would be difficult to prefigure
there appeared to be qualities in holgrave such as in a country where everything is free to the hand that can grasp it could hardly fail to put some of the worlds prizes within his reach
but these matters are delightfully uncertain
at almost every step in life we meet with young men of just about holgraves age for whom we anticipate wonderful things but of whom even after much and careful inquiry we never happen to hear another word
the effervescence of youth and passion and the fresh gloss of the intellect and imagination endow them with a false brilliancy which makes fools of themselves and other people
like certain chintzes calicoes and ginghams they show finely in their first newness but cannot stand the sun and rain and assume a very sober aspect after washingday
but our business is with holgrave as we find him on this particular afternoon and in the arbor of the pyncheon garden
in that point of view it was a pleasant sight to behold this young man with so much faith in himself and so fair an appearance of admirable powersso little harmed too by the many tests that had tried his metalit was pleasant to see him in his kindly intercourse with phbe
her thought had scarcely done him justice when it pronounced him cold or if so he had grown warmer now
without such purpose on her part and unconsciously on his she made the house of the seven gables like a home to him and the garden a familiar precinct
with the insight on which he prided himself he fancied that he could look through phbe and all around her and could read her off like a page of a childs storybook
but these transparent natures are often deceptive in their depth those pebbles at the bottom of the fountain are farther from us than we think
thus the artist whatever he might judge of phbes capacity was beguiled by some silent charm of hers to talk freely of what he dreamed of doing in the world
he poured himself out as to another self
very possibly he forgot phbe while he talked to her and was moved only by the inevitable tendency of thought when rendered sympathetic by enthusiasm and emotion to flow into the first safe reservoir which it finds
but had you peeped at them through the chinks of the gardenfence the young mans earnestness and heightened color might have led you to suppose that he was making love to the young girl
at length something was said by holgrave that made it apposite for phbe to inquire what had first brought him acquainted with her cousin hepzibah and why he now chose to lodge in the desolate old pyncheon house
without directly answering her he turned from the future which had heretofore been the theme of his discourse and began to speak of the influences of the past
one subject indeed is but the reverberation of the other
shall we never never get rid of this past cried he keeping up the earnest tone of his preceding conversation
it lies upon the present like a giants dead body
in fact the case is just as if a young giant were compelled to waste all his strength in carrying about the corpse of the old giant his grandfather who died a long while ago and only needs to be decently buried
just think a moment and it will startle you to see what slaves we are to bygone timesto death if we give the matter the right word  but i do not see it observed phbe
for example then continued holgrave a dead man if he happens to have made a will disposes of wealth no longer his own or if he die intestate it is distributed in accordance with the notions of men much longer dead than he
a dead man sits on all our judgmentseats and living judges do but search out and repeat his decisions
we read in dead mens books
we laugh at dead mens jokes and cry at dead mens pathos
we are sick of dead mens diseases physical and moral and die of the same remedies with which dead doctors killed their patients
we worship the living deity according to dead mens forms and creeds
whatever we seek to do of our own free motion a dead mans icy hand obstructs us
turn our eyes to what point we may a dead mans white immitigable face encounters them and freezes our very heart
and we must be dead ourselves before we can begin to have our proper influence on our own world which will then be no longer our world but the world of another generation with which we shall have no shadow of a right to interfere
i ought to have said too that we live in dead mens houses as for instance in this of the seven gables  and why not said phbe so long as we can be comfortable in them  but we shall live to see the day i trust went on the artist when no man shall build his house for posterity
why should he
he might just as reasonably order a durable suit of clothesleather or guttapercha or whatever else lasts longestso that his greatgrandchildren should have the benefit of them and cut precisely the same figure in the world that he himself does
if each generation were allowed and expected to build its own houses that single change comparatively unimportant in itself would imply almost every reform which society is now suffering for
i doubt whether even our public edificesour capitols statehouses courthouses cityhall and churchesought to be built of such permanent materials as stone or brick
it were better that they should crumble to ruin once in twenty years or thereabouts as a hint to the people to examine into and reform the institutions which they symbolize  how you hate everything old said phbe in dismay
it makes me dizzy to think of such a shifting world  i certainly love nothing mouldy answered holgrave
now this old pyncheon house
is it a wholesome place to live in with its black shingles and the green moss that shows how damp they areits dark lowstudded roomsits grime and sordidness which are the crystallization on its walls of the human breath that has been drawn and exhaled here in discontent and anguish
the house ought to be purified with firepurified till only its ashes remain  then why do you live in it asked phbe a little piqued
oh i am pursuing my studies here not in books however replied holgrave
the house in my view is expressive of that odious and abominable past with all its bad influences against which i have just been declaiming
i dwell in it for a while that i may know the better how to hate it
by the bye did you ever hear the story of maule the wizard and what happened between him and your immeasurably greatgrandfather  yes indeed said phbe i heard it long ago from my father and two or three times from my cousin hepzibah in the month that i have been here
she seems to think that all the calamities of the pyncheons began from that quarrel with the wizard as you call him
and you mr holgrave look as if you thought so too
how singular that you should believe what is so very absurd when you reject many things that are a great deal worthier of credit  i do believe it said the artist seriously not as a superstition however but as proved by unquestionable facts and as exemplifying a theory
now see under those seven gables at which we now look upand which old colonel pyncheon meant to be the house of his descendants in prosperity and happiness down to an epoch far beyond the presentunder that roof through a portion of three centuries there has been perpetual remorse of conscience a constantly defeated hope strife amongst kindred various misery a strange form of death dark suspicion unspeakable disgraceall or most of which calamity i have the means of tracing to the old puritans inordinate desire to plant and endow a family
to plant a family
this idea is at the bottom of most of the wrong and mischief which men do
the truth is that once in every halfcentury at longest a family should be merged into the great obscure mass of humanity and forget all about its ancestors
human blood in order to keep its freshness should run in hidden streams as the water of an aqueduct is conveyed in subterranean pipes
in the family existence of these pyncheons for instanceforgive me phbe but i cannot think of you as one of themin their brief new england pedigree there has been time enough to infect them all with one kind of lunacy or another  you speak very unceremoniously of my kindred said phbe debating with herself whether she ought to take offence
i speak true thoughts to a true mind answered holgrave with a vehemence which phbe had not before witnessed in him
the truth is as i say
furthermore the original perpetrator and father of this mischief appears to have perpetuated himself and still walks the streetat least his very image in mind and bodywith the fairest prospect of transmitting to posterity as rich and as wretched an inheritance as he has received
do you remember the daguerreotype and its resemblance to the old portrait  how strangely in earnest you are exclaimed phbe looking at him with surprise and perplexity half alarmed and partly inclined to laugh
you talk of the lunacy of the pyncheons is it contagious  i understand you said the artist coloring and laughing
i believe i am a little mad
this subject has taken hold of my mind with the strangest tenacity of clutch since i have lodged in yonder old gable
as one method of throwing it off i have put an incident of the pyncheon family history with which i happen to be acquainted into the form of a legend and mean to publish it in a magazine  do you write for the magazines inquired phbe
is it possible you did not know it cried holgrave
well such is literary fame
yes
miss phbe pyncheon among the multitude of my marvellous gifts i have that of writing stories and my name has figured i can assure you on the covers of graham and godey making as respectable an appearance for aught i could see as any of the canonized beadroll with which it was associated
in the humorous line i am thought to have a very pretty way with me and as for pathos i am as provocative of tears as an onion
but shall i read you my story  yes if it is not very long said phbeand added laughinglynor very dull  as this latter point was one which the daguerreotypist could not decide for himself he forthwith produced his roll of manuscript and while the late sunbeams gilded the seven gables began to read
xiii
alice pyncheon   there was a message brought one day from the worshipful gervayse pyncheon to young matthew maule the carpenter desiring his immediate presence at the house of the seven gables
and what does your master want with me said the carpenter to mr pyncheons black servant
does the house need any repair
well it may by this time and no blame to my father who built it neither
i was reading the old colonels tombstone no longer ago than last sabbath and reckoning from that date the house has stood sevenandthirty years
no wonder if there should be a job to do on the roof  dont know what massa wants answered scipio
the house is a berry good house and old colonel pyncheon think so too i reckonelse why the old man haunt it so and frighten a poor nigga as he does  well well friend scipio let your master know that im coming said the carpenter with a laugh
for a fair workmanlike job hell find me his man
and so the house is haunted is it
it will take a tighter workman than i am to keep the spirits out of the seven gables
even if the colonel would be quiet he added muttering to himself my old grandfather the wizard will be pretty sure to stick to the pyncheons as long as their walls hold together  whats that you mutter to yourself matthew maule asked scipio
and what for do you look so black at me  no matter darky said the carpenter
do you think nobody is to look black but yourself
go tell your master im coming and if you happen to see mistress alice his daughter give matthew maules humble respects to her
she has brought a fair face from italyfair and gentle and proudhas that same alice pyncheon  he talk of mistress alice cried scipio as he returned from his errand
the low carpenterman
he no business so much as to look at her a great way off  this young matthew maule the carpenter it must be observed was a person little understood and not very generally liked in the town where he resided not that anything could be alleged against his integrity or his skill and diligence in the handicraft which he exercised
the aversion as it might justly be called with which many persons regarded him was partly the result of his own character and deportment and partly an inheritance
he was the grandson of a former matthew maule one of the early settlers of the town and who had been a famous and terrible wizard in his day
this old reprobate was one of the sufferers when cotton mather and his brother ministers and the learned judges and other wise men and sir william phipps the sagacious governor made such laudable efforts to weaken the great enemy of souls by sending a multitude of his adherents up the rocky pathway of gallows hill
since those days no doubt it had grown to be suspected that in consequence of an unfortunate overdoing of a work praiseworthy in itself the proceedings against the witches had proved far less acceptable to the beneficent father than to that very arch enemy whom they were intended to distress and utterly overwhelm
it is not the less certain however that awe and terror brooded over the memories of those who died for this horrible crime of witchcraft
their graves in the crevices of the rocks were supposed to be incapable of retaining the occupants who had been so hastily thrust into them
old matthew maule especially was known to have as little hesitation or difficulty in rising out of his grave as an ordinary man in getting out of bed and was as often seen at midnight as living people at noonday
this pestilent wizard in whom his just punishment seemed to have wrought no manner of amendment had an inveterate habit of haunting a certain mansion styled the house of the seven gables against the owner of which he pretended to hold an unsettled claim for groundrent
the ghost it appearswith the pertinacity which was one of his distinguishing characteristics while aliveinsisted that he was the rightful proprietor of the site upon which the house stood
his terms were that either the aforesaid groundrent from the day when the cellar began to be dug should be paid down or the mansion itself given up else he the ghostly creditor would have his finger in all the affairs of the pyncheons and make everything go wrong with them though it should be a thousand years after his death
it was a wild story perhaps but seemed not altogether so incredible to those who could remember what an inflexibly obstinate old fellow this wizard maule had been
now the wizards grandson the young matthew maule of our story was popularly supposed to have inherited some of his ancestors questionable traits
it is wonderful how many absurdities were promulgated in reference to the young man
he was fabled for example to have a strange power of getting into peoples dreams and regulating matters there according to his own fancy pretty much like the stagemanager of a theatre
there was a great deal of talk among the neighbors particularly the petticoated ones about what they called the witchcraft of maules eye
some said that he could look into peoples minds others that by the marvellous power of this eye he could draw people into his own mind or send them if he pleased to do errands to his grandfather in the spiritual world others again that it was what is termed an evil eye and possessed the valuable faculty of blighting corn and drying children into mummies with the heartburn
but after all what worked most to the young carpenters disadvantage was first the reserve and sternness of his natural disposition and next the fact of his not being a churchcommunicant and the suspicion of his holding heretical tenets in matters of religion and polity
after receiving mr pyncheons message the carpenter merely tarried to finish a small job which he happened to have in hand and then took his way towards the house of the seven gables
this noted edifice though its style might be getting a little out of fashion was still as respectable a family residence as that of any gentleman in town
the present owner gervayse pyncheon was said to have contracted a dislike to the house in consequence of a shock to his sensibility in early childhood from the sudden death of his grandfather
in the very act of running to climb colonel pyncheons knee the boy had discovered the old puritan to be a corpse
on arriving at manhood mr pyncheon had visited england where he married a lady of fortune and had subsequently spent many years partly in the mother country and partly in various cities on the continent of europe
during this period the family mansion had been consigned to the charge of a kinsman who was allowed to make it his home for the time being in consideration of keeping the premises in thorough repair
so faithfully had this contract been fulfilled that now as the carpenter approached the house his practised eye could detect nothing to criticise in its condition
the peaks of the seven gables rose up sharply the shingled roof looked thoroughly watertight and the glittering plasterwork entirely covered the exterior walls and sparkled in the october sun as if it had been new only a week ago
the house had that pleasant aspect of life which is like the cheery expression of comfortable activity in the human countenance
you could see at once that there was the stir of a large family within it
a huge load of oakwood was passing through the gateway towards the outbuildings in the rear the fat cookor probably it might be the housekeeperstood at the side door bargaining for some turkeys and poultry which a countryman had brought for sale
now and then a maidservant neatly dressed and now the shining sable face of a slave might be seen bustling across the windows in the lower part of the house
at an open window of a room in the second story hanging over some pots of beautiful and delicate flowersexotics but which had never known a more genial sunshine than that of the new england autumnwas the figure of a young lady an exotic like the flowers and beautiful and delicate as they
her presence imparted an indescribable grace and faint witchery to the whole edifice
in other respects it was a substantial jollylooking mansion and seemed fit to be the residence of a patriarch who might establish his own headquarters in the front gable and assign one of the remainder to each of his six children while the great chimney in the centre should symbolize the old fellows hospitable heart which kept them all warm and made a great whole of the seven smaller ones
there was a vertical sundial on the front gable and as the carpenter passed beneath it he looked up and noted the hour
three oclock said he to himself
my father told me that dial was put up only an hour before the old colonels death
how truly it has kept time these sevenandthirty years past
the shadow creeps and creeps and is always looking over the shoulder of the sunshine  it might have befitted a craftsman like matthew maule on being sent for to a gentlemans house to go to the back door where servants and workpeople were usually admitted or at least to the side entrance where the better class of tradesmen made application
but the carpenter had a great deal of pride and stiffness in his nature and at this moment moreover his heart was bitter with the sense of hereditary wrong because he considered the great pyncheon house to be standing on soil which should have been his own
on this very site beside a spring of delicious water his grandfather had felled the pinetrees and built a cottage in which children had been born to him and it was only from a dead mans stiffened fingers that colonel pyncheon had wrested away the titledeeds
so young maule went straight to the principal entrance beneath a portal of carved oak and gave such a peal of the iron knocker that you would have imagined the stern old wizard himself to be standing at the threshold
black scipio answered the summons in a prodigious hurry but showed the whites of his eyes in amazement on beholding only the carpenter
lordamercy what a great man he be this carpenter fellow mumbled scipio down in his throat
anybody think he beat on the door with his biggest hammer  here i am said maule sternly
show me the way to your masters parlor  as he stept into the house a note of sweet and melancholy music thrilled and vibrated along the passageway proceeding from one of the rooms above stairs
it was the harpsichord which alice pyncheon had brought with her from beyond the sea
the fair alice bestowed most of her maiden leisure between flowers and music although the former were apt to droop and the melodies were often sad
she was of foreign education and could not take kindly to the new england modes of life in which nothing beautiful had ever been developed
as mr pyncheon had been impatiently awaiting maules arrival black scipio of course lost no time in ushering the carpenter into his masters presence
the room in which this gentleman sat was a parlor of moderate size looking out upon the garden of the house and having its windows partly shadowed by the foliage of fruittrees
it was mr pyncheons peculiar apartment and was provided with furniture in an elegant and costly style principally from paris the floor which was unusual at that day being covered with a carpet so skilfully and richly wrought that it seemed to glow as with living flowers
in one corner stood a marble woman to whom her own beauty was the sole and sufficient garment
some picturesthat looked old and had a mellow tinge diffused through all their artful splendorhung on the walls
near the fireplace was a large and very beautiful cabinet of ebony inlaid with ivory a piece of antique furniture which mr pyncheon had bought in venice and which he used as the treasureplace for medals ancient coins and whatever small and valuable curiosities he had picked up on his travels
through all this variety of decoration however the room showed its original characteristics its low stud its crossbeam its chimneypiece with the oldfashioned dutch tiles so that it was the emblem of a mind industriously stored with foreign ideas and elaborated into artificial refinement but neither larger nor in its proper self more elegant than before
there were two objects that appeared rather out of place in this very handsomely furnished room
one was a large map or surveyors plan of a tract of land which looked as if it had been drawn a good many years ago and was now dingy with smoke and soiled here and there with the touch of fingers
the other was a portrait of a stern old man in a puritan garb painted roughly but with a bold effect and a remarkably strong expression of character
at a small table before a fire of english seacoal sat mr pyncheon sipping coffee which had grown to be a very favorite beverage with him in france
he was a middleaged and really handsome man with a wig flowing down upon his shoulders his coat was of blue velvet with lace on the borders and at the buttonholes and the firelight glistened on the spacious breadth of his waistcoat which was flowered all over with gold
on the entrance of scipio ushering in the carpenter mr pyncheon turned partly round but resumed his former position and proceeded deliberately to finish his cup of coffee without immediate notice of the guest whom he had summoned to his presence
it was not that he intended any rudeness or improper neglectwhich indeed he would have blushed to be guilty ofbut it never occurred to him that a person in maules station had a claim on his courtesy or would trouble himself about it one way or the other
the carpenter however stepped at once to the hearth and turned himself about so as to look mr pyncheon in the face
you sent for me said he
be pleased to explain your business that i may go back to my own affairs  ah
excuse me said mr pyncheon quietly
i did not mean to tax your time without a recompense
your name i think is maulethomas or matthew maulea son or grandson of the builder of this house  matthew maule replied the carpenterson of him who built the housegrandson of the rightful proprietor of the soil  i know the dispute to which you allude observed mr pyncheon with undisturbed equanimity
i am well aware that my grandfather was compelled to resort to a suit at law in order to establish his claim to the foundationsite of this edifice
we will not if you please renew the discussion
the matter was settled at the time and by the competent authoritiesequitably it is to be presumedand at all events irrevocably
yet singularly enough there is an incidental reference to this very subject in what i am now about to say to you
and this same inveterate grudgeexcuse me i mean no offencethis irritability which you have just shown is not entirely aside from the matter  if you can find anything for your purpose mr pyncheon said the carpenter in a mans natural resentment for the wrongs done to his blood you are welcome to it  i take you at your word goodman maule said the owner of the seven gables with a smile and will proceed to suggest a mode in which your hereditary resentmentsjustifiable or otherwisemay have had a bearing on my affairs
you have heard i suppose that the pyncheon family ever since my grandfathers days have been prosecuting a still unsettled claim to a very large extent of territory at the eastward  often replied mauleand it is said that a smile came over his facevery oftenfrom my father  this claim continued mr pyncheon after pausing a moment as if to consider what the carpenters smile might mean appeared to be on the very verge of a settlement and full allowance at the period of my grandfathers decease
it was well known to those in his confidence that he anticipated neither difficulty nor delay
now colonel pyncheon i need hardly say was a practical man well acquainted with public and private business and not at all the person to cherish illfounded hopes or to attempt the following out of an impracticable scheme
it is obvious to conclude therefore that he had grounds not apparent to his heirs for his confident anticipation of success in the matter of this eastern claim
in a word i believeand my legal advisers coincide in the belief which moreover is authorized to a certain extent by the family traditionsthat my grandfather was in possession of some deed or other document essential to this claim but which has since disappeared  very likely said matthew mauleand again it is said there was a dark smile on his facebut what can a poor carpenter have to do with the grand affairs of the pyncheon family  perhaps nothing returned mr pyncheon possibly much  here ensued a great many words between matthew maule and the proprietor of the seven gables on the subject which the latter had thus broached
it seems although mr pyncheon had some hesitation in referring to stories so exceedingly absurd in their aspect that the popular belief pointed to some mysterious connection and dependence existing between the family of the maules and these vast unrealized possessions of the pyncheons
it was an ordinary saying that the old wizard hanged though he was had obtained the best end of the bargain in his contest with colonel pyncheon inasmuch as he had got possession of the great eastern claim in exchange for an acre or two of gardenground
a very aged woman recently dead had often used the metaphorical expression in her fireside talk that miles and miles of the pyncheon lands had been shovelled into maules grave which by the bye was but a very shallow nook between two rocks near the summit of gallows hill
again when the lawyers were making inquiry for the missing document it was a byword that it would never be found unless in the wizards skeleton hand
so much weight had the shrewd lawyers assigned to these fables that but mr pyncheon did not see fit to inform the carpenter of the fact they had secretly caused the wizards grave to be searched
nothing was discovered however except that unaccountably the right hand of the skeleton was gone
now what was unquestionably important a portion of these popular rumors could be traced though rather doubtfully and indistinctly to chance words and obscure hints of the executed wizards son and the father of this present matthew maule
and here mr pyncheon could bring an item of his own personal evidence into play
though but a child at the time he either remembered or fancied that matthews father had had some job to perform on the day before or possibly the very morning of the colonels decease in the private room where he and the carpenter were at this moment talking
certain papers belonging to colonel pyncheon as his grandson distinctly recollected had been spread out on the table
matthew maule understood the insinuated suspicion
my father he saidbut still there was that dark smile making a riddle of his countenancemy father was an honester man than the bloody old colonel
not to get his rights back again would he have carried off one of those papers  i shall not bandy words with you observed the foreignbred mr pyncheon with haughty composure
nor will it become me to resent any rudeness towards either my grandfather or myself
a gentleman before seeking intercourse with a person of your station and habits will first consider whether the urgency of the end may compensate for the disagreeableness of the means
it does so in the present instance  he then renewed the conversation and made great pecuniary offers to the carpenter in case the latter should give information leading to the discovery of the lost document and the consequent success of the eastern claim
for a long time matthew maule is said to have turned a cold ear to these propositions
at last however with a strange kind of laugh he inquired whether mr pyncheon would make over to him the old wizards homesteadground together with the house of the seven gables now standing on it in requital of the documentary evidence so urgently required
the wild chimneycorner legend which without copying all its extravagances my narrative essentially follows here gives an account of some very strange behavior on the part of colonel pyncheons portrait
this picture it must be understood was supposed to be so intimately connected with the fate of the house and so magically built into its walls that if once it should be removed that very instant the whole edifice would come thundering down in a heap of dusty ruin
all through the foregoing conversation between mr pyncheon and the carpenter the portrait had been frowning clenching its fist and giving many such proofs of excessive discomposure but without attracting the notice of either of the two colloquists
and finally at matthew maules audacious suggestion of a transfer of the sevengabled structure the ghostly portrait is averred to have lost all patience and to have shown itself on the point of descending bodily from its frame
but such incredible incidents are merely to be mentioned aside
give up this house exclaimed mr pyncheon in amazement at the proposal
were i to do so my grandfather would not rest quiet in his grave  he never has if all stories are true remarked the carpenter composedly
but that matter concerns his grandson more than it does matthew maule
i have no other terms to propose  impossible as he at first thought it to comply with maules conditions still on a second glance mr pyncheon was of opinion that they might at least be made matter of discussion
he himself had no personal attachment for the house nor any pleasant associations connected with his childish residence in it
on the contrary after sevenandthirty years the presence of his dead grandfather seemed still to pervade it as on that morning when the affrighted boy had beheld him with so ghastly an aspect stiffening in his chair
his long abode in foreign parts moreover and familiarity with many of the castles and ancestral halls of england and the marble palaces of italy had caused him to look contemptuously at the house of the seven gables whether in point of splendor or convenience
it was a mansion exceedingly inadequate to the style of living which it would be incumbent on mr pyncheon to support after realizing his territorial rights
his steward might deign to occupy it but never certainly the great landed proprietor himself
in the event of success indeed it was his purpose to return to england nor to say the truth would he recently have quitted that more congenial home had not his own fortune as well as his deceased wifes begun to give symptoms of exhaustion
the eastern claim once fairly settled and put upon the firm basis of actual possession mr pyncheons propertyto be measured by miles not acreswould be worth an earldom and would reasonably entitle him to solicit or enable him to purchase that elevated dignity from the british monarch
lord pyncheonor the earl of waldohow could such a magnate be expected to contract his grandeur within the pitiful compass of seven shingled gables
in short on an enlarged view of the business the carpenters terms appeared so ridiculously easy that mr pyncheon could scarcely forbear laughing in his face
he was quite ashamed after the foregoing reflections to propose any diminution of so moderate a recompense for the immense service to be rendered
i consent to your proposition maule cried he
put me in possession of the document essential to establish my rights and the house of the seven gables is your own  according to some versions of the story a regular contract to the above effect was drawn up by a lawyer and signed and sealed in the presence of witnesses
others say that matthew maule was contented with a private written agreement in which mr pyncheon pledged his honor and integrity to the fulfillment of the terms concluded upon
the gentleman then ordered wine which he and the carpenter drank together in confirmation of their bargain
during the whole preceding discussion and subsequent formalities the old puritans portrait seems to have persisted in its shadowy gestures of disapproval but without effect except that as mr pyncheon set down the emptied glass he thought he beheld his grandfather frown
this sherry is too potent a wine for me it has affected my brain already he observed after a somewhat startled look at the picture
on returning to europe i shall confine myself to the more delicate vintages of italy and france the best of which will not bear transportation  my lord pyncheon may drink what wine he will and wherever he pleases replied the carpenter as if he had been privy to mr pyncheons ambitious projects
but first sir if you desire tidings of this lost document i must crave the favor of a little talk with your fair daughter alice  you are mad maule exclaimed mr pyncheon haughtily and now at last there was anger mixed up with his pride
what can my daughter have to do with a business like this  indeed at this new demand on the carpenters part the proprietor of the seven gables was even more thunderstruck than at the cool proposition to surrender his house
there was at least an assignable motive for the first stipulation there appeared to be none whatever for the last
nevertheless matthew maule sturdily insisted on the young lady being summoned and even gave her father to understand in a mysterious kind of explanationwhich made the matter considerably darker than it looked beforethat the only chance of acquiring the requisite knowledge was through the clear crystal medium of a pure and virgin intelligence like that of the fair alice
not to encumber our story with mr pyncheons scruples whether of conscience pride or fatherly affection he at length ordered his daughter to be called
he well knew that she was in her chamber and engaged in no occupation that could not readily be laid aside for as it happened ever since alices name had been spoken both her father and the carpenter had heard the sad and sweet music of her harpsichord and the airier melancholy of her accompanying voice
so alice pyncheon was summoned and appeared
a portrait of this young lady painted by a venetian artist and left by her father in england is said to have fallen into the hands of the present duke of devonshire and to be now preserved at chatsworth not on account of any associations with the original but for its value as a picture and the high character of beauty in the countenance
if ever there was a lady born and set apart from the worlds vulgar mass by a certain gentle and cold stateliness it was this very alice pyncheon
yet there was the womanly mixture in her the tenderness or at least the tender capabilities
for the sake of that redeeming quality a man of generous nature would have forgiven all her pride and have been content almost to lie down in her path and let alice set her slender foot upon his heart
all that he would have required was simply the acknowledgment that he was indeed a man and a fellowbeing moulded of the same elements as she
as alice came into the room her eyes fell upon the carpenter who was standing near its centre clad in green woollen jacket a pair of loose breeches open at the knees and with a long pocket for his rule the end of which protruded it was as proper a mark of the artisans calling as mr pyncheons fulldress sword of that gentlemans aristocratic pretensions
a glow of artistic approval brightened over alice pyncheons face she was struck with admirationwhich she made no attempt to concealof the remarkable comeliness strength and energy of maules figure
but that admiring glance which most other men perhaps would have cherished as a sweet recollection all through life the carpenter never forgave
it must have been the devil himself that made maule so subtile in his preception
does the girl look at me as if i were a brute beast thought he setting his teeth
she shall know whether i have a human spirit and the worse for her if it prove stronger than her own  my father you sent for me said alice in her sweet and harplike voice
but if you have business with this young man pray let me go again
you know i do not love this room in spite of that claude with which you try to bring back sunny recollections  stay a moment young lady if you please said matthew maule
my business with your father is over
with yourself it is now to begin  alice looked towards her father in surprise and inquiry
yes alice said mr pyncheon with some disturbance and confusion
this young manhis name is matthew mauleprofesses so far as i can understand him to be able to discover through your means a certain paper or parchment which was missing long before your birth
the importance of the document in question renders it advisable to neglect no possible even if improbable method of regaining it
you will therefore oblige me my dear alice by answering this persons inquiries and complying with his lawful and reasonable requests so far as they may appear to have the aforesaid object in view
as i shall remain in the room you need apprehend no rude nor unbecoming deportment on the young mans part and at your slightest wish of course the investigation or whatever we may call it shall immediately be broken off  mistress alice pyncheon remarked matthew maule with the utmost deference but yet a halfhidden sarcasm in his look and tone will no doubt feel herself quite safe in her fathers presence and under his allsufficient protection  i certainly shall entertain no manner of apprehension with my father at hand said alice with maidenly dignity
neither do i conceive that a lady while true to herself can have aught to fear from whomsoever or in any circumstances  poor alice
by what unhappy impulse did she thus put herself at once on terms of defiance against a strength which she could not estimate
then mistress alice said matthew maule handing a chairgracefully enough for a craftsman will it please you only to sit down and do me the favor though altogether beyond a poor carpenters deserts to fix your eyes on mine  alice complied she was very proud
setting aside all advantages of rank this fair girl deemed herself conscious of a powercombined of beauty high unsullied purity and the preservative force of womanhoodthat could make her sphere impenetrable unless betrayed by treachery within
she instinctively knew it may be that some sinister or evil potency was now striving to pass her barriers nor would she decline the contest
so alice put womans might against mans might a match not often equal on the part of woman
her father meanwhile had turned away and seemed absorbed in the contemplation of a landscape by claude where a shadowy and sunstreaked vista penetrated so remotely into an ancient wood that it would have been no wonder if his fancy had lost itself in the pictures bewildering depths
but in truth the picture was no more to him at that moment than the blank wall against which it hung
his mind was haunted with the many and strange tales which he had heard attributing mysterious if not supernatural endowments to these maules as well the grandson here present as his two immediate ancestors
mr pyncheons long residence abroad and intercourse with men of wit and fashioncourtiers worldlings and freethinkershad done much towards obliterating the grim puritan superstitions which no man of new england birth at that early period could entirely escape
but on the other hand had not a whole community believed maules grandfather to be a wizard
had not the crime been proved
had not the wizard died for it
had he not bequeathed a legacy of hatred against the pyncheons to this only grandson who as it appeared was now about to exercise a subtle influence over the daughter of his enemys house
might not this influence be the same that was called witchcraft
turning half around he caught a glimpse of maules figure in the lookingglass
at some paces from alice with his arms uplifted in the air the carpenter made a gesture as if directing downward a slow ponderous and invisible weight upon the maiden
stay maule exclaimed mr pyncheon stepping forward
i forbid your proceeding further  pray my dear father do not interrupt the young man said alice without changing her position
his efforts i assure you will prove very harmless  again mr pyncheon turned his eyes towards the claude
it was then his daughters will in opposition to his own that the experiment should be fully tried
henceforth therefore he did but consent not urge it
and was it not for her sake far more than for his own that he desired its success
that lost parchment once restored the beautiful alice pyncheon with the rich dowry which he could then bestow might wed an english duke or a german reigningprince instead of some new england clergyman or lawyer
at the thought the ambitious father almost consented in his heart that if the devils power were needed to the accomplishment of this great object maule might evoke him
alices own purity would be her safeguard
with his mind full of imaginary magnificence mr pyncheon heard a halfuttered exclamation from his daughter
it was very faint and low so indistinct that there seemed but half a will to shape out the words and too undefined a purport to be intelligible
yet it was a call for helphis conscience never doubted itand little more than a whisper to his ear it was a dismal shriek and long reechoed so in the region round his heart
but this time the father did not turn
after a further interval maule spoke
behold your daughter said he
mr pyncheon came hastily forward
the carpenter was standing erect in front of alices chair and pointing his finger towards the maiden with an expression of triumphant power the limits of which could not be defined as indeed its scope stretched vaguely towards the unseen and the infinite
alice sat in an attitude of profound repose with the long brown lashes drooping over her eyes
there she is said the carpenter
speak to her  alice
my daughter exclaimed mr pyncheon
my own alice  she did not stir
louder said maule smiling
alice
awake cried her father
it troubles me to see you thus
awake  he spoke loudly with terror in his voice and close to that delicate ear which had always been so sensitive to every discord
but the sound evidently reached her not
it is indescribable what a sense of remote dim unattainable distance betwixt himself and alice was impressed on the father by this impossibility of reaching her with his voice
best touch her said matthew maule shake the girl and roughly too
my hands are hardened with too much use of axe saw and planeelse i might help you  mr pyncheon took her hand and pressed it with the earnestness of startled emotion
he kissed her with so great a heartthrob in the kiss that he thought she must needs feel it
then in a gust of anger at her insensibility he shook her maiden form with a violence which the next moment it affrighted him to remember
he withdrew his encircling arms and alicewhose figure though flexible had been wholly impassiverelapsed into the same attitude as before these attempts to arouse her
maule having shifted his position her face was turned towards him slightly but with what seemed to be a reference of her very slumber to his guidance
then it was a strange sight to behold how the man of conventionalities shook the powder out of his periwig how the reserved and stately gentleman forgot his dignity how the goldembroidered waistcoat flickered and glistened in the firelight with the convulsion of rage terror and sorrow in the human heart that was beating under it
villain cried mr pyncheon shaking his clenched fist at maule
you and the fiend together have robbed me of my daughter
give her back spawn of the old wizard or you shall climb gallows hill in your grandfathers footsteps  softly mr pyncheon said the carpenter with scornful composure
softly an it please your worship else you will spoil those rich laceruffles at your wrists
is it my crime if you have sold your daughter for the mere hope of getting a sheet of yellow parchment into your clutch
there sits mistress alice quietly asleep
now let matthew maule try whether she be as proud as the carpenter found her awhile since  he spoke and alice responded with a soft subdued inward acquiescence and a bending of her form towards him like the flame of a torch when it indicates a gentle draught of air
he beckoned with his hand and rising from her chairblindly but undoubtingly as tending to her sure and inevitable centrethe proud alice approached him
he waved her back and retreating alice sank again into her seat
she is mine said matthew maule
mine by the right of the strongest spirit  in the further progress of the legend there is a long grotesque and occasionally awestriking account of the carpenters incantations if so they are to be called with a view of discovering the lost document
it appears to have been his object to convert the mind of alice into a kind of telescopic medium through which mr pyncheon and himself might obtain a glimpse into the spiritual world
he succeeded accordingly in holding an imperfect sort of intercourse at one remove with the departed personages in whose custody the so much valued secret had been carried beyond the precincts of earth
during her trance alice described three figures as being present to her spiritualized perception
one was an aged dignified sternlooking gentleman clad as for a solemn festival in grave and costly attire but with a great bloodstain on his richly wrought band the second an aged man meanly dressed with a dark and malign countenance and a broken halter about his neck the third a person not so advanced in life as the former two but beyond the middle age wearing a coarse woollen tunic and leather breeches and with a carpenters rule sticking out of his side pocket
these three visionary characters possessed a mutual knowledge of the missing document
one of them in truthit was he with the bloodstain on his bandseemed unless his gestures were misunderstood to hold the parchment in his immediate keeping but was prevented by his two partners in the mystery from disburdening himself of the trust
finally when he showed a purpose of shouting forth the secret loudly enough to be heard from his own sphere into that of mortals his companions struggled with him and pressed their hands over his mouth and forthwithwhether that he were choked by it or that the secret itself was of a crimson huethere was a fresh flow of blood upon his band
upon this the two meanly dressed figures mocked and jeered at the muchabashed old dignitary and pointed their fingers at the stain
at this juncture maule turned to mr pyncheon
it will never be allowed said he
the custody of this secret that would so enrich his heirs makes part of your grandfathers retribution
he must choke with it until it is no longer of any value
and keep you the house of the seven gables
it is too dear bought an inheritance and too heavy with the curse upon it to be shifted yet awhile from the colonels posterity  mr pyncheon tried to speak butwhat with fear and passioncould make only a gurgling murmur in his throat
the carpenter smiled
aha worshipful sirso you have old maules blood to drink said he jeeringly
fiend in mans shape
why dost thou keep dominion over my child cried mr pyncheon when his choked utterance could make way
give me back my daughter
then go thy ways and may we never meet again  your daughter said matthew maule
why she is fairly mine
nevertheless not to be too hard with fair mistress alice i will leave her in your keeping but i do not warrant you that she shall never have occasion to remember maule the carpenter  he waved his hands with an upward motion and after a few repetitions of similar gestures the beautiful alice pyncheon awoke from her strange trance
she awoke without the slightest recollection of her visionary experience but as one losing herself in a momentary reverie and returning to the consciousness of actual life in almost as brief an interval as the downsinking flame of the hearth should quiver again up the chimney
on recognizing matthew maule she assumed an air of somewhat cold but gentle dignity the rather as there was a certain peculiar smile on the carpenters visage that stirred the native pride of the fair alice
so ended for that time the quest for the lost titledeed of the pyncheon territory at the eastward nor though often subsequently renewed has it ever yet befallen a pyncheon to set his eye upon that parchment
but alas for the beautiful the gentle yet too haughty alice
a power that she little dreamed of had laid its grasp upon her maiden soul
a will most unlike her own constrained her to do its grotesque and fantastic bidding
her father as it proved had martyred his poor child to an inordinate desire for measuring his land by miles instead of acres
and therefore while alice pyncheon lived she was maules slave in a bondage more humiliating a thousandfold than that which binds its chain around the body
seated by his humble fireside maule had but to wave his hand and wherever the proud lady chanced to bewhether in her chamber or entertaining her fathers stately guests or worshipping at churchwhatever her place or occupation her spirit passed from beneath her own control and bowed itself to maule
alice laughthe carpenter beside his hearth would say or perhaps intensely will it without a spoken word
and even were it prayertime or at a funeral alice must break into wild laughter
alice be sadand at the instant down would come her tears quenching all the mirth of those around her like sudden rain upon a bonfire
alice danceand dance she would not in such courtlike measures as she had learned abroad but some highpaced jig or hopskip rigadoon befitting the brisk lasses at a rustic merrymaking
it seemed to be maules impulse not to ruin alice nor to visit her with any black or gigantic mischief which would have crowned her sorrows with the grace of tragedy but to wreak a low ungenerous scorn upon her
thus all the dignity of life was lost
she felt herself too much abased and longed to change natures with some worm
one evening at a bridal party but not her own for so lost from selfcontrol she would have deemed it sin to marry poor alice was beckoned forth by her unseen despot and constrained in her gossamer white dress and satin slippers to hasten along the street to the mean dwelling of a laboringman
there was laughter and good cheer within for matthew maule that night was to wed the laborers daughter and had summoned proud alice pyncheon to wait upon his bride
and so she did and when the twain were one alice awoke out of her enchanted sleep
yet no longer proudhumbly and with a smile all steeped in sadnessshe kissed maules wife and went her way
it was an inclement night the southeast wind drove the mingled snow and rain into her thinly sheltered bosom her satin slippers were wet through and through as she trod the muddy sidewalks
the next day a cold soon a settled cough anon a hectic cheek a wasted form that sat beside the harpsichord and filled the house with music
music in which a strain of the heavenly choristers was echoed
oh joy
for alice had borne her last humiliation
oh greater joy
for alice was penitent of her one earthly sin and proud no more
the pyncheons made a great funeral for alice
the kith and kin were there and the whole respectability of the town besides
but last in the procession came matthew maule gnashing his teeth as if he would have bitten his own heart in twainthe darkest and wofullest man that ever walked behind a corpse
he meant to humble alice not to kill her but he had taken a womans delicate soul into his rude gripe to play withand she was dead
xiv
phbes goodbye   holgrave plunging into his tale with the energy and absorption natural to a young author had given a good deal of action to the parts capable of being developed and exemplified in that manner
he now observed that a certain remarkable drowsiness wholly unlike that with which the reader possibly feels himself affected had been flung over the senses of his auditress
it was the effect unquestionably of the mystic gesticulations by which he had sought to bring bodily before phbes perception the figure of the mesmerizing carpenter
with the lids drooping over her eyesnow lifted for an instant and drawn down again as with leaden weightsshe leaned slightly towards him and seemed almost to regulate her breath by his
holgrave gazed at her as he rolled up his manuscript and recognized an incipient stage of that curious psychological condition which as he had himself told phbe he possessed more than an ordinary faculty of producing
a veil was beginning to be muffled about her in which she could behold only him and live only in his thoughts and emotions
his glance as he fastened it on the young girl grew involuntarily more concentrated in his attitude there was the consciousness of power investing his hardly mature figure with a dignity that did not belong to its physical manifestation
it was evident that with but one wave of his hand and a corresponding effort of his will he could complete his mastery over phbes yet free and virgin spirit he could establish an influence over this good pure and simple child as dangerous and perhaps as disastrous as that which the carpenter of his legend had acquired and exercised over the illfated alice
to a disposition like holgraves at once speculative and active there is no temptation so great as the opportunity of acquiring empire over the human spirit nor any idea more seductive to a young man than to become the arbiter of a young girls destiny
let us thereforewhatever his defects of nature and education and in spite of his scorn for creeds and institutionsconcede to the daguerreotypist the rare and high quality of reverence for anothers individuality
let us allow him integrity also forever after to be confided in since he forbade himself to twine that one link more which might have rendered his spell over phbe indissoluble
he made a slight gesture upward with his hand
you really mortify me my dear miss phbe he exclaimed smiling halfsarcastically at her
my poor story it is but too evident will never do for godey or graham
only think of your falling asleep at what i hoped the newspaper critics would pronounce a most brilliant powerful imaginative pathetic and original winding up
well the manuscript must serve to light lamps withif indeed being so imbued with my gentle dulness it is any longer capable of flame  me asleep
how can you say so answered phbe as unconscious of the crisis through which she had passed as an infant of the precipice to the verge of which it has rolled
no no
i consider myself as having been very attentive and though i dont remember the incidents quite distinctly yet i have an impression of a vast deal of trouble and calamityso no doubt the story will prove exceedingly attractive  by this time the sun had gone down and was tinting the clouds towards the zenith with those bright hues which are not seen there until some time after sunset and when the horizon has quite lost its richer brilliancy
the moon too which had long been climbing overhead and unobtrusively melting its disk into the azurelike an ambitious demagogue who hides his aspiring purpose by assuming the prevalent hue of popular sentimentnow began to shine out broad and oval in its middle pathway
these silvery beams were already powerful enough to change the character of the lingering daylight
they softened and embellished the aspect of the old house although the shadows fell deeper into the angles of its many gables and lay brooding under the projecting story and within the halfopen door
with the lapse of every moment the garden grew more picturesque the fruittrees shrubbery and flowerbushes had a dark obscurity among them
the commonplace characteristicswhich at noontide it seemed to have taken a century of sordid life to accumulatewere now transfigured by a charm of romance
a hundred mysterious years were whispering among the leaves whenever the slight seabreeze found its way thither and stirred them
through the foliage that roofed the little summerhouse the moonlight flickered to and fro and fell silvery white on the dark floor the table and the circular bench with a continual shift and play according as the chinks and wayward crevices among the twigs admitted or shut out the glimmer
so sweetly cool was the atmosphere after all the feverish day that the summer eve might be fancied as sprinkling dews and liquid moonlight with a dash of icy temper in them out of a silver vase
here and there a few drops of this freshness were scattered on a human heart and gave it youth again and sympathy with the eternal youth of nature
the artist chanced to be one on whom the reviving influence fell
it made him feelwhat he sometimes almost forgot thrust so early as he had been into the rude struggle of man with manhow youthful he still was
it seems to me he observed that i never watched the coming of so beautiful an eve and never felt anything so very much like happiness as at this moment
after all what a good world we live in
how good and beautiful
how young it is too with nothing really rotten or ageworn in it
this old house for example which sometimes has positively oppressed my breath with its smell of decaying timber
and this garden where the black mould always clings to my spade as if i were a sexton delving in a graveyard
could i keep the feeling that now possesses me the garden would every day be virgin soil with the earths first freshness in the flavor of its beans and squashes and the houseit would be like a bower in eden blossoming with the earliest roses that god ever made
moonlight and the sentiment in mans heart responsive to it are the greatest of renovators and reformers
and all other reform and renovation i suppose will prove to be no better than moonshine  i have been happier than i am now at least much gayer said phbe thoughtfully
yet i am sensible of a great charm in this brightening moonlight and i love to watch how the day tired as it is lags away reluctantly and hates to be called yesterday so soon
i never cared much about moonlight before
what is there i wonder so beautiful in it tonight  and you have never felt it before inquired the artist looking earnestly at the girl through the twilight
never answered phbe and life does not look the same now that i have felt it so
it seems as if i had looked at everything hitherto in broad daylight or else in the ruddy light of a cheerful fire glimmering and dancing through a room
ah poor me she added with a halfmelancholy laugh
i shall never be so merry as before i knew cousin hepzibah and poor cousin clifford
i have grown a great deal older in this little time
older and i hope wiser andnot exactly sadderbut certainly with not half so much lightness in my spirits
i have given them my sunshine and have been glad to give it but of course i cannot both give and keep it
they are welcome notwithstanding  you have lost nothing phbe worth keeping nor which it was possible to keep said holgrave after a pause
our first youth is of no value for we are never conscious of it until after it is gone
but sometimesalways i suspect unless one is exceedingly unfortunatethere comes a sense of second youth gushing out of the hearts joy at being in love or possibly it may come to crown some other grand festival in life if any other such there be
this bemoaning of ones self as you do now over the first careless shallow gayety of youth departed and this profound happiness at youth regainedso much deeper and richer than that we lostare essential to the souls development
in some cases the two states come almost simultaneously and mingle the sadness and the rapture in one mysterious emotion  i hardly think i understand you said phbe
no wonder replied holgrave smiling for i have told you a secret which i hardly began to know before i found myself giving it utterance
remember it however and when the truth becomes clear to you then think of this moonlight scene  it is entirely moonlight now except only a little flush of faint crimson upward from the west between those buildings remarked phbe
i must go in
cousin hepzibah is not quick at figures and will give herself a headache over the days accounts unless i help her  but holgrave detained her a little longer
miss hepzibah tells me observed he that you return to the country in a few days  yes but only for a little while answered phbe for i look upon this as my present home
i go to make a few arrangements and to take a more deliberate leave of my mother and friends
it is pleasant to live where one is much desired and very useful and i think i may have the satisfaction of feeling myself so here  you surely may and more than you imagine said the artist
whatever health comfort and natural life exists in the house is embodied in your person
these blessings came along with you and will vanish when you leave the threshold
miss hepzibah by secluding herself from society has lost all true relation with it and is in fact dead although she galvanizes herself into a semblance of life and stands behind her counter afflicting the world with a greatlytobedeprecated scowl
your poor cousin clifford is another dead and longburied person on whom the governor and council have wrought a necromantic miracle
i should not wonder if he were to crumble away some morning after you are gone and nothing be seen of him more except a heap of dust
miss hepzibah at any rate will lose what little flexibility she has
they both exist by you  i should be very sorry to think so answered phbe gravely
but it is true that my small abilities were precisely what they needed and i have a real interest in their welfarean odd kind of motherly sentimentwhich i wish you would not laugh at
and let me tell you frankly mr holgrave i am sometimes puzzled to know whether you wish them well or ill  undoubtedly said the daguerreotypist i do feel an interest in this antiquated povertystricken old maiden lady and this degraded and shattered gentlemanthis abortive lover of the beautiful
a kindly interest too helpless old children that they are
but you have no conception what a different kind of heart mine is from your own
it is not my impulse as regards these two individuals either to help or hinder but to look on to analyze to explain matters to myself and to comprehend the drama which for almost two hundred years has been dragging its slow length over the ground where you and i now tread
if permitted to witness the close i doubt not to derive a moral satisfaction from it go matters how they may
there is a conviction within me that the end draws nigh
but though providence sent you hither to help and sends me only as a privileged and meet spectator i pledge myself to lend these unfortunate beings whatever aid i can  i wish you would speak more plainly cried phbe perplexed and displeased and above all that you would feel more like a christian and a human being
how is it possible to see people in distress without desiring more than anything else to help and comfort them
you talk as if this old house were a theatre and you seem to look at hepzibahs and cliffords misfortunes and those of generations before them as a tragedy such as i have seen acted in the hall of a country hotel only the present one appears to be played exclusively for your amusement
i do not like this
the play costs the performers too much and the audience is too coldhearted  you are severe said holgrave compelled to recognize a degree of truth in the piquant sketch of his own mood
and then continued phbe what can you mean by your conviction which you tell me of that the end is drawing near
do you know of any new trouble hanging over my poor relatives
if so tell me at once and i will not leave them  forgive me phbe said the daguerreotypist holding out his hand to which the girl was constrained to yield her own
i am somewhat of a mystic it must be confessed
the tendency is in my blood together with the faculty of mesmerism which might have brought me to gallows hill in the good old times of witchcraft
believe me if i were really aware of any secret the disclosure of which would benefit your friendswho are my own friends likewiseyou should learn it before we part
but i have no such knowledge  you hold something back said phbe
nothingno secrets but my own answered holgrave
i can perceive indeed that judge pyncheon still keeps his eye on clifford in whose ruin he had so large a share
his motives and intentions however are a mystery to me
he is a determined and relentless man with the genuine character of an inquisitor and had he any object to gain by putting clifford to the rack i verily believe that he would wrench his joints from their sockets in order to accomplish it
but so wealthy and eminent as he isso powerful in his own strength and in the support of society on all sideswhat can judge pyncheon have to hope or fear from the imbecile branded halftorpid clifford  yet urged phbe you did speak as if misfortune were impending  oh that was because i am morbid replied the artist
my mind has a twist aside like almost everybodys mind except your own
moreover it is so strange to find myself an inmate of this old pyncheon house and sitting in this old gardenhark how maules well is murmuring
that were it only for this one circumstance i cannot help fancying that destiny is arranging its fifth act for a catastrophe  there cried phbe with renewed vexation for she was by nature as hostile to mystery as the sunshine to a dark corner
you puzzle me more than ever  then let us part friends said holgrave pressing her hand
or if not friends let us part before you entirely hate me
you who love everybody else in the world  goodby then said phbe frankly
i do not mean to be angry a great while and should be sorry to have you think so
there has cousin hepzibah been standing in the shadow of the doorway this quarter of an hour past
she thinks i stay too long in the damp garden
so goodnight and goodby  on the second morning thereafter phbe might have been seen in her straw bonnet with a shawl on one arm and a little carpetbag on the other bidding adieu to hepzibah and cousin clifford
she was to take a seat in the next train of cars which would transport her to within half a dozen miles of her country village
the tears were in phbes eyes a smile dewy with affectionate regret was glimmering around her pleasant mouth
she wondered how it came to pass that her life of a few weeks here in this heavyhearted old mansion had taken such hold of her and so melted into her associations as now to seem a more important centrepoint of remembrance than all which had gone before
how had hepzibahgrim silent and irresponsive to her overflow of cordial sentimentcontrived to win so much love
and cliffordin his abortive decay with the mystery of fearful crime upon him and the close prisonatmosphere yet lurking in his breathhow had he transformed himself into the simplest child whom phbe felt bound to watch over and be as it were the providence of his unconsidered hours
everything at that instant of farewell stood out prominently to her view
look where she would lay her hand on what she might the object responded to her consciousness as if a moist human heart were in it
she peeped from the window into the garden and felt herself more regretful at leaving this spot of black earth vitiated with such an agelong growth of weeds than joyful at the idea of again scenting her pine forests and fresh cloverfields
she called chanticleer his two wives and the venerable chicken and threw them some crumbs of bread from the breakfasttable
these being hastily gobbled up the chicken spread its wings and alighted close by phbe on the windowsill where it looked gravely into her face and vented its emotions in a croak
phbe bade it be a good old chicken during her absence and promised to bring it a little bag of buckwheat
ah phbe remarked hepzibah you do not smile so naturally as when you came to us
then the smile chose to shine out now you choose it should
it is well that you are going back for a little while into your native air
there has been too much weight on your spirits
the house is too gloomy and lonesome the shop is full of vexations and as for me i have no faculty of making things look brighter than they are
dear clifford has been your only comfort  come hither phbe suddenly cried her cousin clifford who had said very little all the morning
closecloserand look me in the face  phbe put one of her small hands on each elbow of his chair and leaned her face towards him so that he might peruse it as carefully as he would
it is probable that the latent emotions of this parting hour had revived in some degree his bedimmed and enfeebled faculties
at any rate phbe soon felt that if not the profound insight of a seer yet a more than feminine delicacy of appreciation was making her heart the subject of its regard
a moment before she had known nothing which she would have sought to hide
now as if some secret were hinted to her own consciousness through the medium of anothers perception she was fain to let her eyelids droop beneath cliffords gaze
a blush toothe redder because she strove hard to keep it downascended bigger and higher in a tide of fitful progress until even her brow was all suffused with it
it is enough phbe said clifford with a melancholy smile
when i first saw you you were the prettiest little maiden in the world and now you have deepened into beauty
girlhood has passed into womanhood the bud is a bloom
go nowi feel lonelier than i did  phbe took leave of the desolate couple and passed through the shop twinkling her eyelids to shake off a dewdrop forconsidering how brief her absence was to be and therefore the folly of being cast down about itshe would not so far acknowledge her tears as to dry them with her handkerchief
on the doorstep she met the little urchin whose marvellous feats of gastronomy have been recorded in the earlier pages of our narrative
she took from the window some specimen or other of natural historyher eyes being too dim with moisture to inform her accurately whether it was a rabbit or a hippopotamusput it into the childs hand as a parting gift and went her way
old uncle venner was just coming out of his door with a woodhorse and saw on his shoulder and trudging along the street he scrupled not to keep company with phbe so far as their paths lay together nor in spite of his patched coat and rusty beaver and the curious fashion of his towcloth trousers could she find it in her heart to outwalk him
we shall miss you next sabbath afternoon observed the street philosopher
it is unaccountable how little while it takes some folks to grow just as natural to a man as his own breath and begging your pardon miss phbe though there can be no offence in an old mans saying it thats just what youve grown to me
my years have been a great many and your life is but just beginning and yet you are somehow as familiar to me as if i had found you at my mothers door and you had blossomed like a running vine all along my pathway since
come back soon or i shall be gone to my farm for i begin to find these woodsawing jobs a little too tough for my backache  very soon uncle venner replied phbe
and let it be all the sooner phbe for the sake of those poor souls yonder continued her companion
they can never do without you nownever phbe neverno more than if one of gods angels had been living with them and making their dismal house pleasant and comfortable
dont it seem to you theyd be in a sad case if some pleasant summer morning like this the angel should spread his wings and fly to the place he came from
well just so they feel now that youre going home by the railroad
they cant bear it miss phbe so be sure to come back  i am no angel uncle venner said phbe smiling as she offered him her hand at the streetcorner
but i suppose people never feel so much like angels as when they are doing what little good they may
so i shall certainly come back  thus parted the old man and the rosy girl and phbe took the wings of the morning and was soon flitting almost as rapidly away as if endowed with the aerial locomotion of the angels to whom uncle venner had so graciously compared her
xv
the scowl and smile   several days passed over the seven gables heavily and drearily enough
in fact not to attribute the whole gloom of sky and earth to the one inauspicious circumstance of phbes departure an easterly storm had set in and indefatigably apply itself to the task of making the black roof and walls of the old house look more cheerless than ever before
yet was the outside not half so cheerless as the interior
poor clifford was cut off at once from all his scanty resources of enjoyment
phbe was not there nor did the sunshine fall upon the floor
the garden with its muddy walks and the chill dripping foliage of its summerhouse was an image to be shuddered at
nothing flourished in the cold moist pitiless atmosphere drifting with the brackish scud of seabreezes except the moss along the joints of the shingleroof and the great bunch of weeds that had lately been suffering from drought in the angle between the two front gables
as for hepzibah she seemed not merely possessed with the east wind but to be in her very person only another phase of this gray and sullen spell of weather the eastwind itself grim and disconsolate in a rusty black silk gown and with a turban of cloudwreaths on its head
the custom of the shop fell off because a story got abroad that she soured her small beer and other damageable commodities by scowling on them
it is perhaps true that the public had something reasonably to complain of in her deportment but towards clifford she was neither illtempered nor unkind nor felt less warmth of heart than always had it been possible to make it reach him
the inutility of her best efforts however palsied the poor old gentlewoman
she could do little else than sit silently in a corner of the room when the wet peartree branches sweeping across the small windows created a noonday dusk which hepzibah unconsciously darkened with her woebegone aspect
it was no fault of hepzibahs
everythingeven the old chairs and tables that had known what weather was for three or four such lifetimes as her ownlooked as damp and chill as if the present were their worst experience
the picture of the puritan colonel shivered on the wall
the house itself shivered from every attic of its seven gables down to the great kitchen fireplace which served all the better as an emblem of the mansions heart because though built for warmth it was now so comfortless and empty
hepzibah attempted to enliven matters by a fire in the parlor
but the storm demon kept watch above and whenever a flame was kindled drove the smoke back again choking the chimneys sooty throat with its own breath
nevertheless during four days of this miserable storm clifford wrapt himself in an old cloak and occupied his customary chair
on the morning of the fifth when summoned to breakfast he responded only by a brokenhearted murmur expressive of a determination not to leave his bed
his sister made no attempt to change his purpose
in fact entirely as she loved him hepzibah could hardly have borne any longer the wretched dutyso impracticable by her few and rigid facultiesof seeking pastime for a still sensitive but ruined mind critical and fastidious without force or volition
it was at least something short of positive despair that today she might sit shivering alone and not suffer continually a new grief and unreasonable pang of remorse at every fitful sigh of her fellow sufferer
but clifford it seemed though he did not make his appearance below stairs had after all bestirred himself in quest of amusement
in the course of the forenoon hepzibah heard a note of music which there being no other tuneful contrivance in the house of the seven gables she knew must proceed from alice pyncheons harpsichord
she was aware that clifford in his youth had possessed a cultivated taste for music and a considerable degree of skill in its practice
it was difficult however to conceive of his retaining an accomplishment to which daily exercise is so essential in the measure indicated by the sweet airy and delicate though most melancholy strain that now stole upon her ear
nor was it less marvellous that the longsilent instrument should be capable of so much melody
hepzibah involuntarily thought of the ghostly harmonies prelusive of death in the family which were attributed to the legendary alice
but it was perhaps proof of the agency of other than spiritual fingers that after a few touches the chords seemed to snap asunder with their own vibrations and the music ceased
but a harsher sound succeeded to the mysterious notes nor was the easterly day fated to pass without an event sufficient in itself to poison for hepzibah and clifford the balmiest air that ever brought the hummingbirds along with it
the final echoes of alice pyncheons performance or cliffords if his we must consider it were driven away by no less vulgar a dissonance than the ringing of the shopbell
a foot was heard scraping itself on the threshold and thence somewhat ponderously stepping on the floor
hepzibah delayed a moment while muffling herself in a faded shawl which had been her defensive armor in a forty years warfare against the east wind
a characteristic sound howeverneither a cough nor a hem but a kind of rumbling and reverberating spasm in somebodys capacious depth of chestimpelled her to hurry forward with that aspect of fierce faintheartedness so common to women in cases of perilous emergency
few of her sex on such occasions have ever looked so terrible as our poor scowling hepzibah
but the visitor quietly closed the shopdoor behind him stood up his umbrella against the counter and turned a visage of composed benignity to meet the alarm and anger which his appearance had excited
hepzibahs presentiment had not deceived her
it was no other than judge pyncheon who after in vain trying the front door had now effected his entrance into the shop
how do you do cousin hepzibahand how does this most inclement weather affect our poor clifford began the judge and wonderful it seemed indeed that the easterly storm was not put to shame or at any rate a little mollified by the genial benevolence of his smile
i could not rest without calling to ask once more whether i can in any manner promote his comfort or your own  you can do nothing said hepzibah controlling her agitation as well as she could
i devote myself to clifford
he has every comfort which his situation admits of  but allow me to suggest dear cousin rejoined the judge you errin all affection and kindness no doubt and with the very best intentionsbut you do err nevertheless in keeping your brother so secluded
why insulate him thus from all sympathy and kindness
clifford alas
has had too much of solitude
now let him try societythe society that is to say of kindred and old friends
let me for instance but see clifford and i will answer for the good effect of the interview  you cannot see him answered hepzibah
clifford has kept his bed since yesterday  what
how
is he ill exclaimed judge pyncheon starting with what seemed to be angry alarm for the very frown of the old puritan darkened through the room as he spoke
nay then i must and will see him
what if he should die  he is in no danger of death said hepzibahand added with bitterness that she could repress no longer none unless he shall be persecuted to death now by the same man who long ago attempted it  cousin hepzibah said the judge with an impressive earnestness of manner which grew even to tearful pathos as he proceeded is it possible that you do not perceive how unjust how unkind how unchristian is this constant this longcontinued bitterness against me for a part which i was constrained by duty and conscience by the force of law and at my own peril to act
what did i do in detriment to clifford which it was possible to leave undone
how could you his sisterif for your neverending sorrow as it has been for mine you had known what i didhave shown greater tenderness
and do you think cousin that it has cost me no pangthat it has left no anguish in my bosom from that day to this amidst all the prosperity with which heaven has blessed meor that i do not now rejoice when it is deemed consistent with the dues of public justice and the welfare of society that this dear kinsman this early friend this nature so delicately and beautifully constitutedso unfortunate let us pronounce him and forbear to say so guiltythat our own clifford in fine should be given back to life and its possibilities of enjoyment
ah you little know me cousin hepzibah
you little know this heart
it now throbs at the thought of meeting him
there lives not the human being except yourselfand you not more than i who has shed so many tears for cliffords calamity
you behold some of them now
there is none who would so delight to promote his happiness
try me hepzibahtry me cousintry the man whom you have treated as your enemy and cliffordstry jaffrey pyncheon and you shall find him true to the hearts core  in the name of heaven cried hepzibah provoked only to intenser indignation by this outgush of the inestimable tenderness of a stern naturein gods name whom you insult and whose power i could almost question since he hears you utter so many false words without palsying your tonguegive over i beseech you this loathsome pretence of affection for your victim
you hate him
say so like a man
you cherish at this moment some black purpose against him in your heart
speak it out at onceor if you hope so to promote it better hide it till you can triumph in its success
but never speak again of your love for my poor brother
i cannot bear it
it will drive me beyond a womans decency
it will drive me mad
forbear
not another word
it will make me spurn you  for once hepzibahs wrath had given her courage
she had spoken
but after all was this unconquerable distrust of judge pyncheons integrity and this utter denial apparently of his claim to stand in the ring of human sympathieswere they founded in any just perception of his character or merely the offspring of a womans unreasonable prejudice deduced from nothing
the judge beyond all question was a man of eminent respectability
the church acknowledged it the state acknowledged it
it was denied by nobody
in all the very extensive sphere of those who knew him whether in his public or private capacities there was not an individualexcept hepzibah and some lawless mystic like the daguerreotypist and possibly a few political opponentswho would have dreamed of seriously disputing his claim to a high and honorable place in the worlds regard
nor we must do him the further justice to say did judge pyncheon himself probably entertain many or very frequent doubts that his enviable reputation accorded with his deserts
his conscience therefore usually considered the surest witness to a mans integrityhis conscience unless it might be for the little space of five minutes in the twentyfour hours or now and then some black day in the whole years circlehis conscience bore an accordant testimony with the worlds laudatory voice
and yet strong as this evidence may seem to be we should hesitate to peril our own conscience on the assertion that the judge and the consenting world were right and that poor hepzibah with her solitary prejudice was wrong
hidden from mankindforgotten by himself or buried so deeply under a sculptured and ornamented pile of ostentatious deeds that his daily life could take no note of itthere may have lurked some evil and unsightly thing
nay we could almost venture to say further that a daily guilt might have been acted by him continually renewed and reddening forth afresh like the miraculous bloodstain of a murder without his necessarily and at every moment being aware of it
men of strong minds great force of character and a hard texture of the sensibilities are very capable of falling into mistakes of this kind
they are ordinarily men to whom forms are of paramount importance
their field of action lies among the external phenomena of life
they possess vast ability in grasping and arranging and appropriating to themselves the big heavy solid unrealities such as gold landed estate offices of trust and emolument and public honors
with these materials and with deeds of goodly aspect done in the public eye an individual of this class builds up as it were a tall and stately edifice which in the view of other people and ultimately in his own view is no other than the mans character or the man himself
behold therefore a palace
its splendid halls and suites of spacious apartments are floored with a mosaicwork of costly marbles its windows the whole height of each room admit the sunshine through the most transparent of plateglass its high cornices are gilded and its ceilings gorgeously painted and a lofty domethrough which from the central pavement you may gaze up to the sky as with no obstructing medium betweensurmounts the whole
with what fairer and nobler emblem could any man desire to shadow forth his character
ah
but in some low and obscure nooksome narrow closet on the groundfloor shut locked and bolted and the key flung awayor beneath the marble pavement in a stagnant waterpuddle with the richest pattern of mosaicwork abovemay lie a corpse half decayed and still decaying and diffusing its deathscent all through the palace
the inhabitant will not be conscious of it for it has long been his daily breath
neither will the visitors for they smell only the rich odors which the master sedulously scatters through the palace and the incense which they bring and delight to burn before him
now and then perchance comes in a seer before whose sadly gifted eye the whole structure melts into thin air leaving only the hidden nook the bolted closet with the cobwebs festooned over its forgotten door or the deadly hole under the pavement and the decaying corpse within
here then we are to seek the true emblem of the mans character and of the deed that gives whatever reality it possesses to his life
and beneath the show of a marble palace that pool of stagnant water foul with many impurities and perhaps tinged with bloodthat secret abomination above which possibly he may say his prayers without remembering itis this mans miserable soul
to apply this train of remark somewhat more closely to judge pyncheon
we might say without in the least imputing crime to a personage of his eminent respectability that there was enough of splendid rubbish in his life to cover up and paralyze a more active and subtile conscience than the judge was ever troubled with
the purity of his judicial character while on the bench the faithfulness of his public service in subsequent capacities his devotedness to his party and the rigid consistency with which he had adhered to its principles or at all events kept pace with its organized movements his remarkable zeal as president of a bible society his unimpeachable integrity as treasurer of a widows and orphans fund his benefits to horticulture by producing two much esteemed varieties of the pear and to agriculture through the agency of the famous pyncheon bull the cleanliness of his moral deportment for a great many years past the severity with which he had frowned upon and finally cast off an expensive and dissipated son delaying forgiveness until within the final quarter of an hour of the young mans life his prayers at morning and eventide and graces at mealtime his efforts in furtherance of the temperance cause his confining himself since the last attack of the gout to five diurnal glasses of old sherry wine the snowy whiteness of his linen the polish of his boots the handsomeness of his goldheaded cane the square and roomy fashion of his coat and the fineness of its material and in general the studied propriety of his dress and equipment the scrupulousness with which he paid public notice in the street by a bow a lifting of the hat a nod or a motion of the hand to all and sundry of his acquaintances rich or poor the smile of broad benevolence wherewith he made it a point to gladden the whole worldwhat room could possibly be found for darker traits in a portrait made up of lineaments like these
this proper face was what he beheld in the lookingglass
this admirably arranged life was what he was conscious of in the progress of every day
then might not he claim to be its result and sum and say to himself and the community behold judge pyncheon there
and allowing that many many years ago in his early and reckless youth he had committed some one wrong actor that even now the inevitable force of circumstances should occasionally make him do one questionable deed among a thousand praiseworthy or at least blameless oneswould you characterize the judge by that one necessary deed and that halfforgotten act and let it overshadow the fair aspect of a lifetime
what is there so ponderous in evil that a thumbs bigness of it should outweigh the mass of things not evil which were heaped into the other scale
this scale and balance system is a favorite one with people of judge pyncheons brotherhood
a hard cold man thus unfortunately situated seldom or never looking inward and resolutely taking his idea of himself from what purports to be his image as reflected in the mirror of public opinion can scarcely arrive at true selfknowledge except through loss of property and reputation
sickness will not always help him do it not always the deathhour
but our affair now is with judge pyncheon as he stood confronting the fierce outbreak of hepzibahs wrath
without premeditation to her own surprise and indeed terror she had given vent for once to the inveteracy of her resentment cherished against this kinsman for thirty years
thus far the judges countenance had expressed mild forbearancegrave and almost gentle deprecation of his cousins unbecoming violencefree and christianlike forgiveness of the wrong inflicted by her words
but when those words were irrevocably spoken his look assumed sternness the sense of power and immitigable resolve and this with so natural and imperceptible a change that it seemed as if the iron man had stood there from the first and the meek man not at all
the effect was as when the light vapory clouds with their soft coloring suddenly vanish from the stony brow of a precipitous mountain and leave there the frown which you at once feel to be eternal
hepzibah almost adopted the insane belief that it was her old puritan ancestor and not the modern judge on whom she had just been wreaking the bitterness of her heart
never did a man show stronger proof of the lineage attributed to him than judge pyncheon at this crisis by his unmistakable resemblance to the picture in the inner room
cousin hepzibah said he very calmly it is time to have done with this  with all my heart answered she
then why do you persecute us any longer
leave poor clifford and me in peace
neither of us desires anything better  it is my purpose to see clifford before i leave this house continued the judge
do not act like a madwoman hepzibah
i am his only friend and an allpowerful one
has it never occurred to youare you so blind as not to have seenthat without not merely my consent but my efforts my representations the exertion of my whole influence political official personal clifford would never have been what you call free
did you think his release a triumph over me
not so my good cousin not so by any means
the furthest possible from that
no but it was the accomplishment of a purpose long entertained on my part
i set him free  you answered hepzibah
i never will believe it
he owed his dungeon to you his freedom to gods providence  i set him free reaffirmed judge pyncheon with the calmest composure
and i came hither now to decide whether he shall retain his freedom
it will depend upon himself
for this purpose i must see him  neverit would drive him mad exclaimed hepzibah but with an irresoluteness sufficiently perceptible to the keen eye of the judge for without the slightest faith in his good intentions she knew not whether there was most to dread in yielding or resistance
and why should you wish to see this wretched broken man who retains hardly a fraction of his intellect and will hide even that from an eye which has no love in it  he shall see love enough in mine if that be all said the judge with wellgrounded confidence in the benignity of his aspect
but cousin hepzibah you confess a great deal and very much to the purpose
now listen and i will frankly explain my reasons for insisting on this interview
at the death thirty years since of our uncle jaffrey it was foundi know not whether the circumstance ever attracted much of your attention among the sadder interests that clustered round that eventbut it was found that his visible estate of every kind fell far short of any estimate ever made of it
he was supposed to be immensely rich
nobody doubted that he stood among the weightiest men of his day
it was one of his eccentricities howeverand not altogether a folly neitherto conceal the amount of his property by making distant and foreign investments perhaps under other names than his own and by various means familiar enough to capitalists but unnecessary here to be specified
by uncle jaffreys last will and testament as you are aware his entire property was bequeathed to me with the single exception of a life interest to yourself in this old family mansion and the strip of patrimonial estate remaining attached to it  and do you seek to deprive us of that asked hepzibah unable to restrain her bitter contempt
is this your price for ceasing to persecute poor clifford  certainly not my dear cousin answered the judge smiling benevolently
on the contrary as you must do me the justice to own i have constantly expressed my readiness to double or treble your resources whenever you should make up your mind to accept any kindness of that nature at the hands of your kinsman
no no
but here lies the gist of the matter
of my uncles unquestionably great estate as i have said not the halfno not one third as i am fully convincedwas apparent after his death
now i have the best possible reasons for believing that your brother clifford can give me a clew to the recovery of the remainder  cliffordclifford know of any hidden wealth
clifford have it in his power to make you rich cried the old gentlewoman affected with a sense of something like ridicule at the idea
impossible
you deceive yourself
it is really a thing to laugh at  it is as certain as that i stand here said judge pyncheon striking his goldheaded cane on the floor and at the same time stamping his foot as if to express his conviction the more forcibly by the whole emphasis of his substantial person
clifford told me so himself  no no exclaimed hepzibah incredulously
you are dreaming cousin jaffrey  i do not belong to the dreaming class of men said the judge quietly
some months before my uncles death clifford boasted to me of the possession of the secret of incalculable wealth
his purpose was to taunt me and excite my curiosity
i know it well
but from a pretty distinct recollection of the particulars of our conversation i am thoroughly convinced that there was truth in what he said
clifford at this moment if he choosesand choose he mustcan inform me where to find the schedule the documents the evidences in whatever shape they exist of the vast amount of uncle jaffreys missing property
he has the secret
his boast was no idle word
it had a directness an emphasis a particularity that showed a backbone of solid meaning within the mystery of his expression  but what could have been cliffords object asked hepzibah in concealing it so long  it was one of the bad impulses of our fallen nature replied the judge turning up his eyes
he looked upon me as his enemy
he considered me as the cause of his overwhelming disgrace his imminent peril of death his irretrievable ruin
there was no great probability therefore of his volunteering information out of his dungeon that should elevate me still higher on the ladder of prosperity
but the moment has now come when he must give up his secret  and what if he should refuse inquired hepzibah
oras i steadfastly believewhat if he has no knowledge of this wealth  my dear cousin said judge pyncheon with a quietude which he had the power of making more formidable than any violence since your brothers return i have taken the precaution a highly proper one in the near kinsman and natural guardian of an individual so situated to have his deportment and habits constantly and carefully overlooked
your neighbors have been eyewitnesses to whatever has passed in the garden
the butcher the baker the fishmonger some of the customers of your shop and many a prying old woman have told me several of the secrets of your interior
a still larger circlei myself among the restcan testify to his extravagances at the arched window
thousands beheld him a week or two ago on the point of flinging himself thence into the street
from all this testimony i am led to apprehendreluctantly and with deep griefthat cliffords misfortunes have so affected his intellect never very strong that he cannot safely remain at large
the alternative you must be awareand its adoption will depend entirely on the decision which i am now about to makethe alternative is his confinement probably for the remainder of his life in a public asylum for persons in his unfortunate state of mind  you cannot mean it shrieked hepzibah
should my cousin clifford continued judge pyncheon wholly undisturbed from mere malice and hatred of one whose interests ought naturally to be dear to hima mode of passion that as often as any other indicates mental diseaseshould he refuse me the information so important to myself and which he assuredly possesses i shall consider it the one needed jot of evidence to satisfy my mind of his insanity
and once sure of the course pointed out by conscience you know me too well cousin hepzibah to entertain a doubt that i shall pursue it  o jaffreycousin jaffrey cried hepzibah mournfully not passionately it is you that are diseased in mind not clifford
you have forgotten that a woman was your motherthat you have had sisters brothers children of your ownor that there ever was affection between man and man or pity from one man to another in this miserable world
else how could you have dreamed of this
you are not young cousin jaffreyno nor middleagedbut already an old man
the hair is white upon your head
how many years have you to live
are you not rich enough for that little time
shall you be hungryshall you lack clothes or a roof to shelter youbetween this point and the grave
no
but with the half of what you now possess you could revel in costly food and wines and build a house twice as splendid as you now inhabit and make a far greater show to the worldand yet leave riches to your only son to make him bless the hour of your death
then why should you do this cruel cruel thingso mad a thing that i know not whether to call it wicked
alas cousin jaffrey this hard and grasping spirit has run in our blood these two hundred years
you are but doing over again in another shape what your ancestor before you did and sending down to your posterity the curse inherited from him  talk sense hepzibah for heavens sake exclaimed the judge with the impatience natural to a reasonable man on hearing anything so utterly absurd as the above in a discussion about matters of business
i have told you my determination
i am not apt to change
clifford must give up his secret or take the consequences
and let him decide quickly for i have several affairs to attend to this morning and an important dinner engagement with some political friends  clifford has no secret answered hepzibah
and god will not let you do the thing you meditate  we shall see said the unmoved judge
meanwhile choose whether you will summon clifford and allow this business to be amicably settled by an interview between two kinsmen or drive me to harsher measures which i should be most happy to feel myself justified in avoiding
the responsibility is altogether on your part  you are stronger than i said hepzibah after a brief consideration and you have no pity in your strength
clifford is not now insane but the interview which you insist upon may go far to make him so
nevertheless knowing you as i do i believe it to be my best course to allow you to judge for yourself as to the improbability of his possessing any valuable secret
i will call clifford
be merciful in your dealings with himbe far more merciful than your heart bids you befor god is looking at you jaffrey pyncheon  the judge followed his cousin from the shop where the foregoing conversation had passed into the parlor and flung himself heavily into the great ancestral chair
many a former pyncheon had found repose in its capacious arms rosy children after their sports young men dreamy with love grown men weary with cares old men burdened with wintersthey had mused and slumbered and departed to a yet profounder sleep
it had been a long tradition though a doubtful one that this was the very chair seated in which the earliest of the judges new england forefathershe whose picture still hung upon the wallhad given a dead mans silent and stern reception to the throng of distinguished guests
from that hour of evil omen until the present it may bethough we know not the secret of his heartbut it may be that no wearier and sadder man had ever sunk into the chair than this same judge pyncheon whom we have just beheld so immitigably hard and resolute
surely it must have been at no slight cost that he had thus fortified his soul with iron
such calmness is a mightier effort than the violence of weaker men
and there was yet a heavy task for him to do
was it a little mattera trifle to be prepared for in a single moment and to be rested from in another momentthat he must now after thirty years encounter a kinsman risen from a living tomb and wrench a secret from him or else consign him to a living tomb again
did you speak asked hepzibah looking in from the threshold of the parlor for she imagined that the judge had uttered some sound which she was anxious to interpret as a relenting impulse
i thought you called me back  no no gruffly answered judge pyncheon with a harsh frown while his brow grew almost a black purple in the shadow of the room
why should i call you back
time flies
bid clifford come to me  the judge had taken his watch from his vest pocket and now held it in his hand measuring the interval which was to ensue before the appearance of clifford
xvi
cliffords chamber   never had the old house appeared so dismal to poor hepzibah as when she departed on that wretched errand
there was a strange aspect in it
as she trode along the footworn passages and opened one crazy door after another and ascended the creaking staircase she gazed wistfully and fearfully around
it would have been no marvel to her excited mind if behind or beside her there had been the rustle of dead peoples garments or pale visages awaiting her on the landingplace above
her nerves were set all ajar by the scene of passion and terror through which she had just struggled
her colloquy with judge pyncheon who so perfectly represented the person and attributes of the founder of the family had called back the dreary past
it weighed upon her heart
whatever she had heard from legendary aunts and grandmothers concerning the good or evil fortunes of the pyncheonsstories which had heretofore been kept warm in her remembrance by the chimneycorner glow that was associated with themnow recurred to her sombre ghastly cold like most passages of family history when brooded over in melancholy mood
the whole seemed little else but a series of calamity reproducing itself in successive generations with one general hue and varying in little save the outline
but hepzibah now felt as if the judge and clifford and herselfthey three togetherwere on the point of adding another incident to the annals of the house with a bolder relief of wrong and sorrow which would cause it to stand out from all the rest
thus it is that the grief of the passing moment takes upon itself an individuality and a character of climax which it is destined to lose after a while and to fade into the dark gray tissue common to the grave or glad events of many years ago
it is but for a moment comparatively that anything looks strange or startlinga truth that has the bitter and the sweet in it
but hepzibah could not rid herself of the sense of something unprecedented at that instant passing and soon to be accomplished
her nerves were in a shake
instinctively she paused before the arched window and looked out upon the street in order to seize its permanent objects with her mental grasp and thus to steady herself from the reel and vibration which affected her more immediate sphere
it brought her up as we may say with a kind of shock when she beheld everything under the same appearance as the day before and numberless preceding days except for the difference between sunshine and sullen storm
her eyes travelled along the street from doorstep to doorstep noting the wet sidewalks with here and there a puddle in hollows that had been imperceptible until filled with water
she screwed her dim optics to their acutest point in the hope of making out with greater distinctness a certain window where she half saw half guessed that a tailors seamstress was sitting at her work
hepzibah flung herself upon that unknown womans companionship even thus far off
then she was attracted by a chaise rapidly passing and watched its moist and glistening top and its splashing wheels until it had turned the corner and refused to carry any further her idly trifling because appalled and overburdened mind
when the vehicle had disappeared she allowed herself still another loitering moment for the patched figure of good uncle venner was now visible coming slowly from the head of the street downward with a rheumatic limp because the east wind had got into his joints
hepzibah wished that he would pass yet more slowly and befriend her shivering solitude a little longer
anything that would take her out of the grievous present and interpose human beings betwixt herself and what was nearest to herwhatever would defer for an instant the inevitable errand on which she was boundall such impediments were welcome
next to the lightest heart the heaviest is apt to be most playful
hepzibah had little hardihood for her own proper pain and far less for what she must inflict on clifford
of so slight a nature and so shattered by his previous calamities it could not well be short of utter ruin to bring him face to face with the hard relentless man who had been his evil destiny through life
even had there been no bitter recollections nor any hostile interest now at stake between them the mere natural repugnance of the more sensitive system to the massive weighty and unimpressible one must in itself have been disastrous to the former
it would be like flinging a porcelain vase with already a crack in it against a granite column
never before had hepzibah so adequately estimated the powerful character of her cousin jaffreypowerful by intellect energy of will the long habit of acting among men and as she believed by his unscrupulous pursuit of selfish ends through evil means
it did but increase the difficulty that judge pyncheon was under a delusion as to the secret which he supposed clifford to possess
men of his strength of purpose and customary sagacity if they chance to adopt a mistaken opinion in practical matters so wedge it and fasten it among things known to be true that to wrench it out of their minds is hardly less difficult than pulling up an oak
thus as the judge required an impossibility of clifford the latter as he could not perform it must needs perish
for what in the grasp of a man like this was to become of cliffords soft poetic nature that never should have had a task more stubborn than to set a life of beautiful enjoyment to the flow and rhythm of musical cadences
indeed what had become of it already
broken
blighted
all but annihilated
soon to be wholly so
for a moment the thought crossed hepzibahs mind whether clifford might not really have such knowledge of their deceased uncles vanished estate as the judge imputed to him
she remembered some vague intimations on her brothers part whichif the supposition were not essentially preposterousmight have been so interpreted
there had been schemes of travel and residence abroad daydreams of brilliant life at home and splendid castles in the air which it would have required boundless wealth to build and realize
had this wealth been in her power how gladly would hepzibah have bestowed it all upon her ironhearted kinsman to buy for clifford the freedom and seclusion of the desolate old house
but she believed that her brothers schemes were as destitute of actual substance and purpose as a childs pictures of its future life while sitting in a little chair by its mothers knee
clifford had none but shadowy gold at his command and it was not the stuff to satisfy judge pyncheon
was there no help in their extremity
it seemed strange that there should be none with a city round about her
it would be so easy to throw up the window and send forth a shriek at the strange agony of which everybody would come hastening to the rescue well understanding it to be the cry of a human soul at some dreadful crisis
but how wild how almost laughable the fatalityand yet how continually it comes to pass thought hepzibah in this dull delirium of a worldthat whosoever and with however kindly a purpose should come to help they would be sure to help the strongest side
might and wrong combined like iron magnetized are endowed with irresistible attraction
there would be judge pyncheona person eminent in the public view of high station and great wealth a philanthropist a member of congress and of the church and intimately associated with whatever else bestows good nameso imposing in these advantageous lights that hepzibah herself could hardly help shrinking from her own conclusions as to his hollow integrity
the judge on one side
and who on the other
the guilty clifford
once a byword
now an indistinctly remembered ignominy
nevertheless in spite of this perception that the judge would draw all human aid to his own behalf hepzibah was so unaccustomed to act for herself that the least word of counsel would have swayed her to any mode of action
little phbe pyncheon would at once have lighted up the whole scene if not by any available suggestion yet simply by the warm vivacity of her character
the idea of the artist occurred to hepzibah
young and unknown mere vagrant adventurer as he was she had been conscious of a force in holgrave which might well adapt him to be the champion of a crisis
with this thought in her mind she unbolted a door cobwebbed and long disused but which had served as a former medium of communication between her own part of the house and the gable where the wandering daguerreotypist had now established his temporary home
he was not there
a book face downward on the table a roll of manuscript a halfwritten sheet a newspaper some tools of his present occupation and several rejected daguerreotypes conveyed an impression as if he were close at hand
but at this period of the day as hepzibah might have anticipated the artist was at his public rooms
with an impulse of idle curiosity that flickered among her heavy thoughts she looked at one of the daguerreotypes and beheld judge pyncheon frowning at her
fate stared her in the face
she turned back from her fruitless quest with a heartsinking sense of disappointment
in all her years of seclusion she had never felt as now what it was to be alone
it seemed as if the house stood in a desert or by some spell was made invisible to those who dwelt around or passed beside it so that any mode of misfortune miserable accident or crime might happen in it without the possibility of aid
in her grief and wounded pride hepzibah had spent her life in divesting herself of friends she had wilfully cast off the support which god has ordained his creatures to need from one another and it was now her punishment that clifford and herself would fall the easier victims to their kindred enemy
returning to the arched window she lifted her eyesscowling poor dimsighted hepzibah in the face of heavenand strove hard to send up a prayer through the dense gray pavement of clouds
those mists had gathered as if to symbolize a great brooding mass of human trouble doubt confusion and chill indifference between earth and the better regions
her faith was too weak the prayer too heavy to be thus uplifted
it fell back a lump of lead upon her heart
it smote her with the wretched conviction that providence intermeddled not in these petty wrongs of one individual to his fellow nor had any balm for these little agonies of a solitary soul but shed its justice and its mercy in a broad sunlike sweep over half the universe at once
its vastness made it nothing
but hepzibah did not see that just as there comes a warm sunbeam into every cottage window so comes a lovebeam of gods care and pity for every separate need
at last finding no other pretext for deferring the torture that she was to inflict on cliffordher reluctance to which was the true cause of her loitering at the window her search for the artist and even her abortive prayerdreading also to hear the stern voice of judge pyncheon from below stairs chiding her delayshe crept slowly a pale griefstricken figure a dismal shape of woman with almost torpid limbs slowly to her brothers door and knocked
there was no reply
and how should there have been
her hand tremulous with the shrinking purpose which directed it had smitten so feebly against the door that the sound could hardly have gone inward
she knocked again
still no response
nor was it to be wondered at
she had struck with the entire force of her hearts vibration communicating by some subtile magnetism her own terror to the summons
clifford would turn his face to the pillow and cover his head beneath the bedclothes like a startled child at midnight
she knocked a third time three regular strokes gentle but perfectly distinct and with meaning in them for modulate it with what cautious art we will the hand cannot help playing some tune of what we feel upon the senseless wood
clifford returned no answer
clifford
dear brother said hepzibah
shall i come in  a silence
two or three times and more hepzibah repeated his name without result till thinking her brothers sleep unwontedly profound she undid the door and entering found the chamber vacant
how could he have come forth and when without her knowledge
was it possible that in spite of the stormy day and worn out with the irksomeness within doors he had betaken himself to his customary haunt in the garden and was now shivering under the cheerless shelter of the summerhouse
she hastily threw up a window thrust forth her turbaned head and the half of her gaunt figure and searched the whole garden through as completely as her dim vision would allow
she could see the interior of the summerhouse and its circular seat kept moist by the droppings of the roof
it had no occupant
clifford was not thereabouts unless indeed he had crept for concealment as for a moment hepzibah fancied might be the case into a great wet mass of tangled and broadleaved shadow where the squashvines were clambering tumultuously upon an old wooden framework set casually aslant against the fence
this could not be however he was not there for while hepzibah was looking a strange grimalkin stole forth from the very spot and picked his way across the garden
twice he paused to snuff the air and then anew directed his course towards the parlor window
whether it was only on account of the stealthy prying manner common to the race or that this cat seemed to have more than ordinary mischief in his thoughts the old gentlewoman in spite of her much perplexity felt an impulse to drive the animal away and accordingly flung down a window stick
the cat stared up at her like a detected thief or murderer and the next instant took to flight
no other living creature was visible in the garden
chanticleer and his family had either not left their roost disheartened by the interminable rain or had done the next wisest thing by seasonably returning to it
hepzibah closed the window
but where was clifford
could it be that aware of the presence of his evil destiny he had crept silently down the staircase while the judge and hepzibah stood talking in the shop and had softly undone the fastenings of the outer door and made his escape into the street
with that thought she seemed to behold his gray wrinkled yet childlike aspect in the oldfashioned garments which he wore about the house a figure such as one sometimes imagines himself to be with the worlds eye upon him in a troubled dream
this figure of her wretched brother would go wandering through the city attracting all eyes and everybodys wonder and repugnance like a ghost the more to be shuddered at because visible at noontide
to incur the ridicule of the younger crowd that knew him notthe harsher scorn and indignation of a few old men who might recall his once familiar features
to be the sport of boys who when old enough to run about the streets have no more reverence for what is beautiful and holy nor pity for what is sadno more sense of sacred misery sanctifying the human shape in which it embodies itselfthan if satan were the father of them all
goaded by their taunts their loud shrill cries and cruel laughterinsulted by the filth of the public ways which they would fling upon himor as it might well be distracted by the mere strangeness of his situation though nobody should afflict him with so much as a thoughtless wordwhat wonder if clifford were to break into some wild extravagance which was certain to be interpreted as lunacy
thus judge pyncheons fiendish scheme would be ready accomplished to his hands
then hepzibah reflected that the town was almost completely watergirdled
the wharves stretched out towards the centre of the harbor and in this inclement weather were deserted by the ordinary throng of merchants laborers and seafaring men each wharf a solitude with the vessels moored stem and stern along its misty length
should her brothers aimless footsteps stray thitherward and he but bend one moment over the deep black tide would he not bethink himself that here was the sure refuge within his reach and that with a single step or the slightest overbalance of his body he might be forever beyond his kinsmans gripe
oh the temptation
to make of his ponderous sorrow a security
to sink with its leaden weight upon him and never rise again
the horror of this last conception was too much for hepzibah
even jaffrey pyncheon must help her now
she hastened down the staircase shrieking as she went
clifford is gone she cried
i cannot find my brother
help jaffrey pyncheon
some harm will happen to him  she threw open the parlordoor
but what with the shade of branches across the windows and the smokeblackened ceiling and the dark oakpanelling of the walls there was hardly so much daylight in the room that hepzibahs imperfect sight could accurately distinguish the judges figure
she was certain however that she saw him sitting in the ancestral armchair near the centre of the floor with his face somewhat averted and looking towards a window
so firm and quiet is the nervous system of such men as judge pyncheon that he had perhaps stirred not more than once since her departure but in the hard composure of his temperament retained the position into which accident had thrown him
i tell you jaffrey cried hepzibah impatiently as she turned from the parlordoor to search other rooms my brother is not in his chamber
you must help me seek him  but judge pyncheon was not the man to let himself be startled from an easychair with haste illbefitting either the dignity of his character or his broad personal basis by the alarm of an hysteric woman
yet considering his own interest in the matter he might have bestirred himself with a little more alacrity
do you hear me jaffrey pyncheon screamed hepzibah as she again approached the parlordoor after an ineffectual search elsewhere
clifford is gone  at this instant on the threshold of the parlor emerging from within appeared clifford himself
his face was preternaturally pale so deadly white indeed that through all the glimmering indistinctness of the passageway hepzibah could discern his features as if a light fell on them alone
their vivid and wild expression seemed likewise sufficient to illuminate them it was an expression of scorn and mockery coinciding with the emotions indicated by his gesture
as clifford stood on the threshold partly turning back he pointed his finger within the parlor and shook it slowly as though he would have summoned not hepzibah alone but the whole world to gaze at some object inconceivably ridiculous
this action so illtimed and extravagantaccompanied too with a look that showed more like joy than any other kind of excitementcompelled hepzibah to dread that her stern kinsmans ominous visit had driven her poor brother to absolute insanity
nor could she otherwise account for the judges quiescent mood than by supposing him craftily on the watch while clifford developed these symptoms of a distracted mind
be quiet clifford whispered his sister raising her hand to impress caution
oh for heavens sake be quiet  let him be quiet
what can he do better answered clifford with a still wilder gesture pointing into the room which he had just quitted
as for us hepzibah we can dance nowwe can sing laugh play do what we will
the weight is gone hepzibah
it is gone off this weary old world and we may be as lighthearted as little phbe herself  and in accordance with his words he began to laugh still pointing his finger at the object invisible to hepzibah within the parlor
she was seized with a sudden intuition of some horrible thing
she thrust herself past clifford and disappeared into the room but almost immediately returned with a cry choking in her throat
gazing at her brother with an affrighted glance of inquiry she beheld him all in a tremor and a quake from head to foot while amid these commoted elements of passion or alarm still flickered his gusty mirth
my god
what is to become of us gasped hepzibah
come said clifford in a tone of brief decision most unlike what was usual with him
we stay here too long
let us leave the old house to our cousin jaffrey
he will take good care of it  hepzibah now noticed that clifford had on a cloaka garment of long agoin which he had constantly muffled himself during these days of easterly storm
he beckoned with his hand and intimated so far as she could comprehend him his purpose that they should go together from the house
there are chaotic blind or drunken moments in the lives of persons who lack real force of charactermoments of test in which courage would most assert itselfbut where these individuals if left to themselves stagger aimlessly along or follow implicitly whatever guidance may befall them even if it be a childs
no matter how preposterous or insane a purpose is a godsend to them
hepzibah had reached this point
unaccustomed to action or responsibilityfull of horror at what she had seen and afraid to inquire or almost to imagine how it had come to passaffrighted at the fatality which seemed to pursue her brotherstupefied by the dim thick stifling atmosphere of dread which filled the house as with a deathsmell and obliterated all definiteness of thoughtshe yielded without a question and on the instant to the will which clifford expressed
for herself she was like a person in a dream when the will always sleeps
clifford ordinarily so destitute of this faculty had found it in the tension of the crisis
why do you delay so cried he sharply
put on your cloak and hood or whatever it pleases you to wear
no matter what you cannot look beautiful nor brilliant my poor hepzibah
take your purse with money in it and come along  hepzibah obeyed these instructions as if nothing else were to be done or thought of
she began to wonder it is true why she did not wake up and at what still more intolerable pitch of dizzy trouble her spirit would struggle out of the maze and make her conscious that nothing of all this had actually happened
of course it was not real no such black easterly day as this had yet begun to be judge pyncheon had not talked with her
clifford had not laughed pointed beckoned her away with him but she had merely been afflictedas lonely sleepers often arewith a great deal of unreasonable misery in a morning dream
nownowi shall certainly awake thought hepzibah as she went to and fro making her little preparations
i can bear it no longer i must wake up now  but it came not that awakening moment
it came not even when just before they left the house clifford stole to the parlordoor and made a parting obeisance to the sole occupant of the room
what an absurd figure the old fellow cuts now whispered he to hepzibah
just when he fancied he had me completely under his thumb
come come make haste
or he will start up like giant despair in pursuit of christian and hopeful and catch us yet  as they passed into the street clifford directed hepzibahs attention to something on one of the posts of the front door
it was merely the initials of his own name which with somewhat of his characteristic grace about the forms of the letters he had cut there when a boy
the brother and sister departed and left judge pyncheon sitting in the old home of his forefathers all by himself so heavy and lumpish that we can liken him to nothing better than a defunct nightmare which had perished in the midst of its wickedness and left its flabby corpse on the breast of the tormented one to be gotten rid of as it might
xvii
the flight of two owls   summer as it was the east wind set poor hepzibahs few remaining teeth chattering in her head as she and clifford faced it on their way up pyncheon street and towards the centre of the town
not merely was it the shiver which this pitiless blast brought to her frame although her feet and hands especially had never seemed so deathacold as now but there was a moral sensation mingling itself with the physical chill and causing her to shake more in spirit than in body
the worlds broad bleak atmosphere was all so comfortless
such indeed is the impression which it makes on every new adventurer even if he plunge into it while the warmest tide of life is bubbling through his veins
what then must it have been to hepzibah and cliffordso timestricken as they were yet so like children in their inexperienceas they left the doorstep and passed from beneath the wide shelter of the pyncheon elm
they were wandering all abroad on precisely such a pilgrimage as a child often meditates to the worlds end with perhaps a sixpence and a biscuit in his pocket
in hepzibahs mind there was the wretched consciousness of being adrift
she had lost the faculty of selfguidance but in view of the difficulties around her felt it hardly worth an effort to regain it and was moreover incapable of making one
as they proceeded on their strange expedition she now and then cast a look sidelong at clifford and could not but observe that he was possessed and swayed by a powerful excitement
it was this indeed that gave him the control which he had at once and so irresistibly established over his movements
it not a little resembled the exhilaration of wine
or it might more fancifully be compared to a joyous piece of music played with wild vivacity but upon a disordered instrument
as the cracked jarring note might always be heard and as it jarred loudest amidst the loftiest exultation of the melody so was there a continual quake through clifford causing him most to quiver while he wore a triumphant smile and seemed almost under a necessity to skip in his gait
they met few people abroad even on passing from the retired neighborhood of the house of the seven gables into what was ordinarily the more thronged and busier portion of the town
glistening sidewalks with little pools of rain here and there along their unequal surface umbrellas displayed ostentatiously in the shopwindows as if the life of trade had concentrated itself in that one article wet leaves of the horsechestnut or elmtrees torn off untimely by the blast and scattered along the public way an unsightly accumulation of mud in the middle of the street which perversely grew the more unclean for its long and laborious washingthese were the more definable points of a very sombre picture
in the way of movement and human life there was the hasty rattle of a cab or coach its driver protected by a waterproof cap over his head and shoulders the forlorn figure of an old man who seemed to have crept out of some subterranean sewer and was stooping along the kennel and poking the wet rubbish with a stick in quest of rusty nails a merchant or two at the door of the postoffice together with an editor and a miscellaneous politician awaiting a dilatory mail a few visages of retired seacaptains at the window of an insurance office looking out vacantly at the vacant street blaspheming at the weather and fretting at the dearth as well of public news as local gossip
what a treasuretrove to these venerable quidnuncs could they have guessed the secret which hepzibah and clifford were carrying along with them
but their two figures attracted hardly so much notice as that of a young girl who passed at the same instant and happened to raise her skirt a trifle too high above her ankles
had it been a sunny and cheerful day they could hardly have gone through the streets without making themselves obnoxious to remark
now probably they were felt to be in keeping with the dismal and bitter weather and therefore did not stand out in strong relief as if the sun were shining on them but melted into the gray gloom and were forgotten as soon as gone
poor hepzibah
could she have understood this fact it would have brought her some little comfort for to all her other troublesstrange to saythere was added the womanish and oldmaidenlike misery arising from a sense of unseemliness in her attire
thus she was fain to shrink deeper into herself as it were as if in the hope of making people suppose that here was only a cloak and hood threadbare and woefully faded taking an airing in the midst of the storm without any wearer
as they went on the feeling of indistinctness and unreality kept dimly hovering round about her and so diffusing itself into her system that one of her hands was hardly palpable to the touch of the other
any certainty would have been preferable to this
she whispered to herself again and again am i awakeam i awake and sometimes exposed her face to the chill spatter of the wind for the sake of its rude assurance that she was
whether it was cliffords purpose or only chance had led them thither they now found themselves passing beneath the arched entrance of a large structure of gray stone
within there was a spacious breadth and an airy height from floor to roof now partially filled with smoke and steam which eddied voluminously upward and formed a mimic cloudregion over their heads
a train of cars was just ready for a start the locomotive was fretting and fuming like a steed impatient for a headlong rush and the bell rang out its hasty peal so well expressing the brief summons which life vouchsafes to us in its hurried career
without question or delaywith the irresistible decision if not rather to be called recklessness which had so strangely taken possession of him and through him of hepzibahclifford impelled her towards the cars and assisted her to enter
the signal was given the engine puffed forth its short quick breaths the train began its movement and along with a hundred other passengers these two unwonted travellers sped onward like the wind
at last therefore and after so long estrangement from everything that the world acted or enjoyed they had been drawn into the great current of human life and were swept away with it as by the suction of fate itself
still haunted with the idea that not one of the past incidents inclusive of judge pyncheons visit could be real the recluse of the seven gables murmured in her brothers ear  clifford
clifford
is not this a dream  a dream hepzibah repeated he almost laughing in her face
on the contrary i have never been awake before  meanwhile looking from the window they could see the world racing past them
at one moment they were rattling through a solitude the next a village had grown up around them a few breaths more and it had vanished as if swallowed by an earthquake
the spires of meetinghouses seemed set adrift from their foundations the broadbased hills glided away
everything was unfixed from its agelong rest and moving at whirlwind speed in a direction opposite to their own
within the car there was the usual interior life of the railroad offering little to the observation of other passengers but full of novelty for this pair of strangely enfranchised prisoners
it was novelty enough indeed that there were fifty human beings in close relation with them under one long and narrow roof and drawn onward by the same mighty influence that had taken their two selves into its grasp
it seemed marvellous how all these people could remain so quietly in their seats while so much noisy strength was at work in their behalf
some with tickets in their hats long travellers these before whom lay a hundred miles of railroad had plunged into the english scenery and adventures of pamphlet novels and were keeping company with dukes and earls
others whose briefer span forbade their devoting themselves to studies so abstruse beguiled the little tedium of the way with pennypapers
a party of girls and one young man on opposite sides of the car found huge amusement in a game of ball
they tossed it to and fro with peals of laughter that might be measured by milelengths for faster than the nimble ball could fly the merry players fled unconsciously along leaving the trail of their mirth afar behind and ending their game under another sky than had witnessed its commencement
boys with apples cakes candy and rolls of variously tinctured lozengesmerchandise that reminded hepzibah of her deserted shopappeared at each momentary stoppingplace doing up their business in a hurry or breaking it short off lest the market should ravish them away with it
new people continually entered
old acquaintancesfor such they soon grew to be in this rapid current of affairscontinually departed
here and there amid the rumble and the tumult sat one asleep
sleep sport business graver or lighter study and the common and inevitable movement onward
it was life itself
cliffords naturally poignant sympathies were all aroused
he caught the color of what was passing about him and threw it back more vividly than he received it but mixed nevertheless with a lurid and portentous hue
hepzibah on the other hand felt herself more apart from human kind than even in the seclusion which she had just quitted
you are not happy hepzibah said clifford apart in a tone of reproach
you are thinking of that dismal old house and of cousin jaffreyhere came the quake through himand of cousin jaffrey sitting there all by himself
take my advicefollow my exampleand let such things slip aside
here we are in the world hepzibahin the midst of lifein the throng of our fellow beings
let you and i be happy
as happy as that youth and those pretty girls at their game of ball  happy thought hepzibah bitterly conscious at the word of her dull and heavy heart with the frozen pain in ithappy
he is mad already and if i could once feel myself broad awake i should go mad too  if a fixed idea be madness she was perhaps not remote from it
fast and far as they had rattled and clattered along the iron track they might just as well as regarded hepzibahs mental images have been passing up and down pyncheon street
with miles and miles of varied scenery between there was no scene for her save the seven old gablepeaks with their moss and the tuft of weeds in one of the angles and the shopwindow and a customer shaking the door and compelling the little bell to jingle fiercely but without disturbing judge pyncheon
this one old house was everywhere
it transported its great lumbering bulk with more than railroad speed and set itself phlegmatically down on whatever spot she glanced at
the quality of hepzibahs mind was too unmalleable to take new impressions so readily as cliffords
he had a winged nature she was rather of the vegetable kind and could hardly be kept long alive if drawn up by the roots
thus it happened that the relation heretofore existing between her brother and herself was changed
at home she was his guardian here clifford had become hers and seemed to comprehend whatever belonged to their new position with a singular rapidity of intelligence
he had been startled into manhood and intellectual vigor or at least into a condition that resembled them though it might be both diseased and transitory
the conductor now applied for their tickets and clifford who had made himself the pursebearer put a banknote into his hand as he had observed others do
for the lady and yourself asked the conductor
and how far  as far as that will carry us said clifford
it is no great matter
we are riding for pleasure merely  you choose a strange day for it sir remarked a gimleteyed old gentleman on the other side of the car looking at clifford and his companion as if curious to make them out
the best chance of pleasure in an easterly rain i take it is in a mans own house with a nice little fire in the chimney  i cannot precisely agree with you said clifford courteously bowing to the old gentleman and at once taking up the clew of conversation which the latter had proffered
it had just occurred to me on the contrary that this admirable invention of the railroadwith the vast and inevitable improvements to be looked for both as to speed and convenienceis destined to do away with those stale ideas of home and fireside and substitute something better  in the name of commonsense asked the old gentleman rather testily what can be better for a man than his own parlor and chimneycorner  these things have not the merit which many good people attribute to them replied clifford
they may be said in few and pithy words to have ill served a poor purpose
my impression is that our wonderfully increased and still increasing facilities of locomotion are destined to bring us around again to the nomadic state
you are aware my dear siryou must have observed it in your own experiencethat all human progress is in a circle or to use a more accurate and beautiful figure in an ascending spiral curve
while we fancy ourselves going straight forward and attaining at every step an entirely new position of affairs we do actually return to something long ago tried and abandoned but which we now find etherealized refined and perfected to its ideal
the past is but a coarse and sensual prophecy of the present and the future
to apply this truth to the topic now under discussion
in the early epochs of our race men dwelt in temporary huts of bowers of branches as easily constructed as a birdsnest and which they builtif it should be called building when such sweet homes of a summer solstice rather grew than were made with handswhich nature we will say assisted them to rear where fruit abounded where fish and game were plentiful or most especially where the sense of beauty was to be gratified by a lovelier shade than elsewhere and a more exquisite arrangement of lake wood and hill
this life possessed a charm which ever since man quitted it has vanished from existence
and it typified something better than itself
it had its drawbacks such as hunger and thirst inclement weather hot sunshine and weary and footblistering marches over barren and ugly tracts that lay between the sites desirable for their fertility and beauty
but in our ascending spiral we escape all this
these railroadscould but the whistle be made musical and the rumble and the jar got rid ofare positively the greatest blessing that the ages have wrought out for us
they give us wings they annihilate the toil and dust of pilgrimage they spiritualize travel
transition being so facile what can be any mans inducement to tarry in one spot
why therefore should he build a more cumbrous habitation than can readily be carried off with him
why should he make himself a prisoner for life in brick and stone and old wormeaten timber when he may just as easily dwell in one sense nowherein a better sense wherever the fit and beautiful shall offer him a home  cliffords countenance glowed as he divulged this theory a youthful character shone out from within converting the wrinkles and pallid duskiness of age into an almost transparent mask
the merry girls let their ball drop upon the floor and gazed at him
they said to themselves perhaps that before his hair was gray and the crowsfeet tracked his temples this now decaying man must have stamped the impress of his features on many a womans heart
but alas
no womans eye had seen his face while it was beautiful
i should scarcely call it an improved state of things observed cliffords new acquaintance to live everywhere and nowhere  would you not exclaimed clifford with singular energy
it is as clear to me as sunshinewere there any in the skythat the greatest possible stumblingblocks in the path of human happiness and improvement are these heaps of bricks and stones consolidated with mortar or hewn timber fastened together with spikenails which men painfully contrive for their own torment and call them house and home
the soul needs air a wide sweep and frequent change of it
morbid influences in a thousandfold variety gather about hearths and pollute the life of households
there is no such unwholesome atmosphere as that of an old home rendered poisonous by ones defunct forefathers and relatives
i speak of what i know
there is a certain house within my familiar recollectionone of those peakedgable there are seven of them projectingstoried edifices such as you occasionally see in our older townsa rusty crazy creaky dryrotted dingy dark and miserable old dungeon with an arched window over the porch and a little shopdoor on one side and a great melancholy elm before it
now sir whenever my thoughts recur to this sevengabled mansion the fact is so very curious that i must needs mention it immediately i have a vision or image of an elderly man of remarkably stern countenance sitting in an oaken elbowchair dead stonedead with an ugly flow of blood upon his shirtbosom
dead but with open eyes
he taints the whole house as i remember it
i could never flourish there nor be happy nor do nor enjoy what god meant me to do and enjoy  his face darkened and seemed to contract and shrivel itself up and wither into age
never sir he repeated
i could never draw cheerful breath there  i should think not said the old gentleman eyeing clifford earnestly and rather apprehensively
i should conceive not sir with that notion in your head  surely not continued clifford and it were a relief to me if that house could be torn down or burnt up and so the earth be rid of it and grass be sown abundantly over its foundation
not that i should ever visit its site again
for sir the farther i get away from it the more does the joy the lightsome freshness the heartleap the intellectual dance the youth in shortyes my youth my youththe more does it come back to me
no longer ago than this morning i was old
i remember looking in the glass and wondering at my own gray hair and the wrinkles many and deep right across my brow and the furrows down my cheeks and the prodigious trampling of crowsfeet about my temples
it was too soon
i could not bear it
age had no right to come
i had not lived
but now do i look old
if so my aspect belies me strangely fora great weight being off my mindi feel in the very heyday of my youth with the world and my best days before me  i trust you may find it so said the old gentleman who seemed rather embarrassed and desirous of avoiding the observation which cliffords wild talk drew on them both
you have my best wishes for it  for heavens sake dear clifford be quiet whispered his sister
they think you mad  be quiet yourself hepzibah returned her brother
no matter what they think
i am not mad
for the first time in thirty years my thoughts gush up and find words ready for them
i must talk and i will  he turned again towards the old gentleman and renewed the conversation
yes my dear sir said he it is my firm belief and hope that these terms of roof and hearthstone which have so long been held to embody something sacred are soon to pass out of mens daily use and be forgotten
just imagine for a moment how much of human evil will crumble away with this one change
what we call real estatethe solid ground to build a house onis the broad foundation on which nearly all the guilt of this world rests
a man will commit almost any wronghe will heap up an immense pile of wickedness as hard as granite and which will weigh as heavily upon his soul to eternal agesonly to build a great gloomy darkchambered mansion for himself to die in and for his posterity to be miserable in
he lays his own dead corpse beneath the underpinning as one may say and hangs his frowning picture on the wall and after thus converting himself into an evil destiny expects his remotest greatgrandchildren to be happy there
i do not speak wildly
i have just such a house in my minds eye  then sir said the old gentleman getting anxious to drop the subject you are not to blame for leaving it  within the lifetime of the child already born clifford went on all this will be done away
the world is growing too ethereal and spiritual to bear these enormities a great while longer
to me though for a considerable period of time i have lived chiefly in retirement and know less of such things than most meneven to me the harbingers of a better era are unmistakable
mesmerism now
will that effect nothing think you towards purging away the grossness out of human life  all a humbug growled the old gentleman
these rapping spirits that little phbe told us of the other day said cliffordwhat are these but the messengers of the spiritual world knocking at the door of substance
and it shall be flung wide open  a humbug again cried the old gentleman growing more and more testy at these glimpses of cliffords metaphysics
i should like to rap with a good stick on the empty pates of the dolts who circulate such nonsense  then there is electricitythe demon the angel the mighty physical power the allpervading intelligence exclaimed clifford
is that a humbug too
is it a factor have i dreamt itthat by means of electricity the world of matter has become a great nerve vibrating thousands of miles in a breathless point of time
rather the round globe is a vast head a brain instinct with intelligence
or shall we say it is itself a thought nothing but thought and no longer the substance which we deemed it  if you mean the telegraph said the old gentleman glancing his eye toward its wire alongside the railtrack it is an excellent thingthat is of course if the speculators in cotton and politics dont get possession of it
a great thing indeed sir particularly as regards the detection of bankrobbers and murderers  i dont quite like it in that point of view replied clifford
a bankrobber and what you call a murderer likewise has his rights which men of enlightened humanity and conscience should regard in so much the more liberal spirit because the bulk of society is prone to controvert their existence
an almost spiritual medium like the electric telegraph should be consecrated to high deep joyful and holy missions
lovers day by dayhour by hour if so often moved to do itmight send their heartthrobs from maine to florida with some such words as these i love you forevermy heart runs over with lovei love you more than i can and again at the next message i have lived an hour longer and love you twice as much or when a good man has departed his distant friend should be conscious of an electric thrill as from the world of happy spirits telling him your dear friend is in bliss or to an absent husband should come tidings thus an immortal being of whom you are the father has this moment come from god and immediately its little voice would seem to have reached so far and to be echoing in his heart
but for these poor rogues the bankrobberswho after all are about as honest as nine people in ten except that they disregard certain formalities and prefer to transact business at midnight rather than changehoursand for these murderers as you phrase it who are often excusable in the motives of their deed and deserve to be ranked among public benefactors if we consider only its resultfor unfortunate individuals like these i really cannot applaud the enlistment of an immaterial and miraculous power in the universal worldhunt at their heels  you cant hey cried the old gentleman with a hard look
positively no answered clifford
it puts them too miserably at disadvantage
for example sir in a dark low crossbeamed panelled room of an old house let us suppose a dead man sitting in an armchair with a bloodstain on his shirtbosomand let us add to our hypothesis another man issuing from the house which he feels to be overfilled with the dead mans presenceand let us lastly imagine him fleeing heaven knows whither at the speed of a hurricane by railroad
now sir if the fugitive alight in some distant town and find all the people babbling about that selfsame dead man whom he has fled so far to avoid the sight and thought of will you not allow that his natural rights have been infringed
he has been deprived of his city of refuge and in my humble opinion has suffered infinite wrong  you are a strange man sir said the old gentleman bringing his gimleteye to a point on clifford as if determined to bore right into him
i cant see through you  no ill be bound you cant cried clifford laughing
and yet my dear sir i am as transparent as the water of maules well
but come hepzibah
we have flown far enough for once
let us alight as the birds do and perch ourselves on the nearest twig and consult wither we shall fly next  just then as it happened the train reached a solitary waystation
taking advantage of the brief pause clifford left the car and drew hepzibah along with him
a moment afterwards the trainwith all the life of its interior amid which clifford had made himself so conspicuous an objectwas gliding away in the distance and rapidly lessening to a point which in another moment vanished
the world had fled away from these two wanderers
they gazed drearily about them
at a little distance stood a wooden church black with age and in a dismal state of ruin and decay with broken windows a great rift through the main body of the edifice and a rafter dangling from the top of the square tower
farther off was a farmhouse in the old style as venerably black as the church with a roof sloping downward from the threestory peak to within a mans height of the ground
it seemed uninhabited
there were the relics of a woodpile indeed near the door but with grass sprouting up among the chips and scattered logs
the small raindrops came down aslant the wind was not turbulent but sullen and full of chilly moisture
clifford shivered from head to foot
the wild effervescence of his moodwhich had so readily supplied thoughts fantasies and a strange aptitude of words and impelled him to talk from the mere necessity of giving vent to this bubblingup gush of ideas had entirely subsided
a powerful excitement had given him energy and vivacity
its operation over he forthwith began to sink
you must take the lead now hepzibah murmured he with a torpid and reluctant utterance
do with me as you will she knelt down upon the platform where they were standing and lifted her clasped hands to the sky
the dull gray weight of clouds made it invisible but it was no hour for disbeliefno juncture this to question that there was a sky above and an almighty father looking from it
o godejaculated poor gaunt hepzibahthen paused a moment to consider what her prayer should beo godour fatherare we not thy children
have mercy on us     xviii
governor pyncheon   judge pyncheon while his two relatives have fled away with such illconsidered haste still sits in the old parlor keeping house as the familiar phrase is in the absence of its ordinary occupants
to him and to the venerable house of the seven gables does our story now betake itself like an owl bewildered in the daylight and hastening back to his hollow tree
the judge has not shifted his position for a long while now
he has not stirred hand or foot nor withdrawn his eyes so much as a hairsbreadth from their fixed gaze towards the corner of the room since the footsteps of hepzibah and clifford creaked along the passage and the outer door was closed cautiously behind their exit
he holds his watch in his left hand but clutched in such a manner that you cannot see the dialplate
how profound a fit of meditation
or supposing him asleep how infantile a quietude of conscience and what wholesome order in the gastric region are betokened by slumber so entirely undisturbed with starts cramp twitches muttered dreamtalk trumpetblasts through the nasal organ or any slightest irregularity of breath
you must hold your own breath to satisfy yourself whether he breathes at all
it is quite inaudible
you hear the ticking of his watch his breath you do not hear
a most refreshing slumber doubtless
and yet the judge cannot be asleep
his eyes are open
a veteran politician such as he would never fall asleep with wideopen eyes lest some enemy or mischiefmaker taking him thus at unawares should peep through these windows into his consciousness and make strange discoveries among the reminiscences projects hopes apprehensions weaknesses and strong points which he has heretofore shared with nobody
a cautious man is proverbially said to sleep with one eye open
that may be wisdom
but not with both for this were heedlessness
no no
judge pyncheon cannot be asleep
it is odd however that a gentleman so burdened with engagementsand noted too for punctualityshould linger thus in an old lonely mansion which he has never seemed very fond of visiting
the oaken chair to be sure may tempt him with its roominess
it is indeed a spacious and allowing for the rude age that fashioned it a moderately easy seat with capacity enough at all events and offering no restraint to the judges breadth of beam
a bigger man might find ample accommodation in it
his ancestor now pictured upon the wall with all his english beef about him used hardly to present a front extending from elbow to elbow of this chair or a base that would cover its whole cushion
but there are better chairs than thismahogany black walnut rosewood springseated and damaskcushioned with varied slopes and innumerable artifices to make them easy and obviate the irksomeness of too tame an easea score of such might be at judge pyncheons service
yes
in a score of drawingrooms he would be more than welcome
mamma would advance to meet him with outstretched hand the virgin daughter elderly as he has now got to bean old widower as he smilingly describes himselfwould shake up the cushion for the judge and do her pretty utmost to make him comfortable
for the judge is a prosperous man
he cherishes his schemes moreover like other people and reasonably brighter than most others or did so at least as he lay abed this morning in an agreeable halfdrowse planning the business of the day and speculating on the probabilities of the next fifteen years
with his firm health and the little inroad that age has made upon him fifteen years or twentyyes or perhaps fiveandtwentyare no more than he may fairly call his own
fiveandtwenty years for the enjoyment of his real estate in town and country his railroad bank and insurance shares his united states stockhis wealth in short however invested now in possession or soon to be acquired together with the public honors that have fallen upon him and the weightier ones that are yet to fall
it is good
it is excellent
it is enough
still lingering in the old chair
if the judge has a little time to throw away why does not he visit the insurance office as is his frequent custom and sit awhile in one of their leatherncushioned armchairs listening to the gossip of the day and dropping some deeply designed chanceword which will be certain to become the gossip of tomorrow
and have not the bank directors a meeting at which it was the judges purpose to be present and his office to preside
indeed they have and the hour is noted on a card which is or ought to be in judge pyncheons right vestpocket
let him go thither and loll at ease upon his moneybags
he has lounged long enough in the old chair
this was to have been such a busy day
in the first place the interview with clifford
half an hour by the judges reckoning was to suffice for that it would probably be less buttaking into consideration that hepzibah was first to be dealt with and that these women are apt to make many words where a few would do much betterit might be safest to allow half an hour
half an hour
why judge it is already two hours by your own undeviatingly accurate chronometer
glance your eye down at it and see
ah he will not give himself the trouble either to bend his head or elevate his hand so as to bring the faithful timekeeper within his range of vision
time all at once appears to have become a matter of no moment with the judge
and has he forgotten all the other items of his memoranda
cliffords affair arranged he was to meet a state street broker who has undertaken to procure a heavy percentage and the best of paper for a few loose thousands which the judge happens to have by him uninvested
the wrinkled noteshaver will have taken his railroad trip in vain
half an hour later in the street next to this there was to be an auction of real estate including a portion of the old pyncheon property originally belonging to maules garden ground
it has been alienated from the pyncheons these fourscore years but the judge had kept it in his eye and had set his heart on reannexing it to the small demesne still left around the seven gables and now during this odd fit of oblivion the fatal hammer must have fallen and transferred our ancient patrimony to some alien possessor
possibly indeed the sale may have been postponed till fairer weather
if so will the judge make it convenient to be present and favor the auctioneer with his bid on the proximate occasion
the next affair was to buy a horse for his own driving
the one heretofore his favorite stumbled this very morning on the road to town and must be at once discarded
judge pyncheons neck is too precious to be risked on such a contingency as a stumbling steed
should all the above business be seasonably got through with he might attend the meeting of a charitable society the very name of which however in the multiplicity of his benevolence is quite forgotten so that this engagement may pass unfulfilled and no great harm done
and if he have time amid the press of more urgent matters he must take measures for the renewal of mrs pyncheons tombstone which the sexton tells him has fallen on its marble face and is cracked quite in twain
she was a praiseworthy woman enough thinks the judge in spite of her nervousness and the tears that she was so oozy with and her foolish behavior about the coffee and as she took her departure so seasonably he will not grudge the second tombstone
it is better at least than if she had never needed any
the next item on his list was to give orders for some fruittrees of a rare variety to be deliverable at his countryseat in the ensuing autumn
yes buy them by all means and may the peaches be luscious in your mouth judge pyncheon
after this comes something more important
a committee of his political party has besought him for a hundred or two of dollars in addition to his previous disbursements towards carrying on the fall campaign
the judge is a patriot the fate of the country is staked on the november election and besides as will be shadowed forth in another paragraph he has no trifling stake of his own in the same great game
he will do what the committee asks nay he will be liberal beyond their expectations they shall have a check for five hundred dollars and more anon if it be needed
what next
a decayed widow whose husband was judge pyncheons early friend has laid her case of destitution before him in a very moving letter
she and her fair daughter have scarcely bread to eat
he partly intends to call on her todayperhaps soperhaps notaccordingly as he may happen to have leisure and a small banknote
another business which however he puts no great weight on it is well you know to be heedful but not overanxious as respects ones personal healthanother business then was to consult his family physician
about what for heavens sake
why it is rather difficult to describe the symptoms
a mere dimness of sight and dizziness of brain was itor disagreeable choking or stifling or gurgling or bubbling in the region of the thorax as the anatomists sayor was it a pretty severe throbbing and kicking of the heart rather creditable to him than otherwise as showing that the organ had not been left out of the judges physical contrivance
no matter what it was
the doctor probably would smile at the statement of such trifles to his professional ear the judge would smile in his turn and meeting one anothers eyes they would enjoy a hearty laugh together
but a fig for medical advice
the judge will never need it
pray pray judge pyncheon look at your watch now
whatnot a glance
it is within ten minutes of the dinner hour
it surely cannot have slipped your memory that the dinner of today is to be the most important in its consequences of all the dinners you ever ate
yes precisely the most important although in the course of your somewhat eminent career you have been placed high towards the head of the table at splendid banquets and have poured out your festive eloquence to ears yet echoing with websters mighty organtones
no public dinner this however
it is merely a gathering of some dozen or so of friends from several districts of the state men of distinguished character and influence assembling almost casually at the house of a common friend likewise distinguished who will make them welcome to a little better than his ordinary fare
nothing in the way of french cookery but an excellent dinner nevertheless
real turtle we understand and salmon tautog canvasbacks pig english mutton good roast beef or dainties of that serious kind fit for substantial country gentlemen as these honorable persons mostly are
the delicacies of the season in short and flavored by a brand of old madeira which has been the pride of many seasons
it is the juno brand a glorious wine fragrant and full of gentle might a bottledup happiness put by for use a golden liquid worth more than liquid gold so rare and admirable that veteran winebibbers count it among their epochs to have tasted it
it drives away the heartache and substitutes no headache
could the judge but quaff a glass it might enable him to shake off the unaccountable lethargy which for the ten intervening minutes and five to boot are already past has made him such a laggard at this momentous dinner
it would all but revive a dead man
would you like to sip it now judge pyncheon
alas this dinner
have you really forgotten its true object
then let us whisper it that you may start at once out of the oaken chair which really seems to be enchanted like the one in comus or that in which moll pitcher imprisoned your own grandfather
but ambition is a talisman more powerful than witchcraft
start up then and hurrying through the streets burst in upon the company that they may begin before the fish is spoiled
they wait for you and it is little for your interest that they should wait
these gentlemenneed you be told ithave assembled not without purpose from every quarter of the state
they are practised politicians every man of them and skilled to adjust those preliminary measures which steal from the people without its knowledge the power of choosing its own rulers
the popular voice at the next gubernatorial election though loud as thunder will be really but an echo of what these gentlemen shall speak under their breath at your friends festive board
they meet to decide upon their candidate
this little knot of subtle schemers will control the convention and through it dictate to the party
and what worthier candidatemore wise and learned more noted for philanthropic liberality truer to safe principles tried oftener by public trusts more spotless in private character with a larger stake in the common welfare and deeper grounded by hereditary descent in the faith and practice of the puritanswhat man can be presented for the suffrage of the people so eminently combining all these claims to the chiefrulership as judge pyncheon here before us
make haste then
do your part
the meed for which you have toiled and fought and climbed and crept is ready for your grasp
be present at this dinnerdrink a glass or two of that noble winemake your pledges in as low a whisper as you willand you rise up from table virtually governor of the glorious old state
governor pyncheon of massachusetts
and is there no potent and exhilarating cordial in a certainty like this
it has been the grand purpose of half your lifetime to obtain it
now when there needs little more than to signify your acceptance why do you sit so lumpishly in your greatgreatgrandfathers oaken chair as if preferring it to the gubernatorial one
we have all heard of king log but in these jostling times one of that royal kindred will hardly win the race for an elective chiefmagistracy
well it is absolutely too late for dinner
turtle salmon tautog woodcock boiled turkey southdown mutton pig roastbeef have vanished or exist only in fragments with lukewarm potatoes and gravies crusted over with cold fat
the judge had he done nothing else would have achieved wonders with his knife and fork
it was he you know of whom it used to be said in reference to his ogrelike appetite that his creator made him a great animal but that the dinnerhour made him a great beast
persons of his large sensual endowments must claim indulgence at their feedingtime
but for once the judge is entirely too late for dinner
too late we fear even to join the party at their wine
the guests are warm and merry they have given up the judge and concluding that the freesoilers have him they will fix upon another candidate
were our friend now to stalk in among them with that wideopen stare at once wild and stolid his ungenial presence would be apt to change their cheer
neither would it be seemly in judge pyncheon generally so scrupulous in his attire to show himself at a dinnertable with that crimson stain upon his shirtbosom
by the bye how came it there
it is an ugly sight at any rate and the wisest way for the judge is to button his coat closely over his breast and taking his horse and chaise from the livery stable to make all speed to his own house
there after a glass of brandy and water and a muttonchop a beefsteak a broiled fowl or some such hasty little dinner and supper all in one he had better spend the evening by the fireside
he must toast his slippers a long while in order to get rid of the chilliness which the air of this vile old house has sent curdling through his veins
up therefore judge pyncheon up
you have lost a day
but tomorrow will be here anon
will you rise betimes and make the most of it
tomorrow
tomorrow
tomorrow
we that are alive may rise betimes tomorrow
as for him that has died today his morrow will be the resurrection morn
meanwhile the twilight is glooming upward out of the corners of the room
the shadows of the tall furniture grow deeper and at first become more definite then spreading wider they lose their distinctness of outline in the dark gray tide of oblivion as it were that creeps slowly over the various objects and the one human figure sitting in the midst of them
the gloom has not entered from without it has brooded here all day and now taking its own inevitable time will possess itself of everything
the judges face indeed rigid and singularly white refuses to melt into this universal solvent
fainter and fainter grows the light
it is as if another doublehandful of darkness had been scattered through the air
now it is no longer gray but sable
there is still a faint appearance at the window neither a glow nor a gleam nor a glimmerany phrase of light would express something far brighter than this doubtful perception or sense rather that there is a window there
has it yet vanished
noyesnot quite
and there is still the swarthy whitenesswe shall venture to marry these illagreeing wordsthe swarthy whiteness of judge pyncheons face
the features are all gone there is only the paleness of them left
and how looks it now
there is no window
there is no face
an infinite inscrutable blackness has annihilated sight
where is our universe
all crumbled away from us and we adrift in chaos may hearken to the gusts of homeless wind that go sighing and murmuring about in quest of what was once a world
is there no other sound
one other and a fearful one
it is the ticking of the judges watch which ever since hepzibah left the room in search of clifford he has been holding in his hand
be the cause what it may this little quiet neverceasing throb of times pulse repeating its small strokes with such busy regularity in judge pyncheons motionless hand has an effect of terror which we do not find in any other accompaniment of the scene
but listen
that puff of the breeze was louder
it had a tone unlike the dreary and sullen one which has bemoaned itself and afflicted all mankind with miserable sympathy for five days past
the wind has veered about
it now comes boisterously from the northwest and taking hold of the aged framework of the seven gables gives it a shake like a wrestler that would try strength with his antagonist
another and another sturdy tussle with the blast
the old house creaks again and makes a vociferous but somewhat unintelligible bellowing in its sooty throat the big flue we mean of its wide chimney partly in complaint at the rude wind but rather as befits their century and a half of hostile intimacy in tough defiance
a rumbling kind of a bluster roars behind the fireboard
a door has slammed above stairs
a window perhaps has been left open or else is driven in by an unruly gust
it is not to be conceived beforehand what wonderful windinstruments are these old timber mansions and how haunted with the strangest noises which immediately begin to sing and sigh and sob and shriekand to smite with sledgehammers airy but ponderous in some distant chamberand to tread along the entries as with stately footsteps and rustle up and down the staircase as with silks miraculously stiffwhenever the gale catches the house with a window open and gets fairly into it
would that we were not an attendant spirit here
it is too awful
this clamor of the wind through the lonely house the judges quietude as he sits invisible and that pertinacious ticking of his watch
as regards judge pyncheons invisibility however that matter will soon be remedied
the northwest wind has swept the sky clear
the window is distinctly seen
through its panes moreover we dimly catch the sweep of the dark clustering foliage outside fluttering with a constant irregularity of movement and letting in a peep of starlight now here now there
oftener than any other object these glimpses illuminate the judges face
but here comes more effectual light
observe that silvery dance upon the upper branches of the peartree and now a little lower and now on the whole mass of boughs while through their shifting intricacies the moonbeams fall aslant into the room
they play over the judges figure and show that he has not stirred throughout the hours of darkness
they follow the shadows in changeful sport across his unchanging features
they gleam upon his watch
his grasp conceals the dialplatebut we know that the faithful hands have met for one of the city clocks tells midnight
a man of sturdy understanding like judge pyncheon cares no more for twelve oclock at night than for the corresponding hour of noon
however just the parallel drawn in some of the preceding pages between his puritan ancestor and himself it fails in this point
the pyncheon of two centuries ago in common with most of his contemporaries professed his full belief in spiritual ministrations although reckoning them chiefly of a malignant character
the pyncheon of tonight who sits in yonder armchair believes in no such nonsense
such at least was his creed some few hours since
his hair will not bristle therefore at the stories whichin times when chimneycorners had benches in them where old people sat poking into the ashes of the past and raking out traditions like live coalsused to be told about this very room of his ancestral house
in fact these tales are too absurd to bristle even childhoods hair
what sense meaning or moral for example such as even ghoststories should be susceptible of can be traced in the ridiculous legend that at midnight all the dead pyncheons are bound to assemble in this parlor
and pray for what
why to see whether the portrait of their ancestor still keeps its place upon the wall in compliance with his testamentary directions
is it worth while to come out of their graves for that
we are tempted to make a little sport with the idea
ghoststories are hardly to be treated seriously any longer
the familyparty of the defunct pyncheons we presume goes off in this wise
first comes the ancestor himself in his black cloak steeplehat and trunkbreeches girt about the waist with a leathern belt in which hangs his steelhilted sword he has a long staff in his hand such as gentlemen in advanced life used to carry as much for the dignity of the thing as for the support to be derived from it
he looks up at the portrait a thing of no substance gazing at its own painted image
all is safe
the picture is still there
the purpose of his brain has been kept sacred thus long after the man himself has sprouted up in graveyard grass
see
he lifts his ineffectual hand and tries the frame
all safe
but is that a smileis it not rather a frown of deadly import that darkens over the shadow of his features
the stout colonel is dissatisfied
so decided is his look of discontent as to impart additional distinctness to his features through which nevertheless the moonlight passes and flickers on the wall beyond
something has strangely vexed the ancestor
with a grim shake of the head he turns away
here come other pyncheons the whole tribe in their half a dozen generations jostling and elbowing one another to reach the picture
we behold aged men and grandames a clergyman with the puritanic stiffness still in his garb and mien and a redcoated officer of the old french war and there comes the shopkeeping pyncheon of a century ago with the ruffles turned back from his wrists and there the periwigged and brocaded gentleman of the artists legend with the beautiful and pensive alice who brings no pride out of her virgin grave
all try the pictureframe
what do these ghostly people seek
a mother lifts her child that his little hands may touch it
there is evidently a mystery about the picture that perplexes these poor pyncheons when they ought to be at rest
in a corner meanwhile stands the figure of an elderly man in a leathern jerkin and breeches with a carpenters rule sticking out of his side pocket he points his finger at the bearded colonel and his descendants nodding jeering mocking and finally bursting into obstreperous though inaudible laughter
indulging our fancy in this freak we have partly lost the power of restraint and guidance
we distinguish an unlookedfor figure in our visionary scene
among those ancestral people there is a young man dressed in the very fashion of today he wears a dark frockcoat almost destitute of skirts gray pantaloons gaiter boots of patent leather and has a finely wrought gold chain across his breast and a little silverheaded whalebone stick in his hand
were we to meet this figure at noonday we should greet him as young jaffrey pyncheon the judges only surviving child who has been spending the last two years in foreign travel
if still in life how comes his shadow hither
if dead what a misfortune
the old pyncheon property together with the great estate acquired by the young mans father would devolve on whom
on poor foolish clifford gaunt hepzibah and rustic little phbe
but another and a greater marvel greets us
can we believe our eyes
a stout elderly gentleman has made his appearance he has an aspect of eminent respectability wears a black coat and pantaloons of roomy width and might be pronounced scrupulously neat in his attire but for a broad crimson stain across his snowy neckcloth and down his shirtbosom
is it the judge or no
how can it be judge pyncheon
we discern his figure as plainly as the flickering moonbeams can show us anything still seated in the oaken chair
be the apparition whose it may it advances to the picture seems to seize the frame tries to peep behind it and turns away with a frown as black as the ancestral one
the fantastic scene just hinted at must by no means be considered as forming an actual portion of our story
we were betrayed into this brief extravagance by the quiver of the moonbeams they dance handinhand with shadows and are reflected in the lookingglass which you are aware is always a kind of window or doorway into the spiritual world
we needed relief moreover from our too long and exclusive contemplation of that figure in the chair
this wild wind too has tossed our thoughts into strange confusion but without tearing them away from their one determined centre
yonder leaden judge sits immovably upon our soul
will he never stir again
we shall go mad unless he stirs
you may the better estimate his quietude by the fearlessness of a little mouse which sits on its hind legs in a streak of moonlight close by judge pyncheons foot and seems to meditate a journey of exploration over this great black bulk
ha
what has startled the nimble little mouse
it is the visage of grimalkin outside of the window where he appears to have posted himself for a deliberate watch
this grimalkin has a very ugly look
is it a cat watching for a mouse or the devil for a human soul
would we could scare him from the window
thank heaven the night is wellnigh past
the moonbeams have no longer so silvery a gleam nor contrast so strongly with the blackness of the shadows among which they fall
they are paler now the shadows look gray not black
the boisterous wind is hushed
what is the hour
ah
the watch has at last ceased to tick for the judges forgetful fingers neglected to wind it up as usual at ten oclock being half an hour or so before his ordinary bedtimeand it has run down for the first time in five years
but the great worldclock of time still keeps its beat
the dreary nightfor oh how dreary seems its haunted waste behind usgives place to a fresh transparent cloudless morn
blessed blessed radiance
the daybeameven what little of it finds its way into this always dusky parlorseems part of the universal benediction annulling evil and rendering all goodness possible and happiness attainable
will judge pyncheon now rise up from his chair
will he go forth and receive the early sunbeams on his brow
will he begin this new daywhich god has smiled upon and blessed and given to mankindwill he begin it with better purposes than the many that have been spent amiss
or are all the deeplaid schemes of yesterday as stubborn in his heart and as busy in his brain as ever
in this latter case there is much to do
will the judge still insist with hepzibah on the interview with clifford
will he buy a safe elderly gentlemans horse
will he persuade the purchaser of the old pyncheon property to relinquish the bargain in his favor
will he see his family physician and obtain a medicine that shall preserve him to be an honor and blessing to his race until the utmost term of patriarchal longevity
will judge pyncheon above all make due apologies to that company of honorable friends and satisfy them that his absence from the festive board was unavoidable and so fully retrieve himself in their good opinion that he shall yet be governor of massachusetts
and all these great purposes accomplished will he walk the streets again with that dogday smile of elaborate benevolence sultry enough to tempt flies to come and buzz in it
or will he after the tomblike seclusion of the past day and night go forth a humbled and repentant man sorrowful gentle seeking no profit shrinking from worldly honor hardly daring to love god but bold to love his fellow man and to do him what good he may
will he bear about with himno odious grin of feigned benignity insolent in its pretence and loathsome in its falsehoodbut the tender sadness of a contrite heart broken at last beneath its own weight of sin
for it is our belief whatever show of honor he may have piled upon it that there was heavy sin at the base of this mans being
rise up judge pyncheon
the morning sunshine glimmers through the foliage and beautiful and holy as it is shuns not to kindle up your face
rise up thou subtle worldly selfish ironhearted hypocrite and make thy choice whether still to be subtle worldly selfish ironhearted and hypocritical or to tear these sins out of thy nature though they bring the lifeblood with them
the avenger is upon thee
rise up before it be too late
what
thou art not stirred by this last appeal
no not a jot
and there we see a flyone of your common houseflies such as are always buzzing on the windowpanewhich has smelt out governor pyncheon and alights now on his forehead now on his chin and now heaven help us
is creeping over the bridge of his nose towards the wouldbe chiefmagistrates wideopen eyes
canst thou not brush the fly away
art thou too sluggish
thou man that hadst so many busy projects yesterday
art thou too weak that wast so powerful
not brush away a fly
nay then we give thee up
and hark
the shopbell rings
after hours like these latter ones through which we have borne our heavy tale it is good to be made sensible that there is a living world and that even this old lonely mansion retains some manner of connection with it
we breathe more freely emerging from judge pyncheons presence into the street before the seven gables
xix
alices posies   uncle venner trundling a wheelbarrow was the earliest person stirring in the neighborhood the day after the storm
pyncheon street in front of the house of the seven gables was a far pleasanter scene than a bylane confined by shabby fences and bordered with wooden dwellings of the meaner class could reasonably be expected to present
nature made sweet amends that morning for the five unkindly days which had preceded it
it would have been enough to live for merely to look up at the wide benediction of the sky or as much of it as was visible between the houses genial once more with sunshine
every object was agreeable whether to be gazed at in the breadth or examined more minutely
such for example were the wellwashed pebbles and gravel of the sidewalk even the skyreflecting pools in the centre of the street and the grass now freshly verdant that crept along the base of the fences on the other side of which if one peeped over was seen the multifarious growth of gardens
vegetable productions of whatever kind seemed more than negatively happy in the juicy warmth and abundance of their life
the pyncheon elm throughout its great circumference was all alive and full of the morning sun and a sweettempered little breeze which lingered within this verdant sphere and set a thousand leafy tongues awhispering all at once
this aged tree appeared to have suffered nothing from the gale
it had kept its boughs unshattered and its full complement of leaves and the whole in perfect verdure except a single branch that by the earlier change with which the elmtree sometimes prophesies the autumn had been transmuted to bright gold
it was like the golden branch that gained aeneas and the sibyl admittance into hades
this one mystic branch hung down before the main entrance of the seven gables so nigh the ground that any passerby might have stood on tiptoe and plucked it off
presented at the door it would have been a symbol of his right to enter and be made acquainted with all the secrets of the house
so little faith is due to external appearance that there was really an inviting aspect over the venerable edifice conveying an idea that its history must be a decorous and happy one and such as would be delightful for a fireside tale
its windows gleamed cheerfully in the slanting sunlight
the lines and tufts of green moss here and there seemed pledges of familiarity and sisterhood with nature as if this human dwellingplace being of such old date had established its prescriptive title among primeval oaks and whatever other objects by virtue of their long continuance have acquired a gracious right to be
a person of imaginative temperament while passing by the house would turn once and again and peruse it well its many peaks consenting together in the clustered chimney the deep projection over its basementstory the arched window imparting a look if not of grandeur yet of antique gentility to the broken portal over which it opened the luxuriance of gigantic burdocks near the threshold he would note all these characteristics and be conscious of something deeper than he saw
he would conceive the mansion to have been the residence of the stubborn old puritan integrity who dying in some forgotten generation had left a blessing in all its rooms and chambers the efficacy of which was to be seen in the religion honesty moderate competence or upright poverty and solid happiness of his descendants to this day
one object above all others would take root in the imaginative observers memory
it was the great tuft of flowersweeds you would have called them only a week agothe tuft of crimsonspotted flowers in the angle between the two front gables
the old people used to give them the name of alices posies in remembrance of fair alice pyncheon who was believed to have brought their seeds from italy
they were flaunting in rich beauty and full bloom today and seemed as it were a mystic expression that something within the house was consummated
it was but little after sunrise when uncle venner made his appearance as aforesaid impelling a wheelbarrow along the street
he was going his matutinal rounds to collect cabbageleaves turniptops potatoskins and the miscellaneous refuse of the dinnerpot which the thrifty housewives of the neighborhood were accustomed to put aside as fit only to feed a pig
uncle venners pig was fed entirely and kept in prime order on these eleemosynary contributions insomuch that the patched philosopher used to promise that before retiring to his farm he would make a feast of the portly grunter and invite all his neighbors to partake of the joints and spareribs which they had helped to fatten
miss hepzibah pyncheons housekeeping had so greatly improved since clifford became a member of the family that her share of the banquet would have been no lean one and uncle venner accordingly was a good deal disappointed not to find the large earthen pan full of fragmentary eatables that ordinarily awaited his coming at the back doorstep of the seven gables
i never knew miss hepzibah so forgetful before said the patriarch to himself
she must have had a dinner yesterdayno question of that
she always has one nowadays
so wheres the potliquor and potatoskins i ask
shall i knock and see if shes stirring yet
no notwont do
if little phbe was about the house i should not mind knocking but miss hepzibah likely as not would scowl down at me out of the window and look cross even if she felt pleasantly
so ill come back at noon  with these reflections the old man was shutting the gate of the little backyard
creaking on its hinges however like every other gate and door about the premises the sound reached the ears of the occupant of the northern gable one of the windows of which had a sideview towards the gate
goodmorning uncle venner said the daguerreotypist leaning out of the window
do you hear nobody stirring  not a soul said the man of patches
but thats no wonder
tis barely half an hour past sunrise yet
but im really glad to see you mr holgrave
theres a strange lonesome look about this side of the house so that my heart misgave me somehow or other and i felt as if there was nobody alive in it
the front of the house looks a good deal cheerier and alices posies are blooming there beautifully and if i were a young man mr holgrave my sweetheart should have one of those flowers in her bosom though i risked my neck climbing for it
well and did the wind keep you awake last night  it did indeed answered the artist smiling
if i were a believer in ghostsand i dont quite know whether i am or noti should have concluded that all the old pyncheons were running riot in the lower rooms especially in miss hepzibahs part of the house
but it is very quiet now  yes miss hepzibah will be apt to oversleep herself after being disturbed all night with the racket said uncle venner
but it would be odd now wouldnt it if the judge had taken both his cousins into the country along with him
i saw him go into the shop yesterday  at what hour inquired holgrave
oh along in the forenoon said the old man
well well
i must go my rounds and so must my wheelbarrow
but ill be back here at dinnertime for my pig likes a dinner as well as a breakfast
no mealtime and no sort of victuals ever seems to come amiss to my pig
good morning to you
and mr holgrave if i were a young man like you id get one of alices posies and keep it in water till phbe comes back  i have heard said the daguerreotypist as he drew in his head that the water of maules well suits those flowers best  here the conversation ceased and uncle venner went on his way
for half an hour longer nothing disturbed the repose of the seven gables nor was there any visitor except a carrierboy who as he passed the front doorstep threw down one of his newspapers for hepzibah of late had regularly taken it in
after a while there came a fat woman making prodigious speed and stumbling as she ran up the steps of the shopdoor
her face glowed with fireheat and it being a pretty warm morning she bubbled and hissed as it were as if all afry with chimneywarmth and summerwarmth and the warmth of her own corpulent velocity
she tried the shopdoor it was fast
she tried it again with so angry a jar that the bell tinkled angrily back at her
the deuce take old maid pyncheon muttered the irascible housewife
think of her pretending to set up a centshop and then lying abed till noon
these are what she calls gentlefolks airs i suppose
but ill either start her ladyship or break the door down  she shook it accordingly and the bell having a spiteful little temper of its own rang obstreperously making its remonstrances heardnot indeed by the ears for which they were intendedbut by a good lady on the opposite side of the street
she opened the window and addressed the impatient applicant
youll find nobody there mrs gubbins  but i must and will find somebody here cried mrs gubbins inflicting another outrage on the bell
i want a halfpound of pork to fry some firstrate flounders for mr gubbinss breakfast and lady or not old maid pyncheon shall get up and serve me with it  but do hear reason mrs gubbins responded the lady opposite
she and her brother too have both gone to their cousins judge pyncheons at his countryseat
theres not a soul in the house but that young daguerreotypeman that sleeps in the north gable
i saw old hepzibah and clifford go away yesterday and a queer couple of ducks they were paddling through the mudpuddles
theyre gone ill assure you  and how do you know theyre gone to the judges asked mrs gubbins
hes a rich man and theres been a quarrel between him and hepzibah this many a day because he wont give her a living
thats the main reason of her setting up a centshop  i know that well enough said the neighbor
but theyre gonethats one thing certain
and who but a blood relation that couldnt help himself i ask you would take in that awfultempered old maid and that dreadful clifford
thats it you may be sure  mrs gubbins took her departure still brimming over with hot wrath against the absent hepzibah
for another halfhour or perhaps considerably more there was almost as much quiet on the outside of the house as within
the elm however made a pleasant cheerful sunny sigh responsive to the breeze that was elsewhere imperceptible a swarm of insects buzzed merrily under its drooping shadow and became specks of light whenever they darted into the sunshine a locust sang once or twice in some inscrutable seclusion of the tree and a solitary little bird with plumage of pale gold came and hovered about alices posies
at last our small acquaintance ned higgins trudged up the street on his way to school and happening for the first time in a fortnight to be the possessor of a cent he could by no means get past the shopdoor of the seven gables
but it would not open
again and again however and half a dozen other agains with the inexorable pertinacity of a child intent upon some object important to itself did he renew his efforts for admittance
he had doubtless set his heart upon an elephant or possibly with hamlet he meant to eat a crocodile
in response to his more violent attacks the bell gave now and then a moderate tinkle but could not be stirred into clamor by any exertion of the little fellows childish and tiptoe strength
holding by the doorhandle he peeped through a crevice of the curtain and saw that the inner door communicating with the passage towards the parlor was closed
miss pyncheon screamed the child rapping on the windowpane i want an elephant  there being no answer to several repetitions of the summons ned began to grow impatient and his little pot of passion quickly boiling over he picked up a stone with a naughty purpose to fling it through the window at the same time blubbering and sputtering with wrath
a manone of two who happened to be passing bycaught the urchins arm
whats the trouble old gentleman he asked
i want old hepzibah or phbe or any of them answered ned sobbing
they wont open the door and i cant get my elephant  go to school you little scamp said the man
theres another centshop round the corner
tis very strange dixey added he to his companion whats become of all these pyncheons
smith the liverystable keeper tells me judge pyncheon put his horse up yesterday to stand till after dinner and has not taken him away yet
and one of the judges hired men has been in this morning to make inquiry about him
hes a kind of person they say that seldom breaks his habits or stays out o nights  oh hell turn up safe enough said dixey
and as for old maid pyncheon take my word for it she has run in debt and gone off from her creditors
i foretold you remember the first morning she set up shop that her devilish scowl would frighten away customers
they couldnt stand it  i never thought shed make it go remarked his friend
this business of centshops is overdone among the womenfolks
my wife tried it and lost five dollars on her outlay  poor business said dixey shaking his head
poor business  in the course of the morning there were various other attempts to open a communication with the supposed inhabitants of this silent and impenetrable mansion
the man of rootbeer came in his neatly painted wagon with a couple of dozen full bottles to be exchanged for empty ones the baker with a lot of crackers which hepzibah had ordered for her retail custom the butcher with a nice titbit which he fancied she would be eager to secure for clifford
had any observer of these proceedings been aware of the fearful secret hidden within the house it would have affected him with a singular shape and modification of horror to see the current of human life making this small eddy hereaboutswhirling sticks straws and all such trifles round and round right over the black depth where a dead corpse lay unseen
the butcher was so much in earnest with his sweetbread of lamb or whatever the dainty might be that he tried every accessible door of the seven gables and at length came round again to the shop where he ordinarily found admittance
its a nice article and i know the old lady would jump at it said he to himself
she cant be gone away
in fifteen years that i have driven my cart through pyncheon street ive never known her to be away from home though often enough to be sure a man might knock all day without bringing her to the door
but that was when shed only herself to provide for  peeping through the same crevice of the curtain where only a little while before the urchin of elephantine appetite had peeped the butcher beheld the inner door not closed as the child had seen it but ajar and almost wide open
however it might have happened it was the fact
through the passageway there was a dark vista into the lighter but still obscure interior of the parlor
it appeared to the butcher that he could pretty clearly discern what seemed to be the stalwart legs clad in black pantaloons of a man sitting in a large oaken chair the back of which concealed all the remainder of his figure
this contemptuous tranquillity on the part of an occupant of the house in response to the butchers indefatigable efforts to attract notice so piqued the man of flesh that he determined to withdraw
so thought he there sits old maid pyncheons bloody brother while ive been giving myself all this trouble
why if a hog hadnt more manners id stick him
i call it demeaning a mans business to trade with such people and from this time forth if they want a sausage or an ounce of liver they shall run after the cart for it  he tossed the titbit angrily into his cart and drove off in a pet
not a great while afterwards there was a sound of music turning the corner and approaching down the street with several intervals of silence and then a renewed and nearer outbreak of brisk melody
a mob of children was seen moving onward or stopping in unison with the sound which appeared to proceed from the centre of the throng so that they were loosely bound together by slender strains of harmony and drawn along captive with ever and anon an accession of some little fellow in an apron and strawhat capering forth from door or gateway
arriving under the shadow of the pyncheon elm it proved to be the italian boy who with his monkey and show of puppets had once before played his hurdygurdy beneath the arched window
the pleasant face of phbeand doubtless too the liberal recompense which she had flung himstill dwelt in his remembrance
his expressive features kindled up as he recognized the spot where this trifling incident of his erratic life had chanced
he entered the neglected yard now wilder than ever with its growth of hogweed and burdock stationed himself on the doorstep of the main entrance and opening his showbox began to play
each individual of the automatic community forthwith set to work according to his or her proper vocation the monkey taking off his highland bonnet bowed and scraped to the bystanders most obsequiously with ever an observant eye to pick up a stray cent and the young foreigner himself as he turned the crank of his machine glanced upward to the arched window expectant of a presence that would make his music the livelier and sweeter
the throng of children stood near some on the sidewalk some within the yard two or three establishing themselves on the very doorstep and one squatting on the threshold
meanwhile the locust kept singing in the great old pyncheon elm
i dont hear anybody in the house said one of the children to another
the monkey wont pick up anything here  there is somebody at home affirmed the urchin on the threshold
i heard a step  still the young italians eye turned sidelong upward and it really seemed as if the touch of genuine though slight and almost playful emotion communicated a juicier sweetness to the dry mechanical process of his minstrelsy
these wanderers are readily responsive to any natural kindnessbe it no more than a smile or a word itself not understood but only a warmth in itwhich befalls them on the roadside of life
they remember these things because they are the little enchantments which for the instantfor the space that reflects a landscape in a soapbubblebuild up a home about them
therefore the italian boy would not be discouraged by the heavy silence with which the old house seemed resolute to clog the vivacity of his instrument
he persisted in his melodious appeals he still looked upward trusting that his dark alien countenance would soon be brightened by phbes sunny aspect
neither could he be willing to depart without again beholding clifford whose sensibility like phbes smile had talked a kind of hearts language to the foreigner
he repeated all his music over and over again until his auditors were getting weary
so were the little wooden people in his showbox and the monkey most of all
there was no response save the singing of the locust
no children live in this house said a schoolboy at last
nobody lives here but an old maid and an old man
youll get nothing here
why dont you go along  you fool you why do you tell him whispered a shrewd little yankee caring nothing for the music but a good deal for the cheap rate at which it was had
let him play as he likes
if theres nobody to pay him thats his own lookout  once more however the italian ran over his round of melodies
to the common observerwho could understand nothing of the case except the music and the sunshine on the hither side of the doorit might have been amusing to watch the pertinacity of the streetperformer
will he succeed at last
will that stubborn door be suddenly flung open
will a group of joyous children the young ones of the house come dancing shouting laughing into the open air and cluster round the showbox looking with eager merriment at the puppets and tossing each a copper for longtailed mammon the monkey to pick up
but to us who know the inner heart of the seven gables as well as its exterior face there is a ghastly effect in this repetition of light popular tunes at its doorstep
it would be an ugly business indeed if judge pyncheon who would not have cared a fig for paganinis fiddle in his most harmonious mood should make his appearance at the door with a bloody shirtbosom and a grim frown on his swarthily white visage and motion the foreign vagabond away
was ever before such a grinding out of jigs and waltzes where nobody was in the cue to dance
yes very often
this contrast or intermingling of tragedy with mirth happens daily hourly momently
the gloomy and desolate old house deserted of life and with awful death sitting sternly in its solitude was the emblem of many a human heart which nevertheless is compelled to hear the thrill and echo of the worlds gayety around it
before the conclusion of the italians performance a couple of men happened to be passing on their way to dinner
i say you young french fellow called out one of themcome away from that doorstep and go somewhere else with your nonsense
the pyncheon family live there and they are in great trouble just about this time
they dont feel musical today
it is reported all over town that judge pyncheon who owns the house has been murdered and the city marshal is going to look into the matter
so be off with you at once  as the italian shouldered his hurdygurdy he saw on the doorstep a card which had been covered all the morning by the newspaper that the carrier had flung upon it but was now shuffled into sight
he picked it up and perceiving something written in pencil gave it to the man to read
in fact it was an engraved card of judge pyncheons with certain pencilled memoranda on the back referring to various businesses which it had been his purpose to transact during the preceding day
it formed a prospective epitome of the days history only that affairs had not turned out altogether in accordance with the programme
the card must have been lost from the judges vestpocket in his preliminary attempt to gain access by the main entrance of the house
though well soaked with rain it was still partially legible
look here dixey cried the man
this has something to do with judge pyncheon
seeheres his name printed on it and here i suppose is some of his handwriting  lets go to the city marshal with it said dixey
it may give him just the clew he wants
after all whispered he in his companions ear it would be no wonder if the judge has gone into that door and never come out again
a certain cousin of his may have been at his old tricks
and old maid pyncheon having got herself in debt by the centshopand the judges pocketbook being well filledand bad blood amongst them already
put all these things together and see what they make  hush hush whispered the other
it seems like a sin to be the first to speak of such a thing
but i think with you that we had better go to the city marshal  yes yes said dixey
welli always said there was something devilish in that womans scowl  the men wheeled about accordingly and retraced their steps up the street
the italian also made the best of his way off with a parting glance up at the arched window
as for the children they took to their heels with one accord and scampered as if some giant or ogre were in pursuit until at a good distance from the house they stopped as suddenly and simultaneously as they had set out
their susceptible nerves took an indefinite alarm from what they had overheard
looking back at the grotesque peaks and shadowy angles of the old mansion they fancied a gloom diffused about it which no brightness of the sunshine could dispel
an imaginary hepzibah scowled and shook her finger at them from several windows at the same moment
an imaginary cliffordfor and it would have deeply wounded him to know it he had always been a horror to these small peoplestood behind the unreal hepzibah making awful gestures in a faded dressinggown
children are even more apt if possible than grown people to catch the contagion of a panic terror
for the rest of the day the more timid went whole streets about for the sake of avoiding the seven gables while the bolder signalized their hardihood by challenging their comrades to race past the mansion at full speed
it could not have been more than half an hour after the disappearance of the italian boy with his unseasonable melodies when a cab drove down the street
it stopped beneath the pyncheon elm the cabman took a trunk a canvas bag and a bandbox from the top of his vehicle and deposited them on the doorstep of the old house a straw bonnet and then the pretty figure of a young girl came into view from the interior of the cab
it was phbe
though not altogether so blooming as when she first tripped into our storyfor in the few intervening weeks her experiences had made her graver more womanly and deepereyed in token of a heart that had begun to suspect its depthsstill there was the quiet glow of natural sunshine over her
neither had she forfeited her proper gift of making things look real rather than fantastic within her sphere
yet we feel it to be a questionable venture even for phbe at this juncture to cross the threshold of the seven gables
is her healthful presence potent enough to chase away the crowd of pale hideous and sinful phantoms that have gained admittance there since her departure
or will she likewise fade sicken sadden and grow into deformity and be only another pallid phantom to glide noiselessly up and down the stairs and affright children as she pauses at the window
at least we would gladly forewarn the unsuspecting girl that there is nothing in human shape or substance to receive her unless it be the figure of judge pyncheon whowretched spectacle that he is and frightful in our remembrance since our nightlong vigil with himstill keeps his place in the oaken chair
phbe first tried the shopdoor
it did not yield to her hand and the white curtain drawn across the window which formed the upper section of the door struck her quick perceptive faculty as something unusual
without making another effort to enter here she betook herself to the great portal under the arched window
finding it fastened she knocked
a reverberation came from the emptiness within
she knocked again and a third time and listening intently fancied that the floor creaked as if hepzibah were coming with her ordinary tiptoe movement to admit her
but so dead a silence ensued upon this imaginary sound that she began to question whether she might not have mistaken the house familiar as she thought herself with its exterior
her notice was now attracted by a childs voice at some distance
it appeared to call her name
looking in the direction whence it proceeded phbe saw little ned higgins a good way down the street stamping shaking his head violently making deprecatory gestures with both hands and shouting to her at mouthwide screech
no no phbe he screamed
dont you go in
theres something wicked there
dontdontdont go in  but as the little personage could not be induced to approach near enough to explain himself phbe concluded that he had been frightened on some of his visits to the shop by her cousin hepzibah for the good ladys manifestations in truth ran about an equal chance of scaring children out of their wits or compelling them to unseemly laughter
still she felt the more for this incident how unaccountably silent and impenetrable the house had become
as her next resort phbe made her way into the garden where on so warm and bright a day as the present she had little doubt of finding clifford and perhaps hepzibah also idling away the noontide in the shadow of the arbor
immediately on her entering the garden gate the family of hens half ran half flew to meet her while a strange grimalkin which was prowling under the parlor window took to his heels clambered hastily over the fence and vanished
the arbor was vacant and its floor table and circular bench were still damp and bestrewn with twigs and the disarray of the past storm
the growth of the garden seemed to have got quite out of bounds the weeds had taken advantage of phbes absence and the longcontinued rain to run rampant over the flowers and kitchenvegetables
maules well had overflowed its stone border and made a pool of formidable breadth in that corner of the garden
the impression of the whole scene was that of a spot where no human foot had left its print for many preceding daysprobably not since phbes departurefor she saw a sidecomb of her own under the table of the arbor where it must have fallen on the last afternoon when she and clifford sat there
the girl knew that her two relatives were capable of far greater oddities than that of shutting themselves up in their old house as they appeared now to have done
nevertheless with indistinct misgivings of something amiss and apprehensions to which she could not give shape she approached the door that formed the customary communication between the house and garden
it was secured within like the two which she had already tried
she knocked however and immediately as if the application had been expected the door was drawn open by a considerable exertion of some unseen persons strength not wide but far enough to afford her a sidelong entrance
as hepzibah in order not to expose herself to inspection from without invariably opened a door in this manner phbe necessarily concluded that it was her cousin who now admitted her
without hesitation therefore she stepped across the threshold and had no sooner entered than the door closed behind her
xx
the flower of eden   phbe coming so suddenly from the sunny daylight was altogether bedimmed in such density of shadow as lurked in most of the passages of the old house
she was not at first aware by whom she had been admitted
before her eyes had adapted themselves to the obscurity a hand grasped her own with a firm but gentle and warm pressure thus imparting a welcome which caused her heart to leap and thrill with an indefinable shiver of enjoyment
she felt herself drawn along not towards the parlor but into a large and unoccupied apartment which had formerly been the grand receptionroom of the seven gables
the sunshine came freely into all the uncurtained windows of this room and fell upon the dusty floor so that phbe now clearly sawwhat indeed had been no secret after the encounter of a warm hand with hersthat it was not hepzibah nor clifford but holgrave to whom she owed her reception
the subtile intuitive communication or rather the vague and formless impression of something to be told had made her yield unresistingly to his impulse
without taking away her hand she looked eagerly in his face not quick to forebode evil but unavoidably conscious that the state of the family had changed since her departure and therefore anxious for an explanation
the artist looked paler than ordinary there was a thoughtful and severe contraction of his forehead tracing a deep vertical line between the eyebrows
his smile however was full of genuine warmth and had in it a joy by far the most vivid expression that phbe had ever witnessed shining out of the new england reserve with which holgrave habitually masked whatever lay near his heart
it was the look wherewith a man brooding alone over some fearful object in a dreary forest or illimitable desert would recognize the familiar aspect of his dearest friend bringing up all the peaceful ideas that belong to home and the gentle current of everyday affairs
and yet as he felt the necessity of responding to her look of inquiry the smile disappeared
i ought not to rejoice that you have come phbe said he
we meet at a strange moment  what has happened she exclaimed
why is the house so deserted
where are hepzibah and clifford  gone
i cannot imagine where they are answered holgrave
we are alone in the house  hepzibah and clifford gone cried phbe
it is not possible
and why have you brought me into this room instead of the parlor
ah something terrible has happened
i must run and see  no no phbe said holgrave holding her back
it is as i have told you
they are gone and i know not whither
a terrible event has indeed happened but not to them nor as i undoubtingly believe through any agency of theirs
if i read your character rightly phbe he continued fixing his eyes on hers with stern anxiety intermixed with tenderness gentle as you are and seeming to have your sphere among common things you yet possess remarkable strength
you have wonderful poise and a faculty which when tested will prove itself capable of dealing with matters that fall far out of the ordinary rule  oh no i am very weak replied phbe trembling
but tell me what has happened  you are strong persisted holgrave
you must be both strong and wise for i am all astray and need your counsel
it may be you can suggest the one right thing to do  tell metell me said phbe all in a tremble
it oppressesit terrifies methis mystery
anything else i can bear  the artist hesitated
notwithstanding what he had just said and most sincerely in regard to the selfbalancing power with which phbe impressed him it still seemed almost wicked to bring the awful secret of yesterday to her knowledge
it was like dragging a hideous shape of death into the cleanly and cheerful space before a household fire where it would present all the uglier aspect amid the decorousness of everything about it
yet it could not be concealed from her she must needs know it
phbe said he do you remember this he put into her hand a daguerreotype the same that he had shown her at their first interview in the garden and which so strikingly brought out the hard and relentless traits of the original
what has this to do with hepzibah and clifford asked phbe with impatient surprise that holgrave should so trifle with her at such a moment
it is judge pyncheon
you have shown it to me before  but here is the same face taken within this halfhour said the artist presenting her with another miniature
i had just finished it when i heard you at the door  this is death shuddered phbe turning very pale
judge pyncheon dead  such as there represented said holgrave he sits in the next room
the judge is dead and clifford and hepzibah have vanished
i know no more
all beyond is conjecture
on returning to my solitary chamber last evening i noticed no light either in the parlor or hepzibahs room or cliffords no stir nor footstep about the house
this morning there was the same deathlike quiet
from my window i overheard the testimony of a neighbor that your relatives were seen leaving the house in the midst of yesterdays storm
a rumor reached me too of judge pyncheon being missed
a feeling which i cannot describean indefinite sense of some catastrophe or consummationimpelled me to make my way into this part of the house where i discovered what you see
as a point of evidence that may be useful to clifford and also as a memorial valuable to myselffor phbe there are hereditary reasons that connect me strangely with that mans fatei used the means at my disposal to preserve this pictorial record of judge pyncheons death  even in her agitation phbe could not help remarking the calmness of holgraves demeanor
he appeared it is true to feel the whole awfulness of the judges death yet had received the fact into his mind without any mixture of surprise but as an event preordained happening inevitably and so fitting itself into past occurrences that it could almost have been prophesied
why have you not thrown open the doors and called in witnesses inquired she with a painful shudder
it is terrible to be here alone  but clifford suggested the artist
clifford and hepzibah
we must consider what is best to be done in their behalf
it is a wretched fatality that they should have disappeared
their flight will throw the worst coloring over this event of which it is susceptible
yet how easy is the explanation to those who know them
bewildered and terrorstricken by the similarity of this death to a former one which was attended with such disastrous consequences to clifford they have had no idea but of removing themselves from the scene
how miserably unfortunate
had hepzibah but shrieked aloudhad clifford flung wide the door and proclaimed judge pyncheons deathit would have been however awful in itself an event fruitful of good consequences to them
as i view it it would have gone far towards obliterating the black stain on cliffords character  and how asked phbe could any good come from what is so very dreadful  because said the artist if the matter can be fairly considered and candidly interpreted it must be evident that judge pyncheon could not have come unfairly to his end
this mode of death had been an idiosyncrasy with his family for generations past not often occurring indeed but when it does occur usually attacking individuals about the judges time of life and generally in the tension of some mental crisis or perhaps in an access of wrath
old maules prophecy was probably founded on a knowledge of this physical predisposition in the pyncheon race
now there is a minute and almost exact similarity in the appearances connected with the death that occurred yesterday and those recorded of the death of cliffords uncle thirty years ago
it is true there was a certain arrangement of circumstances unnecessary to be recounted which made it possible nay as men look at these things probable or even certainthat old jaffrey pyncheon came to a violent death and by cliffords hands  whence came those circumstances exclaimed phbe
he being innocent as we know him to be  they were arranged said holgraveat least such has long been my convictionthey were arranged after the uncles death and before it was made public by the man who sits in yonder parlor
his own death so like that former one yet attended by none of those suspicious circumstances seems the stroke of god upon him at once a punishment for his wickedness and making plain the innocence of clifford
but this flightit distorts everything
he may be in concealment near at hand
could we but bring him back before the discovery of the judges death the evil might be rectified  we must not hide this thing a moment longer said phbe
it is dreadful to keep it so closely in our hearts
clifford is innocent
god will make it manifest
let us throw open the doors and call all the neighborhood to see the truth  you are right phbe rejoined holgrave
doubtless you are right  yet the artist did not feel the horror which was proper to phbes sweet and orderloving character at thus finding herself at issue with society and brought in contact with an event that transcended ordinary rules
neither was he in haste like her to betake himself within the precincts of common life
on the contrary he gathered a wild enjoymentas it were a flower of strange beauty growing in a desolate spot and blossoming in the windsuch a flower of momentary happiness he gathered from his present position
it separated phbe and himself from the world and bound them to each other by their exclusive knowledge of judge pyncheons mysterious death and the counsel which they were forced to hold respecting it
the secret so long as it should continue such kept them within the circle of a spell a solitude in the midst of men a remoteness as entire as that of an island in midocean once divulged the ocean would flow betwixt them standing on its widely sundered shores
meanwhile all the circumstances of their situation seemed to draw them together they were like two children who go hand in hand pressing closely to one anothers side through a shadowhaunted passage
the image of awful death which filled the house held them united by his stiffened grasp
these influences hastened the development of emotions that might not otherwise have flowered so
possibly indeed it had been holgraves purpose to let them die in their undeveloped germs
why do we delay so asked phbe
this secret takes away my breath
let us throw open the doors  in all our lives there can never come another moment like this said holgrave
phbe is it all terrornothing but terror
are you conscious of no joy as i am that has made this the only point of life worth living for  it seems a sin replied phbe trembling to think of joy at such a time  could you but know phbe how it was with me the hour before you came exclaimed the artist
a dark cold miserable hour
the presence of yonder dead man threw a great black shadow over everything he made the universe so far as my perception could reach a scene of guilt and of retribution more dreadful than the guilt
the sense of it took away my youth
i never hoped to feel young again
the world looked strange wild evil hostile my past life so lonesome and dreary my future a shapeless gloom which i must mould into gloomy shapes
but phbe you crossed the threshold and hope warmth and joy came in with you
the black moment became at once a blissful one
it must not pass without the spoken word
i love you  how can you love a simple girl like me asked phbe compelled by his earnestness to speak
you have many many thoughts with which i should try in vain to sympathize
and ii tooi have tendencies with which you would sympathize as little
that is less matter
but i have not scope enough to make you happy  you are my only possibility of happiness answered holgrave
i have no faith in it except as you bestow it on me  and theni am afraid continued phbe shrinking towards holgrave even while she told him so frankly the doubts with which he affected her
you will lead me out of my own quiet path
you will make me strive to follow you where it is pathless
i cannot do so
it is not my nature
i shall sink down and perish  ah phbe exclaimed holgrave with almost a sigh and a smile that was burdened with thought
it will be far otherwise than as you forebode
the world owes all its onward impulses to men ill at ease
the happy man inevitably confines himself within ancient limits
i have a presentiment that hereafter it will be my lot to set out trees to make fencesperhaps even in due time to build a house for another generationin a word to conform myself to laws and the peaceful practice of society
your poise will be more powerful than any oscillating tendency of mine  i would not have it so said phbe earnestly
do you love me asked holgrave
if we love one another the moment has room for nothing more
let us pause upon it and be satisfied
do you love me phbe  you look into my heart said she letting her eyes drop
you know i love you  and it was in this hour so full of doubt and awe that the one miracle was wrought without which every human existence is a blank
the bliss which makes all things true beautiful and holy shone around this youth and maiden
they were conscious of nothing sad nor old
they transfigured the earth and made it eden again and themselves the two first dwellers in it
the dead man so close beside them was forgotten
at such a crisis there is no death for immortality is revealed anew and embraces everything in its hallowed atmosphere
but how soon the heavy earthdream settled down again
hark whispered phbe
somebody is at the street door  now let us meet the world said holgrave
no doubt the rumor of judge pyncheons visit to this house and the flight of hepzibah and clifford is about to lead to the investigation of the premises
we have no way but to meet it
let us open the door at once  but to their surprise before they could reach the street dooreven before they quitted the room in which the foregoing interview had passedthey heard footsteps in the farther passage
the door therefore which they supposed to be securely lockedwhich holgrave indeed had seen to be so and at which phbe had vainly tried to entermust have been opened from without
the sound of footsteps was not harsh bold decided and intrusive as the gait of strangers would naturally be making authoritative entrance into a dwelling where they knew themselves unwelcome
it was feeble as of persons either weak or weary there was the mingled murmur of two voices familiar to both the listeners
can it be whispered holgrave
it is they answered phbe
thank godthank god  and then as if in sympathy with phbes whispered ejaculation they heard hepzibahs voice more distinctly
thank god my brother we are at home  wellyesthank god responded clifford
a dreary home hepzibah
but you have done well to bring me hither
stay
that parlor door is open
i cannot pass by it
let me go and rest me in the arbor where i usedoh very long ago it seems to me after what has befallen uswhere i used to be so happy with little phbe  but the house was not altogether so dreary as clifford imagined it
they had not made many stepsin truth they were lingering in the entry with the listlessness of an accomplished purpose uncertain what to do nextwhen phbe ran to meet them
on beholding her hepzibah burst into tears
with all her might she had staggered onward beneath the burden of grief and responsibility until now that it was safe to fling it down
indeed she had not energy to fling it down but had ceased to uphold it and suffered it to press her to the earth
clifford appeared the stronger of the two
it is our own little phbeah
and holgrave with her exclaimed he with a glance of keen and delicate insight and a smile beautiful kind but melancholy
i thought of you both as we came down the street and beheld alices posies in full bloom
and so the flower of eden has bloomed likewise in this old darksome house today     xxi
the departure   the sudden death of so prominent a member of the social world as the honorable judge jaffrey pyncheon created a sensation at least in the circles more immediately connected with the deceased which had hardly quite subsided in a fortnight
it may be remarked however that of all the events which constitute a persons biography there is scarcely onenone certainly of anything like a similar importanceto which the world so easily reconciles itself as to his death
in most other cases and contingencies the individual is present among us mixed up with the daily revolution of affairs and affording a definite point for observation
at his decease there is only a vacancy and a momentary eddyvery small as compared with the apparent magnitude of the ingurgitated objectand a bubble or two ascending out of the black depth and bursting at the surface
as regarded judge pyncheon it seemed probable at first blush that the mode of his final departure might give him a larger and longer posthumous vogue than ordinarily attends the memory of a distinguished man
but when it came to be understood on the highest professional authority that the event was a natural andexcept for some unimportant particulars denoting a slight idiosyncrasyby no means an unusual form of death the public with its customary alacrity proceeded to forget that he had ever lived
in short the honorable judge was beginning to be a stale subject before half the country newspapers had found time to put their columns in mourning and publish his exceedingly eulogistic obituary
nevertheless creeping darkly through the places which this excellent person had haunted in his lifetime there was a hidden stream of private talk such as it would have shocked all decency to speak loudly at the streetcorners
it is very singular how the fact of a mans death often seems to give people a truer idea of his character whether for good or evil than they have ever possessed while he was living and acting among them
death is so genuine a fact that it excludes falsehood or betrays its emptiness it is a touchstone that proves the gold and dishonors the baser metal
could the departed whoever he may be return in a week after his decease he would almost invariably find himself at a higher or lower point than he had formerly occupied on the scale of public appreciation
but the talk or scandal to which we now allude had reference to matters of no less old a date than the supposed murder thirty or forty years ago of the late judge pyncheons uncle
the medical opinion with regard to his own recent and regretted decease had almost entirely obviated the idea that a murder was committed in the former case
yet as the record showed there were circumstances irrefragably indicating that some person had gained access to old jaffrey pyncheons private apartments at or near the moment of his death
his desk and private drawers in a room contiguous to his bedchamber had been ransacked money and valuable articles were missing there was a bloody handprint on the old mans linen and by a powerfully welded chain of deductive evidence the guilt of the robbery and apparent murder had been fixed on clifford then residing with his uncle in the house of the seven gables
whencesoever originating there now arose a theory that undertook so to account for these circumstances as to exclude the idea of cliffords agency
many persons affirmed that the history and elucidation of the facts long so mysterious had been obtained by the daguerreotypist from one of those mesmerical seers who nowadays so strangely perplex the aspect of human affairs and put everybodys natural vision to the blush by the marvels which they see with their eyes shut
according to this version of the story judge pyncheon exemplary as we have portrayed him in our narrative was in his youth an apparently irreclaimable scapegrace
the brutish the animal instincts as is often the case had been developed earlier than the intellectual qualities and the force of character for which he was afterwards remarkable
he had shown himself wild dissipated addicted to low pleasures little short of ruffianly in his propensities and recklessly expensive with no other resources than the bounty of his uncle
this course of conduct had alienated the old bachelors affection once strongly fixed upon him
now it is averredbut whether on authority available in a court of justice we do not pretend to have investigatedthat the young man was tempted by the devil one night to search his uncles private drawers to which he had unsuspected means of access
while thus criminally occupied he was startled by the opening of the chamberdoor
there stood old jaffrey pyncheon in his nightclothes
the surprise of such a discovery his agitation alarm and horror brought on the crisis of a disorder to which the old bachelor had an hereditary liability he seemed to choke with blood and fell upon the floor striking his temple a heavy blow against the corner of a table
what was to be done
the old man was surely dead
assistance would come too late
what a misfortune indeed should it come too soon since his reviving consciousness would bring the recollection of the ignominious offence which he had beheld his nephew in the very act of committing
but he never did revive
with the cool hardihood that always pertained to him the young man continued his search of the drawers and found a will of recent date in favor of cliffordwhich he destroyedand an older one in his own favor which he suffered to remain
but before retiring jaffrey bethought himself of the evidence in these ransacked drawers that some one had visited the chamber with sinister purposes
suspicion unless averted might fix upon the real offender
in the very presence of the dead man therefore he laid a scheme that should free himself at the expense of clifford his rival for whose character he had at once a contempt and a repugnance
it is not probable be it said that he acted with any set purpose of involving clifford in a charge of murder
knowing that his uncle did not die by violence it may not have occurred to him in the hurry of the crisis that such an inference might be drawn
but when the affair took this darker aspect jaffreys previous steps had already pledged him to those which remained
so craftily had he arranged the circumstances that at cliffords trial his cousin hardly found it necessary to swear to anything false but only to withhold the one decisive explanation by refraining to state what he had himself done and witnessed
thus jaffrey pyncheons inward criminality as regarded clifford was indeed black and damnable while its mere outward show and positive commission was the smallest that could possibly consist with so great a sin
this is just the sort of guilt that a man of eminent respectability finds it easiest to dispose of
it was suffered to fade out of sight or be reckoned a venial matter in the honorable judge pyncheons long subsequent survey of his own life
he shuffled it aside among the forgotten and forgiven frailties of his youth and seldom thought of it again
we leave the judge to his repose
he could not be styled fortunate at the hour of death
unknowingly he was a childless man while striving to add more wealth to his only childs inheritance
hardly a week after his decease one of the cunard steamers brought intelligence of the death by cholera of judge pyncheons son just at the point of embarkation for his native land
by this misfortune clifford became rich so did hepzibah so did our little village maiden and through her that sworn foe of wealth and all manner of conservatismthe wild reformerholgrave
it was now far too late in cliffords life for the good opinion of society to be worth the trouble and anguish of a formal vindication
what he needed was the love of a very few not the admiration or even the respect of the unknown many
the latter might probably have been won for him had those on whom the guardianship of his welfare had fallen deemed it advisable to expose clifford to a miserable resuscitation of past ideas when the condition of whatever comfort he might expect lay in the calm of forgetfulness
after such wrong as he had suffered there is no reparation
the pitiable mockery of it which the world might have been ready enough to offer coming so long after the agony had done its utmost work would have been fit only to provoke bitterer laughter than poor clifford was ever capable of
it is a truth and it would be a very sad one but for the higher hopes which it suggests that no great mistake whether acted or endured in our mortal sphere is ever really set right
time the continual vicissitude of circumstances and the invariable inopportunity of death render it impossible
if after long lapse of years the right seems to be in our power we find no niche to set it in
the better remedy is for the sufferer to pass on and leave what he once thought his irreparable ruin far behind him
the shock of judge pyncheons death had a permanently invigorating and ultimately beneficial effect on clifford
that strong and ponderous man had been cliffords nightmare
there was no free breath to be drawn within the sphere of so malevolent an influence
the first effect of freedom as we have witnessed in cliffords aimless flight was a tremulous exhilaration
subsiding from it he did not sink into his former intellectual apathy
he never it is true attained to nearly the full measure of what might have been his faculties
but he recovered enough of them partially to light up his character to display some outline of the marvellous grace that was abortive in it and to make him the object of no less deep although less melancholy interest than heretofore
he was evidently happy
could we pause to give another picture of his daily life with all the appliances now at command to gratify his instinct for the beautiful the garden scenes that seemed so sweet to him would look mean and trivial in comparison
very soon after their change of fortune clifford hepzibah and little phbe with the approval of the artist concluded to remove from the dismal old house of the seven gables and take up their abode for the present at the elegant countryseat of the late judge pyncheon
chanticleer and his family had already been transported thither where the two hens had forthwith begun an indefatigable process of egglaying with an evident design as a matter of duty and conscience to continue their illustrious breed under better auspices than for a century past
on the day set for their departure the principal personages of our story including good uncle venner were assembled in the parlor
the countryhouse is certainly a very fine one so far as the plan goes observed holgrave as the party were discussing their future arrangements
but i wonder that the late judgebeing so opulent and with a reasonable prospect of transmitting his wealth to descendants of his ownshould not have felt the propriety of embodying so excellent a piece of domestic architecture in stone rather than in wood
then every generation of the family might have altered the interior to suit its own taste and convenience while the exterior through the lapse of years might have been adding venerableness to its original beauty and thus giving that impression of permanence which i consider essential to the happiness of any one moment  why cried phbe gazing into the artists face with infinite amazement how wonderfully your ideas are changed
a house of stone indeed
it is but two or three weeks ago that you seemed to wish people to live in something as fragile and temporary as a birdsnest  ah phbe i told you how it would be said the artist with a halfmelancholy laugh
you find me a conservative already
little did i think ever to become one
it is especially unpardonable in this dwelling of so much hereditary misfortune and under the eye of yonder portrait of a model conservative who in that very character rendered himself so long the evil destiny of his race  that picture said clifford seeming to shrink from its stern glance
whenever i look at it there is an old dreamy recollection haunting me but keeping just beyond the grasp of my mind
wealth it seems to sayboundless wealthunimaginable wealth
i could fancy that when i was a child or a youth that portrait had spoken and told me a rich secret or had held forth its hand with the written record of hidden opulence
but those old matters are so dim with me nowadays
what could this dream have been  perhaps i can recall it answered holgrave
see
there are a hundred chances to one that no person unacquainted with the secret would ever touch this spring  a secret spring cried clifford
ah i remember now
i did discover it one summer afternoon when i was idling and dreaming about the house long long ago
but the mystery escapes me  the artist put his finger on the contrivance to which he had referred
in former days the effect would probably have been to cause the picture to start forward
but in so long a period of concealment the machinery had been eaten through with rust so that at holgraves pressure the portrait frame and all tumbled suddenly from its position and lay face downward on the floor
a recess in the wall was thus brought to light in which lay an object so covered with a centurys dust that it could not immediately be recognized as a folded sheet of parchment
holgrave opened it and displayed an ancient deed signed with the hieroglyphics of several indian sagamores and conveying to colonel pyncheon and his heirs forever a vast extent of territory at the eastward
this is the very parchment the attempt to recover which cost the beautiful alice pyncheon her happiness and life said the artist alluding to his legend
it is what the pyncheons sought in vain while it was valuable and now that they find the treasure it has long been worthless  poor cousin jaffrey
this is what deceived him exclaimed hepzibah
when they were young together clifford probably made a kind of fairytale of this discovery
he was always dreaming hither and thither about the house and lighting up its dark corners with beautiful stories
and poor jaffrey who took hold of everything as if it were real thought my brother had found out his uncles wealth
he died with this delusion in his mind  but said phbe apart to holgrave how came you to know the secret  my dearest phbe said holgrave how will it please you to assume the name of maule
as for the secret it is the only inheritance that has come down to me from my ancestors
you should have known sooner only that i was afraid of frightening you away that in this long drama of wrong and retribution i represent the old wizard and am probably as much a wizard as ever he was
the son of the executed matthew maule while building this house took the opportunity to construct that recess and hide away the indian deed on which depended the immense landclaim of the pyncheons
thus they bartered their eastern territory for maules gardenground  and now said uncle venner i suppose their whole claim is not worth one mans share in my farm yonder  uncle venner cried phbe taking the patched philosophers hand you must never talk any more about your farm
you shall never go there as long as you live
there is a cottage in our new gardenthe prettiest little yellowishbrown cottage you ever saw and the sweetestlooking place for it looks just as if it were made of gingerbreadand we are going to fit it up and furnish it on purpose for you
and you shall do nothing but what you choose and shall be as happy as the day is long and shall keep cousin clifford in spirits with the wisdom and pleasantness which is always dropping from your lips  ah
my dear child quoth good uncle venner quite overcome if you were to speak to a young man as you do to an old one his chance of keeping his heart another minute would not be worth one of the buttons on my waistcoat
andsoul alivethat great sigh which you made me heave has burst off the very last of them
but never mind
it was the happiest sigh i ever did heave and it seems as if i must have drawn in a gulp of heavenly breath to make it with
well well miss phbe
theyll miss me in the gardens hereabouts and round by the back doors and pyncheon street im afraid will hardly look the same without old uncle venner who remembers it with a mowing field on one side and the garden of the seven gables on the other
but either i must go to your countryseat or you must come to my farmthats one of two things certain and i leave you to choose which  oh come with us by all means uncle venner said clifford who had a remarkable enjoyment of the old mans mellow quiet and simple spirit
i want you always to be within five minutes saunter of my chair
you are the only philosopher i ever knew of whose wisdom has not a drop of bitter essence at the bottom  dear me cried uncle venner beginning partly to realize what manner of man he was
and yet folks used to set me down among the simple ones in my younger days
but i suppose i am like a roxbury russeta great deal the better the longer i can be kept
yes and my words of wisdom that you and phbe tell me of are like the golden dandelions which never grow in the hot months but may be seen glistening among the withered grass and under the dry leaves sometimes as late as december
and you are welcome friends to my mess of dandelions if there were twice as many  a plain but handsome darkgreen barouche had now drawn up in front of the ruinous portal of the old mansionhouse
the party came forth and with the exception of good uncle venner who was to follow in a few days proceeded to take their places
they were chatting and laughing very pleasantly together andas proves to be often the case at moments when we ought to palpitate with sensibilityclifford and hepzibah bade a final farewell to the abode of their forefathers with hardly more emotion than if they had made it their arrangement to return thither at teatime
several children were drawn to the spot by so unusual a spectacle as the barouche and pair of gray horses
recognizing little ned higgins among them hepzibah put her hand into her pocket and presented the urchin her earliest and staunchest customer with silver enough to people the domdaniel cavern of his interior with as various a procession of quadrupeds as passed into the ark
two men were passing just as the barouche drove off
well dixey said one of them what do you think of this
my wife kept a centshop three months and lost five dollars on her outlay
old maid pyncheon has been in trade just about as long and rides off in her carriage with a couple of hundred thousandreckoning her share and cliffords and phbesand some say twice as much
if you choose to call it luck it is all very well but if we are to take it as the will of providence why i cant exactly fathom it  pretty good business quoth the sagacious dixeypretty good business  maules well all this time though left in solitude was throwing up a succession of kaleidoscopic pictures in which a gifted eye might have seen foreshadowed the coming fortunes of hepzibah and clifford and the descendant of the legendary wizard and the village maiden over whom he had thrown loves web of sorcery
the pyncheon elm moreover with what foliage the september gale had spared to it whispered unintelligible prophecies
and wise uncle venner passing slowly from the ruinous porch seemed to hear a strain of music and fancied that sweet alice pyncheonafter witnessing these deeds this bygone woe and this present happiness of her kindred mortalshad given one farewell touch of a spirits joy upon her harpsichord as she floated heavenward from the house of the seven gables

the revelation of the scarlet letter  xxiv
conclusion     the customhouse  introductory to the scarlet letter   it is a little remarkable thatthough disinclined to talk overmuch of myself and my affairs at the fireside and to my personal friendsan autobiographical impulse should twice in my life have taken possession of me in addressing the public
the first time was three or four years since when i favoured the readerinexcusably and for no earthly reason that either the indulgent reader or the intrusive author could imaginewith a description of my way of life in the deep quietude of an old manse
and nowbecause beyond my deserts i was happy enough to find a listener or two on the former occasioni again seize the public by the button and talk of my three years experience in a customhouse
the example of the famous p
p clerk of this parish was never more faithfully followed
the truth seems to be however that when he casts his leaves forth upon the wind the author addresses not the many who will fling aside his volume or never take it up but the few who will understand him better than most of his schoolmates or lifemates
some authors indeed do far more than this and indulge themselves in such confidential depths of revelation as could fittingly be addressed only and exclusively to the one heart and mind of perfect sympathy as if the printed book thrown at large on the wide world were certain to find out the divided segment of the writers own nature and complete his circle of existence by bringing him into communion with it
it is scarcely decorous however to speak all even where we speak impersonally
but as thoughts are frozen and utterance benumbed unless the speaker stand in some true relation with his audience it may be pardonable to imagine that a friend a kind and apprehensive though not the closest friend is listening to our talk and then a native reserve being thawed by this genial consciousness we may prate of the circumstances that lie around us and even of ourself but still keep the inmost me behind its veil
to this extent and within these limits an author methinks may be autobiographical without violating either the readers rights or his own
it will be seen likewise that this customhouse sketch has a certain propriety of a kind always recognised in literature as explaining how a large portion of the following pages came into my possession and as offering proofs of the authenticity of a narrative therein contained
this in facta desire to put myself in my true position as editor or very little more of the most prolix among the tales that make up my volumethis and no other is my true reason for assuming a personal relation with the public
in accomplishing the main purpose it has appeared allowable by a few extra touches to give a faint representation of a mode of life not heretofore described together with some of the characters that move in it among whom the author happened to make one
in my native town of salem at the head of what half a century ago in the days of old king derby was a bustling wharfbut which is now burdened with decayed wooden warehouses and exhibits few or no symptoms of commercial life except perhaps a bark or brig halfway down its melancholy length discharging hides or nearer at hand a nova scotia schooner pitching out her cargo of firewoodat the head i say of this dilapidated wharf which the tide often overflows and along which at the base and in the rear of the row of buildings the track of many languid years is seen in a border of unthrifty grasshere with a view from its front windows adown this not very enlivening prospect and thence across the harbour stands a spacious edifice of brick
from the loftiest point of its roof during precisely three and a half hours of each forenoon floats or droops in breeze or calm the banner of the republic but with the thirteen stripes turned vertically instead of horizontally and thus indicating that a civil and not a military post of uncle sams government is here established
its front is ornamented with a portico of halfadozen wooden pillars supporting a balcony beneath which a flight of wide granite steps descends towards the street
over the entrance hovers an enormous specimen of the american eagle with outspread wings a shield before her breast and if i recollect aright a bunch of intermingled thunderbolts and barbed arrows in each claw
with the customary infirmity of temper that characterizes this unhappy fowl she appears by the fierceness of her beak and eye and the general truculency of her attitude to threaten mischief to the inoffensive community and especially to warn all citizens careful of their safety against intruding on the premises which she overshadows with her wings
nevertheless vixenly as she looks many people are seeking at this very moment to shelter themselves under the wing of the federal eagle imagining i presume that her bosom has all the softness and snugness of an eiderdown pillow
but she has no great tenderness even in her best of moods and sooner or lateroftener soon than lateis apt to fling off her nestlings with a scratch of her claw a dab of her beak or a rankling wound from her barbed arrows
the pavement round about the abovedescribed edificewhich we may as well name at once as the customhouse of the porthas grass enough growing in its chinks to show that it has not of late days been worn by any multitudinous resort of business
in some months of the year however there often chances a forenoon when affairs move onward with a livelier tread
such occasions might remind the elderly citizen of that period before the last war with england when salem was a port by itself not scorned as she is now by her own merchants and shipowners who permit her wharves to crumble to ruin while their ventures go to swell needlessly and imperceptibly the mighty flood of commerce at new york or boston
on some such morning when three or four vessels happen to have arrived at once usually from africa or south americaor to be on the verge of their departure thitherward there is a sound of frequent feet passing briskly up and down the granite steps
here before his own wife has greeted him you may greet the seaflushed shipmaster just in port with his vessels papers under his arm in a tarnished tin box
here too comes his owner cheerful sombre gracious or in the sulks accordingly as his scheme of the now accomplished voyage has been realized in merchandise that will readily be turned to gold or has buried him under a bulk of incommodities such as nobody will care to rid him of
here likewisethe germ of the wrinklebrowed grizzlybearded careworn merchantwe have the smart young clerk who gets the taste of traffic as a wolfcub does of blood and already sends adventures in his masters ships when he had better be sailing mimic boats upon a millpond
another figure in the scene is the outwardbound sailor in quest of a protection or the recently arrived one pale and feeble seeking a passport to the hospital
nor must we forget the captains of the rusty little schooners that bring firewood from the british provinces a roughlooking set of tarpaulins without the alertness of the yankee aspect but contributing an item of no slight importance to our decaying trade
cluster all these individuals together as they sometimes were with other miscellaneous ones to diversify the group and for the time being it made the customhouse a stirring scene
more frequently however on ascending the steps you would discern in the entry if it were summer time or in their appropriate rooms if wintry or inclement weathersa row of venerable figures sitting in oldfashioned chairs which were tipped on their hind legs back against the wall
oftentimes they were asleep but occasionally might be heard talking together in voices between a speech and a snore and with that lack of energy that distinguishes the occupants of almshouses and all other human beings who depend for subsistence on charity on monopolized labour or anything else but their own independent exertions
these old gentlemenseated like matthew at the receipt of custom but not very liable to be summoned thence like him for apostolic errandswere customhouse officers
furthermore on the left hand as you enter the front door is a certain room or office about fifteen feet square and of a lofty height with two of its arched windows commanding a view of the aforesaid dilapidated wharf and the third looking across a narrow lane and along a portion of derby street
all three give glimpses of the shops of grocers blockmakers slopsellers and shipchandlers around the doors of which are generally to be seen laughing and gossiping clusters of old salts and such other wharfrats as haunt the wapping of a seaport
the room itself is cobwebbed and dingy with old paint its floor is strewn with grey sand in a fashion that has elsewhere fallen into long disuse and it is easy to conclude from the general slovenliness of the place that this is a sanctuary into which womankind with her tools of magic the broom and mop has very infrequent access
in the way of furniture there is a stove with a voluminous funnel an old pine desk with a threelegged stool beside it two or three woodenbottom chairs exceedingly decrepit and infirm andnot to forget the libraryon some shelves a score or two of volumes of the acts of congress and a bulky digest of the revenue laws
a tin pipe ascends through the ceiling and forms a medium of vocal communication with other parts of the edifice
and here some six months agopacing from corner to corner or lounging on the longlegged stool with his elbow on the desk and his eyes wandering up and down the columns of the morning newspaperyou might have recognised honoured reader the same individual who welcomed you into his cheery little study where the sunshine glimmered so pleasantly through the willow branches on the western side of the old manse
but now should you go thither to seek him you would inquire in vain for the locofoco surveyor
the besom of reform hath swept him out of office and a worthier successor wears his dignity and pockets his emoluments
this old town of salemmy native place though i have dwelt much away from it both in boyhood and maturer yearspossesses or did possess a hold on my affection the force of which i have never realized during my seasons of actual residence here
indeed so far as its physical aspect is concerned with its flat unvaried surface covered chiefly with wooden houses few or none of which pretend to architectural beautyits irregularity which is neither picturesque nor quaint but only tameits long and lazy street lounging wearisomely through the whole extent of the peninsula with gallows hill and new guinea at one end and a view of the almshouse at the othersuch being the features of my native town it would be quite as reasonable to form a sentimental attachment to a disarranged checkerboard
and yet though invariably happiest elsewhere there is within me a feeling for old salem which in lack of a better phrase i must be content to call affection
the sentiment is probably assignable to the deep and aged roots which my family has stuck into the soil
it is now nearly two centuries and a quarter since the original briton the earliest emigrant of my name made his appearance in the wild and forestbordered settlement which has since become a city
and here his descendants have been born and died and have mingled their earthly substance with the soil until no small portion of it must necessarily be akin to the mortal frame wherewith for a little while i walk the streets
in part therefore the attachment which i speak of is the mere sensuous sympathy of dust for dust
few of my countrymen can know what it is nor as frequent transplantation is perhaps better for the stock need they consider it desirable to know
but the sentiment has likewise its moral quality
the figure of that first ancestor invested by family tradition with a dim and dusky grandeur was present to my boyish imagination as far back as i can remember
it still haunts me and induces a sort of homefeeling with the past which i scarcely claim in reference to the present phase of the town
i seem to have a stronger claim to a residence here on account of this grave bearded sablecloaked and steeplecrowned progenitorwho came so early with his bible and his sword and trode the unworn street with such a stately port and made so large a figure as a man of war and peacea stronger claim than for myself whose name is seldom heard and my face hardly known
he was a soldier legislator judge he was a ruler in the church he had all the puritanic traits both good and evil
he was likewise a bitter persecutor as witness the quakers who have remembered him in their histories and relate an incident of his hard severity towards a woman of their sect which will last longer it is to be feared than any record of his better deeds although these were many
his son too inherited the persecuting spirit and made himself so conspicuous in the martyrdom of the witches that their blood may fairly be said to have left a stain upon him
so deep a stain indeed that his dry old bones in the charterstreet burialground must still retain it if they have not crumbled utterly to dust
i know not whether these ancestors of mine bethought themselves to repent and ask pardon of heaven for their cruelties or whether they are now groaning under the heavy consequences of them in another state of being
at all events i the present writer as their representative hereby take shame upon myself for their sakes and pray that any curse incurred by themas i have heard and as the dreary and unprosperous condition of the race for many a long year back would argue to existmay be now and henceforth removed
doubtless however either of these stern and blackbrowed puritans would have thought it quite a sufficient retribution for his sins that after so long a lapse of years the old trunk of the family tree with so much venerable moss upon it should have borne as its topmost bough an idler like myself
no aim that i have ever cherished would they recognise as laudable no success of mineif my life beyond its domestic scope had ever been brightened by successwould they deem otherwise than worthless if not positively disgraceful
what is he murmurs one grey shadow of my forefathers to the other
a writer of story books
what kind of business in lifewhat mode of glorifying god or being serviceable to mankind in his day and generationmay that be
why the degenerate fellow might as well have been a fiddler such are the compliments bandied between my great grandsires and myself across the gulf of time
and yet let them scorn me as they will strong traits of their nature have intertwined themselves with mine
planted deep in the towns earliest infancy and childhood by these two earnest and energetic men the race has ever since subsisted here always too in respectability never so far as i have known disgraced by a single unworthy member but seldom or never on the other hand after the first two generations performing any memorable deed or so much as putting forward a claim to public notice
gradually they have sunk almost out of sight as old houses here and there about the streets get covered halfway to the eaves by the accumulation of new soil
from father to son for above a hundred years they followed the sea a greyheaded shipmaster in each generation retiring from the quarterdeck to the homestead while a boy of fourteen took the hereditary place before the mast confronting the salt spray and the gale which had blustered against his sire and grandsire
the boy also in due time passed from the forecastle to the cabin spent a tempestuous manhood and returned from his worldwanderings to grow old and die and mingle his dust with the natal earth
this long connexion of a family with one spot as its place of birth and burial creates a kindred between the human being and the locality quite independent of any charm in the scenery or moral circumstances that surround him
it is not love but instinct
the new inhabitantwho came himself from a foreign land or whose father or grandfather camehas little claim to be called a salemite he has no conception of the oysterlike tenacity with which an old settler over whom his third century is creeping clings to the spot where his successive generations have been embedded
it is no matter that the place is joyless for him that he is weary of the old wooden houses the mud and dust the dead level of site and sentiment the chill east wind and the chillest of social atmospheresall these and whatever faults besides he may see or imagine are nothing to the purpose
the spell survives and just as powerfully as if the natal spot were an earthly paradise
so has it been in my case
i felt it almost as a destiny to make salem my home so that the mould of features and cast of character which had all along been familiar hereever as one representative of the race lay down in the grave another assuming as it were his sentrymarch along the main streetmight still in my little day be seen and recognised in the old town
nevertheless this very sentiment is an evidence that the connexion which has become an unhealthy one should at last be severed
human nature will not flourish any more than a potato if it be planted and replanted for too long a series of generations in the same wornout soil
my children have had other birthplaces and so far as their fortunes may be within my control shall strike their roots into unaccustomed earth
on emerging from the old manse it was chiefly this strange indolent unjoyous attachment for my native town that brought me to fill a place in uncle sams brick edifice when i might as well or better have gone somewhere else
my doom was on me
it was not the first time nor the second that i had gone awayas it seemed permanentlybut yet returned like the bad halfpenny or as if salem were for me the inevitable centre of the universe
so one fine morning i ascended the flight of granite steps with the presidents commission in my pocket and was introduced to the corps of gentlemen who were to aid me in my weighty responsibility as chief executive officer of the customhouse
i doubt greatlyor rather i do not doubt at allwhether any public functionary of the united states either in the civil or military line has ever had such a patriarchal body of veterans under his orders as myself
the whereabouts of the oldest inhabitant was at once settled when i looked at them
for upwards of twenty years before this epoch the independent position of the collector had kept the salem customhouse out of the whirlpool of political vicissitude which makes the tenure of office generally so fragile
a soldiernew englands most distinguished soldierhe stood firmly on the pedestal of his gallant services and himself secure in the wise liberality of the successive administrations through which he had held office he had been the safety of his subordinates in many an hour of danger and heartquake
general miller was radically conservative a man over whose kindly nature habit had no slight influence attaching himself strongly to familiar faces and with difficulty moved to change even when change might have brought unquestionable improvement
thus on taking charge of my department i found few but aged men
they were ancient seacaptains for the most part who after being tossed on every sea and standing up sturdily against lifes tempestuous blast had finally drifted into this quiet nook where with little to disturb them except the periodical terrors of a presidential election they one and all acquired a new lease of existence
though by no means less liable than their fellowmen to age and infirmity they had evidently some talisman or other that kept death at bay
two or three of their number as i was assured being gouty and rheumatic or perhaps bedridden never dreamed of making their appearance at the customhouse during a large part of the year but after a torpid winter would creep out into the warm sunshine of may or june go lazily about what they termed duty and at their own leisure and convenience betake themselves to bed again
i must plead guilty to the charge of abbreviating the official breath of more than one of these venerable servants of the republic
they were allowed on my representation to rest from their arduous labours and soon afterwardsas if their sole principle of life had been zeal for their countrys serviceas i verily believe it waswithdrew to a better world
it is a pious consolation to me that through my interference a sufficient space was allowed them for repentance of the evil and corrupt practices into which as a matter of course every customhouse officer must be supposed to fall
neither the front nor the back entrance of the customhouse opens on the road to paradise
the greater part of my officers were whigs
it was well for their venerable brotherhood that the new surveyor was not a politician and though a faithful democrat in principle neither received nor held his office with any reference to political services
had it been otherwisehad an active politician been put into this influential post to assume the easy task of making head against a whig collector whose infirmities withheld him from the personal administration of his officehardly a man of the old corps would have drawn the breath of official life within a month after the exterminating angel had come up the customhouse steps
according to the received code in such matters it would have been nothing short of duty in a politician to bring every one of those white heads under the axe of the guillotine
it was plain enough to discern that the old fellows dreaded some such discourtesy at my hands
it pained and at the same time amused me to behold the terrors that attended my advent to see a furrowed cheek weatherbeaten by half a century of storm turn ashy pale at the glance of so harmless an individual as myself to detect as one or another addressed me the tremor of a voice which in longpast days had been wont to bellow through a speakingtrumpet hoarsely enough to frighten boreas himself to silence
they knew these excellent old persons that by all established ruleand as regarded some of them weighed by their own lack of efficiency for businessthey ought to have given place to younger men more orthodox in politics and altogether fitter than themselves to serve our common uncle
i knew it too but could never quite find in my heart to act upon the knowledge
much and deservedly to my own discredit therefore and considerably to the detriment of my official conscience they continued during my incumbency to creep about the wharves and loiter up and down the customhouse steps
they spent a good deal of time also asleep in their accustomed corners with their chairs tilted back against the walls awaking however once or twice in the forenoon to bore one another with the several thousandth repetition of old seastories and mouldy jokes that had grown to be passwords and countersigns among them
the discovery was soon made i imagine that the new surveyor had no great harm in him
so with lightsome hearts and the happy consciousness of being usefully employedin their own behalf at least if not for our beloved countrythese good old gentlemen went through the various formalities of office
sagaciously under their spectacles did they peep into the holds of vessels
mighty was their fuss about little matters and marvellous sometimes the obtuseness that allowed greater ones to slip between their fingers
whenever such a mischance occurredwhen a waggonload of valuable merchandise had been smuggled ashore at noonday perhaps and directly beneath their unsuspicious nosesnothing could exceed the vigilance and alacrity with which they proceeded to lock and doublelock and secure with tape and sealingwax all the avenues of the delinquent vessel
instead of a reprimand for their previous negligence the case seemed rather to require an eulogium on their praiseworthy caution after the mischief had happened a grateful recognition of the promptitude of their zeal the moment that there was no longer any remedy
unless people are more than commonly disagreeable it is my foolish habit to contract a kindness for them
the better part of my companions character if it have a better part is that which usually comes uppermost in my regard and forms the type whereby i recognise the man
as most of these old customhouse officers had good traits and as my position in reference to them being paternal and protective was favourable to the growth of friendly sentiments i soon grew to like them all
it was pleasant in the summer forenoonswhen the fervent heat that almost liquefied the rest of the human family merely communicated a genial warmth to their half torpid systemsit was pleasant to hear them chatting in the back entry a row of them all tipped against the wall as usual while the frozen witticisms of past generations were thawed out and came bubbling with laughter from their lips
externally the jollity of aged men has much in common with the mirth of children the intellect any more than a deep sense of humour has little to do with the matter it is with both a gleam that plays upon the surface and imparts a sunny and cheery aspect alike to the green branch and grey mouldering trunk
in one case however it is real sunshine in the other it more resembles the phosphorescent glow of decaying wood
it would be sad injustice the reader must understand to represent all my excellent old friends as in their dotage
in the first place my coadjutors were not invariably old there were men among them in their strength and prime of marked ability and energy and altogether superior to the sluggish and dependent mode of life on which their evil stars had cast them
then moreover the white locks of age were sometimes found to be the thatch of an intellectual tenement in good repair
but as respects the majority of my corps of veterans there will be no wrong done if i characterize them generally as a set of wearisome old souls who had gathered nothing worth preservation from their varied experience of life
they seemed to have flung away all the golden grain of practical wisdom which they had enjoyed so many opportunities of harvesting and most carefully to have stored their memory with the husks
they spoke with far more interest and unction of their mornings breakfast or yesterdays todays or tomorrows dinner than of the shipwreck of forty or fifty years ago and all the worlds wonders which they had witnessed with their youthful eyes
the father of the customhousethe patriarch not only of this little squad of officials but i am bold to say of the respectable body of tidewaiters all over the united stateswas a certain permanent inspector
he might truly be termed a legitimate son of the revenue system dyed in the wool or rather born in the purple since his sire a revolutionary colonel and formerly collector of the port had created an office for him and appointed him to fill it at a period of the early ages which few living men can now remember
this inspector when i first knew him was a man of fourscore years or thereabouts and certainly one of the most wonderful specimens of wintergreen that you would be likely to discover in a lifetimes search
with his florid cheek his compact figure smartly arrayed in a brightbuttoned blue coat his brisk and vigorous step and his hale and hearty aspect altogether he seemednot young indeedbut a kind of new contrivance of mother nature in the shape of man whom age and infirmity had no business to touch
his voice and laugh which perpetually reechoed through the customhouse had nothing of the tremulous quaver and cackle of an old mans utterance they came strutting out of his lungs like the crow of a cock or the blast of a clarion
looking at him merely as an animaland there was very little else to look athe was a most satisfactory object from the thorough healthfulness and wholesomeness of his system and his capacity at that extreme age to enjoy all or nearly all the delights which he had ever aimed at or conceived of
the careless security of his life in the customhouse on a regular income and with but slight and infrequent apprehensions of removal had no doubt contributed to make time pass lightly over him
the original and more potent causes however lay in the rare perfection of his animal nature the moderate proportion of intellect and the very trifling admixture of moral and spiritual ingredients these latter qualities indeed being in barely enough measure to keep the old gentleman from walking on allfours
he possessed no power of thought no depth of feeling no troublesome sensibilities nothing in short but a few commonplace instincts which aided by the cheerful temper which grew inevitably out of his physical wellbeing did duty very respectably and to general acceptance in lieu of a heart
he had been the husband of three wives all long since dead the father of twenty children most of whom at every age of childhood or maturity had likewise returned to dust
here one would suppose might have been sorrow enough to imbue the sunniest disposition through and through with a sable tinge
not so with our old inspector
one brief sigh sufficed to carry off the entire burden of these dismal reminiscences
the next moment he was as ready for sport as any unbreeched infant far readier than the collectors junior clerk who at nineteen years was much the elder and graver man of the two
i used to watch and study this patriarchal personage with i think livelier curiosity than any other form of humanity there presented to my notice
he was in truth a rare phenomenon so perfect in one point of view so shallow so delusive so impalpable such an absolute nonentity in every other
my conclusion was that he had no soul no heart no mind nothing as i have already said but instincts and yet withal so cunningly had the few materials of his character been put together that there was no painful perception of deficiency but on my part an entire contentment with what i found in him
it might be difficultand it was soto conceive how he should exist hereafter so earthly and sensuous did he seem but surely his existence here admitting that it was to terminate with his last breath had been not unkindly given with no higher moral responsibilities than the beasts of the field but with a larger scope of enjoyment than theirs and with all their blessed immunity from the dreariness and duskiness of age
one point in which he had vastly the advantage over his fourfooted brethren was his ability to recollect the good dinners which it had made no small portion of the happiness of his life to eat
his gourmandism was a highly agreeable trait and to hear him talk of roast meat was as appetizing as a pickle or an oyster
as he possessed no higher attribute and neither sacrificed nor vitiated any spiritual endowment by devoting all his energies and ingenuities to subserve the delight and profit of his maw it always pleased and satisfied me to hear him expatiate on fish poultry and butchers meat and the most eligible methods of preparing them for the table
his reminiscences of good cheer however ancient the date of the actual banquet seemed to bring the savour of pig or turkey under ones very nostrils
there were flavours on his palate that had lingered there not less than sixty or seventy years and were still apparently as fresh as that of the mutton chop which he had just devoured for his breakfast
i have heard him smack his lips over dinners every guest at which except himself had long been food for worms
it was marvellous to observe how the ghosts of bygone meals were continually rising up before himnot in anger or retribution but as if grateful for his former appreciation and seeking to reduplicate an endless series of enjoyment at once shadowy and sensual a tenderloin of beef a hindquarter of veal a sparerib of pork a particular chicken or a remarkably praiseworthy turkey which had perhaps adorned his board in the days of the elder adams would be remembered while all the subsequent experience of our race and all the events that brightened or darkened his individual career had gone over him with as little permanent effect as the passing breeze
the chief tragic event of the old mans life so far as i could judge was his mishap with a certain goose which lived and died some twenty or forty years ago a goose of most promising figure but which at table proved so inveterately tough that the carvingknife would make no impression on its carcase and it could only be divided with an axe and handsaw
but it is time to quit this sketch on which however i should be glad to dwell at considerably more length because of all men whom i have ever known this individual was fittest to be a customhouse officer
most persons owing to causes which i may not have space to hint at suffer moral detriment from this peculiar mode of life
the old inspector was incapable of it and were he to continue in office to the end of time would be just as good as he was then and sit down to dinner with just as good an appetite
there is one likeness without which my gallery of customhouse portraits would be strangely incomplete but which my comparatively few opportunities for observation enable me to sketch only in the merest outline
it is that of the collector our gallant old general who after his brilliant military service subsequently to which he had ruled over a wild western territory had come hither twenty years before to spend the decline of his varied and honourable life
the brave soldier had already numbered nearly or quite his threescore years and ten and was pursuing the remainder of his earthly march burdened with infirmities which even the martial music of his own spiritstirring recollections could do little towards lightening
the step was palsied now that had been foremost in the charge
it was only with the assistance of a servant and by leaning his hand heavily on the iron balustrade that he could slowly and painfully ascend the customhouse steps and with a toilsome progress across the floor attain his customary chair beside the fireplace
there he used to sit gazing with a somewhat dim serenity of aspect at the figures that came and went amid the rustle of papers the administering of oaths the discussion of business and the casual talk of the office all which sounds and circumstances seemed but indistinctly to impress his senses and hardly to make their way into his inner sphere of contemplation
his countenance in this repose was mild and kindly
if his notice was sought an expression of courtesy and interest gleamed out upon his features proving that there was light within him and that it was only the outward medium of the intellectual lamp that obstructed the rays in their passage
the closer you penetrated to the substance of his mind the sounder it appeared
when no longer called upon to speak or listeneither of which operations cost him an evident efforthis face would briefly subside into its former not uncheerful quietude
it was not painful to behold this look for though dim it had not the imbecility of decaying age
the framework of his nature originally strong and massive was not yet crumpled into ruin
to observe and define his character however under such disadvantages was as difficult a task as to trace out and build up anew in imagination an old fortress like ticonderoga from a view of its grey and broken ruins
here and there perchance the walls may remain almost complete but elsewhere may be only a shapeless mound cumbrous with its very strength and overgrown through long years of peace and neglect with grass and alien weeds
nevertheless looking at the old warrior with affectionfor slight as was the communication between us my feeling towards him like that of all bipeds and quadrupeds who knew him might not improperly be termed soi could discern the main points of his portrait
it was marked with the noble and heroic qualities which showed it to be not a mere accident but of good right that he had won a distinguished name
his spirit could never i conceive have been characterized by an uneasy activity it must at any period of his life have required an impulse to set him in motion but once stirred up with obstacles to overcome and an adequate object to be attained it was not in the man to give out or fail
the heat that had formerly pervaded his nature and which was not yet extinct was never of the kind that flashes and flickers in a blaze but rather a deep red glow as of iron in a furnace
weight solidity firmnessthis was the expression of his repose even in such decay as had crept untimely over him at the period of which i speak
but i could imagine even then that under some excitement which should go deeply into his consciousnessroused by a trumpets peal loud enough to awaken all of his energies that were not dead but only slumberinghe was yet capable of flinging off his infirmities like a sick mans gown dropping the staff of age to seize a battlesword and starting up once more a warrior
and in so intense a moment his demeanour would have still been calm
such an exhibition however was but to be pictured in fancy not to be anticipated nor desired
what i saw in himas evidently as the indestructible ramparts of old ticonderoga already cited as the most appropriate similewas the features of stubborn and ponderous endurance which might well have amounted to obstinacy in his earlier days of integrity that like most of his other endowments lay in a somewhat heavy mass and was just as unmalleable or unmanageable as a ton of iron ore and of benevolence which fiercely as he led the bayonets on at chippewa or fort erie i take to be of quite as genuine a stamp as what actuates any or all the polemical philanthropists of the age
he had slain men with his own hand for aught i knowcertainly they had fallen like blades of grass at the sweep of the scythe before the charge to which his spirit imparted its triumphant energybut be that as it might there was never in his heart so much cruelty as would have brushed the down off a butterflys wing
i have not known the man to whose innate kindliness i would more confidently make an appeal
many characteristicsand those too which contribute not the least forcibly to impart resemblance in a sketchmust have vanished or been obscured before i met the general
all merely graceful attributes are usually the most evanescent nor does nature adorn the human ruin with blossoms of new beauty that have their roots and proper nutriment only in the chinks and crevices of decay as she sows wallflowers over the ruined fortress of ticonderoga
still even in respect of grace and beauty there were points well worth noting
a ray of humour now and then would make its way through the veil of dim obstruction and glimmer pleasantly upon our faces
a trait of native elegance seldom seen in the masculine character after childhood or early youth was shown in the generals fondness for the sight and fragrance of flowers
an old soldier might be supposed to prize only the bloody laurel on his brow but here was one who seemed to have a young girls appreciation of the floral tribe
there beside the fireplace the brave old general used to sit while the surveyorthough seldom when it could be avoided taking upon himself the difficult task of engaging him in conversationwas fond of standing at a distance and watching his quiet and almost slumberous countenance
he seemed away from us although we saw him but a few yards off remote though we passed close beside his chair unattainable though we might have stretched forth our hands and touched his own
it might be that he lived a more real life within his thoughts than amid the unappropriate environment of the collectors office
the evolutions of the parade the tumult of the battle the flourish of old heroic music heard thirty years beforesuch scenes and sounds perhaps were all alive before his intellectual sense
meanwhile the merchants and shipmasters the spruce clerks and uncouth sailors entered and departed the bustle of his commercial and customhouse life kept up its little murmur round about him and neither with the men nor their affairs did the general appear to sustain the most distant relation
he was as much out of place as an old swordnow rusty but which had flashed once in the battles front and showed still a bright gleam along its bladewould have been among the inkstands paperfolders and mahogany rulers on the deputy collectors desk
there was one thing that much aided me in renewing and recreating the stalwart soldier of the niagara frontierthe man of true and simple energy
it was the recollection of those memorable words of hisill try sirspoken on the very verge of a desperate and heroic enterprise and breathing the soul and spirit of new england hardihood comprehending all perils and encountering all
if in our country valour were rewarded by heraldic honour this phrasewhich it seems so easy to speak but which only he with such a task of danger and glory before him has ever spokenwould be the best and fittest of all mottoes for the generals shield of arms
it contributes greatly towards a mans moral and intellectual health to be brought into habits of companionship with individuals unlike himself who care little for his pursuits and whose sphere and abilities he must go out of himself to appreciate
the accidents of my life have often afforded me this advantage but never with more fulness and variety than during my continuance in office
there was one man especially the observation of whose character gave me a new idea of talent
his gifts were emphatically those of a man of business prompt acute clearminded with an eye that saw through all perplexities and a faculty of arrangement that made them vanish as by the waving of an enchanters wand
bred up from boyhood in the customhouse it was his proper field of activity and the many intricacies of business so harassing to the interloper presented themselves before him with the regularity of a perfectly comprehended system
in my contemplation he stood as the ideal of his class
he was indeed the customhouse in himself or at all events the mainspring that kept its variously revolving wheels in motion for in an institution like this where its officers are appointed to subserve their own profit and convenience and seldom with a leading reference to their fitness for the duty to be performed they must perforce seek elsewhere the dexterity which is not in them
thus by an inevitable necessity as a magnet attracts steelfilings so did our man of business draw to himself the difficulties which everybody met with
with an easy condescension and kind forbearance towards our stupiditywhich to his order of mind must have seemed little short of crimewould he forthwith by the merest touch of his finger make the incomprehensible as clear as daylight
the merchants valued him not less than we his esoteric friends
his integrity was perfect it was a law of nature with him rather than a choice or a principle nor can it be otherwise than the main condition of an intellect so remarkably clear and accurate as his to be honest and regular in the administration of affairs
a stain on his conscience as to anything that came within the range of his vocation would trouble such a man very much in the same way though to a far greater degree than an error in the balance of an account or an inkblot on the fair page of a book of record
here in a wordand it is a rare instance in my lifei had met with a person thoroughly adapted to the situation which he held
such were some of the people with whom i now found myself connected
i took it in good part at the hands of providence that i was thrown into a position so little akin to my past habits and set myself seriously to gather from it whatever profit was to be had
after my fellowship of toil and impracticable schemes with the dreamy brethren of brook farm after living for three years within the subtle influence of an intellect like emersons after those wild free days on the assabeth indulging fantastic speculations beside our fire of fallen boughs with ellery channing after talking with thoreau about pinetrees and indian relics in his hermitage at walden after growing fastidious by sympathy with the classic refinement of hillards culture after becoming imbued with poetic sentiment at longfellows hearthstoneit was time at length that i should exercise other faculties of my nature and nourish myself with food for which i had hitherto had little appetite
even the old inspector was desirable as a change of diet to a man who had known alcott
i looked upon it as an evidence in some measure of a system naturally well balanced and lacking no essential part of a thorough organization that with such associates to remember i could mingle at once with men of altogether different qualities and never murmur at the change
literature its exertions and objects were now of little moment in my regard
i cared not at this period for books they were apart from me
natureexcept it were human naturethe nature that is developed in earth and sky was in one sense hidden from me and all the imaginative delight wherewith it had been spiritualized passed away out of my mind
a gift a faculty if it had not been departed was suspended and inanimate within me
there would have been something sad unutterably dreary in all this had i not been conscious that it lay at my own option to recall whatever was valuable in the past
it might be true indeed that this was a life which could not with impunity be lived too long else it might make me permanently other than i had been without transforming me into any shape which it would be worth my while to take
but i never considered it as other than a transitory life
there was always a prophetic instinct a low whisper in my ear that within no long period and whenever a new change of custom should be essential to my good change would come
meanwhile there i was a surveyor of the revenue and so far as i have been able to understand as good a surveyor as need be
a man of thought fancy and sensibility had he ten times the surveyors proportion of those qualities may at any time be a man of affairs if he will only choose to give himself the trouble
my fellowofficers and the merchants and seacaptains with whom my official duties brought me into any manner of connection viewed me in no other light and probably knew me in no other character
none of them i presume had ever read a page of my inditing or would have cared a fig the more for me if they had read them all nor would it have mended the matter in the least had those same unprofitable pages been written with a pen like that of burns or of chaucer each of whom was a customhouse officer in his day as well as i
it is a good lessonthough it may often be a hard onefor a man who has dreamed of literary fame and of making for himself a rank among the worlds dignitaries by such means to step aside out of the narrow circle in which his claims are recognized and to find how utterly devoid of significance beyond that circle is all that he achieves and all he aims at
i know not that i especially needed the lesson either in the way of warning or rebuke but at any rate i learned it thoroughly nor it gives me pleasure to reflect did the truth as it came home to my perception ever cost me a pang or require to be thrown off in a sigh
in the way of literary talk it is true the naval officeran excellent fellow who came into the office with me and went out only a little laterwould often engage me in a discussion about one or the other of his favourite topics napoleon or shakespeare
the collectors junior clerk too a young gentleman who it was whispered occasionally covered a sheet of uncle sams letter paper with what at the distance of a few yards looked very much like poetryused now and then to speak to me of books as matters with which i might possibly be conversant
this was my all of lettered intercourse and it was quite sufficient for my necessities
no longer seeking nor caring that my name should be blasoned abroad on titlepages i smiled to think that it had now another kind of vogue
the customhouse marker imprinted it with a stencil and black paint on pepperbags and baskets of anatto and cigarboxes and bales of all kinds of dutiable merchandise in testimony that these commodities had paid the impost and gone regularly through the office
borne on such queer vehicle of fame a knowledge of my existence so far as a name conveys it was carried where it had never been before and i hope will never go again
but the past was not dead
once in a great while the thoughts that had seemed so vital and so active yet had been put to rest so quietly revived again
one of the most remarkable occasions when the habit of bygone days awoke in me was that which brings it within the law of literary propriety to offer the public the sketch which i am now writing
in the second storey of the customhouse there is a large room in which the brickwork and naked rafters have never been covered with panelling and plaster
the edificeoriginally projected on a scale adapted to the old commercial enterprise of the port and with an idea of subsequent prosperity destined never to be realizedcontains far more space than its occupants know what to do with
this airy hall therefore over the collectors apartments remains unfinished to this day and in spite of the aged cobwebs that festoon its dusky beams appears still to await the labour of the carpenter and mason
at one end of the room in a recess were a number of barrels piled one upon another containing bundles of official documents
large quantities of similar rubbish lay lumbering the floor
it was sorrowful to think how many days and weeks and months and years of toil had been wasted on these musty papers which were now only an encumbrance on earth and were hidden away in this forgotten corner never more to be glanced at by human eyes
but then what reams of other manuscriptsfilled not with the dulness of official formalities but with the thought of inventive brains and the rich effusion of deep heartshad gone equally to oblivion and that moreover without serving a purpose in their day as these heapedup papers had andsaddest of allwithout purchasing for their writers the comfortable livelihood which the clerks of the customhouse had gained by these worthless scratchings of the pen
yet not altogether worthless perhaps as materials of local history
here no doubt statistics of the former commerce of salem might be discovered and memorials of her princely merchantsold king derbyold billy grayold simon forresterand many another magnate in his day whose powdered head however was scarcely in the tomb before his mountain pile of wealth began to dwindle
the founders of the greater part of the families which now compose the aristocracy of salem might here be traced from the petty and obscure beginnings of their traffic at periods generally much posterior to the revolution upward to what their children look upon as longestablished rank
prior to the revolution there is a dearth of records the earlier documents and archives of the customhouse having probably been carried off to halifax when all the kings officials accompanied the british army in its flight from boston
it has often been a matter of regret with me for going back perhaps to the days of the protectorate those papers must have contained many references to forgotten or remembered men and to antique customs which would have affected me with the same pleasure as when i used to pick up indian arrowheads in the field near the old manse
but one idle and rainy day it was my fortune to make a discovery of some little interest
poking and burrowing into the heapedup rubbish in the corner unfolding one and another document and reading the names of vessels that had long ago foundered at sea or rotted at the wharves and those of merchants never heard of now on change nor very readily decipherable on their mossy tombstones glancing at such matters with the saddened weary halfreluctant interest which we bestow on the corpse of dead activityand exerting my fancy sluggish with little use to raise up from these dry bones an image of the old towns brighter aspect when india was a new region and only salem knew the way thitheri chanced to lay my hand on a small package carefully done up in a piece of ancient yellow parchment
this envelope had the air of an official record of some period long past when clerks engrossed their stiff and formal chirography on more substantial materials than at present
there was something about it that quickened an instinctive curiosity and made me undo the faded red tape that tied up the package with the sense that a treasure would here be brought to light
unbending the rigid folds of the parchment cover i found it to be a commission under the hand and seal of governor shirley in favour of one jonathan pue as surveyor of his majestys customs for the port of salem in the province of massachusetts bay
i remembered to have read probably in felts annals a notice of the decease of mr surveyor pue about fourscore years ago and likewise in a newspaper of recent times an account of the digging up of his remains in the little graveyard of st peters church during the renewal of that edifice
nothing if i rightly call to mind was left of my respected predecessor save an imperfect skeleton and some fragments of apparel and a wig of majestic frizzle which unlike the head that it once adorned was in very satisfactory preservation
but on examining the papers which the parchment commission served to envelop i found more traces of mr pues mental part and the internal operations of his head than the frizzled wig had contained of the venerable skull itself
they were documents in short not official but of a private nature or at least written in his private capacity and apparently with his own hand
i could account for their being included in the heap of customhouse lumber only by the fact that mr pues death had happened suddenly and that these papers which he probably kept in his official desk had never come to the knowledge of his heirs or were supposed to relate to the business of the revenue
on the transfer of the archives to halifax this package proving to be of no public concern was left behind and had remained ever since unopened
the ancient surveyorbeing little molested i suppose at that early day with business pertaining to his officeseems to have devoted some of his many leisure hours to researches as a local antiquarian and other inquisitions of a similar nature
these supplied material for petty activity to a mind that would otherwise have been eaten up with rust
a portion of his facts by the by did me good service in the preparation of the article entitled main street included in the present volume
the remainder may perhaps be applied to purposes equally valuable hereafter or not impossibly may be worked up so far as they go into a regular history of salem should my veneration for the natal soil ever impel me to so pious a task
meanwhile they shall be at the command of any gentleman inclined and competent to take the unprofitable labour off my hands
as a final disposition i contemplate depositing them with the essex historical society
but the object that most drew my attention to the mysterious package was a certain affair of fine red cloth much worn and faded there were traces about it of gold embroidery which however was greatly frayed and defaced so that none or very little of the glitter was left
it had been wrought as was easy to perceive with wonderful skill of needlework and the stitch as i am assured by ladies conversant with such mysteries gives evidence of a now forgotten art not to be discovered even by the process of picking out the threads
this rag of scarlet clothfor time and wear and a sacrilegious moth had reduced it to little other than a ragon careful examination assumed the shape of a letter
it was the capital letter a
by an accurate measurement each limb proved to be precisely three inches and a quarter in length
it had been intended there could be no doubt as an ornamental article of dress but how it was to be worn or what rank honour and dignity in bypast times were signified by it was a riddle which so evanescent are the fashions of the world in these particulars i saw little hope of solving
and yet it strangely interested me
my eyes fastened themselves upon the old scarlet letter and would not be turned aside
certainly there was some deep meaning in it most worthy of interpretation and which as it were streamed forth from the mystic symbol subtly communicating itself to my sensibilities but evading the analysis of my mind
when thus perplexedand cogitating among other hypotheses whether the letter might not have been one of those decorations which the white men used to contrive in order to take the eyes of indiansi happened to place it on my breast
it seemed to methe reader may smile but must not doubt my wordit seemed to me then that i experienced a sensation not altogether physical yet almost so as of burning heat and as if the letter were not of red cloth but redhot iron
i shuddered and involuntarily let it fall upon the floor
in the absorbing contemplation of the scarlet letter i had hitherto neglected to examine a small roll of dingy paper around which it had been twisted
this i now opened and had the satisfaction to find recorded by the old surveyors pen a reasonably complete explanation of the whole affair
there were several foolscap sheets containing many particulars respecting the life and conversation of one hester prynne who appeared to have been rather a noteworthy personage in the view of our ancestors
she had flourished during the period between the early days of massachusetts and the close of the seventeenth century
aged persons alive in the time of mr surveyor pue and from whose oral testimony he had made up his narrative remembered her in their youth as a very old but not decrepit woman of a stately and solemn aspect
it had been her habit from an almost immemorial date to go about the country as a kind of voluntary nurse and doing whatever miscellaneous good she might taking upon herself likewise to give advice in all matters especially those of the heart by which meansas a person of such propensities inevitably mustshe gained from many people the reverence due to an angel but i should imagine was looked upon by others as an intruder and a nuisance
prying further into the manuscript i found the record of other doings and sufferings of this singular woman for most of which the reader is referred to the story entitled the scarlet letter and it should be borne carefully in mind that the main facts of that story are authorized and authenticated by the document of mr surveyor pue
the original papers together with the scarlet letter itselfa most curious relicare still in my possession and shall be freely exhibited to whomsoever induced by the great interest of the narrative may desire a sight of them
i must not be understood affirming that in the dressing up of the tale and imagining the motives and modes of passion that influenced the characters who figure in it i have invariably confined myself within the limits of the old surveyors halfadozen sheets of foolscap
on the contrary i have allowed myself as to such points nearly or altogether as much license as if the facts had been entirely of my own invention
what i contend for is the authenticity of the outline
this incident recalled my mind in some degree to its old track
there seemed to be here the groundwork of a tale
it impressed me as if the ancient surveyor in his garb of a hundred years gone by and wearing his immortal wigwhich was buried with him but did not perish in the gravehad met me in the deserted chamber of the customhouse
in his port was the dignity of one who had borne his majestys commission and who was therefore illuminated by a ray of the splendour that shone so dazzlingly about the throne
how unlike alas the hangdog look of a republican official who as the servant of the people feels himself less than the least and below the lowest of his masters
with his own ghostly hand the obscurely seen but majestic figure had imparted to me the scarlet symbol and the little roll of explanatory manuscript
with his own ghostly voice he had exhorted me on the sacred consideration of my filial duty and reverence towards himwho might reasonably regard himself as my official ancestorto bring his mouldy and motheaten lucubrations before the public
do this said the ghost of mr surveyor pue emphatically nodding the head that looked so imposing within its memorable wig do this and the profit shall be all your own
you will shortly need it for it is not in your days as it was in mine when a mans office was a lifelease and oftentimes an heirloom
but i charge you in this matter of old mistress prynne give to your predecessors memory the credit which will be rightfully due and i said to the ghost of mr surveyor puei will
on hester prynnes story therefore i bestowed much thought
it was the subject of my meditations for many an hour while pacing to and fro across my room or traversing with a hundredfold repetition the long extent from the front door of the customhouse to the side entrance and back again
great were the weariness and annoyance of the old inspector and the weighers and gaugers whose slumbers were disturbed by the unmercifully lengthened tramp of my passing and returning footsteps
remembering their own former habits they used to say that the surveyor was walking the quarterdeck
they probably fancied that my sole objectand indeed the sole object for which a sane man could ever put himself into voluntary motionwas to get an appetite for dinner
and to say the truth an appetite sharpened by the east wind that generally blew along the passage was the only valuable result of so much indefatigable exercise
so little adapted is the atmosphere of a customhouse to the delicate harvest of fancy and sensibility that had i remained there through ten presidencies yet to come i doubt whether the tale of the scarlet letter would ever have been brought before the public eye
my imagination was a tarnished mirror
it would not reflect or only with miserable dimness the figures with which i did my best to people it
the characters of the narrative would not be warmed and rendered malleable by any heat that i could kindle at my intellectual forge
they would take neither the glow of passion nor the tenderness of sentiment but retained all the rigidity of dead corpses and stared me in the face with a fixed and ghastly grin of contemptuous defiance
what have you to do with us that expression seemed to say
the little power you might have once possessed over the tribe of unrealities is gone
you have bartered it for a pittance of the public gold
go then and earn your wages in short the almost torpid creatures of my own fancy twitted me with imbecility and not without fair occasion
it was not merely during the three hours and a half which uncle sam claimed as his share of my daily life that this wretched numbness held possession of me
it went with me on my seashore walks and rambles into the country wheneverwhich was seldom and reluctantlyi bestirred myself to seek that invigorating charm of nature which used to give me such freshness and activity of thought the moment that i stepped across the threshold of the old manse
the same torpor as regarded the capacity for intellectual effort accompanied me home and weighed upon me in the chamber which i most absurdly termed my study
nor did it quit me when late at night i sat in the deserted parlour lighted only by the glimmering coalfire and the moon striving to picture forth imaginary scenes which the next day might flow out on the brightening page in manyhued description
if the imaginative faculty refused to act at such an hour it might well be deemed a hopeless case
moonlight in a familiar room falling so white upon the carpet and showing all its figures so distinctlymaking every object so minutely visible yet so unlike a morning or noontide visibilityis a medium the most suitable for a romancewriter to get acquainted with his illusive guests
there is the little domestic scenery of the wellknown apartment the chairs with each its separate individuality the centretable sustaining a workbasket a volume or two and an extinguished lamp the sofa the bookcase the picture on the wallall these details so completely seen are so spiritualised by the unusual light that they seem to lose their actual substance and become things of intellect
nothing is too small or too trifling to undergo this change and acquire dignity thereby
a childs shoe the doll seated in her little wicker carriage the hobbyhorsewhatever in a word has been used or played with during the day is now invested with a quality of strangeness and remoteness though still almost as vividly present as by daylight
thus therefore the floor of our familiar room has become a neutral territory somewhere between the real world and fairyland where the actual and the imaginary may meet and each imbue itself with the nature of the other
ghosts might enter here without affrighting us
it would be too much in keeping with the scene to excite surprise were we to look about us and discover a form beloved but gone hence now sitting quietly in a streak of this magic moonshine with an aspect that would make us doubt whether it had returned from afar or had never once stirred from our fireside
the somewhat dim coal fire has an essential influence in producing the effect which i would describe
it throws its unobtrusive tinge throughout the room with a faint ruddiness upon the walls and ceiling and a reflected gleam upon the polish of the furniture
this warmer light mingles itself with the cold spirituality of the moonbeams and communicates as it were a heart and sensibilities of human tenderness to the forms which fancy summons up
it converts them from snowimages into men and women
glancing at the lookingglass we beholddeep within its haunted vergethe smouldering glow of the halfextinguished anthracite the white moonbeams on the floor and a repetition of all the gleam and shadow of the picture with one remove further from the actual and nearer to the imaginative
then at such an hour and with this scene before him if a man sitting all alone cannot dream strange things and make them look like truth he need never try to write romances
but for myself during the whole of my customhouse experience moonlight and sunshine and the glow of firelight were just alike in my regard and neither of them was of one whit more avail than the twinkle of a tallowcandle
an entire class of susceptibilities and a gift connected with themof no great richness or value but the best i hadwas gone from me
it is my belief however that had i attempted a different order of composition my faculties would not have been found so pointless and inefficacious
i might for instance have contented myself with writing out the narratives of a veteran shipmaster one of the inspectors whom i should be most ungrateful not to mention since scarcely a day passed that he did not stir me to laughter and admiration by his marvelous gifts as a storyteller
could i have preserved the picturesque force of his style and the humourous colouring which nature taught him how to throw over his descriptions the result i honestly believe would have been something new in literature
or i might readily have found a more serious task
it was a folly with the materiality of this daily life pressing so intrusively upon me to attempt to fling myself back into another age or to insist on creating the semblance of a world out of airy matter when at every moment the impalpable beauty of my soapbubble was broken by the rude contact of some actual circumstance
the wiser effort would have been to diffuse thought and imagination through the opaque substance of today and thus to make it a bright transparency to spiritualise the burden that began to weigh so heavily to seek resolutely the true and indestructible value that lay hidden in the petty and wearisome incidents and ordinary characters with which i was now conversant
the fault was mine
the page of life that was spread out before me seemed dull and commonplace only because i had not fathomed its deeper import
a better book than i shall ever write was there leaf after leaf presenting itself to me just as it was written out by the reality of the flitting hour and vanishing as fast as written only because my brain wanted the insight and my hand the cunning to transcribe it
at some future day it may be i shall remember a few scattered fragments and broken paragraphs and write them down and find the letters turn to gold upon the page
these perceptions had come too late
at the instant i was only conscious that what would have been a pleasure once was now a hopeless toil
there was no occasion to make much moan about this state of affairs
i had ceased to be a writer of tolerably poor tales and essays and had become a tolerably good surveyor of the customs
that was all
but nevertheless it is anything but agreeable to be haunted by a suspicion that ones intellect is dwindling away or exhaling without your consciousness like ether out of a phial so that at every glance you find a smaller and less volatile residuum
of the fact there could be no doubt and examining myself and others i was led to conclusions in reference to the effect of public office on the character not very favourable to the mode of life in question
in some other form perhaps i may hereafter develop these effects
suffice it here to say that a customhouse officer of long continuance can hardly be a very praiseworthy or respectable personage for many reasons one of them the tenure by which he holds his situation and another the very nature of his business whichthough i trust an honest oneis of such a sort that he does not share in the united effort of mankind
an effectwhich i believe to be observable more or less in every individual who has occupied the positionis that while he leans on the mighty arm of the republic his own proper strength departs from him
he loses in an extent proportioned to the weakness or force of his original nature the capability of selfsupport
if he possesses an unusual share of native energy or the enervating magic of place do not operate too long upon him his forfeited powers may be redeemable
the ejected officerfortunate in the unkindly shove that sends him forth betimes to struggle amid a struggling worldmay return to himself and become all that he has ever been
but this seldom happens
he usually keeps his ground just long enough for his own ruin and is then thrust out with sinews all unstrung to totter along the difficult footpath of life as he best may
conscious of his own infirmitythat his tempered steel and elasticity are losthe for ever afterwards looks wistfully about him in quest of support external to himself
his pervading and continual hopea hallucination which in the face of all discouragement and making light of impossibilities haunts him while he lives and i fancy like the convulsive throes of the cholera torments him for a brief space after deathis that finally and in no long time by some happy coincidence of circumstances he shall be restored to office
this faith more than anything else steals the pith and availability out of whatever enterprise he may dream of undertaking
why should he toil and moil and be at so much trouble to pick himself up out of the mud when in a little while hence the strong arm of his uncle will raise and support him
why should he work for his living here or go to dig gold in california when he is so soon to be made happy at monthly intervals with a little pile of glittering coin out of his uncles pocket
it is sadly curious to observe how slight a taste of office suffices to infect a poor fellow with this singular disease
uncle sams goldmeaning no disrespect to the worthy old gentlemanhas in this respect a quality of enchantment like that of the devils wages
whoever touches it should look well to himself or he may find the bargain to go hard against him involving if not his soul yet many of its better attributes its sturdy force its courage and constancy its truth its selfreliance and all that gives the emphasis to manly character
here was a fine prospect in the distance
not that the surveyor brought the lesson home to himself or admitted that he could be so utterly undone either by continuance in office or ejectment
yet my reflections were not the most comfortable
i began to grow melancholy and restless continually prying into my mind to discover which of its poor properties were gone and what degree of detriment had already accrued to the remainder
i endeavoured to calculate how much longer i could stay in the customhouse and yet go forth a man
to confess the truth it was my greatest apprehensionas it would never be a measure of policy to turn out so quiet an individual as myself and it being hardly in the nature of a public officer to resignit was my chief trouble therefore that i was likely to grow grey and decrepit in the surveyorship and become much such another animal as the old inspector
might it not in the tedious lapse of official life that lay before me finally be with me as it was with this venerable friendto make the dinnerhour the nucleus of the day and to spend the rest of it as an old dog spends it asleep in the sunshine or in the shade
a dreary lookforward this for a man who felt it to be the best definition of happiness to live throughout the whole range of his faculties and sensibilities
but all this while i was giving myself very unnecessary alarm
providence had meditated better things for me than i could possibly imagine for myself
a remarkable event of the third year of my surveyorshipto adopt the tone of p
pwas the election of general taylor to the presidency
it is essential in order to form a complete estimate of the advantages of official life to view the incumbent at the incoming of a hostile administration
his position is then one of the most singularly irksome and in every contingency disagreeable that a wretched mortal can possibly occupy with seldom an alternative of good on either hand although what presents itself to him as the worst event may very probably be the best
but it is a strange experience to a man of pride and sensibility to know that his interests are within the control of individuals who neither love nor understand him and by whom since one or the other must needs happen he would rather be injured than obliged
strange too for one who has kept his calmness throughout the contest to observe the bloodthirstiness that is developed in the hour of triumph and to be conscious that he is himself among its objects
there are few uglier traits of human nature than this tendencywhich i now witnessed in men no worse than their neighboursto grow cruel merely because they possessed the power of inflicting harm
if the guillotine as applied to officeholders were a literal fact instead of one of the most apt of metaphors it is my sincere belief that the active members of the victorious party were sufficiently excited to have chopped off all our heads and have thanked heaven for the opportunity
it appears to mewho have been a calm and curious observer as well in victory as defeatthat this fierce and bitter spirit of malice and revenge has never distinguished the many triumphs of my own party as it now did that of the whigs
the democrats take the offices as a general rule because they need them and because the practice of many years has made it the law of political warfare which unless a different system be proclaimed it was weakness and cowardice to murmur at
but the long habit of victory has made them generous
they know how to spare when they see occasion and when they strike the axe may be sharp indeed but its edge is seldom poisoned with illwill nor is it their custom ignominiously to kick the head which they have just struck off
in short unpleasant as was my predicament at best i saw much reason to congratulate myself that i was on the losing side rather than the triumphant one
if heretofore i had been none of the warmest of partisans i began now at this season of peril and adversity to be pretty acutely sensible with which party my predilections lay nor was it without something like regret and shame that according to a reasonable calculation of chances i saw my own prospect of retaining office to be better than those of my democratic brethren
but who can see an inch into futurity beyond his nose
my own head was the first that fell
the moment when a mans head drops off is seldom or never i am inclined to think precisely the most agreeable of his life
nevertheless like the greater part of our misfortunes even so serious a contingency brings its remedy and consolation with it if the sufferer will but make the best rather than the worst of the accident which has befallen him
in my particular case the consolatory topics were close at hand and indeed had suggested themselves to my meditations a considerable time before it was requisite to use them
in view of my previous weariness of office and vague thoughts of resignation my fortune somewhat resembled that of a person who should entertain an idea of committing suicide and although beyond his hopes meet with the good hap to be murdered
in the customhouse as before in the old manse i had spent three yearsa term long enough to rest a weary brain long enough to break off old intellectual habits and make room for new ones long enough and too long to have lived in an unnatural state doing what was really of no advantage nor delight to any human being and withholding myself from toil that would at least have stilled an unquiet impulse in me
then moreover as regarded his unceremonious ejectment the late surveyor was not altogether illpleased to be recognised by the whigs as an enemy since his inactivity in political affairshis tendency to roam at will in that broad and quiet field where all mankind may meet rather than confine himself to those narrow paths where brethren of the same household must diverge from one anotherhad sometimes made it questionable with his brother democrats whether he was a friend
now after he had won the crown of martyrdom though with no longer a head to wear it on the point might be looked upon as settled
finally little heroic as he was it seemed more decorous to be overthrown in the downfall of the party with which he had been content to stand than to remain a forlorn survivor when so many worthier men were falling and at last after subsisting for four years on the mercy of a hostile administration to be compelled then to define his position anew and claim the yet more humiliating mercy of a friendly one
meanwhile the press had taken up my affair and kept me for a week or two careering through the public prints in my decapitated state like irvings headless horseman ghastly and grim and longing to be buried as a political dead man ought
so much for my figurative self
the real human being all this time with his head safely on his shoulders had brought himself to the comfortable conclusion that everything was for the best and making an investment in ink paper and steel pens had opened his longdisused writing desk and was again a literary man
now it was that the lucubrations of my ancient predecessor mr surveyor pue came into play
rusty through long idleness some little space was requisite before my intellectual machinery could be brought to work upon the tale with an effect in any degree satisfactory
even yet though my thoughts were ultimately much absorbed in the task it wears to my eye a stern and sombre aspect too much ungladdened by genial sunshine too little relieved by the tender and familiar influences which soften almost every scene of nature and real life and undoubtedly should soften every picture of them
this uncaptivating effect is perhaps due to the period of hardly accomplished revolution and still seething turmoil in which the story shaped itself
it is no indication however of a lack of cheerfulness in the writers mind for he was happier while straying through the gloom of these sunless fantasies than at any time since he had quitted the old manse
some of the briefer articles which contribute to make up the volume have likewise been written since my involuntary withdrawal from the toils and honours of public life and the remainder are gleaned from annuals and magazines of such antique date that they have gone round the circle and come back to novelty again
keeping up the metaphor of the political guillotine the whole may be considered as the posthumous papers of a decapitated surveyor and the sketch which i am now bringing to a close if too autobiographical for a modest person to publish in his lifetime will readily be excused in a gentleman who writes from beyond the grave
peace be with all the world
my blessing on my friends
my forgiveness to my enemies
for i am in the realm of quiet
the life of the customhouse lies like a dream behind me
the old inspectorwho by the by i regret to say was overthrown and killed by a horse some time ago else he would certainly have lived for everhe and all those other venerable personages who sat with him at the receipt of custom are but shadows in my view whiteheaded and wrinkled images which my fancy used to sport with and has now flung aside for ever
the merchantspingree phillips shepard upton kimball bertram huntthese and many other names which had such classic familiarity for my ear six months agothese men of traffic who seemed to occupy so important a position in the worldhow little time has it required to disconnect me from them all not merely in act but recollection
it is with an effort that i recall the figures and appellations of these few
soon likewise my old native town will loom upon me through the haze of memory a mist brooding over and around it as if it were no portion of the real earth but an overgrown village in cloudland with only imaginary inhabitants to people its wooden houses and walk its homely lanes and the unpicturesque prolixity of its main street
henceforth it ceases to be a reality of my life i am a citizen of somewhere else
my good townspeople will not much regret me forthough it has been as dear an object as any in my literary efforts to be of some importance in their eyes and to win myself a pleasant memory in this abode and burialplace of so many of my forefathersthere has never been for me the genial atmosphere which a literary man requires in order to ripen the best harvest of his mind
i shall do better amongst other faces and these familiar ones it need hardly be said will do just as well without me
it may be howeveroh transporting and triumphant thoughtthat the greatgrandchildren of the present race may sometimes think kindly of the scribbler of bygone days when the antiquary of days to come among the sites memorable in the towns history shall point out the locality of the town pump
the scarlet letter     i
the prison door   a throng of bearded men in sadcoloured garments and grey steeplecrowned hats intermixed with women some wearing hoods and others bareheaded was assembled in front of a wooden edifice the door of which was heavily timbered with oak and studded with iron spikes
the founders of a new colony whatever utopia of human virtue and happiness they might originally project have invariably recognised it among their earliest practical necessities to allot a portion of the virgin soil as a cemetery and another portion as the site of a prison
in accordance with this rule it may safely be assumed that the forefathers of boston had built the first prisonhouse somewhere in the vicinity of cornhill almost as seasonably as they marked out the first burialground on isaac johnsons lot and round about his grave which subsequently became the nucleus of all the congregated sepulchres in the old churchyard of kings chapel
certain it is that some fifteen or twenty years after the settlement of the town the wooden jail was already marked with weatherstains and other indications of age which gave a yet darker aspect to its beetlebrowed and gloomy front
the rust on the ponderous ironwork of its oaken door looked more antique than anything else in the new world
like all that pertains to crime it seemed never to have known a youthful era
before this ugly edifice and between it and the wheeltrack of the street was a grassplot much overgrown with burdock pigweed applepern and such unsightly vegetation which evidently found something congenial in the soil that had so early borne the black flower of civilised society a prison
but on one side of the portal and rooted almost at the threshold was a wild rosebush covered in this month of june with its delicate gems which might be imagined to offer their fragrance and fragile beauty to the prisoner as he went in and to the condemned criminal as he came forth to his doom in token that the deep heart of nature could pity and be kind to him
this rosebush by a strange chance has been kept alive in history but whether it had merely survived out of the stern old wilderness so long after the fall of the gigantic pines and oaks that originally overshadowed it or whether as there is fair authority for believing it had sprung up under the footsteps of the sainted ann hutchinson as she entered the prisondoor we shall not take upon us to determine
finding it so directly on the threshold of our narrative which is now about to issue from that inauspicious portal we could hardly do otherwise than pluck one of its flowers and present it to the reader
it may serve let us hope to symbolise some sweet moral blossom that may be found along the track or relieve the darkening close of a tale of human frailty and sorrow
ii
the marketplace   the grassplot before the jail in prison lane on a certain summer morning not less than two centuries ago was occupied by a pretty large number of the inhabitants of boston all with their eyes intently fastened on the ironclamped oaken door
amongst any other population or at a later period in the history of new england the grim rigidity that petrified the bearded physiognomies of these good people would have augured some awful business in hand
it could have betokened nothing short of the anticipated execution of some noted culprit on whom the sentence of a legal tribunal had but confirmed the verdict of public sentiment
but in that early severity of the puritan character an inference of this kind could not so indubitably be drawn
it might be that a sluggish bondservant or an undutiful child whom his parents had given over to the civil authority was to be corrected at the whippingpost
it might be that an antinomian a quaker or other heterodox religionist was to be scourged out of the town or an idle or vagrant indian whom the white mans firewater had made riotous about the streets was to be driven with stripes into the shadow of the forest
it might be too that a witch like old mistress hibbins the bittertempered widow of the magistrate was to die upon the gallows
in either case there was very much the same solemnity of demeanour on the part of the spectators as befitted a people among whom religion and law were almost identical and in whose character both were so thoroughly interfused that the mildest and severest acts of public discipline were alike made venerable and awful
meagre indeed and cold was the sympathy that a transgressor might look for from such bystanders at the scaffold
on the other hand a penalty which in our days would infer a degree of mocking infamy and ridicule might then be invested with almost as stern a dignity as the punishment of death itself
it was a circumstance to be noted on the summer morning when our story begins its course that the women of whom there were several in the crowd appeared to take a peculiar interest in whatever penal infliction might be expected to ensue
the age had not so much refinement that any sense of impropriety restrained the wearers of petticoat and farthingale from stepping forth into the public ways and wedging their not unsubstantial persons if occasion were into the throng nearest to the scaffold at an execution
morally as well as materially there was a coarser fibre in those wives and maidens of old english birth and breeding than in their fair descendants separated from them by a series of six or seven generations for throughout that chain of ancestry every successive mother had transmitted to her child a fainter bloom a more delicate and briefer beauty and a slighter physical frame if not character of less force and solidity than her own
the women who were now standing about the prisondoor stood within less than half a century of the period when the manlike elizabeth had been the not altogether unsuitable representative of the sex
they were her countrywomen and the beef and ale of their native land with a moral diet not a whit more refined entered largely into their composition
the bright morning sun therefore shone on broad shoulders and welldeveloped busts and on round and ruddy cheeks that had ripened in the faroff island and had hardly yet grown paler or thinner in the atmosphere of new england
there was moreover a boldness and rotundity of speech among these matrons as most of them seemed to be that would startle us at the present day whether in respect to its purport or its volume of tone
goodwives said a hardfeatured dame of fifty ill tell ye a piece of my mind
it would be greatly for the public behoof if we women being of mature age and churchmembers in good repute should have the handling of such malefactresses as this hester prynne
what think ye gossips
if the hussy stood up for judgment before us five that are now here in a knot together would she come off with such a sentence as the worshipful magistrates have awarded
marry i trow not  people say said another that the reverend master dimmesdale her godly pastor takes it very grievously to heart that such a scandal should have come upon his congregation  the magistrates are godfearing gentlemen but merciful overmuchthat is a truth added a third autumnal matron
at the very least they should have put the brand of a hot iron on hester prynnes forehead
madame hester would have winced at that i warrant me
but shethe naughty baggagelittle will she care what they put upon the bodice of her gown
why look you she may cover it with a brooch or such like heathenish adornment and so walk the streets as brave as ever  ah but interposed more softly a young wife holding a child by the hand let her cover the mark as she will the pang of it will be always in her heart  what do we talk of marks and brands whether on the bodice of her gown or the flesh of her forehead cried another female the ugliest as well as the most pitiless of these selfconstituted judges
this woman has brought shame upon us all and ought to die is there not law for it
truly there is both in the scripture and the statutebook
then let the magistrates who have made it of no effect thank themselves if their own wives and daughters go astray  mercy on us goodwife exclaimed a man in the crowd is there no virtue in woman save what springs from a wholesome fear of the gallows
that is the hardest word yet
hush now gossips for the lock is turning in the prisondoor and here comes mistress prynne herself  the door of the jail being flung open from within there appeared in the first place like a black shadow emerging into sunshine the grim and grisly presence of the townbeadle with a sword by his side and his staff of office in his hand
this personage prefigured and represented in his aspect the whole dismal severity of the puritanic code of law which it was his business to administer in its final and closest application to the offender
stretching forth the official staff in his left hand he laid his right upon the shoulder of a young woman whom he thus drew forward until on the threshold of the prisondoor she repelled him by an action marked with natural dignity and force of character and stepped into the open air as if by her own free will
she bore in her arms a child a baby of some three months old who winked and turned aside its little face from the too vivid light of day because its existence heretofore had brought it acquaintance only with the grey twilight of a dungeon or other darksome apartment of the prison
when the young womanthe mother of this childstood fully revealed before the crowd it seemed to be her first impulse to clasp the infant closely to her bosom not so much by an impulse of motherly affection as that she might thereby conceal a certain token which was wrought or fastened into her dress
in a moment however wisely judging that one token of her shame would but poorly serve to hide another she took the baby on her arm and with a burning blush and yet a haughty smile and a glance that would not be abashed looked around at her townspeople and neighbours
on the breast of her gown in fine red cloth surrounded with an elaborate embroidery and fantastic flourishes of gold thread appeared the letter a
it was so artistically done and with so much fertility and gorgeous luxuriance of fancy that it had all the effect of a last and fitting decoration to the apparel which she wore and which was of a splendour in accordance with the taste of the age but greatly beyond what was allowed by the sumptuary regulations of the colony
the young woman was tall with a figure of perfect elegance on a large scale
she had dark and abundant hair so glossy that it threw off the sunshine with a gleam and a face which besides being beautiful from regularity of feature and richness of complexion had the impressiveness belonging to a marked brow and deep black eyes
she was ladylike too after the manner of the feminine gentility of those days characterised by a certain state and dignity rather than by the delicate evanescent and indescribable grace which is now recognised as its indication
and never had hester prynne appeared more ladylike in the antique interpretation of the term than as she issued from the prison
those who had before known her and had expected to behold her dimmed and obscured by a disastrous cloud were astonished and even startled to perceive how her beauty shone out and made a halo of the misfortune and ignominy in which she was enveloped
it may be true that to a sensitive observer there was some thing exquisitely painful in it
her attire which indeed she had wrought for the occasion in prison and had modelled much after her own fancy seemed to express the attitude of her spirit the desperate recklessness of her mood by its wild and picturesque peculiarity
but the point which drew all eyes and as it were transfigured the wearerso that both men and women who had been familiarly acquainted with hester prynne were now impressed as if they beheld her for the first timewas that scarlet letter so fantastically embroidered and illuminated upon her bosom
it had the effect of a spell taking her out of the ordinary relations with humanity and enclosing her in a sphere by herself
she hath good skill at her needle thats certain remarked one of her female spectators but did ever a woman before this brazen hussy contrive such a way of showing it
why gossips what is it but to laugh in the faces of our godly magistrates and make a pride out of what they worthy gentlemen meant for a punishment  it were well muttered the most ironvisaged of the old dames if we stripped madame hesters rich gown off her dainty shoulders and as for the red letter which she hath stitched so curiously ill bestow a rag of mine own rheumatic flannel to make a fitter one  oh peace neighbourspeace whispered their youngest companion do not let her hear you
not a stitch in that embroidered letter but she has felt it in her heart  the grim beadle now made a gesture with his staff
make way good peoplemake way in the kings name cried he
open a passage and i promise ye mistress prynne shall be set where man woman and child may have a fair sight of her brave apparel from this time till an hour past meridian
a blessing on the righteous colony of the massachusetts where iniquity is dragged out into the sunshine
come along madame hester and show your scarlet letter in the marketplace  a lane was forthwith opened through the crowd of spectators
preceded by the beadle and attended by an irregular procession of sternbrowed men and unkindly visaged women hester prynne set forth towards the place appointed for her punishment
a crowd of eager and curious schoolboys understanding little of the matter in hand except that it gave them a halfholiday ran before her progress turning their heads continually to stare into her face and at the winking baby in her arms and at the ignominious letter on her breast
it was no great distance in those days from the prison door to the marketplace
measured by the prisoners experience however it might be reckoned a journey of some length for haughty as her demeanour was she perchance underwent an agony from every footstep of those that thronged to see her as if her heart had been flung into the street for them all to spurn and trample upon
in our nature however there is a provision alike marvellous and merciful that the sufferer should never know the intensity of what he endures by its present torture but chiefly by the pang that rankles after it
with almost a serene deportment therefore hester prynne passed through this portion of her ordeal and came to a sort of scaffold at the western extremity of the marketplace
it stood nearly beneath the eaves of bostons earliest church and appeared to be a fixture there
in fact this scaffold constituted a portion of a penal machine which now for two or three generations past has been merely historical and traditionary among us but was held in the old time to be as effectual an agent in the promotion of good citizenship as ever was the guillotine among the terrorists of france
it was in short the platform of the pillory and above it rose the framework of that instrument of discipline so fashioned as to confine the human head in its tight grasp and thus hold it up to the public gaze
the very ideal of ignominy was embodied and made manifest in this contrivance of wood and iron
there can be no outrage methinks against our common naturewhatever be the delinquencies of the individualno outrage more flagrant than to forbid the culprit to hide his face for shame as it was the essence of this punishment to do
in hester prynnes instance however as not unfrequently in other cases her sentence bore that she should stand a certain time upon the platform but without undergoing that gripe about the neck and confinement of the head the proneness to which was the most devilish characteristic of this ugly engine
knowing well her part she ascended a flight of wooden steps and was thus displayed to the surrounding multitude at about the height of a mans shoulders above the street
had there been a papist among the crowd of puritans he might have seen in this beautiful woman so picturesque in her attire and mien and with the infant at her bosom an object to remind him of the image of divine maternity which so many illustrious painters have vied with one another to represent something which should remind him indeed but only by contrast of that sacred image of sinless motherhood whose infant was to redeem the world
here there was the taint of deepest sin in the most sacred quality of human life working such effect that the world was only the darker for this womans beauty and the more lost for the infant that she had borne
the scene was not without a mixture of awe such as must always invest the spectacle of guilt and shame in a fellowcreature before society shall have grown corrupt enough to smile instead of shuddering at it
the witnesses of hester prynnes disgrace had not yet passed beyond their simplicity
they were stern enough to look upon her death had that been the sentence without a murmur at its severity but had none of the heartlessness of another social state which would find only a theme for jest in an exhibition like the present
even had there been a disposition to turn the matter into ridicule it must have been repressed and overpowered by the solemn presence of men no less dignified than the governor and several of his counsellors a judge a general and the ministers of the town all of whom sat or stood in a balcony of the meetinghouse looking down upon the platform
when such personages could constitute a part of the spectacle without risking the majesty or reverence of rank and office it was safely to be inferred that the infliction of a legal sentence would have an earnest and effectual meaning
accordingly the crowd was sombre and grave
the unhappy culprit sustained herself as best a woman might under the heavy weight of a thousand unrelenting eyes all fastened upon her and concentrated at her bosom
it was almost intolerable to be borne
of an impulsive and passionate nature she had fortified herself to encounter the stings and venomous stabs of public contumely wreaking itself in every variety of insult but there was a quality so much more terrible in the solemn mood of the popular mind that she longed rather to behold all those rigid countenances contorted with scornful merriment and herself the object
had a roar of laughter burst from the multitudeeach man each woman each little shrillvoiced child contributing their individual partshester prynne might have repaid them all with a bitter and disdainful smile
but under the leaden infliction which it was her doom to endure she felt at moments as if she must needs shriek out with the full power of her lungs and cast herself from the scaffold down upon the ground or else go mad at once
yet there were intervals when the whole scene in which she was the most conspicuous object seemed to vanish from her eyes or at least glimmered indistinctly before them like a mass of imperfectly shaped and spectral images
her mind and especially her memory was preternaturally active and kept bringing up other scenes than this roughly hewn street of a little town on the edge of the western wilderness other faces than were lowering upon her from beneath the brims of those steeplecrowned hats
reminiscences the most trifling and immaterial passages of infancy and schooldays sports childish quarrels and the little domestic traits of her maiden years came swarming back upon her intermingled with recollections of whatever was gravest in her subsequent life one picture precisely as vivid as another as if all were of similar importance or all alike a play
possibly it was an instinctive device of her spirit to relieve itself by the exhibition of these phantasmagoric forms from the cruel weight and hardness of the reality
be that as it might the scaffold of the pillory was a point of view that revealed to hester prynne the entire track along which she had been treading since her happy infancy
standing on that miserable eminence she saw again her native village in old england and her paternal home a decayed house of grey stone with a povertystricken aspect but retaining a half obliterated shield of arms over the portal in token of antique gentility
she saw her fathers face with its bold brow and reverend white beard that flowed over the oldfashioned elizabethan ruff her mothers too with the look of heedful and anxious love which it always wore in her remembrance and which even since her death had so often laid the impediment of a gentle remonstrance in her daughters pathway
she saw her own face glowing with girlish beauty and illuminating all the interior of the dusky mirror in which she had been wont to gaze at it
there she beheld another countenance of a man well stricken in years a pale thin scholarlike visage with eyes dim and bleared by the lamplight that had served them to pore over many ponderous books
yet those same bleared optics had a strange penetrating power when it was their owners purpose to read the human soul
this figure of the study and the cloister as hester prynnes womanly fancy failed not to recall was slightly deformed with the left shoulder a trifle higher than the right
next rose before her in memorys picturegallery the intricate and narrow thoroughfares the tall grey houses the huge cathedrals and the public edifices ancient in date and quaint in architecture of a continental city where new life had awaited her still in connexion with the misshapen scholar a new life but feeding itself on timeworn materials like a tuft of green moss on a crumbling wall
lastly in lieu of these shifting scenes came back the rude marketplace of the puritan settlement with all the townspeople assembled and levelling their stern regards at hester prynneyes at herselfwho stood on the scaffold of the pillory an infant on her arm and the letter a in scarlet fantastically embroidered with gold thread upon her bosom
could it be true
she clutched the child so fiercely to her breast that it sent forth a cry she turned her eyes downward at the scarlet letter and even touched it with her finger to assure herself that the infant and the shame were real
yes these were her realitiesall else had vanished
iii
the recognition   from this intense consciousness of being the object of severe and universal observation the wearer of the scarlet letter was at length relieved by discerning on the outskirts of the crowd a figure which irresistibly took possession of her thoughts
an indian in his native garb was standing there but the red men were not so infrequent visitors of the english settlements that one of them would have attracted any notice from hester prynne at such a time much less would he have excluded all other objects and ideas from her mind
by the indians side and evidently sustaining a companionship with him stood a white man clad in a strange disarray of civilized and savage costume
he was small in stature with a furrowed visage which as yet could hardly be termed aged
there was a remarkable intelligence in his features as of a person who had so cultivated his mental part that it could not fail to mould the physical to itself and become manifest by unmistakable tokens
although by a seemingly careless arrangement of his heterogeneous garb he had endeavoured to conceal or abate the peculiarity it was sufficiently evident to hester prynne that one of this mans shoulders rose higher than the other
again at the first instant of perceiving that thin visage and the slight deformity of the figure she pressed her infant to her bosom with so convulsive a force that the poor babe uttered another cry of pain
but the mother did not seem to hear it
at his arrival in the marketplace and some time before she saw him the stranger had bent his eyes on hester prynne
it was carelessly at first like a man chiefly accustomed to look inward and to whom external matters are of little value and import unless they bear relation to something within his mind
very soon however his look became keen and penetrative
a writhing horror twisted itself across his features like a snake gliding swiftly over them and making one little pause with all its wreathed intervolutions in open sight
his face darkened with some powerful emotion which nevertheless he so instantaneously controlled by an effort of his will that save at a single moment its expression might have passed for calmness
after a brief space the convulsion grew almost imperceptible and finally subsided into the depths of his nature
when he found the eyes of hester prynne fastened on his own and saw that she appeared to recognize him he slowly and calmly raised his finger made a gesture with it in the air and laid it on his lips
then touching the shoulder of a townsman who stood near to him he addressed him in a formal and courteous manner  i pray you good sir said he who is this womanand wherefore is she here set up to public shame  you must needs be a stranger in this region friend answered the townsman looking curiously at the questioner and his savage companion else you would surely have heard of mistress hester prynne and her evil doings
she hath raised a great scandal i promise you in godly master dimmesdales church  you say truly replied the other i am a stranger and have been a wanderer sorely against my will
i have met with grievous mishaps by sea and land and have been long held in bonds among the heathenfolk to the southward and am now brought hither by this indian to be redeemed out of my captivity
will it please you therefore to tell me of hester prynneshave i her name rightlyof this womans offences and what has brought her to yonder scaffold  truly friend and methinks it must gladden your heart after your troubles and sojourn in the wilderness said the townsman to find yourself at length in a land where iniquity is searched out and punished in the sight of rulers and people as here in our godly new england
yonder woman sir you must know was the wife of a certain learned man english by birth but who had long ago dwelt in amsterdam whence some good time agone he was minded to cross over and cast in his lot with us of the massachusetts
to this purpose he sent his wife before him remaining himself to look after some necessary affairs
marry good sir in some two years or less that the woman has been a dweller here in boston no tidings have come of this learned gentleman master prynne and his young wife look you being left to her own misguidance  ahahai conceive you said the stranger with a bitter smile
so learned a man as you speak of should have learned this too in his books
and who by your favour sir may be the father of yonder babeit is some three or four months old i should judgewhich mistress prynne is holding in her arms  of a truth friend that matter remaineth a riddle and the daniel who shall expound it is yet awanting answered the townsman
madame hester absolutely refuseth to speak and the magistrates have laid their heads together in vain
peradventure the guilty one stands looking on at this sad spectacle unknown of man and forgetting that god sees him  the learned man observed the stranger with another smile should come himself to look into the mystery  it behoves him well if he be still in life responded the townsman
now good sir our massachusetts magistracy bethinking themselves that this woman is youthful and fair and doubtless was strongly tempted to her fall and that moreover as is most likely her husband may be at the bottom of the sea they have not been bold to put in force the extremity of our righteous law against her
the penalty thereof is death
but in their great mercy and tenderness of heart they have doomed mistress prynne to stand only a space of three hours on the platform of the pillory and then and thereafter for the remainder of her natural life to wear a mark of shame upon her bosom  a wise sentence remarked the stranger gravely bowing his head
thus she will be a living sermon against sin until the ignominious letter be engraved upon her tombstone
it irks me nevertheless that the partner of her iniquity should not at least stand on the scaffold by her side
but he will be knownhe will be knownhe will be known  he bowed courteously to the communicative townsman and whispering a few words to his indian attendant they both made their way through the crowd
while this passed hester prynne had been standing on her pedestal still with a fixed gaze towards the strangerso fixed a gaze that at moments of intense absorption all other objects in the visible world seemed to vanish leaving only him and her
such an interview perhaps would have been more terrible than even to meet him as she now did with the hot midday sun burning down upon her face and lighting up its shame with the scarlet token of infamy on her breast with the sinborn infant in her arms with a whole people drawn forth as to a festival staring at the features that should have been seen only in the quiet gleam of the fireside in the happy shadow of a home or beneath a matronly veil at church
dreadful as it was she was conscious of a shelter in the presence of these thousand witnesses
it was better to stand thus with so many betwixt him and her than to greet him face to facethey two alone
she fled for refuge as it were to the public exposure and dreaded the moment when its protection should be withdrawn from her
involved in these thoughts she scarcely heard a voice behind her until it had repeated her name more than once in a loud and solemn tone audible to the whole multitude
hearken unto me hester prynne said the voice
it has already been noticed that directly over the platform on which hester prynne stood was a kind of balcony or open gallery appended to the meetinghouse
it was the place whence proclamations were wont to be made amidst an assemblage of the magistracy with all the ceremonial that attended such public observances in those days
here to witness the scene which we are describing sat governor bellingham himself with four sergeants about his chair bearing halberds as a guard of honour
he wore a dark feather in his hat a border of embroidery on his cloak and a black velvet tunic beneatha gentleman advanced in years with a hard experience written in his wrinkles
he was not illfitted to be the head and representative of a community which owed its origin and progress and its present state of development not to the impulses of youth but to the stern and tempered energies of manhood and the sombre sagacity of age accomplishing so much precisely because it imagined and hoped so little
the other eminent characters by whom the chief ruler was surrounded were distinguished by a dignity of mien belonging to a period when the forms of authority were felt to possess the sacredness of divine institutions
they were doubtless good men just and sage
but out of the whole human family it would not have been easy to select the same number of wise and virtuous persons who should be less capable of sitting in judgment on an erring womans heart and disentangling its mesh of good and evil than the sages of rigid aspect towards whom hester prynne now turned her face
she seemed conscious indeed that whatever sympathy she might expect lay in the larger and warmer heart of the multitude for as she lifted her eyes towards the balcony the unhappy woman grew pale and trembled
the voice which had called her attention was that of the reverend and famous john wilson the eldest clergyman of boston a great scholar like most of his contemporaries in the profession and withal a man of kind and genial spirit
this last attribute however had been less carefully developed than his intellectual gifts and was in truth rather a matter of shame than selfcongratulation with him
there he stood with a border of grizzled locks beneath his skullcap while his grey eyes accustomed to the shaded light of his study were winking like those of hesters infant in the unadulterated sunshine
he looked like the darkly engraved portraits which we see prefixed to old volumes of sermons and had no more right than one of those portraits would have to step forth as he now did and meddle with a question of human guilt passion and anguish
hester prynne said the clergyman i have striven with my young brother here under whose preaching of the word you have been privileged to sithere mr wilson laid his hand on the shoulder of a pale young man beside himi have sought i say to persuade this godly youth that he should deal with you here in the face of heaven and before these wise and upright rulers and in hearing of all the people as touching the vileness and blackness of your sin
knowing your natural temper better than i he could the better judge what arguments to use whether of tenderness or terror such as might prevail over your hardness and obstinacy insomuch that you should no longer hide the name of him who tempted you to this grievous fall
but he opposes to mewith a young mans oversoftness albeit wise beyond his yearsthat it were wronging the very nature of woman to force her to lay open her hearts secrets in such broad daylight and in presence of so great a multitude
truly as i sought to convince him the shame lay in the commission of the sin and not in the showing of it forth
what say you to it once again brother dimmesdale
must it be thou or i that shall deal with this poor sinners soul  there was a murmur among the dignified and reverend occupants of the balcony and governor bellingham gave expression to its purport speaking in an authoritative voice although tempered with respect towards the youthful clergyman whom he addressed  good master dimmesdale said he the responsibility of this womans soul lies greatly with you
it behoves you therefore to exhort her to repentance and to confession as a proof and consequence thereof  the directness of this appeal drew the eyes of the whole crowd upon the reverend mr dimmesdaleyoung clergyman who had come from one of the great english universities bringing all the learning of the age into our wild forest land
his eloquence and religious fervour had already given the earnest of high eminence in his profession
he was a person of very striking aspect with a white lofty and impending brow large brown melancholy eyes and a mouth which unless when he forcibly compressed it was apt to be tremulous expressing both nervous sensibility and a vast power of self restraint
notwithstanding his high native gifts and scholarlike attainments there was an air about this young ministeran apprehensive a startled a halffrightened lookas of a being who felt himself quite astray and at a loss in the pathway of human existence and could only be at ease in some seclusion of his own
therefore so far as his duties would permit he trod in the shadowy bypaths and thus kept himself simple and childlike coming forth when occasion was with a freshness and fragrance and dewy purity of thought which as many people said affected them like the speech of an angel
such was the young man whom the reverend mr wilson and the governor had introduced so openly to the public notice bidding him speak in the hearing of all men to that mystery of a womans soul so sacred even in its pollution
the trying nature of his position drove the blood from his cheek and made his lips tremulous
speak to the woman my brother said mr wilson
it is of moment to her soul and therefore as the worshipful governor says momentous to thine own in whose charge hers is
exhort her to confess the truth  the reverend mr dimmesdale bent his head in silent prayer as it seemed and then came forward
hester prynne said he leaning over the balcony and looking down steadfastly into her eyes thou hearest what this good man says and seest the accountability under which i labour
if thou feelest it to be for thy souls peace and that thy earthly punishment will thereby be made more effectual to salvation i charge thee to speak out the name of thy fellowsinner and fellowsufferer
be not silent from any mistaken pity and tenderness for him for believe me hester though he were to step down from a high place and stand there beside thee on thy pedestal of shame yet better were it so than to hide a guilty heart through life
what can thy silence do for him except it tempt himyea compel him as it wereto add hypocrisy to sin
heaven hath granted thee an open ignominy that thereby thou mayest work out an open triumph over the evil within thee and the sorrow without
take heed how thou deniest to himwho perchance hath not the courage to grasp it for himselfthe bitter but wholesome cup that is now presented to thy lips  the young pastors voice was tremulously sweet rich deep and broken
the feeling that it so evidently manifested rather than the direct purport of the words caused it to vibrate within all hearts and brought the listeners into one accord of sympathy
even the poor baby at hesters bosom was affected by the same influence for it directed its hitherto vacant gaze towards mr dimmesdale and held up its little arms with a halfpleased halfplaintive murmur
so powerful seemed the ministers appeal that the people could not believe but that hester prynne would speak out the guilty name or else that the guilty one himself in whatever high or lowly place he stood would be drawn forth by an inward and inevitable necessity and compelled to ascend the scaffold
hester shook her head
woman transgress not beyond the limits of heavens mercy cried the reverend mr wilson more harshly than before
that little babe hath been gifted with a voice to second and confirm the counsel which thou hast heard
speak out the name
that and thy repentance may avail to take the scarlet letter off thy breast  never replied hester prynne looking not at mr wilson but into the deep and troubled eyes of the younger clergyman
it is too deeply branded
ye cannot take it off
and would that i might endure his agony as well as mine  speak woman said another voice coldly and sternly proceeding from the crowd about the scaffold speak and give your child a father  i will not speak answered hester turning pale as death but responding to this voice which she too surely recognised
and my child must seek a heavenly father she shall never know an earthly one  she will not speak murmured mr dimmesdale who leaning over the balcony with his hand upon his heart had awaited the result of his appeal
he now drew back with a long respiration
wondrous strength and generosity of a womans heart
she will not speak  discerning the impracticable state of the poor culprits mind the elder clergyman who had carefully prepared himself for the occasion addressed to the multitude a discourse on sin in all its branches but with continual reference to the ignominious letter
so forcibly did he dwell upon this symbol for the hour or more during which his periods were rolling over the peoples heads that it assumed new terrors in their imagination and seemed to derive its scarlet hue from the flames of the infernal pit
hester prynne meanwhile kept her place upon the pedestal of shame with glazed eyes and an air of weary indifference
she had borne that morning all that nature could endure and as her temperament was not of the order that escapes from too intense suffering by a swoon her spirit could only shelter itself beneath a stony crust of insensibility while the faculties of animal life remained entire
in this state the voice of the preacher thundered remorselessly but unavailingly upon her ears
the infant during the latter portion of her ordeal pierced the air with its wailings and screams she strove to hush it mechanically but seemed scarcely to sympathise with its trouble
with the same hard demeanour she was led back to prison and vanished from the public gaze within its ironclamped portal
it was whispered by those who peered after her that the scarlet letter threw a lurid gleam along the dark passageway of the interior
iv
the interview   after her return to the prison hester prynne was found to be in a state of nervous excitement that demanded constant watchfulness lest she should perpetrate violence on herself or do some halffrenzied mischief to the poor babe
as night approached it proving impossible to quell her insubordination by rebuke or threats of punishment master brackett the jailer thought fit to introduce a physician
he described him as a man of skill in all christian modes of physical science and likewise familiar with whatever the savage people could teach in respect to medicinal herbs and roots that grew in the forest
to say the truth there was much need of professional assistance not merely for hester herself but still more urgently for the childwho drawing its sustenance from the maternal bosom seemed to have drank in with it all the turmoil the anguish and despair which pervaded the mothers system
it now writhed in convulsions of pain and was a forcible type in its little frame of the moral agony which hester prynne had borne throughout the day
closely following the jailer into the dismal apartment appeared that individual of singular aspect whose presence in the crowd had been of such deep interest to the wearer of the scarlet letter
he was lodged in the prison not as suspected of any offence but as the most convenient and suitable mode of disposing of him until the magistrates should have conferred with the indian sagamores respecting his ransom
his name was announced as roger chillingworth
the jailer after ushering him into the room remained a moment marvelling at the comparative quiet that followed his entrance for hester prynne had immediately become as still as death although the child continued to moan
prithee friend leave me alone with my patient said the practitioner
trust me good jailer you shall briefly have peace in your house and i promise you mistress prynne shall hereafter be more amenable to just authority than you may have found her heretofore  nay if your worship can accomplish that answered master brackett i shall own you for a man of skill indeed
verily the woman hath been like a possessed one and there lacks little that i should take in hand to drive satan out of her with stripes  the stranger had entered the room with the characteristic quietude of the profession to which he announced himself as belonging
nor did his demeanour change when the withdrawal of the prison keeper left him face to face with the woman whose absorbed notice of him in the crowd had intimated so close a relation between himself and her
his first care was given to the child whose cries indeed as she lay writhing on the trundlebed made it of peremptory necessity to postpone all other business to the task of soothing her
he examined the infant carefully and then proceeded to unclasp a leathern case which he took from beneath his dress
it appeared to contain medical preparations one of which he mingled with a cup of water
my old studies in alchemy observed he and my sojourn for above a year past among a people well versed in the kindly properties of simples have made a better physician of me than many that claim the medical degree
here woman
the child is yoursshe is none of mineneither will she recognise my voice or aspect as a fathers
administer this draught therefore with thine own hand  hester repelled the offered medicine at the same time gazing with strongly marked apprehension into his face
wouldst thou avenge thyself on the innocent babe whispered she
foolish woman responded the physician half coldly half soothingly
what should ail me to harm this misbegotten and miserable babe
the medicine is potent for good and were it my childyea mine own as well as thine
i could do no better for it  as she still hesitated being in fact in no reasonable state of mind he took the infant in his arms and himself administered the draught
it soon proved its efficacy and redeemed the leechs pledge
the moans of the little patient subsided its convulsive tossings gradually ceased and in a few moments as is the custom of young children after relief from pain it sank into a profound and dewy slumber
the physician as he had a fair right to be termed next bestowed his attention on the mother
with calm and intent scrutiny he felt her pulse looked into her eyesa gaze that made her heart shrink and shudder because so familiar and yet so strange and coldand finally satisfied with his investigation proceeded to mingle another draught
i know not lethe nor nepenthe remarked he but i have learned many new secrets in the wilderness and here is one of thema recipe that an indian taught me in requital of some lessons of my own that were as old as paracelsus
drink it
it may be less soothing than a sinless conscience
that i cannot give thee
but it will calm the swell and heaving of thy passion like oil thrown on the waves of a tempestuous sea  he presented the cup to hester who received it with a slow earnest look into his face not precisely a look of fear yet full of doubt and questioning as to what his purposes might be
she looked also at her slumbering child
i have thought of death said shehave wished for itwould even have prayed for it were it fit that such as i should pray for anything
yet if death be in this cup i bid thee think again ere thou beholdest me quaff it
see
it is even now at my lips  drink then replied he still with the same cold composure
dost thou know me so little hester prynne
are my purposes wont to be so shallow
even if i imagine a scheme of vengeance what could i do better for my object than to let thee livethan to give thee medicines against all harm and peril of lifeso that this burning shame may still blaze upon thy bosom as he spoke he laid his long forefinger on the scarlet letter which forthwith seemed to scorch into hesters breast as if it had been red hot
he noticed her involuntary gesture and smiled
live therefore and bear about thy doom with thee in the eyes of men and womenin the eyes of him whom thou didst call thy husbandin the eyes of yonder child
and that thou mayest live take off this draught  without further expostulation or delay hester prynne drained the cup and at the motion of the man of skill seated herself on the bed where the child was sleeping while he drew the only chair which the room afforded and took his own seat beside her
she could not but tremble at these preparations for she felt thathaving now done all that humanity or principle or if so it were a refined cruelty impelled him to do for the relief of physical sufferinghe was next to treat with her as the man whom she had most deeply and irreparably injured
hester said he i ask not wherefore nor how thou hast fallen into the pit or say rather thou hast ascended to the pedestal of infamy on which i found thee
the reason is not far to seek
it was my folly and thy weakness
ia man of thoughtthe bookworm of great librariesa man already in decay having given my best years to feed the hungry dream of knowledgewhat had i to do with youth and beauty like thine own
misshapen from my birthhour how could i delude myself with the idea that intellectual gifts might veil physical deformity in a young girls fantasy
men call me wise
if sages were ever wise in their own behoof i might have foreseen all this
i might have known that as i came out of the vast and dismal forest and entered this settlement of christian men the very first object to meet my eyes would be thyself hester prynne standing up a statue of ignominy before the people
nay from the moment when we came down the old churchsteps together a married pair i might have beheld the balefire of that scarlet letter blazing at the end of our path  thou knowest said hesterfor depressed as she was she could not endure this last quiet stab at the token of her shamethou knowest that i was frank with thee
i felt no love nor feigned any  true replied he
it was my folly
i have said it
but up to that epoch of my life i had lived in vain
the world had been so cheerless
my heart was a habitation large enough for many guests but lonely and chill and without a household fire
i longed to kindle one
it seemed not so wild a dreamold as i was and sombre as i was and misshapen as i wasthat the simple bliss which is scattered far and wide for all mankind to gather up might yet be mine
and so hester i drew thee into my heart into its innermost chamber and sought to warm thee by the warmth which thy presence made there  i have greatly wronged thee murmured hester
we have wronged each other answered he
mine was the first wrong when i betrayed thy budding youth into a false and unnatural relation with my decay
therefore as a man who has not thought and philosophised in vain i seek no vengeance plot no evil against thee
between thee and me the scale hangs fairly balanced
but hester the man lives who has wronged us both
who is he  ask me not replied hester prynne looking firmly into his face
that thou shalt never know  never sayest thou rejoined he with a smile of dark and selfrelying intelligence
never know him
believe me hester there are few things whether in the outward world or to a certain depth in the invisible sphere of thoughtfew things hidden from the man who devotes himself earnestly and unreservedly to the solution of a mystery
thou mayest cover up thy secret from the prying multitude
thou mayest conceal it too from the ministers and magistrates even as thou didst this day when they sought to wrench the name out of thy heart and give thee a partner on thy pedestal
but as for me i come to the inquest with other senses than they possess
i shall seek this man as i have sought truth in books as i have sought gold in alchemy
there is a sympathy that will make me conscious of him
i shall see him tremble
i shall feel myself shudder suddenly and unawares
sooner or later he must needs be mine  the eyes of the wrinkled scholar glowed so intensely upon her that hester prynne clasped her hand over her heart dreading lest he should read the secret there at once
thou wilt not reveal his name
not the less he is mine resumed he with a look of confidence as if destiny were at one with him
he bears no letter of infamy wrought into his garment as thou dost but i shall read it on his heart
yet fear not for him
think not that i shall interfere with heavens own method of retribution or to my own loss betray him to the gripe of human law
neither do thou imagine that i shall contrive aught against his life no nor against his fame if as i judge he be a man of fair repute
let him live
let him hide himself in outward honour if he may
not the less he shall be mine  thy acts are like mercy said hester bewildered and appalled but thy words interpret thee as a terror  one thing thou that wast my wife i would enjoin upon thee continued the scholar
thou hast kept the secret of thy paramour
keep likewise mine
there are none in this land that know me
breathe not to any human soul that thou didst ever call me husband
here on this wild outskirt of the earth i shall pitch my tent for elsewhere a wanderer and isolated from human interests i find here a woman a man a child amongst whom and myself there exist the closest ligaments
no matter whether of love or hate no matter whether of right or wrong
thou and thine hester prynne belong to me
my home is where thou art and where he is
but betray me not  wherefore dost thou desire it inquired hester shrinking she hardly knew why from this secret bond
why not announce thyself openly and cast me off at once  it may be he replied because i will not encounter the dishonour that besmirches the husband of a faithless woman
it may be for other reasons
enough it is my purpose to live and die unknown
let therefore thy husband be to the world as one already dead and of whom no tidings shall ever come
recognise me not by word by sign by look
breathe not the secret above all to the man thou wottest of
shouldst thou fail me in this beware
his fame his position his life will be in my hands
beware  i will keep thy secret as i have his said hester
swear it rejoined he
and she took the oath
and now mistress prynne said old roger chillingworth as he was hereafter to be named i leave thee alone alone with thy infant and the scarlet letter
how is it hester
doth thy sentence bind thee to wear the token in thy sleep
art thou not afraid of nightmares and hideous dreams  why dost thou smile so at me inquired hester troubled at the expression of his eyes
art thou like the black man that haunts the forest round about us
hast thou enticed me into a bond that will prove the ruin of my soul  not thy soul he answered with another smile
no not thine     v hester at her needle   hester prynnes term of confinement was now at an end
her prisondoor was thrown open and she came forth into the sunshine which falling on all alike seemed to her sick and morbid heart as if meant for no other purpose than to reveal the scarlet letter on her breast
perhaps there was a more real torture in her first unattended footsteps from the threshold of the prison than even in the procession and spectacle that have been described where she was made the common infamy at which all mankind was summoned to point its finger
then she was supported by an unnatural tension of the nerves and by all the combative energy of her character which enabled her to convert the scene into a kind of lurid triumph
it was moreover a separate and insulated event to occur but once in her lifetime and to meet which therefore reckless of economy she might call up the vital strength that would have sufficed for many quiet years
the very law that condemned hera giant of stern features but with vigour to support as well as to annihilate in his iron armhad held her up through the terrible ordeal of her ignominy
but now with this unattended walk from her prison door began the daily custom and she must either sustain and carry it forward by the ordinary resources of her nature or sink beneath it
she could no longer borrow from the future to help her through the present grief
tomorrow would bring its own trial with it so would the next day and so would the next each its own trial and yet the very same that was now so unutterably grievous to be borne
the days of the faroff future would toil onward still with the same burden for her to take up and bear along with her but never to fling down for the accumulating days and added years would pile up their misery upon the heap of shame
throughout them all giving up her individuality she would become the general symbol at which the preacher and moralist might point and in which they might vivify and embody their images of womans frailty and sinful passion
thus the young and pure would be taught to look at her with the scarlet letter flaming on her breastat her the child of honourable parentsat her the mother of a babe that would hereafter be a womanat her who had once been innocentas the figure the body the reality of sin
and over her grave the infamy that she must carry thither would be her only monument
it may seem marvellous that with the world before herkept by no restrictive clause of her condemnation within the limits of the puritan settlement so remote and so obscurefree to return to her birthplace or to any other european land and there hide her character and identity under a new exterior as completely as if emerging into another state of beingand having also the passes of the dark inscrutable forest open to her where the wildness of her nature might assimilate itself with a people whose customs and life were alien from the law that had condemned herit may seem marvellous that this woman should still call that place her home where and where only she must needs be the type of shame
but there is a fatality a feeling so irresistible and inevitable that it has the force of doom which almost invariably compels human beings to linger around and haunt ghostlike the spot where some great and marked event has given the colour to their lifetime and still the more irresistibly the darker the tinge that saddens it
her sin her ignominy were the roots which she had struck into the soil
it was as if a new birth with stronger assimilations than the first had converted the forestland still so uncongenial to every other pilgrim and wanderer into hester prynnes wild and dreary but lifelong home
all other scenes of eartheven that village of rural england where happy infancy and stainless maidenhood seemed yet to be in her mothers keeping like garments put off long agowere foreign to her in comparison
the chain that bound her here was of iron links and galling to her inmost soul but could never be broken
it might be toodoubtless it was so although she hid the secret from herself and grew pale whenever it struggled out of her heart like a serpent from its holeit might be that another feeling kept her within the scene and pathway that had been so fatal
there dwelt there trode the feet of one with whom she deemed herself connected in a union that unrecognised on earth would bring them together before the bar of final judgment and make that their marriagealtar for a joint futurity of endless retribution
over and over again the tempter of souls had thrust this idea upon hesters contemplation and laughed at the passionate and desperate joy with which she seized and then strove to cast it from her
she barely looked the idea in the face and hastened to bar it in its dungeon
what she compelled herself to believewhat finally she reasoned upon as her motive for continuing a resident of new englandwas half a truth and half a selfdelusion
here she said to herself had been the scene of her guilt and here should be the scene of her earthly punishment and so perchance the torture of her daily shame would at length purge her soul and work out another purity than that which she had lost more saintlike because the result of martyrdom
hester prynne therefore did not flee
on the outskirts of the town within the verge of the peninsula but not in close vicinity to any other habitation there was a small thatched cottage
it had been built by an earlier settler and abandoned because the soil about it was too sterile for cultivation while its comparative remoteness put it out of the sphere of that social activity which already marked the habits of the emigrants
it stood on the shore looking across a basin of the sea at the forestcovered hills towards the west
a clump of scrubby trees such as alone grew on the peninsula did not so much conceal the cottage from view as seem to denote that here was some object which would fain have been or at least ought to be concealed
in this little lonesome dwelling with some slender means that she possessed and by the licence of the magistrates who still kept an inquisitorial watch over her hester established herself with her infant child
a mystic shadow of suspicion immediately attached itself to the spot
children too young to comprehend wherefore this woman should be shut out from the sphere of human charities would creep nigh enough to behold her plying her needle at the cottagewindow or standing in the doorway or labouring in her little garden or coming forth along the pathway that led townward and discerning the scarlet letter on her breast would scamper off with a strange contagious fear
lonely as was hesters situation and without a friend on earth who dared to show himself she however incurred no risk of want
she possessed an art that sufficed even in a land that afforded comparatively little scope for its exercise to supply food for her thriving infant and herself
it was the art then as now almost the only one within a womans graspof needlework
she bore on her breast in the curiously embroidered letter a specimen of her delicate and imaginative skill of which the dames of a court might gladly have availed themselves to add the richer and more spiritual adornment of human ingenuity to their fabrics of silk and gold
here indeed in the sable simplicity that generally characterised the puritanic modes of dress there might be an infrequent call for the finer productions of her handiwork
yet the taste of the age demanding whatever was elaborate in compositions of this kind did not fail to extend its influence over our stern progenitors who had cast behind them so many fashions which it might seem harder to dispense with
public ceremonies such as ordinations the installation of magistrates and all that could give majesty to the forms in which a new government manifested itself to the people were as a matter of policy marked by a stately and wellconducted ceremonial and a sombre but yet a studied magnificence
deep ruffs painfully wrought bands and gorgeously embroidered gloves were all deemed necessary to the official state of men assuming the reins of power and were readily allowed to individuals dignified by rank or wealth even while sumptuary laws forbade these and similar extravagances to the plebeian order
in the array of funerals toowhether for the apparel of the dead body or to typify by manifold emblematic devices of sable cloth and snowy lawn the sorrow of the survivorsthere was a frequent and characteristic demand for such labour as hester prynne could supply
babylinenfor babies then wore robes of stateafforded still another possibility of toil and emolument
by degrees not very slowly her handiwork became what would now be termed the fashion
whether from commiseration for a woman of so miserable a destiny or from the morbid curiosity that gives a fictitious value even to common or worthless things or by whatever other intangible circumstance was then as now sufficient to bestow on some persons what others might seek in vain or because hester really filled a gap which must otherwise have remained vacant it is certain that she had ready and fairly requited employment for as many hours as she saw fit to occupy with her needle
vanity it may be chose to mortify itself by putting on for ceremonials of pomp and state the garments that had been wrought by her sinful hands
her needlework was seen on the ruff of the governor military men wore it on their scarfs and the minister on his band it decked the babys little cap it was shut up to be mildewed and moulder away in the coffins of the dead
but it is not recorded that in a single instance her skill was called in to embroider the white veil which was to cover the pure blushes of a bride
the exception indicated the ever relentless vigour with which society frowned upon her sin
hester sought not to acquire anything beyond a subsistence of the plainest and most ascetic description for herself and a simple abundance for her child
her own dress was of the coarsest materials and the most sombre hue with only that one ornamentthe scarlet letterwhich it was her doom to wear
the childs attire on the other hand was distinguished by a fanciful or we may rather say a fantastic ingenuity which served indeed to heighten the airy charm that early began to develop itself in the little girl but which appeared to have also a deeper meaning
we may speak further of it hereafter
except for that small expenditure in the decoration of her infant hester bestowed all her superfluous means in charity on wretches less miserable than herself and who not unfrequently insulted the hand that fed them
much of the time which she might readily have applied to the better efforts of her art she employed in making coarse garments for the poor
it is probable that there was an idea of penance in this mode of occupation and that she offered up a real sacrifice of enjoyment in devoting so many hours to such rude handiwork
she had in her nature a rich voluptuous oriental characteristica taste for the gorgeously beautiful which save in the exquisite productions of her needle found nothing else in all the possibilities of her life to exercise itself upon
women derive a pleasure incomprehensible to the other sex from the delicate toil of the needle
to hester prynne it might have been a mode of expressing and therefore soothing the passion of her life
like all other joys she rejected it as sin
this morbid meddling of conscience with an immaterial matter betokened it is to be feared no genuine and steadfast penitence but something doubtful something that might be deeply wrong beneath
in this manner hester prynne came to have a part to perform in the world
with her native energy of character and rare capacity it could not entirely cast her off although it had set a mark upon her more intolerable to a womans heart than that which branded the brow of cain
in all her intercourse with society however there was nothing that made her feel as if she belonged to it
every gesture every word and even the silence of those with whom she came in contact implied and often expressed that she was banished and as much alone as if she inhabited another sphere or communicated with the common nature by other organs and senses than the rest of human kind
she stood apart from mortal interests yet close beside them like a ghost that revisits the familiar fireside and can no longer make itself seen or felt no more smile with the household joy nor mourn with the kindred sorrow or should it succeed in manifesting its forbidden sympathy awakening only terror and horrible repugnance
these emotions in fact and its bitterest scorn besides seemed to be the sole portion that she retained in the universal heart
it was not an age of delicacy and her position although she understood it well and was in little danger of forgetting it was often brought before her vivid selfperception like a new anguish by the rudest touch upon the tenderest spot
the poor as we have already said whom she sought out to be the objects of her bounty often reviled the hand that was stretched forth to succour them
dames of elevated rank likewise whose doors she entered in the way of her occupation were accustomed to distil drops of bitterness into her heart sometimes through that alchemy of quiet malice by which women can concoct a subtle poison from ordinary trifles and sometimes also by a coarser expression that fell upon the sufferers defenceless breast like a rough blow upon an ulcerated wound
hester had schooled herself long and well and she never responded to these attacks save by a flush of crimson that rose irrepressibly over her pale cheek and again subsided into the depths of her bosom
she was patienta martyr indeedbut she forebore to pray for enemies lest in spite of her forgiving aspirations the words of the blessing should stubbornly twist themselves into a curse
continually and in a thousand other ways did she feel the innumerable throbs of anguish that had been so cunningly contrived for her by the undying the everactive sentence of the puritan tribunal
clergymen paused in the streets to address words of exhortation that brought a crowd with its mingled grin and frown around the poor sinful woman
if she entered a church trusting to share the sabbath smile of the universal father it was often her mishap to find herself the text of the discourse
she grew to have a dread of children for they had imbibed from their parents a vague idea of something horrible in this dreary woman gliding silently through the town with never any companion but one only child
therefore first allowing her to pass they pursued her at a distance with shrill cries and the utterances of a word that had no distinct purport to their own minds but was none the less terrible to her as proceeding from lips that babbled it unconsciously
it seemed to argue so wide a diffusion of her shame that all nature knew of it it could have caused her no deeper pang had the leaves of the trees whispered the dark story among themselveshad the summer breeze murmured about ithad the wintry blast shrieked it aloud
another peculiar torture was felt in the gaze of a new eye
when strangers looked curiously at the scarlet letterand none ever failed to do sothey branded it afresh in hesters soul so that oftentimes she could scarcely refrain yet always did refrain from covering the symbol with her hand
but then again an accustomed eye had likewise its own anguish to inflict
its cool stare of familiarity was intolerable
from first to last in short hester prynne had always this dreadful agony in feeling a human eye upon the token the spot never grew callous it seemed on the contrary to grow more sensitive with daily torture
but sometimes once in many days or perchance in many months she felt an eyea human eyeupon the ignominious brand that seemed to give a momentary relief as if half of her agony were shared
the next instant back it all rushed again with still a deeper throb of pain for in that brief interval she had sinned anew
had hester sinned alone
her imagination was somewhat affected and had she been of a softer moral and intellectual fibre would have been still more so by the strange and solitary anguish of her life
walking to and fro with those lonely footsteps in the little world with which she was outwardly connected it now and then appeared to hesterif altogether fancy it was nevertheless too potent to be resistedshe felt or fancied then that the scarlet letter had endowed her with a new sense
she shuddered to believe yet could not help believing that it gave her a sympathetic knowledge of the hidden sin in other hearts
she was terrorstricken by the revelations that were thus made
what were they
could they be other than the insidious whispers of the bad angel who would fain have persuaded the struggling woman as yet only half his victim that the outward guise of purity was but a lie and that if truth were everywhere to be shown a scarlet letter would blaze forth on many a bosom besides hester prynnes
or must she receive those intimationsso obscure yet so distinctas truth
in all her miserable experience there was nothing else so awful and so loathsome as this sense
it perplexed as well as shocked her by the irreverent inopportuneness of the occasions that brought it into vivid action
sometimes the red infamy upon her breast would give a sympathetic throb as she passed near a venerable minister or magistrate the model of piety and justice to whom that age of antique reverence looked up as to a mortal man in fellowship with angels
what evil thing is at hand would hester say to herself
lifting her reluctant eyes there would be nothing human within the scope of view save the form of this earthly saint
again a mystic sisterhood would contumaciously assert itself as she met the sanctified frown of some matron who according to the rumour of all tongues had kept cold snow within her bosom throughout life
that unsunned snow in the matrons bosom and the burning shame on hester prynneswhat had the two in common
or once more the electric thrill would give her warningbehold hester here is a companion and looking up she would detect the eyes of a young maiden glancing at the scarlet letter shyly and aside and quickly averted with a faint chill crimson in her cheeks as if her purity were somewhat sullied by that momentary glance
o fiend whose talisman was that fatal symbol wouldst thou leave nothing whether in youth or age for this poor sinner to reveresuch loss of faith is ever one of the saddest results of sin
be it accepted as a proof that all was not corrupt in this poor victim of her own frailty and mans hard law that hester prynne yet struggled to believe that no fellowmortal was guilty like herself
the vulgar who in those dreary old times were always contributing a grotesque horror to what interested their imaginations had a story about the scarlet letter which we might readily work up into a terrific legend
they averred that the symbol was not mere scarlet cloth tinged in an earthly dyepot but was redhot with infernal fire and could be seen glowing all alight whenever hester prynne walked abroad in the nighttime
and we must needs say it seared hesters bosom so deeply that perhaps there was more truth in the rumour than our modern incredulity may be inclined to admit
vi
pearl   we have as yet hardly spoken of the infant that little creature whose innocent life had sprung by the inscrutable decree of providence a lovely and immortal flower out of the rank luxuriance of a guilty passion
how strange it seemed to the sad woman as she watched the growth and the beauty that became every day more brilliant and the intelligence that threw its quivering sunshine over the tiny features of this child
her pearlfor so had hester called her not as a name expressive of her aspect which had nothing of the calm white unimpassioned lustre that would be indicated by the comparison
but she named the infant pearl as being of great pricepurchased with all she hadher mothers only treasure
how strange indeed
man had marked this womans sin by a scarlet letter which had such potent and disastrous efficacy that no human sympathy could reach her save it were sinful like herself
god as a direct consequence of the sin which man thus punished had given her a lovely child whose place was on that same dishonoured bosom to connect her parent for ever with the race and descent of mortals and to be finally a blessed soul in heaven
yet these thoughts affected hester prynne less with hope than apprehension
she knew that her deed had been evil she could have no faith therefore that its result would be good
day after day she looked fearfully into the childs expanding nature ever dreading to detect some dark and wild peculiarity that should correspond with the guiltiness to which she owed her being
certainly there was no physical defect
by its perfect shape its vigour and its natural dexterity in the use of all its untried limbs the infant was worthy to have been brought forth in eden worthy to have been left there to be the plaything of the angels after the worlds first parents were driven out
the child had a native grace which does not invariably coexist with faultless beauty its attire however simple always impressed the beholder as if it were the very garb that precisely became it best
but little pearl was not clad in rustic weeds
her mother with a morbid purpose that may be better understood hereafter had bought the richest tissues that could be procured and allowed her imaginative faculty its full play in the arrangement and decoration of the dresses which the child wore before the public eye
so magnificent was the small figure when thus arrayed and such was the splendour of pearls own proper beauty shining through the gorgeous robes which might have extinguished a paler loveliness that there was an absolute circle of radiance around her on the darksome cottage floor
and yet a russet gown torn and soiled with the childs rude play made a picture of her just as perfect
pearls aspect was imbued with a spell of infinite variety in this one child there were many children comprehending the full scope between the wildflower prettiness of a peasantbaby and the pomp in little of an infant princess
throughout all however there was a trait of passion a certain depth of hue which she never lost and if in any of her changes she had grown fainter or paler she would have ceased to be herselfit would have been no longer pearl
this outward mutability indicated and did not more than fairly express the various properties of her inner life
her nature appeared to possess depth too as well as variety butor else hesters fears deceived herit lacked reference and adaptation to the world into which she was born
the child could not be made amenable to rules
in giving her existence a great law had been broken and the result was a being whose elements were perhaps beautiful and brilliant but all in disorder or with an order peculiar to themselves amidst which the point of variety and arrangement was difficult or impossible to be discovered
hester could only account for the childs characterand even then most vaguely and imperfectlyby recalling what she herself had been during that momentous period while pearl was imbibing her soul from the spiritual world and her bodily frame from its material of earth
the mothers impassioned state had been the medium through which were transmitted to the unborn infant the rays of its moral life and however white and clear originally they had taken the deep stains of crimson and gold the fiery lustre the black shadow and the untempered light of the intervening substance
above all the warfare of hesters spirit at that epoch was perpetuated in pearl
she could recognize her wild desperate defiant mood the flightiness of her temper and even some of the very cloudshapes of gloom and despondency that had brooded in her heart
they were now illuminated by the morning radiance of a young childs disposition but later in the day of earthly existence might be prolific of the storm and whirlwind
the discipline of the family in those days was of a far more rigid kind than now
the frown the harsh rebuke the frequent application of the rod enjoined by scriptural authority were used not merely in the way of punishment for actual offences but as a wholesome regimen for the growth and promotion of all childish virtues
hester prynne nevertheless the loving mother of this one child ran little risk of erring on the side of undue severity
mindful however of her own errors and misfortunes she early sought to impose a tender but strict control over the infant immortality that was committed to her charge
but the task was beyond her skill
after testing both smiles and frowns and proving that neither mode of treatment possessed any calculable influence hester was ultimately compelled to stand aside and permit the child to be swayed by her own impulses
physical compulsion or restraint was effectual of course while it lasted
as to any other kind of discipline whether addressed to her mind or heart little pearl might or might not be within its reach in accordance with the caprice that ruled the moment
her mother while pearl was yet an infant grew acquainted with a certain peculiar look that warned her when it would be labour thrown away to insist persuade or plead
it was a look so intelligent yet inexplicable perverse sometimes so malicious but generally accompanied by a wild flow of spirits that hester could not help questioning at such moments whether pearl was a human child
she seemed rather an airy sprite which after playing its fantastic sports for a little while upon the cottage floor would flit away with a mocking smile
whenever that look appeared in her wild bright deeply black eyes it invested her with a strange remoteness and intangibility it was as if she were hovering in the air and might vanish like a glimmering light that comes we know not whence and goes we know not whither
beholding it hester was constrained to rush towards the childto pursue the little elf in the flight which she invariably beganto snatch her to her bosom with a close pressure and earnest kissesnot so much from overflowing love as to assure herself that pearl was flesh and blood and not utterly delusive
but pearls laugh when she was caught though full of merriment and music made her mother more doubtful than before
heartsmitten at this bewildering and baffling spell that so often came between herself and her sole treasure whom she had bought so dear and who was all her world hester sometimes burst into passionate tears
then perhapsfor there was no foreseeing how it might affect herpearl would frown and clench her little fist and harden her small features into a stern unsympathising look of discontent
not seldom she would laugh anew and louder than before like a thing incapable and unintelligent of human sorrow
orbut this more rarely happenedshe would be convulsed with rage of grief and sob out her love for her mother in broken words and seem intent on proving that she had a heart by breaking it
yet hester was hardly safe in confiding herself to that gusty tenderness it passed as suddenly as it came
brooding over all these matters the mother felt like one who has evoked a spirit but by some irregularity in the process of conjuration has failed to win the masterword that should control this new and incomprehensible intelligence
her only real comfort was when the child lay in the placidity of sleep
then she was sure of her and tasted hours of quiet sad delicious happiness untilperhaps with that perverse expression glimmering from beneath her opening lidslittle pearl awoke
how soonwith what strange rapidity indeeddid pearl arrive at an age that was capable of social intercourse beyond the mothers everready smile and nonsensewords
and then what a happiness would it have been could hester prynne have heard her clear birdlike voice mingling with the uproar of other childish voices and have distinguished and unravelled her own darlings tones amid all the entangled outcry of a group of sportive children
but this could never be
pearl was a born outcast of the infantile world
an imp of evil emblem and product of sin she had no right among christened infants
nothing was more remarkable than the instinct as it seemed with which the child comprehended her loneliness the destiny that had drawn an inviolable circle round about her the whole peculiarity in short of her position in respect to other children
never since her release from prison had hester met the public gaze without her
in all her walks about the town pearl too was there first as the babe in arms and afterwards as the little girl small companion of her mother holding a forefinger with her whole grasp and tripping along at the rate of three or four footsteps to one of hesters
she saw the children of the settlement on the grassy margin of the street or at the domestic thresholds disporting themselves in such grim fashions as the puritanic nurture would permit playing at going to church perchance or at scourging quakers or taking scalps in a sham fight with the indians or scaring one another with freaks of imitative witchcraft
pearl saw and gazed intently but never sought to make acquaintance
if spoken to she would not speak again
if the children gathered about her as they sometimes did pearl would grow positively terrible in her puny wrath snatching up stones to fling at them with shrill incoherent exclamations that made her mother tremble because they had so much the sound of a witchs anathemas in some unknown tongue
the truth was that the little puritans being of the most intolerant brood that ever lived had got a vague idea of something outlandish unearthly or at variance with ordinary fashions in the mother and child and therefore scorned them in their hearts and not unfrequently reviled them with their tongues
pearl felt the sentiment and requited it with the bitterest hatred that can be supposed to rankle in a childish bosom
these outbreaks of a fierce temper had a kind of value and even comfort for the mother because there was at least an intelligible earnestness in the mood instead of the fitful caprice that so often thwarted her in the childs manifestations
it appalled her nevertheless to discern here again a shadowy reflection of the evil that had existed in herself
all this enmity and passion had pearl inherited by inalienable right out of hesters heart
mother and daughter stood together in the same circle of seclusion from human society and in the nature of the child seemed to be perpetuated those unquiet elements that had distracted hester prynne before pearls birth but had since begun to be soothed away by the softening influences of maternity
at home within and around her mothers cottage pearl wanted not a wide and various circle of acquaintance
the spell of life went forth from her evercreative spirit and communicated itself to a thousand objects as a torch kindles a flame wherever it may be applied
the unlikeliest materialsa stick a bunch of rags a flowerwere the puppets of pearls witchcraft and without undergoing any outward change became spiritually adapted to whatever drama occupied the stage of her inner world
her one babyvoice served a multitude of imaginary personages old and young to talk withal
the pinetrees aged black and solemn and flinging groans and other melancholy utterances on the breeze needed little transformation to figure as puritan elders the ugliest weeds of the garden were their children whom pearl smote down and uprooted most unmercifully
it was wonderful the vast variety of forms into which she threw her intellect with no continuity indeed but darting up and dancing always in a state of preternatural activitysoon sinking down as if exhausted by so rapid and feverish a tide of lifeand succeeded by other shapes of a similar wild energy
it was like nothing so much as the phantasmagoric play of the northern lights
in the mere exercise of the fancy however and the sportiveness of a growing mind there might be a little more than was observable in other children of bright faculties except as pearl in the dearth of human playmates was thrown more upon the visionary throng which she created
the singularity lay in the hostile feelings with which the child regarded all these offsprings of her own heart and mind
she never created a friend but seemed always to be sowing broadcast the dragons teeth whence sprung a harvest of armed enemies against whom she rushed to battle
it was inexpressibly sadthen what depth of sorrow to a mother who felt in her own heart the causeto observe in one so young this constant recognition of an adverse world and so fierce a training of the energies that were to make good her cause in the contest that must ensue
gazing at pearl hester prynne often dropped her work upon her knees and cried out with an agony which she would fain have hidden but which made utterance for itself betwixt speech and a groano father in heavenif thou art still my fatherwhat is this being which i have brought into the world and pearl overhearing the ejaculation or aware through some more subtile channel of those throbs of anguish would turn her vivid and beautiful little face upon her mother smile with spritelike intelligence and resume her play
one peculiarity of the childs deportment remains yet to be told
the very first thing which she had noticed in her life waswhatnot the mothers smile responding to it as other babies do by that faint embryo smile of the little mouth remembered so doubtfully afterwards and with such fond discussion whether it were indeed a smile
by no means
but that first object of which pearl seemed to become aware wasshall we say itthe scarlet letter on hesters bosom
one day as her mother stooped over the cradle the infants eyes had been caught by the glimmering of the gold embroidery about the letter and putting up her little hand she grasped at it smiling not doubtfully but with a decided gleam that gave her face the look of a much older child
then gasping for breath did hester prynne clutch the fatal token instinctively endeavouring to tear it away so infinite was the torture inflicted by the intelligent touch of pearls babyhand
again as if her mothers agonised gesture were meant only to make sport for her did little pearl look into her eyes and smile
from that epoch except when the child was asleep hester had never felt a moments safety not a moments calm enjoyment of her
weeks it is true would sometimes elapse during which pearls gaze might never once be fixed upon the scarlet letter but then again it would come at unawares like the stroke of sudden death and always with that peculiar smile and odd expression of the eyes
once this freakish elvish cast came into the childs eyes while hester was looking at her own image in them as mothers are fond of doing and suddenlyfor women in solitude and with troubled hearts are pestered with unaccountable delusionsshe fancied that she beheld not her own miniature portrait but another face in the small black mirror of pearls eye
it was a face fiendlike full of smiling malice yet bearing the semblance of features that she had known full well though seldom with a smile and never with malice in them
it was as if an evil spirit possessed the child and had just then peeped forth in mockery
many a time afterwards had hester been tortured though less vividly by the same illusion
in the afternoon of a certain summers day after pearl grew big enough to run about she amused herself with gathering handfuls of wild flowers and flinging them one by one at her mothers bosom dancing up and down like a little elf whenever she hit the scarlet letter
hesters first motion had been to cover her bosom with her clasped hands
but whether from pride or resignation or a feeling that her penance might best be wrought out by this unutterable pain she resisted the impulse and sat erect pale as death looking sadly into little pearls wild eyes
still came the battery of flowers almost invariably hitting the mark and covering the mothers breast with hurts for which she could find no balm in this world nor knew how to seek it in another
at last her shot being all expended the child stood still and gazed at hester with that little laughing image of a fiend peeping outor whether it peeped or no her mother so imagined itfrom the unsearchable abyss of her black eyes
child what art thou cried the mother
oh i am your little pearl answered the child
but while she said it pearl laughed and began to dance up and down with the humoursome gesticulation of a little imp whose next freak might be to fly up the chimney
art thou my child in very truth asked hester
nor did she put the question altogether idly but for the moment with a portion of genuine earnestness for such was pearls wonderful intelligence that her mother half doubted whether she were not acquainted with the secret spell of her existence and might not now reveal herself
yes i am little pearl repeated the child continuing her antics
thou art not my child
thou art no pearl of mine said the mother half playfully for it was often the case that a sportive impulse came over her in the midst of her deepest suffering
tell me then what thou art and who sent thee hither  tell me mother said the child seriously coming up to hester and pressing herself close to her knees
do thou tell me  thy heavenly father sent thee answered hester prynne
but she said it with a hesitation that did not escape the acuteness of the child
whether moved only by her ordinary freakishness or because an evil spirit prompted her she put up her small forefinger and touched the scarlet letter
he did not send me cried she positively
i have no heavenly father  hush pearl hush
thou must not talk so answered the mother suppressing a groan
he sent us all into the world
he sent even me thy mother
then much more thee
or if not thou strange and elfish child whence didst thou come  tell me
tell me repeated pearl no longer seriously but laughing and capering about the floor
it is thou that must tell me  but hester could not resolve the query being herself in a dismal labyrinth of doubt
she rememberedbetwixt a smile and a shudderthe talk of the neighbouring townspeople who seeking vainly elsewhere for the childs paternity and observing some of her odd attributes had given out that poor little pearl was a demon offspring such as ever since old catholic times had occasionally been seen on earth through the agency of their mothers sin and to promote some foul and wicked purpose
luther according to the scandal of his monkish enemies was a brat of that hellish breed nor was pearl the only child to whom this inauspicious origin was assigned among the new england puritans
vii
the governors hall   hester prynne went one day to the mansion of governor bellingham with a pair of gloves which she had fringed and embroidered to his order and which were to be worn on some great occasion of state for though the chances of a popular election had caused this former ruler to descend a step or two from the highest rank he still held an honourable and influential place among the colonial magistracy
another and far more important reason than the delivery of a pair of embroidered gloves impelled hester at this time to seek an interview with a personage of so much power and activity in the affairs of the settlement
it had reached her ears that there was a design on the part of some of the leading inhabitants cherishing the more rigid order of principles in religion and government to deprive her of her child
on the supposition that pearl as already hinted was of demon origin these good people not unreasonably argued that a christian interest in the mothers soul required them to remove such a stumblingblock from her path
if the child on the other hand were really capable of moral and religious growth and possessed the elements of ultimate salvation then surely it would enjoy all the fairer prospect of these advantages by being transferred to wiser and better guardianship than hester prynnes
among those who promoted the design governor bellingham was said to be one of the most busy
it may appear singular and indeed not a little ludicrous that an affair of this kind which in later days would have been referred to no higher jurisdiction than that of the select men of the town should then have been a question publicly discussed and on which statesmen of eminence took sides
at that epoch of pristine simplicity however matters of even slighter public interest and of far less intrinsic weight than the welfare of hester and her child were strangely mixed up with the deliberations of legislators and acts of state
the period was hardly if at all earlier than that of our story when a dispute concerning the right of property in a pig not only caused a fierce and bitter contest in the legislative body of the colony but resulted in an important modification of the framework itself of the legislature
full of concern thereforebut so conscious of her own right that it seemed scarcely an unequal match between the public on the one side and a lonely woman backed by the sympathies of nature on the otherhester prynne set forth from her solitary cottage
little pearl of course was her companion
she was now of an age to run lightly along by her mothers side and constantly in motion from morn till sunset could have accomplished a much longer journey than that before her
often nevertheless more from caprice than necessity she demanded to be taken up in arms but was soon as imperious to be let down again and frisked onward before hester on the grassy pathway with many a harmless trip and tumble
we have spoken of pearls rich and luxuriant beautya beauty that shone with deep and vivid tints a bright complexion eyes possessing intensity both of depth and glow and hair already of a deep glossy brown and which in after years would be nearly akin to black
there was fire in her and throughout her she seemed the unpremeditated offshoot of a passionate moment
her mother in contriving the childs garb had allowed the gorgeous tendencies of her imagination their full play arraying her in a crimson velvet tunic of a peculiar cut abundantly embroidered in fantasies and flourishes of gold thread
so much strength of colouring which must have given a wan and pallid aspect to cheeks of a fainter bloom was admirably adapted to pearls beauty and made her the very brightest little jet of flame that ever danced upon the earth
but it was a remarkable attribute of this garb and indeed of the childs whole appearance that it irresistibly and inevitably reminded the beholder of the token which hester prynne was doomed to wear upon her bosom
it was the scarlet letter in another form the scarlet letter endowed with life
the mother herselfas if the red ignominy were so deeply scorched into her brain that all her conceptions assumed its formhad carefully wrought out the similitude lavishing many hours of morbid ingenuity to create an analogy between the object of her affection and the emblem of her guilt and torture
but in truth pearl was the one as well as the other and only in consequence of that identity had hester contrived so perfectly to represent the scarlet letter in her appearance
as the two wayfarers came within the precincts of the town the children of the puritans looked up from their playor what passed for play with those sombre little urchinsand spoke gravely one to another
behold verily there is the woman of the scarlet letter and of a truth moreover there is the likeness of the scarlet letter running along by her side
come therefore and let us fling mud at them  but pearl who was a dauntless child after frowning stamping her foot and shaking her little hand with a variety of threatening gestures suddenly made a rush at the knot of her enemies and put them all to flight
she resembled in her fierce pursuit of them an infant pestilencethe scarlet fever or some such halffledged angel of judgmentwhose mission was to punish the sins of the rising generation
she screamed and shouted too with a terrific volume of sound which doubtless caused the hearts of the fugitives to quake within them
the victory accomplished pearl returned quietly to her mother and looked up smiling into her face
without further adventure they reached the dwelling of governor bellingham
this was a large wooden house built in a fashion of which there are specimens still extant in the streets of our older towns now mossgrown crumbling to decay and melancholy at heart with the many sorrowful or joyful occurrences remembered or forgotten that have happened and passed away within their dusky chambers
then however there was the freshness of the passing year on its exterior and the cheerfulness gleaming forth from the sunny windows of a human habitation into which death had never entered
it had indeed a very cheery aspect the walls being overspread with a kind of stucco in which fragments of broken glass were plentifully intermixed so that when the sunshine fell aslantwise over the front of the edifice it glittered and sparkled as if diamonds had been flung against it by the double handful
the brilliancy might have befitted aladdins palace rather than the mansion of a grave old puritan ruler
it was further decorated with strange and seemingly cabalistic figures and diagrams suitable to the quaint taste of the age which had been drawn in the stucco when newly laid on and had now grown hard and durable for the admiration of after times
pearl looking at this bright wonder of a house began to caper and dance and imperatively required that the whole breadth of sunshine should be stripped off its front and given her to play with
no my little pearl said her mother thou must gather thine own sunshine
i have none to give thee  they approached the door which was of an arched form and flanked on each side by a narrow tower or projection of the edifice in both of which were latticewindows the wooden shutters to close over them at need
lifting the iron hammer that hung at the portal hester prynne gave a summons which was answered by one of the governors bondservantsa freeborn englishman but now a seven years slave
during that term he was to be the property of his master and as much a commodity of bargain and sale as an ox or a jointstool
the serf wore the customary garb of servingmen at that period and long before in the old hereditary halls of england
is the worshipful governor bellingham within inquired hester
yea forsooth replied the bondservant staring with wideopen eyes at the scarlet letter which being a newcomer in the country he had never before seen
yea his honourable worship is within
but he hath a godly minister or two with him and likewise a leech
ye may not see his worship now  nevertheless i will enter answered hester prynne and the bondservant perhaps judging from the decision of her air and the glittering symbol in her bosom that she was a great lady in the land offered no opposition
so the mother and little pearl were admitted into the hall of entrance
with many variations suggested by the nature of his building materials diversity of climate and a different mode of social life governor bellingham had planned his new habitation after the residences of gentlemen of fair estate in his native land
here then was a wide and reasonably lofty hall extending through the whole depth of the house and forming a medium of general communication more or less directly with all the other apartments
at one extremity this spacious room was lighted by the windows of the two towers which formed a small recess on either side of the portal
at the other end though partly muffled by a curtain it was more powerfully illuminated by one of those embowed hall windows which we read of in old books and which was provided with a deep and cushioned seat
here on the cushion lay a folio tome probably of the chronicles of england or other such substantial literature even as in our own days we scatter gilded volumes on the centre table to be turned over by the casual guest
the furniture of the hall consisted of some ponderous chairs the backs of which were elaborately carved with wreaths of oaken flowers and likewise a table in the same taste the whole being of the elizabethan age or perhaps earlier and heirlooms transferred hither from the governors paternal home
on the tablein token that the sentiment of old english hospitality had not been left behindstood a large pewter tankard at the bottom of which had hester or pearl peeped into it they might have seen the frothy remnant of a recent draught of ale
on the wall hung a row of portraits representing the forefathers of the bellingham lineage some with armour on their breasts and others with stately ruffs and robes of peace
all were characterised by the sternness and severity which old portraits so invariably put on as if they were the ghosts rather than the pictures of departed worthies and were gazing with harsh and intolerant criticism at the pursuits and enjoyments of living men
at about the centre of the oaken panels that lined the hall was suspended a suit of mail not like the pictures an ancestral relic but of the most modern date for it had been manufactured by a skilful armourer in london the same year in which governor bellingham came over to new england
there was a steel headpiece a cuirass a gorget and greaves with a pair of gauntlets and a sword hanging beneath all and especially the helmet and breastplate so highly burnished as to glow with white radiance and scatter an illumination everywhere about upon the floor
this bright panoply was not meant for mere idle show but had been worn by the governor on many a solemn muster and training field and had glittered moreover at the head of a regiment in the pequod war
for though bred a lawyer and accustomed to speak of bacon coke noye and finch as his professional associates the exigencies of this new country had transformed governor bellingham into a soldier as well as a statesman and ruler
little pearl who was as greatly pleased with the gleaming armour as she had been with the glittering frontispiece of the house spent some time looking into the polished mirror of the breastplate
mother cried she i see you here
look
look  hester looked by way of humouring the child and she saw that owing to the peculiar effect of this convex mirror the scarlet letter was represented in exaggerated and gigantic proportions so as to be greatly the most prominent feature of her appearance
in truth she seemed absolutely hidden behind it
pearl pointed upwards also at a similar picture in the headpiece smiling at her mother with the elfish intelligence that was so familiar an expression on her small physiognomy
that look of naughty merriment was likewise reflected in the mirror with so much breadth and intensity of effect that it made hester prynne feel as if it could not be the image of her own child but of an imp who was seeking to mould itself into pearls shape
come along pearl said she drawing her away come and look into this fair garden
it may be we shall see flowers there more beautiful ones than we find in the woods  pearl accordingly ran to the bowwindow at the further end of the hall and looked along the vista of a garden walk carpeted with closelyshaven grass and bordered with some rude and immature attempt at shrubbery
but the proprietor appeared already to have relinquished as hopeless the effort to perpetuate on this side of the atlantic in a hard soil and amid the close struggle for subsistence the native english taste for ornamental gardening
cabbages grew in plain sight and a pumpkinvine rooted at some distance had run across the intervening space and deposited one of its gigantic products directly beneath the hall window as if to warn the governor that this great lump of vegetable gold was as rich an ornament as new england earth would offer him
there were a few rosebushes however and a number of appletrees probably the descendants of those planted by the reverend mr blackstone the first settler of the peninsula that half mythological personage who rides through our early annals seated on the back of a bull
pearl seeing the rosebushes began to cry for a red rose and would not be pacified
hush childhush said her mother earnestly
do not cry dear little pearl
i hear voices in the garden
the governor is coming and gentlemen along with him  in fact adown the vista of the garden avenue a number of persons were seen approaching towards the house
pearl in utter scorn of her mothers attempt to quiet her gave an eldritch scream and then became silent not from any notion of obedience but because the quick and mobile curiosity of her disposition was excited by the appearance of those new personages
viii
the elfchild and the minister   governor bellingham in a loose gown and easy capsuch as elderly gentlemen loved to endue themselves with in their domestic privacywalked foremost and appeared to be showing off his estate and expatiating on his projected improvements
the wide circumference of an elaborate ruff beneath his grey beard in the antiquated fashion of king jamess reign caused his head to look not a little like that of john the baptist in a charger
the impression made by his aspect so rigid and severe and frostbitten with more than autumnal age was hardly in keeping with the appliances of worldly enjoyment wherewith he had evidently done his utmost to surround himself
but it is an error to suppose that our great forefathersthough accustomed to speak and think of human existence as a state merely of trial and warfare and though unfeignedly prepared to sacrifice goods and life at the behest of dutymade it a matter of conscience to reject such means of comfort or even luxury as lay fairly within their grasp
this creed was never taught for instance by the venerable pastor john wilson whose beard white as a snowdrift was seen over governor bellinghams shoulders while its wearer suggested that pears and peaches might yet be naturalised in the new england climate and that purple grapes might possibly be compelled to flourish against the sunny gardenwall
the old clergyman nurtured at the rich bosom of the english church had a long established and legitimate taste for all good and comfortable things and however stern he might show himself in the pulpit or in his public reproof of such transgressions as that of hester prynne still the genial benevolence of his private life had won him warmer affection than was accorded to any of his professional contemporaries
behind the governor and mr wilson came two other guestsone the reverend arthur dimmesdale whom the reader may remember as having taken a brief and reluctant part in the scene of hester prynnes disgrace and in close companionship with him old roger chillingworth a person of great skill in physic who for two or three years past had been settled in the town
it was understood that this learned man was the physician as well as friend of the young minister whose health had severely suffered of late by his too unreserved selfsacrifice to the labours and duties of the pastoral relation
the governor in advance of his visitors ascended one or two steps and throwing open the leaves of the great hall window found himself close to little pearl
the shadow of the curtain fell on hester prynne and partially concealed her
what have we here said governor bellingham looking with surprise at the scarlet little figure before him
i profess i have never seen the like since my days of vanity in old king jamess time when i was wont to esteem it a high favour to be admitted to a court mask
there used to be a swarm of these small apparitions in holiday time and we called them children of the lord of misrule
but how gat such a guest into my hall  ay indeed cried good old mr wilson
what little bird of scarlet plumage may this be
methinks i have seen just such figures when the sun has been shining through a richly painted window and tracing out the golden and crimson images across the floor
but that was in the old land
prithee young one who art thou and what has ailed thy mother to bedizen thee in this strange fashion
art thou a christian childha
dost know thy catechism
or art thou one of those naughty elfs or fairies whom we thought to have left behind us with other relics of papistry in merry old england  i am mothers child answered the scarlet vision and my name is pearl  pearlruby ratheror coralor red rose at the very least judging from thy hue responded the old minister putting forth his hand in a vain attempt to pat little pearl on the cheek
but where is this mother of thine
ah
i see he added and turning to governor bellingham whispered this is the selfsame child of whom we have held speech together and behold here the unhappy woman hester prynne her mother  sayest thou so cried the governor
nay we might have judged that such a childs mother must needs be a scarlet woman and a worthy type of her of babylon
but she comes at a good time and we will look into this matter forthwith  governor bellingham stepped through the window into the hall followed by his three guests
hester prynne said he fixing his naturally stern regard on the wearer of the scarlet letter there hath been much question concerning thee of late
the point hath been weightily discussed whether we that are of authority and influence do well discharge our consciences by trusting an immortal soul such as there is in yonder child to the guidance of one who hath stumbled and fallen amid the pitfalls of this world
speak thou the childs own mother
were it not thinkest thou for thy little ones temporal and eternal welfare that she be taken out of thy charge and clad soberly and disciplined strictly and instructed in the truths of heaven and earth
what canst thou do for the child in this kind  i can teach my little pearl what i have learned from this answered hester prynne laying her finger on the red token
woman it is thy badge of shame replied the stern magistrate
it is because of the stain which that letter indicates that we would transfer thy child to other hands  nevertheless said the mother calmly though growing more pale this badge hath taught meit daily teaches meit is teaching me at this momentlessons whereof my child may be the wiser and better albeit they can profit nothing to myself  we will judge warily said bellingham and look well what we are about to do
good master wilson i pray you examine this pearlsince that is her nameand see whether she hath had such christian nurture as befits a child of her age  the old minister seated himself in an armchair and made an effort to draw pearl betwixt his knees
but the child unaccustomed to the touch or familiarity of any but her mother escaped through the open window and stood on the upper step looking like a wild tropical bird of rich plumage ready to take flight into the upper air
mr wilson not a little astonished at this outbreakfor he was a grandfatherly sort of personage and usually a vast favourite with childrenessayed however to proceed with the examination
pearl said he with great solemnity thou must take heed to instruction that so in due season thou mayest wear in thy bosom the pearl of great price
canst thou tell me my child who made thee  now pearl knew well enough who made her for hester prynne the daughter of a pious home very soon after her talk with the child about her heavenly father had begun to inform her of those truths which the human spirit at whatever stage of immaturity imbibes with such eager interest
pearl thereforeso large were the attainments of her three years lifetimecould have borne a fair examination in the new england primer or the first column of the westminster catechisms although unacquainted with the outward form of either of those celebrated works
but that perversity which all children have more or less of and of which little pearl had a tenfold portion now at the most inopportune moment took thorough possession of her and closed her lips or impelled her to speak words amiss
after putting her finger in her mouth with many ungracious refusals to answer good mr wilsons question the child finally announced that she had not been made at all but had been plucked by her mother off the bush of wild roses that grew by the prisondoor
this phantasy was probably suggested by the near proximity of the governors red roses as pearl stood outside of the window together with her recollection of the prison rosebush which she had passed in coming hither
old roger chillingworth with a smile on his face whispered something in the young clergymans ear
hester prynne looked at the man of skill and even then with her fate hanging in the balance was startled to perceive what a change had come over his featureshow much uglier they were how his dark complexion seemed to have grown duskier and his figure more misshapensince the days when she had familiarly known him
she met his eyes for an instant but was immediately constrained to give all her attention to the scene now going forward
this is awful cried the governor slowly recovering from the astonishment into which pearls response had thrown him
here is a child of three years old and she cannot tell who made her
without question she is equally in the dark as to her soul its present depravity and future destiny
methinks gentlemen we need inquire no further  hester caught hold of pearl and drew her forcibly into her arms confronting the old puritan magistrate with almost a fierce expression
alone in the world cast off by it and with this sole treasure to keep her heart alive she felt that she possessed indefeasible rights against the world and was ready to defend them to the death
god gave me the child cried she
he gave her in requital of all things else which ye had taken from me
she is my happinessshe is my torture none the less
pearl keeps me here in life
pearl punishes me too
see ye not she is the scarlet letter only capable of being loved and so endowed with a millionfold the power of retribution for my sin
ye shall not take her
i will die first  my poor woman said the not unkind old minister the child shall be well cared forfar better than thou canst do for it  god gave her into my keeping repeated hester prynne raising her voice almost to a shriek
i will not give her up and here by a sudden impulse she turned to the young clergyman mr dimmesdale at whom up to this moment she had seemed hardly so much as once to direct her eyes
speak thou for me cried she
thou wast my pastor and hadst charge of my soul and knowest me better than these men can
i will not lose the child
speak for me
thou knowestfor thou hast sympathies which these men lackthou knowest what is in my heart and what are a mothers rights and how much the stronger they are when that mother has but her child and the scarlet letter
look thou to it
i will not lose the child
look to it  at this wild and singular appeal which indicated that hester prynnes situation had provoked her to little less than madness the young minister at once came forward pale and holding his hand over his heart as was his custom whenever his peculiarly nervous temperament was thrown into agitation
he looked now more careworn and emaciated than as we described him at the scene of hesters public ignominy and whether it were his failing health or whatever the cause might be his large dark eyes had a world of pain in their troubled and melancholy depth
there is truth in what she says began the minister with a voice sweet tremulous but powerful insomuch that the hall reechoed and the hollow armour rang with ittruth in what hester says and in the feeling which inspires her
god gave her the child and gave her too an instinctive knowledge of its nature and requirementsboth seemingly so peculiarwhich no other mortal being can possess
and moreover is there not a quality of awful sacredness in the relation between this mother and this child  ayhow is that good master dimmesdale interrupted the governor
make that plain i pray you  it must be even so resumed the minister
for if we deem it otherwise do we not thereby say that the heavenly father the creator of all flesh hath lightly recognised a deed of sin and made of no account the distinction between unhallowed lust and holy love
this child of its fathers guilt and its mothers shame has come from the hand of god to work in many ways upon her heart who pleads so earnestly and with such bitterness of spirit the right to keep her
it was meant for a blessingfor the one blessing of her life
it was meant doubtless the mother herself hath told us for a retribution too a torture to be felt at many an unthoughtof moment a pang a sting an everrecurring agony in the midst of a troubled joy
hath she not expressed this thought in the garb of the poor child so forcibly reminding us of that red symbol which sears her bosom  well said again cried good mr wilson
i feared the woman had no better thought than to make a mountebank of her child  oh not sonot so continued mr dimmesdale
she recognises believe me the solemn miracle which god hath wrought in the existence of that child
and may she feel toowhat methinks is the very truththat this boon was meant above all things else to keep the mothers soul alive and to preserve her from blacker depths of sin into which satan might else have sought to plunge her
therefore it is good for this poor sinful woman that she hath an infant immortality a being capable of eternal joy or sorrow confided to her careto be trained up by her to righteousness to remind her at every moment of her fall but yet to teach her as if it were by the creators sacred pledge that if she bring the child to heaven the child also will bring its parents thither
herein is the sinful mother happier than the sinful father
for hester prynnes sake then and no less for the poor childs sake let us leave them as providence hath seen fit to place them  you speak my friend with a strange earnestness said old roger chillingworth smiling at him
and there is a weighty import in what my young brother hath spoken added the rev
mr wilson
what say you worshipful master bellingham
hath he not pleaded well for the poor woman  indeed hath he answered the magistrate and hath adduced such arguments that we will even leave the matter as it now stands so long at least as there shall be no further scandal in the woman
care must be had nevertheless to put the child to due and stated examination in the catechism at thy hands or master dimmesdales
moreover at a proper season the tithingmen must take heed that she go both to school and to meeting  the young minister on ceasing to speak had withdrawn a few steps from the group and stood with his face partially concealed in the heavy folds of the windowcurtain while the shadow of his figure which the sunlight cast upon the floor was tremulous with the vehemence of his appeal
pearl that wild and flighty little elf stole softly towards him and taking his hand in the grasp of both her own laid her cheek against it a caress so tender and withal so unobtrusive that her mother who was looking on asked herselfis that my pearl yet she knew that there was love in the childs heart although it mostly revealed itself in passion and hardly twice in her lifetime had been softened by such gentleness as now
the ministerfor save the longsought regards of woman nothing is sweeter than these marks of childish preference accorded spontaneously by a spiritual instinct and therefore seeming to imply in us something truly worthy to be lovedthe minister looked round laid his hand on the childs head hesitated an instant and then kissed her brow
little pearls unwonted mood of sentiment lasted no longer she laughed and went capering down the hall so airily that old mr wilson raised a question whether even her tiptoes touched the floor
the little baggage hath witchcraft in her i profess said he to mr dimmesdale
she needs no old womans broomstick to fly withal  a strange child remarked old roger chillingworth
it is easy to see the mothers part in her
would it be beyond a philosophers research think ye gentlemen to analyse that childs nature and from it make a mould to give a shrewd guess at the father  nay it would be sinful in such a question to follow the clue of profane philosophy said mr wilson
better to fast and pray upon it and still better it may be to leave the mystery as we find it unless providence reveal it of its own accord
thereby every good christian man hath a title to show a fathers kindness towards the poor deserted babe  the affair being so satisfactorily concluded hester prynne with pearl departed from the house
as they descended the steps it is averred that the lattice of a chamberwindow was thrown open and forth into the sunny day was thrust the face of mistress hibbins governor bellinghams bittertempered sister and the same who a few years later was executed as a witch
hist hist said she while her illomened physiognomy seemed to cast a shadow over the cheerful newness of the house
wilt thou go with us tonight
there will be a merry company in the forest and i wellnigh promised the black man that comely hester prynne should make one  make my excuse to him so please you answered hester with a triumphant smile
i must tarry at home and keep watch over my little pearl
had they taken her from me i would willingly have gone with thee into the forest and signed my name in the black mans book too and that with mine own blood  we shall have thee there anon said the witchlady frowning as she drew back her head
but hereif we suppose this interview betwixt mistress hibbins and hester prynne to be authentic and not a parablewas already an illustration of the young ministers argument against sundering the relation of a fallen mother to the offspring of her frailty
even thus early had the child saved her from satans snare
ix
the leech   under the appellation of roger chillingworth the reader will remember was hidden another name which its former wearer had resolved should never more be spoken
it has been related how in the crowd that witnessed hester prynnes ignominious exposure stood a man elderly travelworn who just emerging from the perilous wilderness beheld the woman in whom he hoped to find embodied the warmth and cheerfulness of home set up as a type of sin before the people
her matronly fame was trodden under all mens feet
infamy was babbling around her in the public marketplace
for her kindred should the tidings ever reach them and for the companions of her unspotted life there remained nothing but the contagion of her dishonour which would not fail to be distributed in strict accordance and proportion with the intimacy and sacredness of their previous relationship
then whysince the choice was with himselfshould the individual whose connexion with the fallen woman had been the most intimate and sacred of them all come forward to vindicate his claim to an inheritance so little desirable
he resolved not to be pilloried beside her on her pedestal of shame
unknown to all but hester prynne and possessing the lock and key of her silence he chose to withdraw his name from the roll of mankind and as regarded his former ties and interest to vanish out of life as completely as if he indeed lay at the bottom of the ocean whither rumour had long ago consigned him
this purpose once effected new interests would immediately spring up and likewise a new purpose dark it is true if not guilty but of force enough to engage the full strength of his faculties
in pursuance of this resolve he took up his residence in the puritan town as roger chillingworth without other introduction than the learning and intelligence of which he possessed more than a common measure
as his studies at a previous period of his life had made him extensively acquainted with the medical science of the day it was as a physician that he presented himself and as such was cordially received
skilful men of the medical and chirurgical profession were of rare occurrence in the colony
they seldom it would appear partook of the religious zeal that brought other emigrants across the atlantic
in their researches into the human frame it may be that the higher and more subtle faculties of such men were materialised and that they lost the spiritual view of existence amid the intricacies of that wondrous mechanism which seemed to involve art enough to comprise all of life within itself
at all events the health of the good town of boston so far as medicine had aught to do with it had hitherto lain in the guardianship of an aged deacon and apothecary whose piety and godly deportment were stronger testimonials in his favour than any that he could have produced in the shape of a diploma
the only surgeon was one who combined the occasional exercise of that noble art with the daily and habitual flourish of a razor
to such a professional body roger chillingworth was a brilliant acquisition
he soon manifested his familiarity with the ponderous and imposing machinery of antique physic in which every remedy contained a multitude of farfetched and heterogeneous ingredients as elaborately compounded as if the proposed result had been the elixir of life
in his indian captivity moreover he had gained much knowledge of the properties of native herbs and roots nor did he conceal from his patients that these simple medicines natures boon to the untutored savage had quite as large a share of his own confidence as the european pharmacopia which so many learned doctors had spent centuries in elaborating
this learned stranger was exemplary as regarded at least the outward forms of a religious life and early after his arrival had chosen for his spiritual guide the reverend mr dimmesdale
the young divine whose scholarlike renown still lived in oxford was considered by his more fervent admirers as little less than a heavenly ordained apostle destined should he live and labour for the ordinary term of life to do as great deeds for the now feeble new england church as the early fathers had achieved for the infancy of the christian faith
about this period however the health of mr dimmesdale had evidently begun to fail
by those best acquainted with his habits the paleness of the young ministers cheek was accounted for by his too earnest devotion to study his scrupulous fulfilment of parochial duty and more than all to the fasts and vigils of which he made a frequent practice in order to keep the grossness of this earthly state from clogging and obscuring his spiritual lamp
some declared that if mr dimmesdale were really going to die it was cause enough that the world was not worthy to be any longer trodden by his feet
he himself on the other hand with characteristic humility avowed his belief that if providence should see fit to remove him it would be because of his own unworthiness to perform its humblest mission here on earth
with all this difference of opinion as to the cause of his decline there could be no question of the fact
his form grew emaciated his voice though still rich and sweet had a certain melancholy prophecy of decay in it he was often observed on any slight alarm or other sudden accident to put his hand over his heart with first a flush and then a paleness indicative of pain
such was the young clergymans condition and so imminent the prospect that his dawning light would be extinguished all untimely when roger chillingworth made his advent to the town
his first entry on the scene few people could tell whence dropping down as it were out of the sky or starting from the nether earth had an aspect of mystery which was easily heightened to the miraculous
he was now known to be a man of skill it was observed that he gathered herbs and the blossoms of wildflowers and dug up roots and plucked off twigs from the foresttrees like one acquainted with hidden virtues in what was valueless to common eyes
he was heard to speak of sir kenelm digby and other famous menwhose scientific attainments were esteemed hardly less than supernaturalas having been his correspondents or associates
why with such rank in the learned world had he come hither
what could he whose sphere was in great cities be seeking in the wilderness
in answer to this query a rumour gained groundand however absurd was entertained by some very sensible peoplethat heaven had wrought an absolute miracle by transporting an eminent doctor of physic from a german university bodily through the air and setting him down at the door of mr dimmesdales study
individuals of wiser faith indeed who knew that heaven promotes its purposes without aiming at the stageeffect of what is called miraculous interposition were inclined to see a providential hand in roger chillingworths so opportune arrival
this idea was countenanced by the strong interest which the physician ever manifested in the young clergyman he attached himself to him as a parishioner and sought to win a friendly regard and confidence from his naturally reserved sensibility
he expressed great alarm at his pastors state of health but was anxious to attempt the cure and if early undertaken seemed not despondent of a favourable result
the elders the deacons the motherly dames and the young and fair maidens of mr dimmesdales flock were alike importunate that he should make trial of the physicians frankly offered skill
mr dimmesdale gently repelled their entreaties
i need no medicine said he
but how could the young minister say so when with every successive sabbath his cheek was paler and thinner and his voice more tremulous than beforewhen it had now become a constant habit rather than a casual gesture to press his hand over his heart
was he weary of his labours
did he wish to die
these questions were solemnly propounded to mr dimmesdale by the elder ministers of boston and the deacons of his church who to use their own phrase dealt with him on the sin of rejecting the aid which providence so manifestly held out
he listened in silence and finally promised to confer with the physician
were it gods will said the reverend mr dimmesdale when in fulfilment of this pledge he requested old roger chillingworths professional advice i could be well content that my labours and my sorrows and my sins and my pains should shortly end with me and what is earthly of them be buried in my grave and the spiritual go with me to my eternal state rather than that you should put your skill to the proof in my behalf  ah replied roger chillingworth with that quietness which whether imposed or natural marked all his deportment it is thus that a young clergyman is apt to speak
youthful men not having taken a deep root give up their hold of life so easily
and saintly men who walk with god on earth would fain be away to walk with him on the golden pavements of the new jerusalem  nay rejoined the young minister putting his hand to his heart with a flush of pain flitting over his brow were i worthier to walk there i could be better content to toil here  good men ever interpret themselves too meanly said the physician
in this manner the mysterious old roger chillingworth became the medical adviser of the reverend mr dimmesdale
as not only the disease interested the physician but he was strongly moved to look into the character and qualities of the patient these two men so different in age came gradually to spend much time together
for the sake of the ministers health and to enable the leech to gather plants with healing balm in them they took long walks on the seashore or in the forest mingling various walks with the splash and murmur of the waves and the solemn windanthem among the treetops
often likewise one was the guest of the other in his place of study and retirement
there was a fascination for the minister in the company of the man of science in whom he recognised an intellectual cultivation of no moderate depth or scope together with a range and freedom of ideas that he would have vainly looked for among the members of his own profession
in truth he was startled if not shocked to find this attribute in the physician
mr dimmesdale was a true priest a true religionist with the reverential sentiment largely developed and an order of mind that impelled itself powerfully along the track of a creed and wore its passage continually deeper with the lapse of time
in no state of society would he have been what is called a man of liberal views it would always be essential to his peace to feel the pressure of a faith about him supporting while it confined him within its iron framework
not the less however though with a tremulous enjoyment did he feel the occasional relief of looking at the universe through the medium of another kind of intellect than those with which he habitually held converse
it was as if a window were thrown open admitting a freer atmosphere into the close and stifled study where his life was wasting itself away amid lamplight or obstructed daybeams and the musty fragrance be it sensual or moral that exhales from books
but the air was too fresh and chill to be long breathed with comfort
so the minister and the physician with him withdrew again within the limits of what their church defined as orthodox
thus roger chillingworth scrutinised his patient carefully both as he saw him in his ordinary life keeping an accustomed pathway in the range of thoughts familiar to him and as he appeared when thrown amidst other moral scenery the novelty of which might call out something new to the surface of his character
he deemed it essential it would seem to know the man before attempting to do him good
wherever there is a heart and an intellect the diseases of the physical frame are tinged with the peculiarities of these
in arthur dimmesdale thought and imagination were so active and sensibility so intense that the bodily infirmity would be likely to have its groundwork there
so roger chillingworththe man of skill the kind and friendly physicianstrove to go deep into his patients bosom delving among his principles prying into his recollections and probing everything with a cautious touch like a treasureseeker in a dark cavern
few secrets can escape an investigator who has opportunity and licence to undertake such a quest and skill to follow it up
a man burdened with a secret should especially avoid the intimacy of his physician
if the latter possess native sagacity and a nameless something morelet us call it intuition if he show no intrusive egotism nor disagreeable prominent characteristics of his own if he have the power which must be born with him to bring his mind into such affinity with his patients that this last shall unawares have spoken what he imagines himself only to have thought if such revelations be received without tumult and acknowledged not so often by an uttered sympathy as by silence an inarticulate breath and here and there a word to indicate that all is understood if to these qualifications of a confidant be joined the advantages afforded by his recognised character as a physicianthen at some inevitable moment will the soul of the sufferer be dissolved and flow forth in a dark but transparent stream bringing all its mysteries into the daylight
roger chillingworth possessed all or most of the attributes above enumerated
nevertheless time went on a kind of intimacy as we have said grew up between these two cultivated minds which had as wide a field as the whole sphere of human thought and study to meet upon they discussed every topic of ethics and religion of public affairs and private character they talked much on both sides of matters that seemed personal to themselves and yet no secret such as the physician fancied must exist there ever stole out of the ministers consciousness into his companions ear
the latter had his suspicions indeed that even the nature of mr dimmesdales bodily disease had never fairly been revealed to him
it was a strange reserve
after a time at a hint from roger chillingworth the friends of mr dimmesdale effected an arrangement by which the two were lodged in the same house so that every ebb and flow of the ministers lifetide might pass under the eye of his anxious and attached physician
there was much joy throughout the town when this greatly desirable object was attained
it was held to be the best possible measure for the young clergymans welfare unless indeed as often urged by such as felt authorised to do so he had selected some one of the many blooming damsels spiritually devoted to him to become his devoted wife
this latter step however there was no present prospect that arthur dimmesdale would be prevailed upon to take he rejected all suggestions of the kind as if priestly celibacy were one of his articles of church discipline
doomed by his own choice therefore as mr dimmesdale so evidently was to eat his unsavoury morsel always at anothers board and endure the lifelong chill which must be his lot who seeks to warm himself only at anothers fireside it truly seemed that this sagacious experienced benevolent old physician with his concord of paternal and reverential love for the young pastor was the very man of all mankind to be constantly within reach of his voice
the new abode of the two friends was with a pious widow of good social rank who dwelt in a house covering pretty nearly the site on which the venerable structure of kings chapel has since been built
it had the graveyard originally isaac johnsons homefield on one side and so was well adapted to call up serious reflections suited to their respective employments in both minister and man of physic
the motherly care of the good widow assigned to mr dimmesdale a front apartment with a sunny exposure and heavy windowcurtains to create a noontide shadow when desirable
the walls were hung round with tapestry said to be from the gobelin looms and at all events representing the scriptural story of david and bathsheba and nathan the prophet in colours still unfaded but which made the fair woman of the scene almost as grimly picturesque as the woedenouncing seer
here the pale clergyman piled up his library rich with parchmentbound folios of the fathers and the lore of rabbis and monkish erudition of which the protestant divines even while they vilified and decried that class of writers were yet constrained often to avail themselves
on the other side of the house old roger chillingworth arranged his study and laboratory not such as a modern man of science would reckon even tolerably complete but provided with a distilling apparatus and the means of compounding drugs and chemicals which the practised alchemist knew well how to turn to purpose
with such commodiousness of situation these two learned persons sat themselves down each in his own domain yet familiarly passing from one apartment to the other and bestowing a mutual and not incurious inspection into one anothers business
and the reverend arthur dimmesdales best discerning friends as we have intimated very reasonably imagined that the hand of providence had done all this for the purposebesought in so many public and domestic and secret prayersof restoring the young minister to health
but it must now be said another portion of the community had latterly begun to take its own view of the relation betwixt mr dimmesdale and the mysterious old physician
when an uninstructed multitude attempts to see with its eyes it is exceedingly apt to be deceived
when however it forms its judgment as it usually does on the intuitions of its great and warm heart the conclusions thus attained are often so profound and so unerring as to possess the character of truth supernaturally revealed
the people in the case of which we speak could justify its prejudice against roger chillingworth by no fact or argument worthy of serious refutation
there was an aged handicraftsman it is true who had been a citizen of london at the period of sir thomas overburys murder now some thirty years agone he testified to having seen the physician under some other name which the narrator of the story had now forgotten in company with dr forman the famous old conjurer who was implicated in the affair of overbury
two or three individuals hinted that the man of skill during his indian captivity had enlarged his medical attainments by joining in the incantations of the savage priests who were universally acknowledged to be powerful enchanters often performing seemingly miraculous cures by their skill in the black art
a large numberand many of these were persons of such sober sense and practical observation that their opinions would have been valuable in other mattersaffirmed that roger chillingworths aspect had undergone a remarkable change while he had dwelt in town and especially since his abode with mr dimmesdale
at first his expression had been calm meditative scholarlike
now there was something ugly and evil in his face which they had not previously noticed and which grew still the more obvious to sight the oftener they looked upon him
according to the vulgar idea the fire in his laboratory had been brought from the lower regions and was fed with infernal fuel and so as might be expected his visage was getting sooty with the smoke
to sum up the matter it grew to be a widely diffused opinion that the rev
arthur dimmesdale like many other personages of special sanctity in all ages of the christian world was haunted either by satan himself or satans emissary in the guise of old roger chillingworth
this diabolical agent had the divine permission for a season to burrow into the clergymans intimacy and plot against his soul
no sensible man it was confessed could doubt on which side the victory would turn
the people looked with an unshaken hope to see the minister come forth out of the conflict transfigured with the glory which he would unquestionably win
meanwhile nevertheless it was sad to think of the perchance mortal agony through which he must struggle towards his triumph
alas
to judge from the gloom and terror in the depth of the poor ministers eyes the battle was a sore one and the victory anything but secure
x
the leech and his patient   old roger chillingworth throughout life had been calm in temperament kindly though not of warm affections but ever and in all his relations with the world a pure and upright man
he had begun an investigation as he imagined with the severe and equal integrity of a judge desirous only of truth even as if the question involved no more than the airdrawn lines and figures of a geometrical problem instead of human passions and wrongs inflicted on himself
but as he proceeded a terrible fascination a kind of fierce though still calm necessity seized the old man within its gripe and never set him free again until he had done all its bidding
he now dug into the poor clergymans heart like a miner searching for gold or rather like a sexton delving into a grave possibly in quest of a jewel that had been buried on the dead mans bosom but likely to find nothing save mortality and corruption
alas for his own soul if these were what he sought
sometimes a light glimmered out of the physicians eyes burning blue and ominous like the reflection of a furnace or let us say like one of those gleams of ghastly fire that darted from bunyans awful doorway in the hillside and quivered on the pilgrims face
the soil where this dark miner was working had perchance shown indications that encouraged him
this man said he at one such moment to himself pure as they deem himall spiritual as he seemshath inherited a strong animal nature from his father or his mother
let us dig a little further in the direction of this vein  then after long search into the ministers dim interior and turning over many precious materials in the shape of high aspirations for the welfare of his race warm love of souls pure sentiments natural piety strengthened by thought and study and illuminated by revelationall of which invaluable gold was perhaps no better than rubbish to the seekerhe would turn back discouraged and begin his quest towards another point
he groped along as stealthily with as cautious a tread and as wary an outlook as a thief entering a chamber where a man lies only half asleepor it may be broad awakewith purpose to steal the very treasure which this man guards as the apple of his eye
in spite of his premeditated carefulness the floor would now and then creak his garments would rustle the shadow of his presence in a forbidden proximity would be thrown across his victim
in other words mr dimmesdale whose sensibility of nerve often produced the effect of spiritual intuition would become vaguely aware that something inimical to his peace had thrust itself into relation with him
but old roger chillingworth too had perceptions that were almost intuitive and when the minister threw his startled eyes towards him there the physician sat his kind watchful sympathising but never intrusive friend
yet mr dimmesdale would perhaps have seen this individuals character more perfectly if a certain morbidness to which sick hearts are liable had not rendered him suspicious of all mankind
trusting no man as his friend he could not recognize his enemy when the latter actually appeared
he therefore still kept up a familiar intercourse with him daily receiving the old physician in his study or visiting the laboratory and for recreations sake watching the processes by which weeds were converted into drugs of potency
one day leaning his forehead on his hand and his elbow on the sill of the open window that looked towards the graveyard he talked with roger chillingworth while the old man was examining a bundle of unsightly plants
where asked he with a look askance at themfor it was the clergymans peculiarity that he seldom nowadays looked straight forth at any object whether human or inanimate where my kind doctor did you gather those herbs with such a dark flabby leaf  even in the graveyard here at hand answered the physician continuing his employment
they are new to me
i found them growing on a grave which bore no tombstone no other memorial of the dead man save these ugly weeds that have taken upon themselves to keep him in remembrance
they grew out of his heart and typify it may be some hideous secret that was buried with him and which he had done better to confess during his lifetime  perchance said mr dimmesdale he earnestly desired it but could not  and wherefore rejoined the physician
wherefore not since all the powers of nature call so earnestly for the confession of sin that these black weeds have sprung up out of a buried heart to make manifest an outspoken crime  that good sir is but a phantasy of yours replied the minister
there can be if i forbode aright no power short of the divine mercy to disclose whether by uttered words or by type or emblem the secrets that may be buried in the human heart
the heart making itself guilty of such secrets must perforce hold them until the day when all hidden things shall be revealed
nor have i so read or interpreted holy writ as to understand that the disclosure of human thoughts and deeds then to be made is intended as a part of the retribution
that surely were a shallow view of it
no these revelations unless i greatly err are meant merely to promote the intellectual satisfaction of all intelligent beings who will stand waiting on that day to see the dark problem of this life made plain
a knowledge of mens hearts will be needful to the completest solution of that problem
and i conceive moreover that the hearts holding such miserable secrets as you speak of will yield them up at that last day not with reluctance but with a joy unutterable  then why not reveal it here asked roger chillingworth glancing quietly aside at the minister
why should not the guilty ones sooner avail themselves of this unutterable solace  they mostly do said the clergyman griping hard at his breast as if afflicted with an importunate throb of pain
many many a poor soul hath given its confidence to me not only on the deathbed but while strong in life and fair in reputation
and ever after such an outpouring oh what a relief have i witnessed in those sinful brethren
even as in one who at last draws free air after a long stifling with his own polluted breath
how can it be otherwise
why should a wretched manguilty we will say of murderprefer to keep the dead corpse buried in his own heart rather than fling it forth at once and let the universe take care of it  yet some men bury their secrets thus observed the calm physician
true there are such men answered mr dimmesdale
but not to suggest more obvious reasons it may be that they are kept silent by the very constitution of their nature
orcan we not suppose itguilty as they may be retaining nevertheless a zeal for gods glory and mans welfare they shrink from displaying themselves black and filthy in the view of men because thenceforward no good can be achieved by them no evil of the past be redeemed by better service
so to their own unutterable torment they go about among their fellowcreatures looking pure as newfallen snow while their hearts are all speckled and spotted with iniquity of which they cannot rid themselves  these men deceive themselves said roger chillingworth with somewhat more emphasis than usual and making a slight gesture with his forefinger
they fear to take up the shame that rightfully belongs to them
their love for man their zeal for gods servicethese holy impulses may or may not coexist in their hearts with the evil inmates to which their guilt has unbarred the door and which must needs propagate a hellish breed within them
but if they seek to glorify god let them not lift heavenward their unclean hands
if they would serve their fellowmen let them do it by making manifest the power and reality of conscience in constraining them to penitential selfabasement
would thou have me to believe o wise and pious friend that a false show can be bettercan be more for gods glory or mans welfarethan gods own truth
trust me such men deceive themselves  it may be so said the young clergyman indifferently as waiving a discussion that he considered irrelevant or unseasonable
he had a ready faculty indeed of escaping from any topic that agitated his too sensitive and nervous temperamentbut now i would ask of my wellskilled physician whether in good sooth he deems me to have profited by his kindly care of this weak frame of mine  before roger chillingworth could answer they heard the clear wild laughter of a young childs voice proceeding from the adjacent burialground
looking instinctively from the open windowfor it was summertimethe minister beheld hester prynne and little pearl passing along the footpath that traversed the enclosure
pearl looked as beautiful as the day but was in one of those moods of perverse merriment which whenever they occurred seemed to remove her entirely out of the sphere of sympathy or human contact
she now skipped irreverently from one grave to another until coming to the broad flat armorial tombstone of a departed worthyperhaps of isaac johnson himselfshe began to dance upon it
in reply to her mothers command and entreaty that she would behave more decorously little pearl paused to gather the prickly burrs from a tall burdock which grew beside the tomb
taking a handful of these she arranged them along the lines of the scarlet letter that decorated the maternal bosom to which the burrs as their nature was tenaciously adhered
hester did not pluck them off
roger chillingworth had by this time approached the window and smiled grimly down
there is no law nor reverence for authority no regard for human ordinances or opinions right or wrong mixed up with that childs composition remarked he as much to himself as to his companion
i saw her the other day bespatter the governor himself with water at the cattletrough in spring lane
what in heavens name is she
is the imp altogether evil
hath she affections
hath she any discoverable principle of being  none save the freedom of a broken law answered mr dimmesdale in a quiet way as if he had been discussing the point within himself whether capable of good i know not  the child probably overheard their voices for looking up to the window with a bright but naughty smile of mirth and intelligence she threw one of the prickly burrs at the rev
mr dimmesdale
the sensitive clergyman shrank with nervous dread from the light missile
detecting his emotion pearl clapped her little hands in the most extravagant ecstacy
hester prynne likewise had involuntarily looked up and all these four persons old and young regarded one another in silence till the child laughed aloud and shoutedcome away mother
come away or yonder old black man will catch you
he hath got hold of the minister already
come away mother or he will catch you
but he cannot catch little pearl  so she drew her mother away skipping dancing and frisking fantastically among the hillocks of the dead people like a creature that had nothing in common with a bygone and buried generation nor owned herself akin to it
it was as if she had been made afresh out of new elements and must perforce be permitted to live her own life and be a law unto herself without her eccentricities being reckoned to her for a crime
there goes a woman resumed roger chillingworth after a pause who be her demerits what they may hath none of that mystery of hidden sinfulness which you deem so grievous to be borne
is hester prynne the less miserable think you for that scarlet letter on her breast  i do verily believe it answered the clergyman
nevertheless i cannot answer for her
there was a look of pain in her face which i would gladly have been spared the sight of
but still methinks it must needs be better for the sufferer to be free to show his pain as this poor woman hester is than to cover it up in his heart  there was another pause and the physician began anew to examine and arrange the plants which he had gathered
you inquired of me a little time agone said he at length my judgment as touching your health  i did answered the clergyman and would gladly learn it
speak frankly i pray you be it for life or death  freely then and plainly said the physician still busy with his plants but keeping a wary eye on mr dimmesdale the disorder is a strange one not so much in itself nor as outwardly manifestedin so far at least as the symptoms have been laid open to my observation
looking daily at you my good sir and watching the tokens of your aspect now for months gone by i should deem you a man sore sick it may be yet not so sick but that an instructed and watchful physician might well hope to cure you
but i know not what to say the disease is what i seem to know yet know it not  you speak in riddles learned sir said the pale minister glancing aside out of the window
then to speak more plainly continued the physician and i crave pardon sir should it seem to require pardon for this needful plainness of my speech
let me ask as your friend as one having charge under providence of your life and physical well being hath all the operation of this disorder been fairly laid open and recounted to me  how can you question it asked the minister
surely it were childs play to call in a physician and then hide the sore  you would tell me then that i know all said roger chillingworth deliberately and fixing an eye bright with intense and concentrated intelligence on the ministers face
be it so
but again
he to whom only the outward and physical evil is laid open knoweth oftentimes but half the evil which he is called upon to cure
a bodily disease which we look upon as whole and entire within itself may after all be but a symptom of some ailment in the spiritual part
your pardon once again good sir if my speech give the shadow of offence
you sir of all men whom i have known are he whose body is the closest conjoined and imbued and identified so to speak with the spirit whereof it is the instrument  then i need ask no further said the clergyman somewhat hastily rising from his chair
you deal not i take it in medicine for the soul  thus a sickness continued roger chillingworth going on in an unaltered tone without heeding the interruption but standing up and confronting the emaciated and whitecheeked minister with his low dark and misshapen figurea sickness a sore place if we may so call it in your spirit hath immediately its appropriate manifestation in your bodily frame
would you therefore that your physician heal the bodily evil
how may this be unless you first lay open to him the wound or trouble in your soul  no not to thee
not to an earthly physician cried mr dimmesdale passionately and turning his eyes full and bright and with a kind of fierceness on old roger chillingworth
not to thee
but if it be the souls disease then do i commit myself to the one physician of the soul
he if it stand with his good pleasure can cure or he can kill
let him do with me as in his justice and wisdom he shall see good
but who art thou that meddlest in this matter
that dares thrust himself between the sufferer and his god  with a frantic gesture he rushed out of the room
it is as well to have made this step said roger chillingworth to himself looking after the minister with a grave smile
there is nothing lost
we shall be friends again anon
but see now how passion takes hold upon this man and hurrieth him out of himself
as with one passion so with another
he hath done a wild thing ere now this pious master dimmesdale in the hot passion of his heart  it proved not difficult to reestablish the intimacy of the two companions on the same footing and in the same degree as heretofore
the young clergyman after a few hours of privacy was sensible that the disorder of his nerves had hurried him into an unseemly outbreak of temper which there had been nothing in the physicians words to excuse or palliate
he marvelled indeed at the violence with which he had thrust back the kind old man when merely proffering the advice which it was his duty to bestow and which the minister himself had expressly sought
with these remorseful feelings he lost no time in making the amplest apologies and besought his friend still to continue the care which if not successful in restoring him to health had in all probability been the means of prolonging his feeble existence to that hour
roger chillingworth readily assented and went on with his medical supervision of the minister doing his best for him in all good faith but always quitting the patients apartment at the close of the professional interview with a mysterious and puzzled smile upon his lips
this expression was invisible in mr dimmesdales presence but grew strongly evident as the physician crossed the threshold
a rare case he muttered
i must needs look deeper into it
a strange sympathy betwixt soul and body
were it only for the arts sake i must search this matter to the bottom  it came to pass not long after the scene above recorded that the reverend mr dimmesdale at noonday and entirely unawares fell into a deep deep slumber sitting in his chair with a large blackletter volume open before him on the table
it must have been a work of vast ability in the somniferous school of literature
the profound depth of the ministers repose was the more remarkable inasmuch as he was one of those persons whose sleep ordinarily is as light as fitful and as easily scared away as a small bird hopping on a twig
to such an unwonted remoteness however had his spirit now withdrawn into itself that he stirred not in his chair when old roger chillingworth without any extraordinary precaution came into the room
the physician advanced directly in front of his patient laid his hand upon his bosom and thrust aside the vestment that hitherto had always covered it even from the professional eye
then indeed mr dimmesdale shuddered and slightly stirred
after a brief pause the physician turned away
but with what a wild look of wonder joy and horror
with what a ghastly rapture as it were too mighty to be expressed only by the eye and features and therefore bursting forth through the whole ugliness of his figure and making itself even riotously manifest by the extravagant gestures with which he threw up his arms towards the ceiling and stamped his foot upon the floor
had a man seen old roger chillingworth at that moment of his ecstasy he would have had no need to ask how satan comports himself when a precious human soul is lost to heaven and won into his kingdom
but what distinguished the physicians ecstasy from satans was the trait of wonder in it
xi
the interior of a heart   after the incident last described the intercourse between the clergyman and the physician though externally the same was really of another character than it had previously been
the intellect of roger chillingworth had now a sufficiently plain path before it
it was not indeed precisely that which he had laid out for himself to tread
calm gentle passionless as he appeared there was yet we fear a quiet depth of malice hitherto latent but active now in this unfortunate old man which led him to imagine a more intimate revenge than any mortal had ever wreaked upon an enemy
to make himself the one trusted friend to whom should be confided all the fear the remorse the agony the ineffectual repentance the backward rush of sinful thoughts expelled in vain
all that guilty sorrow hidden from the world whose great heart would have pitied and forgiven to be revealed to him the pitilessto him the unforgiving
all that dark treasure to be lavished on the very man to whom nothing else could so adequately pay the debt of vengeance
the clergymans shy and sensitive reserve had balked this scheme
roger chillingworth however was inclined to be hardly if at all less satisfied with the aspect of affairs which providenceusing the avenger and his victim for its own purposes and perchance pardoning where it seemed most to punishhad substituted for his black devices
a revelation he could almost say had been granted to him
it mattered little for his object whether celestial or from what other region
by its aid in all the subsequent relations betwixt him and mr dimmesdale not merely the external presence but the very inmost soul of the latter seemed to be brought out before his eyes so that he could see and comprehend its every movement
he became thenceforth not a spectator only but a chief actor in the poor ministers interior world
he could play upon him as he chose
would he arouse him with a throb of agony
the victim was for ever on the rack it needed only to know the spring that controlled the engine and the physician knew it well
would he startle him with sudden fear
as at the waving of a magicians wand up rose a grisly phantomup rose a thousand phantomsin many shapes of death or more awful shame all flocking round about the clergyman and pointing with their fingers at his breast
all this was accomplished with a subtlety so perfect that the minister though he had constantly a dim perception of some evil influence watching over him could never gain a knowledge of its actual nature
true he looked doubtfully fearfullyeven at times with horror and the bitterness of hatredat the deformed figure of the old physician
his gestures his gait his grizzled beard his slightest and most indifferent acts the very fashion of his garments were odious in the clergymans sight a token implicitly to be relied on of a deeper antipathy in the breast of the latter than he was willing to acknowledge to himself
for as it was impossible to assign a reason for such distrust and abhorrence so mr dimmesdale conscious that the poison of one morbid spot was infecting his hearts entire substance attributed all his presentiments to no other cause
he took himself to task for his bad sympathies in reference to roger chillingworth disregarded the lesson that he should have drawn from them and did his best to root them out
unable to accomplish this he nevertheless as a matter of principle continued his habits of social familiarity with the old man and thus gave him constant opportunities for perfecting the purpose to whichpoor forlorn creature that he was and more wretched than his victimthe avenger had devoted himself
while thus suffering under bodily disease and gnawed and tortured by some black trouble of the soul and given over to the machinations of his deadliest enemy the reverend mr dimmesdale had achieved a brilliant popularity in his sacred office
he won it indeed in great part by his sorrows
his intellectual gifts his moral perceptions his power of experiencing and communicating emotion were kept in a state of preternatural activity by the prick and anguish of his daily life
his fame though still on its upward slope already overshadowed the soberer reputations of his fellowclergymen eminent as several of them were
there are scholars among them who had spent more years in acquiring abstruse lore connected with the divine profession than mr dimmesdale had lived and who might well therefore be more profoundly versed in such solid and valuable attainments than their youthful brother
there were men too of a sturdier texture of mind than his and endowed with a far greater share of shrewd hard iron or granite understanding which duly mingled with a fair proportion of doctrinal ingredient constitutes a highly respectable efficacious and unamiable variety of the clerical species
there were others again true saintly fathers whose faculties had been elaborated by weary toil among their books and by patient thought and etherealised moreover by spiritual communications with the better world into which their purity of life had almost introduced these holy personages with their garments of mortality still clinging to them
all that they lacked was the gift that descended upon the chosen disciples at pentecost in tongues of flame symbolising it would seem not the power of speech in foreign and unknown languages but that of addressing the whole human brotherhood in the hearts native language
these fathers otherwise so apostolic lacked heavens last and rarest attestation of their office the tongue of flame
they would have vainly soughthad they ever dreamed of seekingto express the highest truths through the humblest medium of familiar words and images
their voices came down afar and indistinctly from the upper heights where they habitually dwelt
not improbably it was to this latter class of men that mr dimmesdale by many of his traits of character naturally belonged
to the high mountain peaks of faith and sanctity he would have climbed had not the tendency been thwarted by the burden whatever it might be of crime or anguish beneath which it was his doom to totter
it kept him down on a level with the lowest him the man of ethereal attributes whose voice the angels might else have listened to and answered
but this very burden it was that gave him sympathies so intimate with the sinful brotherhood of mankind so that his heart vibrated in unison with theirs and received their pain into itself and sent its own throb of pain through a thousand other hearts in gushes of sad persuasive eloquence
oftenest persuasive but sometimes terrible
the people knew not the power that moved them thus
they deemed the young clergyman a miracle of holiness
they fancied him the mouthpiece of heavens messages of wisdom and rebuke and love
in their eyes the very ground on which he trod was sanctified
the virgins of his church grew pale around him victims of a passion so imbued with religious sentiment that they imagined it to be all religion and brought it openly in their white bosoms as their most acceptable sacrifice before the altar
the aged members of his flock beholding mr dimmesdales frame so feeble while they were themselves so rugged in their infirmity believed that he would go heavenward before them and enjoined it upon their children that their old bones should be buried close to their young pastors holy grave
and all this time perchance when poor mr dimmesdale was thinking of his grave he questioned with himself whether the grass would ever grow on it because an accursed thing must there be buried
it is inconceivable the agony with which this public veneration tortured him
it was his genuine impulse to adore the truth and to reckon all things shadowlike and utterly devoid of weight or value that had not its divine essence as the life within their life
then what was hea substanceor the dimmest of all shadows
he longed to speak out from his own pulpit at the full height of his voice and tell the people what he was
i whom you behold in these black garments of the priesthoodi who ascend the sacred desk and turn my pale face heavenward taking upon myself to hold communion in your behalf with the most high omnisciencei in whose daily life you discern the sanctity of enochi whose footsteps as you suppose leave a gleam along my earthly track whereby the pilgrims that shall come after me may be guided to the regions of the blesti who have laid the hand of baptism upon your childreni who have breathed the parting prayer over your dying friends to whom the amen sounded faintly from a world which they had quittedi your pastor whom you so reverence and trust am utterly a pollution and a lie  more than once mr dimmesdale had gone into the pulpit with a purpose never to come down its steps until he should have spoken words like the above
more than once he had cleared his throat and drawn in the long deep and tremulous breath which when sent forth again would come burdened with the black secret of his soul
more than oncenay more than a hundred timeshe had actually spoken
spoken
but how
he had told his hearers that he was altogether vile a viler companion of the vilest the worst of sinners an abomination a thing of unimaginable iniquity and that the only wonder was that they did not see his wretched body shrivelled up before their eyes by the burning wrath of the almighty
could there be plainer speech than this
would not the people start up in their seats by a simultaneous impulse and tear him down out of the pulpit which he defiled
not so indeed
they heard it all and did but reverence him the more
they little guessed what deadly purport lurked in those selfcondemning words
the godly youth said they among themselves
the saint on earth
alas
if he discern such sinfulness in his own white soul what horrid spectacle would he behold in thine or mine the minister well knewsubtle but remorseful hypocrite that he wasthe light in which his vague confession would be viewed
he had striven to put a cheat upon himself by making the avowal of a guilty conscience but had gained only one other sin and a selfacknowledged shame without the momentary relief of being selfdeceived
he had spoken the very truth and transformed it into the veriest falsehood
and yet by the constitution of his nature he loved the truth and loathed the lie as few men ever did
therefore above all things else he loathed his miserable self
his inward trouble drove him to practices more in accordance with the old corrupted faith of rome than with the better light of the church in which he had been born and bred
in mr dimmesdales secret closet under lock and key there was a bloody scourge
oftentimes this protestant and puritan divine had plied it on his own shoulders laughing bitterly at himself the while and smiting so much the more pitilessly because of that bitter laugh
it was his custom too as it has been that of many other pious puritans to fastnot however like them in order to purify the body and render it the fitter medium of celestial illuminationbut rigorously and until his knees trembled beneath him as an act of penance
he kept vigils likewise night after night sometimes in utter darkness sometimes with a glimmering lamp and sometimes viewing his own face in a lookingglass by the most powerful light which he could throw upon it
he thus typified the constant introspection wherewith he tortured but could not purify himself
in these lengthened vigils his brain often reeled and visions seemed to flit before him perhaps seen doubtfully and by a faint light of their own in the remote dimness of the chamber or more vividly and close beside him within the lookingglass
now it was a herd of diabolic shapes that grinned and mocked at the pale minister and beckoned him away with them now a group of shining angels who flew upward heavily as sorrowladen but grew more ethereal as they rose
now came the dead friends of his youth and his whitebearded father with a saintlike frown and his mother turning her face away as she passed by
ghost of a motherthinnest fantasy of a mothermethinks she might yet have thrown a pitying glance towards her son
and now through the chamber which these spectral thoughts had made so ghastly glided hester prynne leading along little pearl in her scarlet garb and pointing her forefinger first at the scarlet letter on her bosom and then at the clergymans own breast
none of these visions ever quite deluded him
at any moment by an effort of his will he could discern substances through their misty lack of substance and convince himself that they were not solid in their nature like yonder table of carved oak or that big square leatherbound and brazenclasped volume of divinity
but for all that they were in one sense the truest and most substantial things which the poor minister now dealt with
it is the unspeakable misery of a life so false as his that it steals the pith and substance out of whatever realities there are around us and which were meant by heaven to be the spirits joy and nutriment
to the untrue man the whole universe is falseit is impalpableit shrinks to nothing within his grasp
and he himself in so far as he shows himself in a false light becomes a shadow or indeed ceases to exist
the only truth that continued to give mr dimmesdale a real existence on this earth was the anguish in his inmost soul and the undissembled expression of it in his aspect
had he once found power to smile and wear a face of gaiety there would have been no such man
on one of those ugly nights which we have faintly hinted at but forborne to picture forth the minister started from his chair
a new thought had struck him
there might be a moments peace in it
attiring himself with as much care as if it had been for public worship and precisely in the same manner he stole softly down the staircase undid the door and issued forth
xii
the ministers vigil   walking in the shadow of a dream as it were and perhaps actually under the influence of a species of somnambulism mr dimmesdale reached the spot where now so long since hester prynne had lived through her first hours of public ignominy
the same platform or scaffold black and weatherstained with the storm or sunshine of seven long years and footworn too with the tread of many culprits who had since ascended it remained standing beneath the balcony of the meetinghouse
the minister went up the steps
it was an obscure night in early may
an unvaried pall of cloud muffled the whole expanse of sky from zenith to horizon
if the same multitude which had stood as eyewitnesses while hester prynne sustained her punishment could now have been summoned forth they would have discerned no face above the platform nor hardly the outline of a human shape in the dark grey of the midnight
but the town was all asleep
there was no peril of discovery
the minister might stand there if it so pleased him until morning should redden in the east without other risk than that the dank and chill night air would creep into his frame and stiffen his joints with rheumatism and clog his throat with catarrh and cough thereby defrauding the expectant audience of tomorrows prayer and sermon
no eye could see him save that everwakeful one which had seen him in his closet wielding the bloody scourge
why then had he come hither
was it but the mockery of penitence
a mockery indeed but in which his soul trifled with itself
a mockery at which angels blushed and wept while fiends rejoiced with jeering laughter
he had been driven hither by the impulse of that remorse which dogged him everywhere and whose own sister and closely linked companion was that cowardice which invariably drew him back with her tremulous gripe just when the other impulse had hurried him to the verge of a disclosure
poor miserable man
what right had infirmity like his to burden itself with crime
crime is for the ironnerved who have their choice either to endure it or if it press too hard to exert their fierce and savage strength for a good purpose and fling it off at once
this feeble and most sensitive of spirits could do neither yet continually did one thing or another which intertwined in the same inextricable knot the agony of heavendefying guilt and vain repentance
and thus while standing on the scaffold in this vain show of expiation mr dimmesdale was overcome with a great horror of mind as if the universe were gazing at a scarlet token on his naked breast right over his heart
on that spot in very truth there was and there had long been the gnawing and poisonous tooth of bodily pain
without any effort of his will or power to restrain himself he shrieked aloud an outcry that went pealing through the night and was beaten back from one house to another and reverberated from the hills in the background as if a company of devils detecting so much misery and terror in it had made a plaything of the sound and were bandying it to and fro
it is done muttered the minister covering his face with his hands
the whole town will awake and hurry forth and find me here  but it was not so
the shriek had perhaps sounded with a far greater power to his own startled ears than it actually possessed
the town did not awake or if it did the drowsy slumberers mistook the cry either for something frightful in a dream or for the noise of witches whose voices at that period were often heard to pass over the settlements or lonely cottages as they rode with satan through the air
the clergyman therefore hearing no symptoms of disturbance uncovered his eyes and looked about him
at one of the chamberwindows of governor bellinghams mansion which stood at some distance on the line of another street he beheld the appearance of the old magistrate himself with a lamp in his hand a white nightcap on his head and a long white gown enveloping his figure
he looked like a ghost evoked unseasonably from the grave
the cry had evidently startled him
at another window of the same house moreover appeared old mistress hibbins the governors sister also with a lamp which even thus far off revealed the expression of her sour and discontented face
she thrust forth her head from the lattice and looked anxiously upward
beyond the shadow of a doubt this venerable witchlady had heard mr dimmesdales outcry and interpreted it with its multitudinous echoes and reverberations as the clamour of the fiends and nighthags with whom she was well known to make excursions in the forest
detecting the gleam of governor bellinghams lamp the old lady quickly extinguished her own and vanished
possibly she went up among the clouds
the minister saw nothing further of her motions
the magistrate after a wary observation of the darknessinto which nevertheless he could see but little further than he might into a millstoneretired from the window
the minister grew comparatively calm
his eyes however were soon greeted by a little glimmering light which at first a long way off was approaching up the street
it threw a gleam of recognition on here a post and there a garden fence and here a latticed windowpane and there a pump with its full trough of water and here again an arched door of oak with an iron knocker and a rough log for the doorstep
the reverend mr dimmesdale noted all these minute particulars even while firmly convinced that the doom of his existence was stealing onward in the footsteps which he now heard and that the gleam of the lantern would fall upon him in a few moments more and reveal his longhidden secret
as the light drew nearer he beheld within its illuminated circle his brother clergymanor to speak more accurately his professional father as well as highly valued friendthe reverend mr wilson who as mr dimmesdale now conjectured had been praying at the bedside of some dying man
and so he had
the good old minister came freshly from the deathchamber of governor winthrop who had passed from earth to heaven within that very hour
and now surrounded like the saintlike personage of olden times with a radiant halo that glorified him amid this gloomy night of sinas if the departed governor had left him an inheritance of his glory or as if he had caught upon himself the distant shine of the celestial city while looking thitherward to see the triumphant pilgrim pass within its gatesnow in short good father wilson was moving homeward aiding his footsteps with a lighted lantern
the glimmer of this luminary suggested the above conceits to mr dimmesdale who smilednay almost laughed at themand then wondered if he was going mad
as the reverend mr wilson passed beside the scaffold closely muffling his geneva cloak about him with one arm and holding the lantern before his breast with the other the minister could hardly restrain himself from speaking  a good evening to you venerable father wilson
come up hither i pray you and pass a pleasant hour with me  good heavens
had mr dimmesdale actually spoken
for one instant he believed that these words had passed his lips
but they were uttered only within his imagination
the venerable father wilson continued to step slowly onward looking carefully at the muddy pathway before his feet and never once turning his head towards the guilty platform
when the light of the glimmering lantern had faded quite away the minister discovered by the faintness which came over him that the last few moments had been a crisis of terrible anxiety although his mind had made an involuntary effort to relieve itself by a kind of lurid playfulness
shortly afterwards the like grisly sense of the humorous again stole in among the solemn phantoms of his thought
he felt his limbs growing stiff with the unaccustomed chilliness of the night and doubted whether he should be able to descend the steps of the scaffold
morning would break and find him there
the neighbourhood would begin to rouse itself
the earliest riser coming forth in the dim twilight would perceive a vaguelydefined figure aloft on the place of shame and halfcrazed betwixt alarm and curiosity would go knocking from door to door summoning all the people to behold the ghostas he needs must think itof some defunct transgressor
a dusky tumult would flap its wings from one house to another
thenthe morning light still waxing strongerold patriarchs would rise up in great haste each in his flannel gown and matronly dames without pausing to put off their nightgear
the whole tribe of decorous personages who had never heretofore been seen with a single hair of their heads awry would start into public view with the disorder of a nightmare in their aspects
old governor bellingham would come grimly forth with his king james ruff fastened askew and mistress hibbins with some twigs of the forest clinging to her skirts and looking sourer than ever as having hardly got a wink of sleep after her night ride and good father wilson too after spending half the night at a deathbed and liking ill to be disturbed thus early out of his dreams about the glorified saints
hither likewise would come the elders and deacons of mr dimmesdales church and the young virgins who so idolized their minister and had made a shrine for him in their white bosoms which now by the by in their hurry and confusion they would scantly have given themselves time to cover with their kerchiefs
all people in a word would come stumbling over their thresholds and turning up their amazed and horrorstricken visages around the scaffold
whom would they discern there with the red eastern light upon his brow
whom but the reverend arthur dimmesdale halffrozen to death overwhelmed with shame and standing where hester prynne had stood
carried away by the grotesque horror of this picture the minister unawares and to his own infinite alarm burst into a great peal of laughter
it was immediately responded to by a light airy childish laugh in which with a thrill of the heartbut he knew not whether of exquisite pain or pleasure as acutehe recognised the tones of little pearl
pearl
little pearl cried he after a moments pause then suppressing his voicehester
hester prynne
are you there  yes it is hester prynne she replied in a tone of surprise and the minister heard her footsteps approaching from the sidewalk along which she had been passing
it is i and my little pearl  whence come you hester asked the minister
what sent you hither  i have been watching at a deathbed answered hester prynne at governor winthrops deathbed and have taken his measure for a robe and am now going homeward to my dwelling  come up hither hester thou and little pearl said the reverend mr dimmesdale
ye have both been here before but i was not with you
come up hither once again and we will stand all three together  she silently ascended the steps and stood on the platform holding little pearl by the hand
the minister felt for the childs other hand and took it
the moment that he did so there came what seemed a tumultuous rush of new life other life than his own pouring like a torrent into his heart and hurrying through all his veins as if the mother and the child were communicating their vital warmth to his halftorpid system
the three formed an electric chain
minister whispered little pearl
what wouldst thou say child asked mr dimmesdale
wilt thou stand here with mother and me tomorrow noontide inquired pearl
nay not so my little pearl answered the minister for with the new energy of the moment all the dread of public exposure that had so long been the anguish of his life had returned upon him and he was already trembling at the conjunction in whichwith a strange joy neverthelesshe now found himselfnot so my child
i shall indeed stand with thy mother and thee one other day but not tomorrow  pearl laughed and attempted to pull away her hand
but the minister held it fast
a moment longer my child said he
but wilt thou promise asked pearl to take my hand and mothers hand tomorrow noontide  not then pearl said the minister but another time  and what other time persisted the child
at the great judgment day whispered the minister and strangely enough the sense that he was a professional teacher of the truth impelled him to answer the child so
then and there before the judgmentseat thy mother and thou and i must stand together
but the daylight of this world shall not see our meeting  pearl laughed again
but before mr dimmesdale had done speaking a light gleamed far and wide over all the muffled sky
it was doubtless caused by one of those meteors which the nightwatcher may so often observe burning out to waste in the vacant regions of the atmosphere
so powerful was its radiance that it thoroughly illuminated the dense medium of cloud betwixt the sky and earth
the great vault brightened like the dome of an immense lamp
it showed the familiar scene of the street with the distinctness of midday but also with the awfulness that is always imparted to familiar objects by an unaccustomed light
the wooden houses with their jutting storeys and quaint gablepeaks the doorsteps and thresholds with the early grass springing up about them the gardenplots black with freshlyturned earth the wheeltrack little worn and even in the marketplace margined with green on either sideall were visible but with a singularity of aspect that seemed to give another moral interpretation to the things of this world than they had ever borne before
and there stood the minister with his hand over his heart and hester prynne with the embroidered letter glimmering on her bosom and little pearl herself a symbol and the connecting link between those two
they stood in the noon of that strange and solemn splendour as if it were the light that is to reveal all secrets and the daybreak that shall unite all who belong to one another
there was witchcraft in little pearls eyes and her face as she glanced upward at the minister wore that naughty smile which made its expression frequently so elvish
she withdrew her hand from mr dimmesdales and pointed across the street
but he clasped both his hands over his breast and cast his eyes towards the zenith
nothing was more common in those days than to interpret all meteoric appearances and other natural phenomena that occurred with less regularity than the rise and set of sun and moon as so many revelations from a supernatural source
thus a blazing spear a sword of flame a bow or a sheaf of arrows seen in the midnight sky prefigured indian warfare
pestilence was known to have been foreboded by a shower of crimson light
we doubt whether any marked event for good or evil ever befell new england from its settlement down to revolutionary times of which the inhabitants had not been previously warned by some spectacle of its nature
not seldom it had been seen by multitudes
oftener however its credibility rested on the faith of some lonely eyewitness who beheld the wonder through the coloured magnifying and distorted medium of his imagination and shaped it more distinctly in his afterthought
it was indeed a majestic idea that the destiny of nations should be revealed in these awful hieroglyphics on the cope of heaven
a scroll so wide might not be deemed too expensive for providence to write a peoples doom upon
the belief was a favourite one with our forefathers as betokening that their infant commonwealth was under a celestial guardianship of peculiar intimacy and strictness
but what shall we say when an individual discovers a revelation addressed to himself alone on the same vast sheet of record
in such a case it could only be the symptom of a highly disordered mental state when a man rendered morbidly selfcontemplative by long intense and secret pain had extended his egotism over the whole expanse of nature until the firmament itself should appear no more than a fitting page for his souls history and fate
we impute it therefore solely to the disease in his own eye and heart that the minister looking upward to the zenith beheld there the appearance of an immense letterthe letter amarked out in lines of dull red light
not but the meteor may have shown itself at that point burning duskily through a veil of cloud but with no such shape as his guilty imagination gave it or at least with so little definiteness that anothers guilt might have seen another symbol in it
there was a singular circumstance that characterised mr dimmesdales psychological state at this moment
all the time that he gazed upward to the zenith he was nevertheless perfectly aware that little pearl was pointing her finger towards old roger chillingworth who stood at no great distance from the scaffold
the minister appeared to see him with the same glance that discerned the miraculous letter
to his feature as to all other objects the meteoric light imparted a new expression or it might well be that the physician was not careful then as at all other times to hide the malevolence with which he looked upon his victim
certainly if the meteor kindled up the sky and disclosed the earth with an awfulness that admonished hester prynne and the clergyman of the day of judgment then might roger chillingworth have passed with them for the archfiend standing there with a smile and scowl to claim his own
so vivid was the expression or so intense the ministers perception of it that it seemed still to remain painted on the darkness after the meteor had vanished with an effect as if the street and all things else were at once annihilated
who is that man hester gasped mr dimmesdale overcome with terror
i shiver at him
dost thou know the man
i hate him hester  she remembered her oath and was silent
i tell thee my soul shivers at him muttered the minister again
who is he
who is he
canst thou do nothing for me
i have a nameless horror of the man  minister said little pearl i can tell thee who he is  quickly then child said the minister bending his ear close to her lips
quickly and as low as thou canst whisper  pearl mumbled something into his ear that sounded indeed like human language but was only such gibberish as children may be heard amusing themselves with by the hour together
at all events if it involved any secret information in regard to old roger chillingworth it was in a tongue unknown to the erudite clergyman and did but increase the bewilderment of his mind
the elvish child then laughed aloud
dost thou mock me now said the minister
thou wast not boldthou wast not true answered the child
thou wouldst not promise to take my hand and mothers hand tomorrow noontide  worthy sir answered the physician who had now advanced to the foot of the platformpious master dimmesdale
can this be you
well well indeed
we men of study whose heads are in our books have need to be straitly looked after
we dream in our waking moments and walk in our sleep
come good sir and my dear friend i pray you let me lead you home  how knewest thou that i was here asked the minister fearfully
verily and in good faith answered roger chillingworth i knew nothing of the matter
i had spent the better part of the night at the bedside of the worshipful governor winthrop doing what my poor skill might to give him ease
he going home to a better world i likewise was on my way homeward when this light shone out
come with me i beseech you reverend sir else you will be poorly able to do sabbath duty tomorrow
aha
see now how they trouble the brainthese booksthese books
you should study less good sir and take a little pastime or these night whimsies will grow upon you  i will go home with you said mr dimmesdale
with a chill despondency like one awakening all nerveless from an ugly dream he yielded himself to the physician and was led away
the next day however being the sabbath he preached a discourse which was held to be the richest and most powerful and the most replete with heavenly influences that had ever proceeded from his lips
souls it is said more souls than one were brought to the truth by the efficacy of that sermon and vowed within themselves to cherish a holy gratitude towards mr dimmesdale throughout the long hereafter
but as he came down the pulpit steps the greybearded sexton met him holding up a black glove which the minister recognised as his own
it was found said the sexton this morning on the scaffold where evildoers are set up to public shame
satan dropped it there i take it intending a scurrilous jest against your reverence
but indeed he was blind and foolish as he ever and always is
a pure hand needs no glove to cover it  thank you my good friend said the minister gravely but startled at heart for so confused was his remembrance that he had almost brought himself to look at the events of the past night as visionary
yes it seems to be my glove indeed  and since satan saw fit to steal it your reverence must needs handle him without gloves henceforward remarked the old sexton grimly smiling
but did your reverence hear of the portent that was seen last night
a great red letter in the skythe letter a which we interpret to stand for angel
for as our good governor winthrop was made an angel this past night it was doubtless held fit that there should be some notice thereof  no answered the minister i had not heard of it     xiii
another view of hester   in her late singular interview with mr dimmesdale hester prynne was shocked at the condition to which she found the clergyman reduced
his nerve seemed absolutely destroyed
his moral force was abased into more than childish weakness
it grovelled helpless on the ground even while his intellectual faculties retained their pristine strength or had perhaps acquired a morbid energy which disease only could have given them
with her knowledge of a train of circumstances hidden from all others she could readily infer that besides the legitimate action of his own conscience a terrible machinery had been brought to bear and was still operating on mr dimmesdales wellbeing and repose
knowing what this poor fallen man had once been her whole soul was moved by the shuddering terror with which he had appealed to herthe outcast womanfor support against his instinctively discovered enemy
she decided moreover that he had a right to her utmost aid
little accustomed in her long seclusion from society to measure her ideas of right and wrong by any standard external to herself hester sawor seemed to seethat there lay a responsibility upon her in reference to the clergyman which she owned to no other nor to the whole world besides
the links that united her to the rest of humankindlinks of flowers or silk or gold or whatever the materialhad all been broken
here was the iron link of mutual crime which neither he nor she could break
like all other ties it brought along with it its obligations
hester prynne did not now occupy precisely the same position in which we beheld her during the earlier periods of her ignominy
years had come and gone
pearl was now seven years old
her mother with the scarlet letter on her breast glittering in its fantastic embroidery had long been a familiar object to the townspeople
as is apt to be the case when a person stands out in any prominence before the community and at the same time interferes neither with public nor individual interests and convenience a species of general regard had ultimately grown up in reference to hester prynne
it is to the credit of human nature that except where its selfishness is brought into play it loves more readily than it hates
hatred by a gradual and quiet process will even be transformed to love unless the change be impeded by a continually new irritation of the original feeling of hostility
in this matter of hester prynne there was neither irritation nor irksomeness
she never battled with the public but submitted uncomplainingly to its worst usage she made no claim upon it in requital for what she suffered she did not weigh upon its sympathies
then also the blameless purity of her life during all these years in which she had been set apart to infamy was reckoned largely in her favour
with nothing now to lose in the sight of mankind and with no hope and seemingly no wish of gaining anything it could only be a genuine regard for virtue that had brought back the poor wanderer to its paths
it was perceived too that while hester never put forward even the humblest title to share in the worlds privilegesfurther than to breathe the common air and earn daily bread for little pearl and herself by the faithful labour of her handsshe was quick to acknowledge her sisterhood with the race of man whenever benefits were to be conferred
none so ready as she to give of her little substance to every demand of poverty even though the bitterhearted pauper threw back a gibe in requital of the food brought regularly to his door or the garments wrought for him by the fingers that could have embroidered a monarchs robe
none so selfdevoted as hester when pestilence stalked through the town
in all seasons of calamity indeed whether general or of individuals the outcast of society at once found her place
she came not as a guest but as a rightful inmate into the household that was darkened by trouble as if its gloomy twilight were a medium in which she was entitled to hold intercourse with her fellowcreature
there glimmered the embroidered letter with comfort in its unearthly ray
elsewhere the token of sin it was the taper of the sick chamber
it had even thrown its gleam in the sufferers hard extremity across the verge of time
it had shown him where to set his foot while the light of earth was fast becoming dim and ere the light of futurity could reach him
in such emergencies hesters nature showed itself warm and richa wellspring of human tenderness unfailing to every real demand and inexhaustible by the largest
her breast with its badge of shame was but the softer pillow for the head that needed one
she was selfordained a sister of mercy or we may rather say the worlds heavy hand had so ordained her when neither the world nor she looked forward to this result
the letter was the symbol of her calling
such helpfulness was found in herso much power to do and power to sympathisethat many people refused to interpret the scarlet a by its original signification
they said that it meant able so strong was hester prynne with a womans strength
it was only the darkened house that could contain her
when sunshine came again she was not there
her shadow had faded across the threshold
the helpful inmate had departed without one backward glance to gather up the meed of gratitude if any were in the hearts of those whom she had served so zealously
meeting them in the street she never raised her head to receive their greeting
if they were resolute to accost her she laid her finger on the scarlet letter and passed on
this might be pride but was so like humility that it produced all the softening influence of the latter quality on the public mind
the public is despotic in its temper it is capable of denying common justice when too strenuously demanded as a right but quite as frequently it awards more than justice when the appeal is made as despots love to have it made entirely to its generosity
interpreting hester prynnes deportment as an appeal of this nature society was inclined to show its former victim a more benign countenance than she cared to be favoured with or perchance than she deserved
the rulers and the wise and learned men of the community were longer in acknowledging the influence of hesters good qualities than the people
the prejudices which they shared in common with the latter were fortified in themselves by an iron framework of reasoning that made it a far tougher labour to expel them
day by day nevertheless their sour and rigid wrinkles were relaxing into something which in the due course of years might grow to be an expression of almost benevolence
thus it was with the men of rank on whom their eminent position imposed the guardianship of the public morals
individuals in private life meanwhile had quite forgiven hester prynne for her frailty nay more they had begun to look upon the scarlet letter as the token not of that one sin for which she had borne so long and dreary a penance but of her many good deeds since
do you see that woman with the embroidered badge they would say to strangers
it is our hesterthe towns own hesterwho is so kind to the poor so helpful to the sick so comfortable to the afflicted then it is true the propensity of human nature to tell the very worst of itself when embodied in the person of another would constrain them to whisper the black scandal of bygone years
it was none the less a fact however that in the eyes of the very men who spoke thus the scarlet letter had the effect of the cross on a nuns bosom
it imparted to the wearer a kind of sacredness which enabled her to walk securely amid all peril
had she fallen among thieves it would have kept her safe
it was reported and believed by many that an indian had drawn his arrow against the badge and that the missile struck it and fell harmless to the ground
the effect of the symbolor rather of the position in respect to society that was indicated by iton the mind of hester prynne herself was powerful and peculiar
all the light and graceful foliage of her character had been withered up by this redhot brand and had long ago fallen away leaving a bare and harsh outline which might have been repulsive had she possessed friends or companions to be repelled by it
even the attractiveness of her person had undergone a similar change
it might be partly owing to the studied austerity of her dress and partly to the lack of demonstration in her manners
it was a sad transformation too that her rich and luxuriant hair had either been cut off or was so completely hidden by a cap that not a shining lock of it ever once gushed into the sunshine
it was due in part to all these causes but still more to something else that there seemed to be no longer anything in hesters face for love to dwell upon nothing in hesters form though majestic and statuelike that passion would ever dream of clasping in its embrace nothing in hesters bosom to make it ever again the pillow of affection
some attribute had departed from her the permanence of which had been essential to keep her a woman
such is frequently the fate and such the stern development of the feminine character and person when the woman has encountered and lived through an experience of peculiar severity
if she be all tenderness she will die
if she survive the tenderness will either be crushed out of her orand the outward semblance is the samecrushed so deeply into her heart that it can never show itself more
the latter is perhaps the truest theory
she who has once been a woman and ceased to be so might at any moment become a woman again if there were only the magic touch to effect the transformation
we shall see whether hester prynne were ever afterwards so touched and so transfigured
much of the marble coldness of hesters impression was to be attributed to the circumstance that her life had turned in a great measure from passion and feeling to thought
standing alone in the worldalone as to any dependence on society and with little pearl to be guided and protectedalone and hopeless of retrieving her position even had she not scorned to consider it desirableshe cast away the fragment of a broken chain
the worlds law was no law for her mind
it was an age in which the human intellect newly emancipated had taken a more active and a wider range than for many centuries before
men of the sword had overthrown nobles and kings
men bolder than these had overthrown and rearrangednot actually but within the sphere of theory which was their most real abodethe whole system of ancient prejudice wherewith was linked much of ancient principle
hester prynne imbibed this spirit
she assumed a freedom of speculation then common enough on the other side of the atlantic but which our forefathers had they known it would have held to be a deadlier crime than that stigmatised by the scarlet letter
in her lonesome cottage by the seashore thoughts visited her such as dared to enter no other dwelling in new england shadowy guests that would have been as perilous as demons to their entertainer could they have been seen so much as knocking at her door
it is remarkable that persons who speculate the most boldly often conform with the most perfect quietude to the external regulations of society
the thought suffices them without investing itself in the flesh and blood of action
so it seemed to be with hester
yet had little pearl never come to her from the spiritual world it might have been far otherwise
then she might have come down to us in history hand in hand with ann hutchinson as the foundress of a religious sect
she might in one of her phases have been a prophetess
she might and not improbably would have suffered death from the stern tribunals of the period for attempting to undermine the foundations of the puritan establishment
but in the education of her child the mothers enthusiasm of thought had something to wreak itself upon
providence in the person of this little girl had assigned to hesters charge the germ and blossom of womanhood to be cherished and developed amid a host of difficulties
everything was against her
the world was hostile
the childs own nature had something wrong in it which continually betokened that she had been born amissthe effluence of her mothers lawless passionand often impelled hester to ask in bitterness of heart whether it were for ill or good that the poor little creature had been born at all
indeed the same dark question often rose into her mind with reference to the whole race of womanhood
was existence worth accepting even to the happiest among them
as concerned her own individual existence she had long ago decided in the negative and dismissed the point as settled
a tendency to speculation though it may keep women quiet as it does man yet makes her sad
she discerns it may be such a hopeless task before her
as a first step the whole system of society is to be torn down and built up anew
then the very nature of the opposite sex or its long hereditary habit which has become like nature is to be essentially modified before woman can be allowed to assume what seems a fair and suitable position
finally all other difficulties being obviated woman cannot take advantage of these preliminary reforms until she herself shall have undergone a still mightier change in which perhaps the ethereal essence wherein she has her truest life will be found to have evaporated
a woman never overcomes these problems by any exercise of thought
they are not to be solved or only in one way
if her heart chance to come uppermost they vanish
thus hester prynne whose heart had lost its regular and healthy throb wandered without a clue in the dark labyrinth of mind now turned aside by an insurmountable precipice now starting back from a deep chasm
there was wild and ghastly scenery all around her and a home and comfort nowhere
at times a fearful doubt strove to possess her soul whether it were not better to send pearl at once to heaven and go herself to such futurity as eternal justice should provide
the scarlet letter had not done its office
now however her interview with the reverend mr dimmesdale on the night of his vigil had given her a new theme of reflection and held up to her an object that appeared worthy of any exertion and sacrifice for its attainment
she had witnessed the intense misery beneath which the minister struggled or to speak more accurately had ceased to struggle
she saw that he stood on the verge of lunacy if he had not already stepped across it
it was impossible to doubt that whatever painful efficacy there might be in the secret sting of remorse a deadlier venom had been infused into it by the hand that proffered relief
a secret enemy had been continually by his side under the semblance of a friend and helper and had availed himself of the opportunities thus afforded for tampering with the delicate springs of mr dimmesdales nature
hester could not but ask herself whether there had not originally been a defect of truth courage and loyalty on her own part in allowing the minister to be thrown into a position where so much evil was to be foreboded and nothing auspicious to be hoped
her only justification lay in the fact that she had been able to discern no method of rescuing him from a blacker ruin than had overwhelmed herself except by acquiescing in roger chillingworths scheme of disguise
under that impulse she had made her choice and had chosen as it now appeared the more wretched alternative of the two
she determined to redeem her error so far as it might yet be possible
strengthened by years of hard and solemn trial she felt herself no longer so inadequate to cope with roger chillingworth as on that night abased by sin and halfmaddened by the ignominy that was still new when they had talked together in the prisonchamber
she had climbed her way since then to a higher point
the old man on the other hand had brought himself nearer to her level or perhaps below it by the revenge which he had stooped for
in fine hester prynne resolved to meet her former husband and do what might be in her power for the rescue of the victim on whom he had so evidently set his gripe
the occasion was not long to seek
one afternoon walking with pearl in a retired part of the peninsula she beheld the old physician with a basket on one arm and a staff in the other hand stooping along the ground in quest of roots and herbs to concoct his medicine withal
xiv
hester and the physician   hester bade little pearl run down to the margin of the water and play with the shells and tangled seaweed until she should have talked awhile with yonder gatherer of herbs
so the child flew away like a bird and making bare her small white feet went pattering along the moist margin of the sea
here and there she came to a full stop and peeped curiously into a pool left by the retiring tide as a mirror for pearl to see her face in
forth peeped at her out of the pool with dark glistening curls around her head and an elfsmile in her eyes the image of a little maid whom pearl having no other playmate invited to take her hand and run a race with her
but the visionary little maid on her part beckoned likewise as if to saythis is a better place come thou into the pool and pearl stepping in midleg deep beheld her own white feet at the bottom while out of a still lower depth came the gleam of a kind of fragmentary smile floating to and fro in the agitated water
meanwhile her mother had accosted the physician
i would speak a word with you said shea word that concerns us much  aha
and is it mistress hester that has a word for old roger chillingworth answered he raising himself from his stooping posture
with all my heart
why mistress i hear good tidings of you on all hands
no longer ago than yestereve a magistrate a wise and godly man was discoursing of your affairs mistress hester and whispered me that there had been question concerning you in the council
it was debated whether or no with safety to the commonweal yonder scarlet letter might be taken off your bosom
on my life hester i made my intreaty to the worshipful magistrate that it might be done forthwith  it lies not in the pleasure of the magistrates to take off the badge calmly replied hester
were i worthy to be quit of it it would fall away of its own nature or be transformed into something that should speak a different purport  nay then wear it if it suit you better rejoined he a woman must needs follow her own fancy touching the adornment of her person
the letter is gaily embroidered and shows right bravely on your bosom  all this while hester had been looking steadily at the old man and was shocked as well as wondersmitten to discern what a change had been wrought upon him within the past seven years
it was not so much that he had grown older for though the traces of advancing life were visible he bore his age well and seemed to retain a wiry vigour and alertness
but the former aspect of an intellectual and studious man calm and quiet which was what she best remembered in him had altogether vanished and been succeeded by an eager searching almost fierce yet carefully guarded look
it seemed to be his wish and purpose to mask this expression with a smile but the latter played him false and flickered over his visage so derisively that the spectator could see his blackness all the better for it
ever and anon too there came a glare of red light out of his eyes as if the old mans soul were on fire and kept on smouldering duskily within his breast until by some casual puff of passion it was blown into a momentary flame
this he repressed as speedily as possible and strove to look as if nothing of the kind had happened
in a word old roger chillingworth was a striking evidence of mans faculty of transforming himself into a devil if he will only for a reasonable space of time undertake a devils office
this unhappy person had effected such a transformation by devoting himself for seven years to the constant analysis of a heart full of torture and deriving his enjoyment thence and adding fuel to those fiery tortures which he analysed and gloated over
the scarlet letter burned on hester prynnes bosom
here was another ruin the responsibility of which came partly home to her
what see you in my face asked the physician that you look at it so earnestly  something that would make me weep if there were any tears bitter enough for it answered she
but let it pass
it is of yonder miserable man that i would speak  and what of him cried roger chillingworth eagerly as if he loved the topic and were glad of an opportunity to discuss it with the only person of whom he could make a confidant
not to hide the truth mistress hester my thoughts happen just now to be busy with the gentleman
so speak freely and i will make answer  when we last spake together said hester now seven years ago it was your pleasure to extort a promise of secrecy as touching the former relation betwixt yourself and me
as the life and good fame of yonder man were in your hands there seemed no choice to me save to be silent in accordance with your behest
yet it was not without heavy misgivings that i thus bound myself for having cast off all duty towards other human beings there remained a duty towards him and something whispered me that i was betraying it in pledging myself to keep your counsel
since that day no man is so near to him as you
you tread behind his every footstep
you are beside him sleeping and waking
you search his thoughts
you burrow and rankle in his heart
your clutch is on his life and you cause him to die daily a living death and still he knows you not
in permitting this i have surely acted a false part by the only man to whom the power was left me to be true  what choice had you asked roger chillingworth
my finger pointed at this man would have hurled him from his pulpit into a dungeon thence peradventure to the gallows  it had been better so said hester prynne
what evil have i done the man asked roger chillingworth again
i tell thee hester prynne the richest fee that ever physician earned from monarch could not have bought such care as i have wasted on this miserable priest
but for my aid his life would have burned away in torments within the first two years after the perpetration of his crime and thine
for hester his spirit lacked the strength that could have borne up as thine has beneath a burden like thy scarlet letter
oh i could reveal a goodly secret
but enough
what art can do i have exhausted on him
that he now breathes and creeps about on earth is owing all to me  better he had died at once said hester prynne
yea woman thou sayest truly cried old roger chillingworth letting the lurid fire of his heart blaze out before her eyes
better had he died at once
never did mortal suffer what this man has suffered
and all all in the sight of his worst enemy
he has been conscious of me
he has felt an influence dwelling always upon him like a curse
he knew by some spiritual sensefor the creator never made another being so sensitive as thishe knew that no friendly hand was pulling at his heartstrings and that an eye was looking curiously into him which sought only evil and found it
but he knew not that the eye and hand were mine
with the superstition common to his brotherhood he fancied himself given over to a fiend to be tortured with frightful dreams and desperate thoughts the sting of remorse and despair of pardon as a foretaste of what awaits him beyond the grave
but it was the constant shadow of my presence the closest propinquity of the man whom he had most vilely wronged and who had grown to exist only by this perpetual poison of the direst revenge
yea indeed he did not err there was a fiend at his elbow
a mortal man with once a human heart has become a fiend for his especial torment  the unfortunate physician while uttering these words lifted his hands with a look of horror as if he had beheld some frightful shape which he could not recognise usurping the place of his own image in a glass
it was one of those momentswhich sometimes occur only at the interval of yearswhen a mans moral aspect is faithfully revealed to his minds eye
not improbably he had never before viewed himself as he did now
hast thou not tortured him enough said hester noticing the old mans look
has he not paid thee all  no no
he has but increased the debt answered the physician and as he proceeded his manner lost its fiercer characteristics and subsided into gloom
dost thou remember me hester as i was nine years agone
even then i was in the autumn of my days nor was it the early autumn
but all my life had been made up of earnest studious thoughtful quiet years bestowed faithfully for the increase of mine own knowledge and faithfully too though this latter object was but casual to the otherfaithfully for the advancement of human welfare
no life had been more peaceful and innocent than mine few lives so rich with benefits conferred
dost thou remember me
was i not though you might deem me cold nevertheless a man thoughtful for others craving little for himselfkind true just and of constant if not warm affections
was i not all this  all this and more said hester
and what am i now demanded he looking into her face and permitting the whole evil within him to be written on his features
i have already told thee what i ama fiend
who made me so  it was myself cried hester shuddering
it was i not less than he
why hast thou not avenged thyself on me  i have left thee to the scarlet letter replied roger chillingworth
if that has not avenged me i can do no more  he laid his finger on it with a smile
it has avenged thee answered hester prynne
i judged no less said the physician
and now what wouldst thou with me touching this man  i must reveal the secret answered hester firmly
he must discern thee in thy true character
what may be the result i know not
but this long debt of confidence due from me to him whose bane and ruin i have been shall at length be paid
so far as concerns the overthrow or preservation of his fair fame and his earthly state and perchance his life he is in my hands
nor do iwhom the scarlet letter has disciplined to truth though it be the truth of redhot iron entering into the soulnor do i perceive such advantage in his living any longer a life of ghastly emptiness that i shall stoop to implore thy mercy
do with him as thou wilt
there is no good for him no good for me no good for thee
there is no good for little pearl
there is no path to guide us out of this dismal maze  woman i could wellnigh pity thee said roger chillingworth unable to restrain a thrill of admiration too for there was a quality almost majestic in the despair which she expressed
thou hadst great elements
peradventure hadst thou met earlier with a better love than mine this evil had not been
i pity thee for the good that has been wasted in thy nature  and i thee answered hester prynne for the hatred that has transformed a wise and just man to a fiend
wilt thou yet purge it out of thee and be once more human
if not for his sake then doubly for thine own
forgive and leave his further retribution to the power that claims it
i said but now that there could be no good event for him or thee or me who are here wandering together in this gloomy maze of evil and stumbling at every step over the guilt wherewith we have strewn our path
it is not so
there might be good for thee and thee alone since thou hast been deeply wronged and hast it at thy will to pardon
wilt thou give up that only privilege
wilt thou reject that priceless benefit  peace hesterpeace replied the old man with gloomy sternnessit is not granted me to pardon
i have no such power as thou tellest me of
my old faith long forgotten comes back to me and explains all that we do and all we suffer
by thy first step awry thou didst plant the germ of evil but since that moment it has all been a dark necessity
ye that have wronged me are not sinful save in a kind of typical illusion neither am i fiendlike who have snatched a fiends office from his hands
it is our fate
let the black flower blossom as it may
now go thy ways and deal as thou wilt with yonder man  he waved his hand and betook himself again to his employment of gathering herbs
xv
hester and pearl   so roger chillingwortha deformed old figure with a face that haunted mens memories longer than they likedtook leave of hester prynne and went stooping away along the earth
he gathered here and there a herb or grubbed up a root and put it into the basket on his arm
his gray beard almost touched the ground as he crept onward
hester gazed after him a little while looking with a half fantastic curiosity to see whether the tender grass of early spring would not be blighted beneath him and show the wavering track of his footsteps sere and brown across its cheerful verdure
she wondered what sort of herbs they were which the old man was so sedulous to gather
would not the earth quickened to an evil purpose by the sympathy of his eye greet him with poisonous shrubs of species hitherto unknown that would start up under his fingers
or might it suffice him that every wholesome growth should be converted into something deleterious and malignant at his touch
did the sun which shone so brightly everywhere else really fall upon him
or was there as it rather seemed a circle of ominous shadow moving along with his deformity whichever way he turned himself
and whither was he now going
would he not suddenly sink into the earth leaving a barren and blasted spot where in due course of time would be seen deadly nightshade dogwood henbane and whatever else of vegetable wickedness the climate could produce all flourishing with hideous luxuriance
or would he spread bats wings and flee away looking so much the uglier the higher he rose towards heaven
be it sin or no said hester prynne bitterly as still she gazed after him i hate the man  she upbraided herself for the sentiment but could not overcome or lessen it
attempting to do so she thought of those longpast days in a distant land when he used to emerge at eventide from the seclusion of his study and sit down in the firelight of their home and in the light of her nuptial smile
he needed to bask himself in that smile he said in order that the chill of so many lonely hours among his books might be taken off the scholars heart
such scenes had once appeared not otherwise than happy but now as viewed through the dismal medium of her subsequent life they classed themselves among her ugliest remembrances
she marvelled how such scenes could have been
she marvelled how she could ever have been wrought upon to marry him
she deemed it her crime most to be repented of that she had ever endured and reciprocated the lukewarm grasp of his hand and had suffered the smile of her lips and eyes to mingle and melt into his own
and it seemed a fouler offence committed by roger chillingworth than any which had since been done him that in the time when her heart knew no better he had persuaded her to fancy herself happy by his side
yes i hate him repeated hester more bitterly than before
he betrayed me
he has done me worse wrong than i did him  let men tremble to win the hand of woman unless they win along with it the utmost passion of her heart
else it may be their miserable fortune as it was roger chillingworths when some mightier touch than their own may have awakened all her sensibilities to be reproached even for the calm content the marble image of happiness which they will have imposed upon her as the warm reality
but hester ought long ago to have done with this injustice
what did it betoken
had seven long years under the torture of the scarlet letter inflicted so much of misery and wrought out no repentance
the emotion of that brief space while she stood gazing after the crooked figure of old roger chillingworth threw a dark light on hesters state of mind revealing much that she might not otherwise have acknowledged to herself
he being gone she summoned back her child
pearl
little pearl
where are you  pearl whose activity of spirit never flagged had been at no loss for amusement while her mother talked with the old gatherer of herbs
at first as already told she had flirted fancifully with her own image in a pool of water beckoning the phantom forth andas it declined to ventureseeking a passage for herself into its sphere of impalpable earth and unattainable sky
soon finding however that either she or the image was unreal she turned elsewhere for better pastime
she made little boats out of birchbark and freighted them with snailshells and sent out more ventures on the mighty deep than any merchant in new england but the larger part of them foundered near the shore
she seized a live horseshoe by the tail and made prize of several fivefingers and laid out a jellyfish to melt in the warm sun
then she took up the white foam that streaked the line of the advancing tide and threw it upon the breeze scampering after it with winged footsteps to catch the great snowflakes ere they fell
perceiving a flock of beachbirds that fed and fluttered along the shore the naughty child picked up her apron full of pebbles and creeping from rock to rock after these small seafowl displayed remarkable dexterity in pelting them
one little gray bird with a white breast pearl was almost sure had been hit by a pebble and fluttered away with a broken wing
but then the elfchild sighed and gave up her sport because it grieved her to have done harm to a little being that was as wild as the seabreeze or as wild as pearl herself
her final employment was to gather seaweed of various kinds and make herself a scarf or mantle and a headdress and thus assume the aspect of a little mermaid
she inherited her mothers gift for devising drapery and costume
as the last touch to her mermaids garb pearl took some eelgrass and imitated as best she could on her own bosom the decoration with which she was so familiar on her mothers
a letterthe letter abut freshly green instead of scarlet
the child bent her chin upon her breast and contemplated this device with strange interest even as if the one only thing for which she had been sent into the world was to make out its hidden import
i wonder if mother will ask me what it means thought pearl
just then she heard her mothers voice and flitting along as lightly as one of the little seabirds appeared before hester prynne dancing laughing and pointing her finger to the ornament upon her bosom
my little pearl said hester after a moments silence the green letter and on thy childish bosom has no purport
but dost thou know my child what this letter means which thy mother is doomed to wear  yes mother said the child
it is the great letter a thou hast taught me in the hornbook  hester looked steadily into her little face but though there was that singular expression which she had so often remarked in her black eyes she could not satisfy herself whether pearl really attached any meaning to the symbol
she felt a morbid desire to ascertain the point
dost thou know child wherefore thy mother wears this letter  truly do i answered pearl looking brightly into her mothers face
it is for the same reason that the minister keeps his hand over his heart  and what reason is that asked hester half smiling at the absurd incongruity of the childs observation but on second thoughts turning pale
what has the letter to do with any heart save mine  nay mother i have told all i know said pearl more seriously than she was wont to speak
ask yonder old man whom thou hast been talking withit may be he can tell
but in good earnest now mother dear what does this scarlet letter meanand why dost thou wear it on thy bosomand why does the minister keep his hand over his heart  she took her mothers hand in both her own and gazed into her eyes with an earnestness that was seldom seen in her wild and capricious character
the thought occurred to hester that the child might really be seeking to approach her with childlike confidence and doing what she could and as intelligently as she knew how to establish a meetingpoint of sympathy
it showed pearl in an unwonted aspect
heretofore the mother while loving her child with the intensity of a sole affection had schooled herself to hope for little other return than the waywardness of an april breeze which spends its time in airy sport and has its gusts of inexplicable passion and is petulant in its best of moods and chills oftener than caresses you when you take it to your bosom in requital of which misdemeanours it will sometimes of its own vague purpose kiss your cheek with a kind of doubtful tenderness and play gently with your hair and then be gone about its other idle business leaving a dreamy pleasure at your heart
and this moreover was a mothers estimate of the childs disposition
any other observer might have seen few but unamiable traits and have given them a far darker colouring
but now the idea came strongly into hesters mind that pearl with her remarkable precocity and acuteness might already have approached the age when she could have been made a friend and intrusted with as much of her mothers sorrows as could be imparted without irreverence either to the parent or the child
in the little chaos of pearls character there might be seen emerging and could have been from the very firstthe steadfast principles of an unflinching couragean uncontrollable willsturdy pride which might be disciplined into selfrespectand a bitter scorn of many things which when examined might be found to have the taint of falsehood in them
she possessed affections too though hitherto acrid and disagreeable as are the richest flavours of unripe fruit
with all these sterling attributes thought hester the evil which she inherited from her mother must be great indeed if a noble woman do not grow out of this elfish child
pearls inevitable tendency to hover about the enigma of the scarlet letter seemed an innate quality of her being
from the earliest epoch of her conscious life she had entered upon this as her appointed mission
hester had often fancied that providence had a design of justice and retribution in endowing the child with this marked propensity but never until now had she bethought herself to ask whether linked with that design there might not likewise be a purpose of mercy and beneficence
if little pearl were entertained with faith and trust as a spirit messenger no less than an earthly child might it not be her errand to soothe away the sorrow that lay cold in her mothers heart and converted it into a tomband to help her to overcome the passion once so wild and even yet neither dead nor asleep but only imprisoned within the same tomblike heart
such were some of the thoughts that now stirred in hesters mind with as much vivacity of impression as if they had actually been whispered into her ear
and there was little pearl all this while holding her mothers hand in both her own and turning her face upward while she put these searching questions once and again and still a third time
what does the letter mean mother
and why dost thou wear it
and why does the minister keep his hand over his heart  what shall i say thought hester to herself
no
if this be the price of the childs sympathy i cannot pay it  then she spoke aloud  silly pearl said she what questions are these
there are many things in this world that a child must not ask about
what know i of the ministers heart
and as for the scarlet letter i wear it for the sake of its gold thread  in all the seven bygone years hester prynne had never before been false to the symbol on her bosom
it may be that it was the talisman of a stern and severe but yet a guardian spirit who now forsook her as recognising that in spite of his strict watch over her heart some new evil had crept into it or some old one had never been expelled
as for little pearl the earnestness soon passed out of her face
but the child did not see fit to let the matter drop
two or three times as her mother and she went homeward and as often at suppertime and while hester was putting her to bed and once after she seemed to be fairly asleep pearl looked up with mischief gleaming in her black eyes
mother said she what does the scarlet letter mean  and the next morning the first indication the child gave of being awake was by popping up her head from the pillow and making that other enquiry which she had so unaccountably connected with her investigations about the scarlet letter  mothermotherwhy does the minister keep his hand over his heart  hold thy tongue naughty child answered her mother with an asperity that she had never permitted to herself before
do not tease me else i shall put thee into the dark closet     xvi
a forest walk   hester prynne remained constant in her resolve to make known to mr dimmesdale at whatever risk of present pain or ulterior consequences the true character of the man who had crept into his intimacy
for several days however she vainly sought an opportunity of addressing him in some of the meditative walks which she knew him to be in the habit of taking along the shores of the peninsula or on the wooded hills of the neighbouring country
there would have been no scandal indeed nor peril to the holy whiteness of the clergymans good fame had she visited him in his own study where many a penitent ere now had confessed sins of perhaps as deep a dye as the one betokened by the scarlet letter
but partly that she dreaded the secret or undisguised interference of old roger chillingworth and partly that her conscious heart imparted suspicion where none could have been felt and partly that both the minister and she would need the whole wide world to breathe in while they talked togetherfor all these reasons hester never thought of meeting him in any narrower privacy than beneath the open sky
at last while attending a sick chamber whither the rev
mr dimmesdale had been summoned to make a prayer she learnt that he had gone the day before to visit the apostle eliot among his indian converts
he would probably return by a certain hour in the afternoon of the morrow
betimes therefore the next day hester took little pearlwho was necessarily the companion of all her mothers expeditions however inconvenient her presenceand set forth
the road after the two wayfarers had crossed from the peninsula to the mainland was no other than a footpath
it straggled onward into the mystery of the primeval forest
this hemmed it in so narrowly and stood so black and dense on either side and disclosed such imperfect glimpses of the sky above that to hesters mind it imaged not amiss the moral wilderness in which she had so long been wandering
the day was chill and sombre
overhead was a gray expanse of cloud slightly stirred however by a breeze so that a gleam of flickering sunshine might now and then be seen at its solitary play along the path
this flitting cheerfulness was always at the further extremity of some long vista through the forest
the sportive sunlightfeebly sportive at best in the predominant pensiveness of the day and scenewithdrew itself as they came nigh and left the spots where it had danced the drearier because they had hoped to find them bright
mother said little pearl the sunshine does not love you
it runs away and hides itself because it is afraid of something on your bosom
now see
there it is playing a good way off
stand you here and let me run and catch it
i am but a child
it will not flee from mefor i wear nothing on my bosom yet  nor ever will my child i hope said hester
and why not mother asked pearl stopping short just at the beginning of her race
will not it come of its own accord when i am a woman grown  run away child answered her mother and catch the sunshine
it will soon be gone  pearl set forth at a great pace and as hester smiled to perceive did actually catch the sunshine and stood laughing in the midst of it all brightened by its splendour and scintillating with the vivacity excited by rapid motion
the light lingered about the lonely child as if glad of such a playmate until her mother had drawn almost nigh enough to step into the magic circle too
it will go now said pearl shaking her head
see answered hester smiling now i can stretch out my hand and grasp some of it  as she attempted to do so the sunshine vanished or to judge from the bright expression that was dancing on pearls features her mother could have fancied that the child had absorbed it into herself and would give it forth again with a gleam about her path as they should plunge into some gloomier shade
there was no other attribute that so much impressed her with a sense of new and untransmitted vigour in pearls nature as this never failing vivacity of spirits she had not the disease of sadness which almost all children in these latter days inherit with the scrofula from the troubles of their ancestors
perhaps this too was a disease and but the reflex of the wild energy with which hester had fought against her sorrows before pearls birth
it was certainly a doubtful charm imparting a hard metallic lustre to the childs character
she wantedwhat some people want throughout lifea grief that should deeply touch her and thus humanise and make her capable of sympathy
but there was time enough yet for little pearl
come my child said hester looking about her from the spot where pearl had stood still in the sunshinewe will sit down a little way within the wood and rest ourselves  i am not aweary mother replied the little girl
but you may sit down if you will tell me a story meanwhile  a story child said hester
and about what  oh a story about the black man answered pearl taking hold of her mothers gown and looking up half earnestly half mischievously into her face
how he haunts this forest and carries a book with him a big heavy book with iron clasps and how this ugly black man offers his book and an iron pen to everybody that meets him here among the trees and they are to write their names with their own blood and then he sets his mark on their bosoms
didst thou ever meet the black man mother  and who told you this story pearl asked her mother recognising a common superstition of the period
it was the old dame in the chimney corner at the house where you watched last night said the child
but she fancied me asleep while she was talking of it
she said that a thousand and a thousand people had met him here and had written in his book and have his mark on them
and that ugly tempered lady old mistress hibbins was one
and mother the old dame said that this scarlet letter was the black mans mark on thee and that it glows like a red flame when thou meetest him at midnight here in the dark wood
is it true mother
and dost thou go to meet him in the nighttime  didst thou ever awake and find thy mother gone asked hester
not that i remember said the child
if thou fearest to leave me in our cottage thou mightest take me along with thee
i would very gladly go
but mother tell me now
is there such a black man
and didst thou ever meet him
and is this his mark  wilt thou let me be at peace if i once tell thee asked her mother
yes if thou tellest me all answered pearl
once in my life i met the black man said her mother
this scarlet letter is his mark  thus conversing they entered sufficiently deep into the wood to secure themselves from the observation of any casual passenger along the forest track
here they sat down on a luxuriant heap of moss which at some epoch of the preceding century had been a gigantic pine with its roots and trunk in the darksome shade and its head aloft in the upper atmosphere
it was a little dell where they had seated themselves with a leafstrewn bank rising gently on either side and a brook flowing through the midst over a bed of fallen and drowned leaves
the trees impending over it had flung down great branches from time to time which choked up the current and compelled it to form eddies and black depths at some points while in its swifter and livelier passages there appeared a channelway of pebbles and brown sparkling sand
letting the eyes follow along the course of the stream they could catch the reflected light from its water at some short distance within the forest but soon lost all traces of it amid the bewilderment of treetrunks and underbrush and here and there a huge rock covered over with gray lichens
all these giant trees and boulders of granite seemed intent on making a mystery of the course of this small brook fearing perhaps that with its neverceasing loquacity it should whisper tales out of the heart of the old forest whence it flowed or mirror its revelations on the smooth surface of a pool
continually indeed as it stole onward the streamlet kept up a babble kind quiet soothing but melancholy like the voice of a young child that was spending its infancy without playfulness and knew not how to be merry among sad acquaintance and events of sombre hue
oh brook
oh foolish and tiresome little brook cried pearl after listening awhile to its talk why art thou so sad
pluck up a spirit and do not be all the time sighing and murmuring  but the brook in the course of its little lifetime among the forest trees had gone through so solemn an experience that it could not help talking about it and seemed to have nothing else to say
pearl resembled the brook inasmuch as the current of her life gushed from a wellspring as mysterious and had flowed through scenes shadowed as heavily with gloom
but unlike the little stream she danced and sparkled and prattled airily along her course
what does this sad little brook say mother inquired she
if thou hadst a sorrow of thine own the brook might tell thee of it answered her mother even as it is telling me of mine
but now pearl i hear a footstep along the path and the noise of one putting aside the branches
i would have thee betake thyself to play and leave me to speak with him that comes yonder  is it the black man asked pearl
wilt thou go and play child repeated her mother but do not stray far into the wood
and take heed that thou come at my first call  yes mother answered pearl but if it be the black man wilt thou not let me stay a moment and look at him with his big book under his arm  go silly child said her mother impatiently
it is no black man
thou canst see him now through the trees
it is the minister  and so it is said the child
and mother he has his hand over his heart
is it because when the minister wrote his name in the book the black man set his mark in that place
but why does he not wear it outside his bosom as thou dost mother  go now child and thou shalt tease me as thou wilt another time cried hester prynne
but do not stray far
keep where thou canst hear the babble of the brook  the child went singing away following up the current of the brook and striving to mingle a more lightsome cadence with its melancholy voice
but the little stream would not be comforted and still kept telling its unintelligible secret of some very mournful mystery that had happenedor making a prophetic lamentation about something that was yet to happenwithin the verge of the dismal forest
so pearl who had enough of shadow in her own little life chose to break off all acquaintance with this repining brook
she set herself therefore to gathering violets and woodanemones and some scarlet columbines that she found growing in the crevice of a high rock
when her elfchild had departed hester prynne made a step or two towards the track that led through the forest but still remained under the deep shadow of the trees
she beheld the minister advancing along the path entirely alone and leaning on a staff which he had cut by the wayside
he looked haggard and feeble and betrayed a nerveless despondency in his air which had never so remarkably characterised him in his walks about the settlement nor in any other situation where he deemed himself liable to notice
here it was wofully visible in this intense seclusion of the forest which of itself would have been a heavy trial to the spirits
there was a listlessness in his gait as if he saw no reason for taking one step further nor felt any desire to do so but would have been glad could he be glad of anything to fling himself down at the root of the nearest tree and lie there passive for evermore
the leaves might bestrew him and the soil gradually accumulate and form a little hillock over his frame no matter whether there were life in it or no
death was too definite an object to be wished for or avoided
to hesters eye the reverend mr dimmesdale exhibited no symptom of positive and vivacious suffering except that as little pearl had remarked he kept his hand over his heart
xvii
the pastor and his parishioner   slowly as the minister walked he had almost gone by before hester prynne could gather voice enough to attract his observation
at length she succeeded
arthur dimmesdale she said faintly at first then louder but hoarselyarthur dimmesdale  who speaks answered the minister
gathering himself quickly up he stood more erect like a man taken by surprise in a mood to which he was reluctant to have witnesses
throwing his eyes anxiously in the direction of the voice he indistinctly beheld a form under the trees clad in garments so sombre and so little relieved from the gray twilight into which the clouded sky and the heavy foliage had darkened the noontide that he knew not whether it were a woman or a shadow
it may be that his pathway through life was haunted thus by a spectre that had stolen out from among his thoughts
he made a step nigher and discovered the scarlet letter
hester
hester prynne said he is it thou
art thou in life  even so she answered
in such life as has been mine these seven years past
and thou arthur dimmesdale dost thou yet live  it was no wonder that they thus questioned one anothers actual and bodily existence and even doubted of their own
so strangely did they meet in the dim wood that it was like the first encounter in the world beyond the grave of two spirits who had been intimately connected in their former life but now stood coldly shuddering in mutual dread as not yet familiar with their state nor wonted to the companionship of disembodied beings
each a ghost and awestricken at the other ghost
they were awestricken likewise at themselves because the crisis flung back to them their consciousness and revealed to each heart its history and experience as life never does except at such breathless epochs
the soul beheld its features in the mirror of the passing moment
it was with fear and tremulously and as it were by a slow reluctant necessity that arthur dimmesdale put forth his hand chill as death and touched the chill hand of hester prynne
the grasp cold as it was took away what was dreariest in the interview
they now felt themselves at least inhabitants of the same sphere
without a word more spokenneither he nor she assuming the guidance but with an unexpressed consentthey glided back into the shadow of the woods whence hester had emerged and sat down on the heap of moss where she and pearl had before been sitting
when they found voice to speak it was at first only to utter remarks and inquiries such as any two acquaintances might have made about the gloomy sky the threatening storm and next the health of each
thus they went onward not boldly but step by step into the themes that were brooding deepest in their hearts
so long estranged by fate and circumstances they needed something slight and casual to run before and throw open the doors of intercourse so that their real thoughts might be led across the threshold
after awhile the minister fixed his eyes on hester prynnes
hester said he hast thou found peace  she smiled drearily looking down upon her bosom
hast thou she asked
nonenothing but despair he answered
what else could i look for being what i am and leading such a life as mine
were i an atheista man devoid of consciencea wretch with coarse and brutal instinctsi might have found peace long ere now
nay i never should have lost it
but as matters stand with my soul whatever of good capacity there originally was in me all of gods gifts that were the choicest have become the ministers of spiritual torment
hester i am most miserable  the people reverence thee said hester
and surely thou workest good among them
doth this bring thee no comfort  more misery hesteronly the more misery answered the clergyman with a bitter smile
as concerns the good which i may appear to do i have no faith in it
it must needs be a delusion
what can a ruined soul like mine effect towards the redemption of other soulsor a polluted soul towards their purification
and as for the peoples reverence would that it were turned to scorn and hatred
canst thou deem it hester a consolation that i must stand up in my pulpit and meet so many eyes turned upward to my face as if the light of heaven were beaming from itmust see my flock hungry for the truth and listening to my words as if a tongue of pentecost were speakingand then look inward and discern the black reality of what they idolise
i have laughed in bitterness and agony of heart at the contrast between what i seem and what i am
and satan laughs at it  you wrong yourself in this said hester gently
you have deeply and sorely repented
your sin is left behind you in the days long past
your present life is not less holy in very truth than it seems in peoples eyes
is there no reality in the penitence thus sealed and witnessed by good works
and wherefore should it not bring you peace  no hesterno replied the clergyman
there is no substance in it
it is cold and dead and can do nothing for me
of penance i have had enough
of penitence there has been none
else i should long ago have thrown off these garments of mock holiness and have shown myself to mankind as they will see me at the judgmentseat
happy are you hester that wear the scarlet letter openly upon your bosom
mine burns in secret
thou little knowest what a relief it is after the torment of a seven years cheat to look into an eye that recognises me for what i am
had i one friendor were it my worst enemyto whom when sickened with the praises of all other men i could daily betake myself and be known as the vilest of all sinners methinks my soul might keep itself alive thereby
even thus much of truth would save me
but now it is all falsehoodall emptinessall death  hester prynne looked into his face but hesitated to speak
yet uttering his longrestrained emotions so vehemently as he did his words here offered her the very point of circumstances in which to interpose what she came to say
she conquered her fears and spoke  such a friend as thou hast even now wished for said she with whom to weep over thy sin thou hast in me the partner of it again she hesitated but brought out the words with an effortthou hast long had such an enemy and dwellest with him under the same roof  the minister started to his feet gasping for breath and clutching at his heart as if he would have torn it out of his bosom
ha
what sayest thou cried he
an enemy
and under mine own roof
what mean you  hester prynne was now fully sensible of the deep injury for which she was responsible to this unhappy man in permitting him to lie for so many years or indeed for a single moment at the mercy of one whose purposes could not be other than malevolent
the very contiguity of his enemy beneath whatever mask the latter might conceal himself was enough to disturb the magnetic sphere of a being so sensitive as arthur dimmesdale
there had been a period when hester was less alive to this consideration or perhaps in the misanthropy of her own trouble she left the minister to bear what she might picture to herself as a more tolerable doom
but of late since the night of his vigil all her sympathies towards him had been both softened and invigorated
she now read his heart more accurately
she doubted not that the continual presence of roger chillingworththe secret poison of his malignity infecting all the air about himand his authorised interference as a physician with the ministers physical and spiritual infirmitiesthat these bad opportunities had been turned to a cruel purpose
by means of them the sufferers conscience had been kept in an irritated state the tendency of which was not to cure by wholesome pain but to disorganize and corrupt his spiritual being
its result on earth could hardly fail to be insanity and hereafter that eternal alienation from the good and true of which madness is perhaps the earthly type
such was the ruin to which she had brought the man oncenay why should we not speak itstill so passionately loved
hester felt that the sacrifice of the clergymans good name and death itself as she had already told roger chillingworth would have been infinitely preferable to the alternative which she had taken upon herself to choose
and now rather than have had this grievous wrong to confess she would gladly have laid down on the forest leaves and died there at arthur dimmesdales feet
oh arthur cried she forgive me
in all things else i have striven to be true
truth was the one virtue which i might have held fast and did hold fast through all extremity save when thy goodthy lifethy famewere put in question
then i consented to a deception
but a lie is never good even though death threaten on the other side
dost thou not see what i would say
that old manthe physicianhe whom they call roger chillingworthhe was my husband  the minister looked at her for an instant with all that violence of passion whichintermixed in more shapes than one with his higher purer softer qualitieswas in fact the portion of him which the devil claimed and through which he sought to win the rest
never was there a blacker or a fiercer frown than hester now encountered
for the brief space that it lasted it was a dark transfiguration
but his character had been so much enfeebled by suffering that even its lower energies were incapable of more than a temporary struggle
he sank down on the ground and buried his face in his hands
i might have known it murmured hei did know it
was not the secret told me in the natural recoil of my heart at the first sight of him and as often as i have seen him since
why did i not understand
oh hester prynne thou little little knowest all the horror of this thing
and the shamethe indelicacythe horrible ugliness of this exposure of a sick and guilty heart to the very eye that would gloat over it
woman woman thou art accountable for thisi cannot forgive thee  thou shalt forgive me cried hester flinging herself on the fallen leaves beside him
let god punish
thou shalt forgive  with sudden and desperate tenderness she threw her arms around him and pressed his head against her bosom little caring though his cheek rested on the scarlet letter
he would have released himself but strove in vain to do so
hester would not set him free lest he should look her sternly in the face
all the world had frowned on herfor seven long years had it frowned upon this lonely womanand still she bore it all nor ever once turned away her firm sad eyes
heaven likewise had frowned upon her and she had not died
but the frown of this pale weak sinful and sorrowstricken man was what hester could not bear and live
wilt thou yet forgive me she repeated over and over again
wilt thou not frown
wilt thou forgive  i do forgive you hester replied the minister at length with a deep utterance out of an abyss of sadness but no anger
i freely forgive you now
may god forgive us both
we are not hester the worst sinners in the world
there is one worse than even the polluted priest
that old mans revenge has been blacker than my sin
he has violated in cold blood the sanctity of a human heart
thou and i hester never did so  never never whispered she
what we did had a consecration of its own
we felt it so
we said so to each other
hast thou forgotten it  hush hester said arthur dimmesdale rising from the ground
no i have not forgotten  they sat down again side by side and hand clasped in hand on the mossy trunk of the fallen tree
life had never brought them a gloomier hour it was the point whither their pathway had so long been tending and darkening ever as it stole alongand yet it unclosed a charm that made them linger upon it and claim another and another and after all another moment
the forest was obscure around them and creaked with a blast that was passing through it
the boughs were tossing heavily above their heads while one solemn old tree groaned dolefully to another as if telling the sad story of the pair that sat beneath or constrained to forbode evil to come
and yet they lingered
how dreary looked the foresttrack that led backward to the settlement where hester prynne must take up again the burden of her ignominy and the minister the hollow mockery of his good name
so they lingered an instant longer
no golden light had ever been so precious as the gloom of this dark forest
here seen only by his eyes the scarlet letter need not burn into the bosom of the fallen woman
here seen only by her eyes arthur dimmesdale false to god and man might be for one moment true
he started at a thought that suddenly occurred to him
hester cried he here is a new horror
roger chillingworth knows your purpose to reveal his true character
will he continue then to keep our secret
what will now be the course of his revenge  there is a strange secrecy in his nature replied hester thoughtfully and it has grown upon him by the hidden practices of his revenge
i deem it not likely that he will betray the secret
he will doubtless seek other means of satiating his dark passion  and ihow am i to live longer breathing the same air with this deadly enemy exclaimed arthur dimmesdale shrinking within himself and pressing his hand nervously against his hearta gesture that had grown involuntary with him
think for me hester
thou art strong
resolve for me  thou must dwell no longer with this man said hester slowly and firmly
thy heart must be no longer under his evil eye  it were far worse than death replied the minister
but how to avoid it
what choice remains to me
shall i lie down again on these withered leaves where i cast myself when thou didst tell me what he was
must i sink down there and die at once  alas
what a ruin has befallen thee said hester with the tears gushing into her eyes
wilt thou die for very weakness
there is no other cause  the judgment of god is on me answered the consciencestricken priest
it is too mighty for me to struggle with  heaven would show mercy rejoined hester hadst thou but the strength to take advantage of it  be thou strong for me answered he
advise me what to do  is the world then so narrow exclaimed hester prynne fixing her deep eyes on the ministers and instinctively exercising a magnetic power over a spirit so shattered and subdued that it could hardly hold itself erect
doth the universe lie within the compass of yonder town which only a little time ago was but a leafstrewn desert as lonely as this around us
whither leads yonder foresttrack
backward to the settlement thou sayest
yes but onward too
deeper it goes and deeper into the wilderness less plainly to be seen at every step until some few miles hence the yellow leaves will show no vestige of the white mans tread
there thou art free
so brief a journey would bring thee from a world where thou hast been most wretched to one where thou mayest still be happy
is there not shade enough in all this boundless forest to hide thy heart from the gaze of roger chillingworth  yes hester but only under the fallen leaves replied the minister with a sad smile
then there is the broad pathway of the sea continued hester
it brought thee hither
if thou so choose it will bear thee back again
in our native land whether in some remote rural village or in vast londonor surely in germany in france in pleasant italythou wouldst be beyond his power and knowledge
and what hast thou to do with all these iron men and their opinions
they have kept thy better part in bondage too long already  it cannot be answered the minister listening as if he were called upon to realise a dream
i am powerless to go
wretched and sinful as i am i have had no other thought than to drag on my earthly existence in the sphere where providence hath placed me
lost as my own soul is i would still do what i may for other human souls
i dare not quit my post though an unfaithful sentinel whose sure reward is death and dishonour when his dreary watch shall come to an end  thou art crushed under this seven years weight of misery replied hester fervently resolved to buoy him up with her own energy
but thou shalt leave it all behind thee
it shall not cumber thy steps as thou treadest along the forestpath neither shalt thou freight the ship with it if thou prefer to cross the sea
leave this wreck and ruin here where it hath happened
meddle no more with it
begin all anew
hast thou exhausted possibility in the failure of this one trial
not so
the future is yet full of trial and success
there is happiness to be enjoyed
there is good to be done
exchange this false life of thine for a true one
be if thy spirit summon thee to such a mission the teacher and apostle of the red men
or as is more thy nature be a scholar and a sage among the wisest and the most renowned of the cultivated world
preach
write
act
do anything save to lie down and die
give up this name of arthur dimmesdale and make thyself another and a high one such as thou canst wear without fear or shame
why shouldst thou tarry so much as one other day in the torments that have so gnawed into thy life
that have made thee feeble to will and to do
that will leave thee powerless even to repent
up and away  oh hester cried arthur dimmesdale in whose eyes a fitful light kindled by her enthusiasm flashed up and died away thou tellest of running a race to a man whose knees are tottering beneath him
i must die here
there is not the strength or courage left me to venture into the wide strange difficult world alone  it was the last expression of the despondency of a broken spirit
he lacked energy to grasp the better fortune that seemed within his reach
he repeated the wordalone hester  thou shall not go alone answered she in a deep whisper
then all was spoken
xviii
a flood of sunshine   arthur dimmesdale gazed into hesters face with a look in which hope and joy shone out indeed but with fear betwixt them and a kind of horror at her boldness who had spoken what he vaguely hinted at but dared not speak
but hester prynne with a mind of native courage and activity and for so long a period not merely estranged but outlawed from society had habituated herself to such latitude of speculation as was altogether foreign to the clergyman
she had wandered without rule or guidance in a moral wilderness as vast as intricate and shadowy as the untamed forest amid the gloom of which they were now holding a colloquy that was to decide their fate
her intellect and heart had their home as it were in desert places where she roamed as freely as the wild indian in his woods
for years past she had looked from this estranged point of view at human institutions and whatever priests or legislators had established criticising all with hardly more reverence than the indian would feel for the clerical band the judicial robe the pillory the gallows the fireside or the church
the tendency of her fate and fortunes had been to set her free
the scarlet letter was her passport into regions where other women dared not tread
shame despair solitude
these had been her teachersstern and wild onesand they had made her strong but taught her much amiss
the minister on the other hand had never gone through an experience calculated to lead him beyond the scope of generally received laws although in a single instance he had so fearfully transgressed one of the most sacred of them
but this had been a sin of passion not of principle nor even purpose
since that wretched epoch he had watched with morbid zeal and minuteness not his actsfor those it was easy to arrangebut each breath of emotion and his every thought
at the head of the social system as the clergymen of that day stood he was only the more trammelled by its regulations its principles and even its prejudices
as a priest the framework of his order inevitably hemmed him in
as a man who had once sinned but who kept his conscience all alive and painfully sensitive by the fretting of an unhealed wound he might have been supposed safer within the line of virtue than if he had never sinned at all
thus we seem to see that as regarded hester prynne the whole seven years of outlaw and ignominy had been little other than a preparation for this very hour
but arthur dimmesdale
were such a man once more to fall what plea could be urged in extenuation of his crime
none unless it avail him somewhat that he was broken down by long and exquisite suffering that his mind was darkened and confused by the very remorse which harrowed it that between fleeing as an avowed criminal and remaining as a hypocrite conscience might find it hard to strike the balance that it was human to avoid the peril of death and infamy and the inscrutable machinations of an enemy that finally to this poor pilgrim on his dreary and desert path faint sick miserable there appeared a glimpse of human affection and sympathy a new life and a true one in exchange for the heavy doom which he was now expiating
and be the stern and sad truth spoken that the breach which guilt has once made into the human soul is never in this mortal state repaired
it may be watched and guarded so that the enemy shall not force his way again into the citadel and might even in his subsequent assaults select some other avenue in preference to that where he had formerly succeeded
but there is still the ruined wall and near it the stealthy tread of the foe that would win over again his unforgotten triumph
the struggle if there were one need not be described
let it suffice that the clergyman resolved to flee and not alone
if in all these past seven years thought he i could recall one instant of peace or hope i would yet endure for the sake of that earnest of heavens mercy
but nowsince i am irrevocably doomedwherefore should i not snatch the solace allowed to the condemned culprit before his execution
or if this be the path to a better life as hester would persuade me i surely give up no fairer prospect by pursuing it
neither can i any longer live without her companionship so powerful is she to sustainso tender to soothe
o thou to whom i dare not lift mine eyes wilt thou yet pardon me  thou wilt go said hester calmly as he met her glance
the decision once made a glow of strange enjoyment threw its flickering brightness over the trouble of his breast
it was the exhilarating effectupon a prisoner just escaped from the dungeon of his own heartof breathing the wild free atmosphere of an unredeemed unchristianised lawless region
his spirit rose as it were with a bound and attained a nearer prospect of the sky than throughout all the misery which had kept him grovelling on the earth
of a deeply religious temperament there was inevitably a tinge of the devotional in his mood
do i feel joy again cried he wondering at himself
methought the germ of it was dead in me
oh hester thou art my better angel
i seem to have flung myselfsick sinstained and sorrowblackeneddown upon these forest leaves and to have risen up all made anew and with new powers to glorify him that hath been merciful
this is already the better life
why did we not find it sooner  let us not look back answered hester prynne
the past is gone
wherefore should we linger upon it now
see
with this symbol i undo it all and make it as if it had never been  so speaking she undid the clasp that fastened the scarlet letter and taking it from her bosom threw it to a distance among the withered leaves
the mystic token alighted on the hither verge of the stream
with a handsbreadth further flight it would have fallen into the water and have given the little brook another woe to carry onward besides the unintelligible tale which it still kept murmuring about
but there lay the embroidered letter glittering like a lost jewel which some illfated wanderer might pick up and thenceforth be haunted by strange phantoms of guilt sinkings of the heart and unaccountable misfortune
the stigma gone hester heaved a long deep sigh in which the burden of shame and anguish departed from her spirit
o exquisite relief
she had not known the weight until she felt the freedom
by another impulse she took off the formal cap that confined her hair and down it fell upon her shoulders dark and rich with at once a shadow and a light in its abundance and imparting the charm of softness to her features
there played around her mouth and beamed out of her eyes a radiant and tender smile that seemed gushing from the very heart of womanhood
a crimson flush was glowing on her cheek that had been long so pale
her sex her youth and the whole richness of her beauty came back from what men call the irrevocable past and clustered themselves with her maiden hope and a happiness before unknown within the magic circle of this hour
and as if the gloom of the earth and sky had been but the effluence of these two mortal hearts it vanished with their sorrow
all at once as with a sudden smile of heaven forth burst the sunshine pouring a very flood into the obscure forest gladdening each green leaf transmuting the yellow fallen ones to gold and gleaming adown the gray trunks of the solemn trees
the objects that had made a shadow hitherto embodied the brightness now
the course of the little brook might be traced by its merry gleam afar into the woods heart of mystery which had become a mystery of joy
such was the sympathy of naturethat wild heathen nature of the forest never subjugated by human law nor illumined by higher truthwith the bliss of these two spirits
love whether newlyborn or aroused from a deathlike slumber must always create a sunshine filling the heart so full of radiance that it overflows upon the outward world
had the forest still kept its gloom it would have been bright in hesters eyes and bright in arthur dimmesdales
hester looked at him with a thrill of another joy
thou must know pearl said she
our little pearl
thou hast seen heryes i know itbut thou wilt see her now with other eyes
she is a strange child
i hardly comprehend her
but thou wilt love her dearly as i do and wilt advise me how to deal with her  dost thou think the child will be glad to know me asked the minister somewhat uneasily
i have long shrunk from children because they often show a distrusta backwardness to be familiar with me
i have even been afraid of little pearl  ah that was sad answered the mother
but she will love thee dearly and thou her
she is not far off
i will call her
pearl
pearl  i see the child observed the minister
yonder she is standing in a streak of sunshine a good way off on the other side of the brook
so thou thinkest the child will love me  hester smiled and again called to pearl who was visible at some distance as the minister had described her like a brightapparelled vision in a sunbeam which fell down upon her through an arch of boughs
the ray quivered to and fro making her figure dim or distinctnow like a real child now like a childs spiritas the splendour went and came again
she heard her mothers voice and approached slowly through the forest
pearl had not found the hour pass wearisomely while her mother sat talking with the clergyman
the great black foreststern as it showed itself to those who brought the guilt and troubles of the world into its bosombecame the playmate of the lonely infant as well as it knew how
sombre as it was it put on the kindest of its moods to welcome her
it offered her the partridgeberries the growth of the preceding autumn but ripening only in the spring and now red as drops of blood upon the withered leaves
these pearl gathered and was pleased with their wild flavour
the small denizens of the wilderness hardly took pains to move out of her path
a partridge indeed with a brood of ten behind her ran forward threateningly but soon repented of her fierceness and clucked to her young ones not to be afraid
a pigeon alone on a low branch allowed pearl to come beneath and uttered a sound as much of greeting as alarm
a squirrel from the lofty depths of his domestic tree chattered either in anger or merrimentfor the squirrel is such a choleric and humorous little personage that it is hard to distinguish between his moodsso he chattered at the child and flung down a nut upon her head
it was a last years nut and already gnawed by his sharp tooth
a fox startled from his sleep by her light footstep on the leaves looked inquisitively at pearl as doubting whether it were better to steal off or renew his nap on the same spot
a wolf it is saidbut here the tale has surely lapsed into the improbablecame up and smelt of pearls robe and offered his savage head to be patted by her hand
the truth seems to be however that the motherforest and these wild things which it nourished all recognised a kindred wilderness in the human child
and she was gentler here than in the grassymargined streets of the settlement or in her mothers cottage
the flowers appeared to know it and one and another whispered as she passed adorn thyself with me thou beautiful child adorn thyself with meand to please them pearl gathered the violets and anemones and columbines and some twigs of the freshest green which the old trees held down before her eyes
with these she decorated her hair and her young waist and became a nymph child or an infant dryad or whatever else was in closest sympathy with the antique wood
in such guise had pearl adorned herself when she heard her mothers voice and came slowly back
slowlyfor she saw the clergyman
xix
the child at the brookside   thou wilt love her dearly repeated hester prynne as she and the minister sat watching little pearl
dost thou not think her beautiful
and see with what natural skill she has made those simple flowers adorn her
had she gathered pearls and diamonds and rubies in the wood they could not have become her better
she is a splendid child
but i know whose brow she has  dost thou know hester said arthur dimmesdale with an unquiet smile that this dear child tripping about always at thy side hath caused me many an alarm
methoughtoh hester what a thought is that and how terrible to dread itthat my own features were partly repeated in her face and so strikingly that the world might see them
but she is mostly thine  no no
not mostly answered the mother with a tender smile
a little longer and thou needest not to be afraid to trace whose child she is
but how strangely beautiful she looks with those wild flowers in her hair
it is as if one of the fairies whom we left in dear old england had decked her out to meet us  it was with a feeling which neither of them had ever before experienced that they sat and watched pearls slow advance
in her was visible the tie that united them
she had been offered to the world these seven past years as the living hieroglyphic in which was revealed the secret they so darkly sought to hideall written in this symbolall plainly manifesthad there been a prophet or magician skilled to read the character of flame
and pearl was the oneness of their being
be the foregone evil what it might how could they doubt that their earthly lives and future destinies were conjoined when they beheld at once the material union and the spiritual idea in whom they met and were to dwell immortally together thoughts like theseand perhaps other thoughts which they did not acknowledge or definethrew an awe about the child as she came onward
let her see nothing strangeno passion or eagernessin thy way of accosting her whispered hester
our pearl is a fitful and fantastic little elf sometimes
especially she is generally intolerant of emotion when she does not fully comprehend the why and wherefore
but the child hath strong affections
she loves me and will love thee  thou canst not think said the minister glancing aside at hester prynne how my heart dreads this interview and yearns for it
but in truth as i already told thee children are not readily won to be familiar with me
they will not climb my knee nor prattle in my ear nor answer to my smile but stand apart and eye me strangely
even little babes when i take them in my arms weep bitterly
yet pearl twice in her little lifetime hath been kind to me
the first timethou knowest it well
the last was when thou ledst her with thee to the house of yonder stern old governor  and thou didst plead so bravely in her behalf and mine answered the mother
i remember it and so shall little pearl
fear nothing
she may be strange and shy at first but will soon learn to love thee  by this time pearl had reached the margin of the brook and stood on the further side gazing silently at hester and the clergyman who still sat together on the mossy treetrunk waiting to receive her
just where she had paused the brook chanced to form a pool so smooth and quiet that it reflected a perfect image of her little figure with all the brilliant picturesqueness of her beauty in its adornment of flowers and wreathed foliage but more refined and spiritualized than the reality
this image so nearly identical with the living pearl seemed to communicate somewhat of its own shadowy and intangible quality to the child herself
it was strange the way in which pearl stood looking so steadfastly at them through the dim medium of the forest gloom herself meanwhile all glorified with a ray of sunshine that was attracted thitherward as by a certain sympathy
in the brook beneath stood another childanother and the samewith likewise its ray of golden light
hester felt herself in some indistinct and tantalizing manner estranged from pearl as if the child in her lonely ramble through the forest had strayed out of the sphere in which she and her mother dwelt together and was now vainly seeking to return to it
there were both truth and error in the impression the child and mother were estranged but through hesters fault not pearls
since the latter rambled from her side another inmate had been admitted within the circle of the mothers feelings and so modified the aspect of them all that pearl the returning wanderer could not find her wonted place and hardly knew where she was
i have a strange fancy observed the sensitive minister that this brook is the boundary between two worlds and that thou canst never meet thy pearl again
or is she an elfish spirit who as the legends of our childhood taught us is forbidden to cross a running stream
pray hasten her for this delay has already imparted a tremor to my nerves  come dearest child said hester encouragingly and stretching out both her arms
how slow thou art
when hast thou been so sluggish before now
here is a friend of mine who must be thy friend also
thou wilt have twice as much love henceforward as thy mother alone could give thee
leap across the brook and come to us
thou canst leap like a young deer  pearl without responding in any manner to these honeysweet expressions remained on the other side of the brook
now she fixed her bright wild eyes on her mother now on the minister and now included them both in the same glance as if to detect and explain to herself the relation which they bore to one another
for some unaccountable reason as arthur dimmesdale felt the childs eyes upon himself his handwith that gesture so habitual as to have become involuntarystole over his heart
at length assuming a singular air of authority pearl stretched out her hand with the small forefinger extended and pointing evidently towards her mothers breast
and beneath in the mirror of the brook there was the flowergirdled and sunny image of little pearl pointing her small forefinger too
thou strange child
why dost thou not come to me exclaimed hester
pearl still pointed with her forefinger and a frown gathered on her browthe more impressive from the childish the almost babylike aspect of the features that conveyed it
as her mother still kept beckoning to her and arraying her face in a holiday suit of unaccustomed smiles the child stamped her foot with a yet more imperious look and gesture
in the brook again was the fantastic beauty of the image with its reflected frown its pointed finger and imperious gesture giving emphasis to the aspect of little pearl
hasten pearl or i shall be angry with thee cried hester prynne who however inured to such behaviour on the elfchilds part at other seasons was naturally anxious for a more seemly deportment now
leap across the brook naughty child and run hither
else i must come to thee  but pearl not a whit startled at her mothers threats any more than mollified by her entreaties now suddenly burst into a fit of passion gesticulating violently and throwing her small figure into the most extravagant contortions
she accompanied this wild outbreak with piercing shrieks which the woods reverberated on all sides so that alone as she was in her childish and unreasonable wrath it seemed as if a hidden multitude were lending her their sympathy and encouragement
seen in the brook once more was the shadowy wrath of pearls image crowned and girdled with flowers but stamping its foot wildly gesticulating and in the midst of all still pointing its small forefinger at hesters bosom
i see what ails the child whispered hester to the clergyman and turning pale in spite of a strong effort to conceal her trouble and annoyance children will not abide any the slightest change in the accustomed aspect of things that are daily before their eyes
pearl misses something that she has always seen me wear  i pray you answered the minister if thou hast any means of pacifying the child do it forthwith
save it were the cankered wrath of an old witch like mistress hibbins added he attempting to smile i know nothing that i would not sooner encounter than this passion in a child
in pearls young beauty as in the wrinkled witch it has a preternatural effect
pacify her if thou lovest me  hester turned again towards pearl with a crimson blush upon her cheek a conscious glance aside at the clergyman and then a heavy sigh while even before she had time to speak the blush yielded to a deadly pallor
pearl said she sadly look down at thy feet
therebefore theeon the hither side of the brook  the child turned her eyes to the point indicated and there lay the scarlet letter so close upon the margin of the stream that the gold embroidery was reflected in it
bring it hither said hester
come thou and take it up answered pearl
was ever such a child observed hester aside to the minister
oh i have much to tell thee about her
but in very truth she is right as regards this hateful token
i must bear its torture yet a little longeronly a few days longeruntil we shall have left this region and look back hither as to a land which we have dreamed of
the forest cannot hide it
the midocean shall take it from my hand and swallow it up for ever  with these words she advanced to the margin of the brook took up the scarlet letter and fastened it again into her bosom
hopefully but a moment ago as hester had spoken of drowning it in the deep sea there was a sense of inevitable doom upon her as she thus received back this deadly symbol from the hand of fate
she had flung it into infinite space
she had drawn an hours free breath
and here again was the scarlet misery glittering on the old spot
so it ever is whether thus typified or no that an evil deed invests itself with the character of doom
hester next gathered up the heavy tresses of her hair and confined them beneath her cap
as if there were a withering spell in the sad letter her beauty the warmth and richness of her womanhood departed like fading sunshine and a gray shadow seemed to fall across her
when the dreary change was wrought she extended her hand to pearl
dost thou know thy mother now child asked she reproachfully but with a subdued tone
wilt thou come across the brook and own thy mother now that she has her shame upon hernow that she is sad  yes now i will answered the child bounding across the brook and clasping hester in her arms now thou art my mother indeed
and i am thy little pearl  in a mood of tenderness that was not usual with her she drew down her mothers head and kissed her brow and both her cheeks
but thenby a kind of necessity that always impelled this child to alloy whatever comfort she might chance to give with a throb of anguishpearl put up her mouth and kissed the scarlet letter too
that was not kind said hester
when thou hast shown me a little love thou mockest me  why doth the minister sit yonder asked pearl
he waits to welcome thee replied her mother
come thou and entreat his blessing
he loves thee my little pearl and loves thy mother too
wilt thou not love him
come he longs to greet thee  doth he love us said pearl looking up with acute intelligence into her mothers face
will he go back with us hand in hand we three together into the town  not now my child answered hester
but in days to come he will walk hand in hand with us
we will have a home and fireside of our own and thou shalt sit upon his knee and he will teach thee many things and love thee dearly
thou wilt love himwilt thou not  and will he always keep his hand over his heart inquired pearl
foolish child what a question is that exclaimed her mother
come and ask his blessing  but whether influenced by the jealousy that seems instinctive with every petted child towards a dangerous rival or from whatever caprice of her freakish nature pearl would show no favour to the clergyman
it was only by an exertion of force that her mother brought her up to him hanging back and manifesting her reluctance by odd grimaces of which ever since her babyhood she had possessed a singular variety and could transform her mobile physiognomy into a series of different aspects with a new mischief in them each and all
the ministerpainfully embarrassed but hoping that a kiss might prove a talisman to admit him into the childs kindlier regardsbent forward and impressed one on her brow
hereupon pearl broke away from her mother and running to the brook stooped over it and bathed her forehead until the unwelcome kiss was quite washed off and diffused through a long lapse of the gliding water
she then remained apart silently watching hester and the clergyman while they talked together and made such arrangements as were suggested by their new position and the purposes soon to be fulfilled
and now this fateful interview had come to a close
the dell was to be left in solitude among its dark old trees which with their multitudinous tongues would whisper long of what had passed there and no mortal be the wiser
and the melancholy brook would add this other tale to the mystery with which its little heart was already overburdened and whereof it still kept up a murmuring babble with not a whit more cheerfulness of tone than for ages heretofore
xx
the minister in a maze   as the minister departed in advance of hester prynne and little pearl he threw a backward glance half expecting that he should discover only some faintly traced features or outline of the mother and the child slowly fading into the twilight of the woods
so great a vicissitude in his life could not at once be received as real
but there was hester clad in her gray robe still standing beside the treetrunk which some blast had overthrown a long antiquity ago and which time had ever since been covering with moss so that these two fated ones with earths heaviest burden on them might there sit down together and find a single hours rest and solace
and there was pearl too lightly dancing from the margin of the brooknow that the intrusive third person was goneand taking her old place by her mothers side
so the minister had not fallen asleep and dreamed
in order to free his mind from this indistinctness and duplicity of impression which vexed it with a strange disquietude he recalled and more thoroughly defined the plans which hester and himself had sketched for their departure
it had been determined between them that the old world with its crowds and cities offered them a more eligible shelter and concealment than the wilds of new england or all america with its alternatives of an indian wigwam or the few settlements of europeans scattered thinly along the seaboard
not to speak of the clergymans health so inadequate to sustain the hardships of a forest life his native gifts his culture and his entire development would secure him a home only in the midst of civilization and refinement the higher the state the more delicately adapted to it the man
in furtherance of this choice it so happened that a ship lay in the harbour one of those unquestionable cruisers frequent at that day which without being absolutely outlaws of the deep yet roamed over its surface with a remarkable irresponsibility of character
this vessel had recently arrived from the spanish main and within three days time would sail for bristol
hester prynnewhose vocation as a selfenlisted sister of charity had brought her acquainted with the captain and crewcould take upon herself to secure the passage of two individuals and a child with all the secrecy which circumstances rendered more than desirable
the minister had inquired of hester with no little interest the precise time at which the vessel might be expected to depart
it would probably be on the fourth day from the present
this is most fortunate he had then said to himself
now why the reverend mr dimmesdale considered it so very fortunate we hesitate to reveal
neverthelessto hold nothing back from the readerit was because on the third day from the present he was to preach the election sermon and as such an occasion formed an honourable epoch in the life of a new england clergyman he could not have chanced upon a more suitable mode and time of terminating his professional career
at least they shall say of me thought this exemplary man that i leave no public duty unperformed or illperformed sad indeed that an introspection so profound and acute as this poor ministers should be so miserably deceived
we have had and may still have worse things to tell of him but none we apprehend so pitiably weak no evidence at once so slight and irrefragable of a subtle disease that had long since begun to eat into the real substance of his character
no man for any considerable period can wear one face to himself and another to the multitude without finally getting bewildered as to which may be the true
the excitement of mr dimmesdales feelings as he returned from his interview with hester lent him unaccustomed physical energy and hurried him townward at a rapid pace
the pathway among the woods seemed wilder more uncouth with its rude natural obstacles and less trodden by the foot of man than he remembered it on his outward journey
but he leaped across the plashy places thrust himself through the clinging underbrush climbed the ascent plunged into the hollow and overcame in short all the difficulties of the track with an unweariable activity that astonished him
he could not but recall how feebly and with what frequent pauses for breath he had toiled over the same ground only two days before
as he drew near the town he took an impression of change from the series of familiar objects that presented themselves
it seemed not yesterday not one not two but many days or even years ago since he had quitted them
there indeed was each former trace of the street as he remembered it and all the peculiarities of the houses with the due multitude of gablepeaks and a weathercock at every point where his memory suggested one
not the less however came this importunately obtrusive sense of change
the same was true as regarded the acquaintances whom he met and all the wellknown shapes of human life about the little town
they looked neither older nor younger now the beards of the aged were no whiter nor could the creeping babe of yesterday walk on his feet today it was impossible to describe in what respect they differed from the individuals on whom he had so recently bestowed a parting glance and yet the ministers deepest sense seemed to inform him of their mutability
a similar impression struck him most remarkably as he passed under the walls of his own church
the edifice had so very strange and yet so familiar an aspect that mr dimmesdales mind vibrated between two ideas either that he had seen it only in a dream hitherto or that he was merely dreaming about it now
this phenomenon in the various shapes which it assumed indicated no external change but so sudden and important a change in the spectator of the familiar scene that the intervening space of a single day had operated on his consciousness like the lapse of years
the ministers own will and hesters will and the fate that grew between them had wrought this transformation
it was the same town as heretofore but the same minister returned not from the forest
he might have said to the friends who greeted himi am not the man for whom you take me
i left him yonder in the forest withdrawn into a secret dell by a mossy tree trunk and near a melancholy brook
go seek your minister and see if his emaciated figure his thin cheek his white heavy painwrinkled brow be not flung down there like a castoff garment his friends no doubt would still have insisted with himthou art thyself the man but the error would have been their own not his
before mr dimmesdale reached home his inner man gave him other evidences of a revolution in the sphere of thought and feeling
in truth nothing short of a total change of dynasty and moral code in that interior kingdom was adequate to account for the impulses now communicated to the unfortunate and startled minister
at every step he was incited to do some strange wild wicked thing or other with a sense that it would be at once involuntary and intentional in spite of himself yet growing out of a profounder self than that which opposed the impulse
for instance he met one of his own deacons
the good old man addressed him with the paternal affection and patriarchal privilege which his venerable age his upright and holy character and his station in the church entitled him to use and conjoined with this the deep almost worshipping respect which the ministers professional and private claims alike demanded
never was there a more beautiful example of how the majesty of age and wisdom may comport with the obeisance and respect enjoined upon it as from a lower social rank and inferior order of endowment towards a higher
now during a conversation of some two or three moments between the reverend mr dimmesdale and this excellent and hoarybearded deacon it was only by the most careful selfcontrol that the former could refrain from uttering certain blasphemous suggestions that rose into his mind respecting the communionsupper
he absolutely trembled and turned pale as ashes lest his tongue should wag itself in utterance of these horrible matters and plead his own consent for so doing without his having fairly given it
and even with this terror in his heart he could hardly avoid laughing to imagine how the sanctified old patriarchal deacon would have been petrified by his ministers impiety
again another incident of the same nature
hurrying along the street the reverend mr dimmesdale encountered the eldest female member of his church a most pious and exemplary old dame poor widowed lonely and with a heart as full of reminiscences about her dead husband and children and her dead friends of long ago as a burialground is full of storied gravestones
yet all this which would else have been such heavy sorrow was made almost a solemn joy to her devout old soul by religious consolations and the truths of scripture wherewith she had fed herself continually for more than thirty years
and since mr dimmesdale had taken her in charge the good grandams chief earthly comfortwhich unless it had been likewise a heavenly comfort could have been none at allwas to meet her pastor whether casually or of set purpose and be refreshed with a word of warm fragrant heavenbreathing gospel truth from his beloved lips into her dulled but rapturously attentive ear
but on this occasion up to the moment of putting his lips to the old womans ear mr dimmesdale as the great enemy of souls would have it could recall no text of scripture nor aught else except a brief pithy and as it then appeared to him unanswerable argument against the immortality of the human soul
the instilment thereof into her mind would probably have caused this aged sister to drop down dead at once as by the effect of an intensely poisonous infusion
what he really did whisper the minister could never afterwards recollect
there was perhaps a fortunate disorder in his utterance which failed to impart any distinct idea to the good widows comprehension or which providence interpreted after a method of its own
assuredly as the minister looked back he beheld an expression of divine gratitude and ecstasy that seemed like the shine of the celestial city on her face so wrinkled and ashy pale
again a third instance
after parting from the old church member he met the youngest sister of them all
it was a maiden newlywonand won by the reverend mr dimmesdales own sermon on the sabbath after his vigilto barter the transitory pleasures of the world for the heavenly hope that was to assume brighter substance as life grew dark around her and which would gild the utter gloom with final glory
she was fair and pure as a lily that had bloomed in paradise
the minister knew well that he was himself enshrined within the stainless sanctity of her heart which hung its snowy curtains about his image imparting to religion the warmth of love and to love a religious purity
satan that afternoon had surely led the poor young girl away from her mothers side and thrown her into the pathway of this sorely tempted orshall we not rather saythis lost and desperate man
as she drew nigh the archfiend whispered him to condense into small compass and drop into her tender bosom a germ of evil that would be sure to blossom darkly soon and bear black fruit betimes
such was his sense of power over this virgin soul trusting him as she did that the minister felt potent to blight all the field of innocence with but one wicked look and develop all its opposite with but a word
sowith a mightier struggle than he had yet sustainedhe held his geneva cloak before his face and hurried onward making no sign of recognition and leaving the young sister to digest his rudeness as she might
she ransacked her consciencewhich was full of harmless little matters like her pocket or her workbagand took herself to task poor thing
for a thousand imaginary faults and went about her household duties with swollen eyelids the next morning
before the minister had time to celebrate his victory over this last temptation he was conscious of another impulse more ludicrous and almost as horrible
it waswe blush to tell itit was to stop short in the road and teach some very wicked words to a knot of little puritan children who were playing there and had but just begun to talk
denying himself this freak as unworthy of his cloth he met a drunken seaman one of the ships crew from the spanish main
and here since he had so valiantly forborne all other wickedness poor mr dimmesdale longed at least to shake hands with the tarry blackguard and recreate himself with a few improper jests such as dissolute sailors so abound with and a volley of good round solid satisfactory and heavendefying oaths
it was not so much a better principle as partly his natural good taste and still more his buckramed habit of clerical decorum that carried him safely through the latter crisis
what is it that haunts and tempts me thus cried the minister to himself at length pausing in the street and striking his hand against his forehead
am i mad
or am i given over utterly to the fiend
did i make a contract with him in the forest and sign it with my blood
and does he now summon me to its fulfilment by suggesting the performance of every wickedness which his most foul imagination can conceive  at the moment when the reverend mr dimmesdale thus communed with himself and struck his forehead with his hand old mistress hibbins the reputed witchlady is said to have been passing by
she made a very grand appearance having on a high headdress a rich gown of velvet and a ruff done up with the famous yellow starch of which anne turner her especial friend had taught her the secret before this last good lady had been hanged for sir thomas overburys murder
whether the witch had read the ministers thoughts or no she came to a full stop looked shrewdly into his face smiled craftily andthough little given to converse with clergymenbegan a conversation
so reverend sir you have made a visit into the forest observed the witchlady nodding her high headdress at him
the next time i pray you to allow me only a fair warning and i shall be proud to bear you company
without taking overmuch upon myself my good word will go far towards gaining any strange gentleman a fair reception from yonder potentate you wot of  i profess madam answered the clergyman with a grave obeisance such as the ladys rank demanded and his own good breeding made imperativei profess on my conscience and character that i am utterly bewildered as touching the purport of your words
i went not into the forest to seek a potentate neither do i at any future time design a visit thither with a view to gaining the favour of such personage
my one sufficient object was to greet that pious friend of mine the apostle eliot and rejoice with him over the many precious souls he hath won from heathendom  ha ha ha cackled the old witchlady still nodding her high headdress at the minister
well well
we must needs talk thus in the daytime
you carry it off like an old hand
but at midnight and in the forest we shall have other talk together  she passed on with her aged stateliness but often turning back her head and smiling at him like one willing to recognise a secret intimacy of connexion
have i then sold myself thought the minister to the fiend whom if men say true this yellowstarched and velveted old hag has chosen for her prince and master  the wretched minister
he had made a bargain very like it
tempted by a dream of happiness he had yielded himself with deliberate choice as he had never done before to what he knew was deadly sin
and the infectious poison of that sin had been thus rapidly diffused throughout his moral system
it had stupefied all blessed impulses and awakened into vivid life the whole brotherhood of bad ones
scorn bitterness unprovoked malignity gratuitous desire of ill ridicule of whatever was good and holy all awoke to tempt even while they frightened him
and his encounter with old mistress hibbins if it were a real incident did but show its sympathy and fellowship with wicked mortals and the world of perverted spirits
he had by this time reached his dwelling on the edge of the burialground and hastening up the stairs took refuge in his study
the minister was glad to have reached this shelter without first betraying himself to the world by any of those strange and wicked eccentricities to which he had been continually impelled while passing through the streets
he entered the accustomed room and looked around him on its books its windows its fireplace and the tapestried comfort of the walls with the same perception of strangeness that had haunted him throughout his walk from the forest dell into the town and thitherward
here he had studied and written here gone through fast and vigil and come forth half alive here striven to pray here borne a hundred thousand agonies
there was the bible in its rich old hebrew with moses and the prophets speaking to him and gods voice through all
there on the table with the inky pen beside it was an unfinished sermon with a sentence broken in the midst where his thoughts had ceased to gush out upon the page two days before
he knew that it was himself the thin and whitecheeked minister who had done and suffered these things and written thus far into the election sermon
but he seemed to stand apart and eye this former self with scornful pitying but halfenvious curiosity
that self was gone
another man had returned out of the foresta wiser onewith a knowledge of hidden mysteries which the simplicity of the former never could have reached
a bitter kind of knowledge that
while occupied with these reflections a knock came at the door of the study and the minister said come innot wholly devoid of an idea that he might behold an evil spirit
and so he did
it was old roger chillingworth that entered
the minister stood white and speechless with one hand on the hebrew scriptures and the other spread upon his breast
welcome home reverend sir said the physician
and how found you that godly man the apostle eliot
but methinks dear sir you look pale as if the travel through the wilderness had been too sore for you
will not my aid be requisite to put you in heart and strength to preach your election sermon  nay i think not so rejoined the reverend mr dimmesdale
my journey and the sight of the holy apostle yonder and the free air which i have breathed have done me good after so long confinement in my study
i think to need no more of your drugs my kind physician good though they be and administered by a friendly hand  all this time roger chillingworth was looking at the minister with the grave and intent regard of a physician towards his patient
but in spite of this outward show the latter was almost convinced of the old mans knowledge or at least his confident suspicion with respect to his own interview with hester prynne
the physician knew then that in the ministers regard he was no longer a trusted friend but his bitterest enemy
so much being known it would appear natural that a part of it should be expressed
it is singular however how long a time often passes before words embody things and with what security two persons who choose to avoid a certain subject may approach its very verge and retire without disturbing it
thus the minister felt no apprehension that roger chillingworth would touch in express words upon the real position which they sustained towards one another
yet did the physician in his dark way creep frightfully near the secret
were it not better said he that you use my poor skill tonight
verily dear sir we must take pains to make you strong and vigorous for this occasion of the election discourse
the people look for great things from you apprehending that another year may come about and find their pastor gone  yes to another world replied the minister with pious resignation
heaven grant it be a better one for in good sooth i hardly think to tarry with my flock through the flitting seasons of another year
but touching your medicine kind sir in my present frame of body i need it not  i joy to hear it answered the physician
it may be that my remedies so long administered in vain begin now to take due effect
happy man were i and well deserving of new englands gratitude could i achieve this cure  i thank you from my heart most watchful friend said the reverend mr dimmesdale with a solemn smile
i thank you and can but requite your good deeds with my prayers  a good mans prayers are golden recompense rejoined old roger chillingworth as he took his leave
yea they are the current gold coin of the new jerusalem with the kings own mint mark on them  left alone the minister summoned a servant of the house and requested food which being set before him he ate with ravenous appetite
then flinging the already written pages of the election sermon into the fire he forthwith began another which he wrote with such an impulsive flow of thought and emotion that he fancied himself inspired and only wondered that heaven should see fit to transmit the grand and solemn music of its oracles through so foul an organ pipe as he
however leaving that mystery to solve itself or go unsolved for ever he drove his task onward with earnest haste and ecstasy
thus the night fled away as if it were a winged steed and he careering on it morning came and peeped blushing through the curtains and at last sunrise threw a golden beam into the study and laid it right across the ministers bedazzled eyes
there he was with the pen still between his fingers and a vast immeasurable tract of written space behind him
xxi
the new england holiday   betimes in the morning of the day on which the new governor was to receive his office at the hands of the people hester prynne and little pearl came into the marketplace
it was already thronged with the craftsmen and other plebeian inhabitants of the town in considerable numbers among whom likewise were many rough figures whose attire of deerskins marked them as belonging to some of the forest settlements which surrounded the little metropolis of the colony
on this public holiday as on all other occasions for seven years past hester was clad in a garment of coarse gray cloth
not more by its hue than by some indescribable peculiarity in its fashion it had the effect of making her fade personally out of sight and outline while again the scarlet letter brought her back from this twilight indistinctness and revealed her under the moral aspect of its own illumination
her face so long familiar to the townspeople showed the marble quietude which they were accustomed to behold there
it was like a mask or rather like the frozen calmness of a dead womans features owing this dreary resemblance to the fact that hester was actually dead in respect to any claim of sympathy and had departed out of the world with which she still seemed to mingle
it might be on this one day that there was an expression unseen before nor indeed vivid enough to be detected now unless some preternaturally gifted observer should have first read the heart and have afterwards sought a corresponding development in the countenance and mien
such a spiritual seer might have conceived that after sustaining the gaze of the multitude through several miserable years as a necessity a penance and something which it was a stern religion to endure she now for one last time more encountered it freely and voluntarily in order to convert what had so long been agony into a kind of triumph
look your last on the scarlet letter and its wearerthe peoples victim and lifelong bondslave as they fancied her might say to them
yet a little while and she will be beyond your reach
a few hours longer and the deep mysterious ocean will quench and hide for ever the symbol which ye have caused to burn on her bosom nor were it an inconsistency too improbable to be assigned to human nature should we suppose a feeling of regret in hesters mind at the moment when she was about to win her freedom from the pain which had been thus deeply incorporated with her being
might there not be an irresistible desire to quaff a last long breathless draught of the cup of wormwood and aloes with which nearly all her years of womanhood had been perpetually flavoured
the wine of life henceforth to be presented to her lips must be indeed rich delicious and exhilarating in its chased and golden beaker or else leave an inevitable and weary languor after the lees of bitterness wherewith she had been drugged as with a cordial of intensest potency
pearl was decked out with airy gaiety
it would have been impossible to guess that this bright and sunny apparition owed its existence to the shape of gloomy gray or that a fancy at once so gorgeous and so delicate as must have been requisite to contrive the childs apparel was the same that had achieved a task perhaps more difficult in imparting so distinct a peculiarity to hesters simple robe
the dress so proper was it to little pearl seemed an effluence or inevitable development and outward manifestation of her character no more to be separated from her than the manyhued brilliancy from a butterflys wing or the painted glory from the leaf of a bright flower
as with these so with the child her garb was all of one idea with her nature
on this eventful day moreover there was a certain singular inquietude and excitement in her mood resembling nothing so much as the shimmer of a diamond that sparkles and flashes with the varied throbbings of the breast on which it is displayed
children have always a sympathy in the agitations of those connected with them always especially a sense of any trouble or impending revolution of whatever kind in domestic circumstances and therefore pearl who was the gem on her mothers unquiet bosom betrayed by the very dance of her spirits the emotions which none could detect in the marble passiveness of hesters brow
this effervescence made her flit with a birdlike movement rather than walk by her mothers side
she broke continually into shouts of a wild inarticulate and sometimes piercing music
when they reached the marketplace she became still more restless on perceiving the stir and bustle that enlivened the spot for it was usually more like the broad and lonesome green before a village meetinghouse than the centre of a towns business
why what is this mother cried she
wherefore have all the people left their work today
is it a playday for the whole world
see there is the blacksmith
he has washed his sooty face and put on his sabbathday clothes and looks as if he would gladly be merry if any kind body would only teach him how
and there is master brackett the old jailer nodding and smiling at me
why does he do so mother  he remembers thee a little babe my child answered hester
he should not nod and smile at me for all thatthe black grim uglyeyed old man said pearl
he may nod at thee if he will for thou art clad in gray and wearest the scarlet letter
but see mother how many faces of strange people and indians among them and sailors
what have they all come to do here in the marketplace  they wait to see the procession pass said hester
for the governor and the magistrates are to go by and the ministers and all the great people and good people with the music and the soldiers marching before them  and will the minister be there asked pearl
and will he hold out both his hands to me as when thou ledst me to him from the brookside  he will be there child answered her mother but he will not greet thee today nor must thou greet him  what a strange sad man is he said the child as if speaking partly to herself
in the dark nighttime he calls us to him and holds thy hand and mine as when we stood with him on the scaffold yonder
and in the deep forest where only the old trees can hear and the strip of sky see it he talks with thee sitting on a heap of moss
and he kisses my forehead too so that the little brook would hardly wash it off
but here in the sunny day and among all the people he knows us not nor must we know him
a strange sad man is he with his hand always over his heart  be quiet pearlthou understandest not these things said her mother
think not now of the minister but look about thee and see how cheery is everybodys face today
the children have come from their schools and the grown people from their workshops and their fields on purpose to be happy for today a new man is beginning to rule over them and soas has been the custom of mankind ever since a nation was first gatheredthey make merry and rejoice as if a good and golden year were at length to pass over the poor old world  it was as hester said in regard to the unwonted jollity that brightened the faces of the people
into this festal season of the yearas it already was and continued to be during the greater part of two centuriesthe puritans compressed whatever mirth and public joy they deemed allowable to human infirmity thereby so far dispelling the customary cloud that for the space of a single holiday they appeared scarcely more grave than most other communities at a period of general affliction
but we perhaps exaggerate the gray or sable tinge which undoubtedly characterized the mood and manners of the age
the persons now in the marketplace of boston had not been born to an inheritance of puritanic gloom
they were native englishmen whose fathers had lived in the sunny richness of the elizabethan epoch a time when the life of england viewed as one great mass would appear to have been as stately magnificent and joyous as the world has ever witnessed
had they followed their hereditary taste the new england settlers would have illustrated all events of public importance by bonfires banquets pageantries and processions
nor would it have been impracticable in the observance of majestic ceremonies to combine mirthful recreation with solemnity and give as it were a grotesque and brilliant embroidery to the great robe of state which a nation at such festivals puts on
there was some shadow of an attempt of this kind in the mode of celebrating the day on which the political year of the colony commenced
the dim reflection of a remembered splendour a colourless and manifold diluted repetition of what they had beheld in proud old londonwe will not say at a royal coronation but at a lord mayors showmight be traced in the customs which our forefathers instituted with reference to the annual installation of magistrates
the fathers and founders of the commonwealththe statesman the priest and the soldierseemed it a duty then to assume the outward state and majesty which in accordance with antique style was looked upon as the proper garb of public and social eminence
all came forth to move in procession before the peoples eye and thus impart a needed dignity to the simple framework of a government so newly constructed
then too the people were countenanced if not encouraged in relaxing the severe and close application to their various modes of rugged industry which at all other times seemed of the same piece and material with their religion
here it is true were none of the appliances which popular merriment would so readily have found in the england of elizabeths time or that of jamesno rude shows of a theatrical kind no minstrel with his harp and legendary ballad nor gleeman with an ape dancing to his music no juggler with his tricks of mimic witchcraft no merry andrew to stir up the multitude with jests perhaps a hundred years old but still effective by their appeals to the very broadest sources of mirthful sympathy
all such professors of the several branches of jocularity would have been sternly repressed not only by the rigid discipline of law but by the general sentiment which give law its vitality
not the less however the great honest face of the people smiledgrimly perhaps but widely too
nor were sports wanting such as the colonists had witnessed and shared in long ago at the country fairs and on the villagegreens of england and which it was thought well to keep alive on this new soil for the sake of the courage and manliness that were essential in them
wrestling matches in the different fashions of cornwall and devonshire were seen here and there about the marketplace in one corner there was a friendly bout at quarterstaff andwhat attracted most interest of allon the platform of the pillory already so noted in our pages two masters of defence were commencing an exhibition with the buckler and broadsword
but much to the disappointment of the crowd this latter business was broken off by the interposition of the town beadle who had no idea of permitting the majesty of the law to be violated by such an abuse of one of its consecrated places
it may not be too much to affirm on the whole the people being then in the first stages of joyless deportment and the offspring of sires who had known how to be merry in their day that they would compare favourably in point of holiday keeping with their descendants even at so long an interval as ourselves
their immediate posterity the generation next to the early emigrants wore the blackest shade of puritanism and so darkened the national visage with it that all the subsequent years have not sufficed to clear it up
we have yet to learn again the forgotten art of gaiety
the picture of human life in the marketplace though its general tint was the sad gray brown or black of the english emigrants was yet enlivened by some diversity of hue
a party of indiansin their savage finery of curiously embroidered deerskin robes wampumbelts red and yellow ochre and feathers and armed with the bow and arrow and stoneheaded spearstood apart with countenances of inflexible gravity beyond what even the puritan aspect could attain
nor wild as were these painted barbarians were they the wildest feature of the scene
this distinction could more justly be claimed by some marinersa part of the crew of the vessel from the spanish mainwho had come ashore to see the humours of election day
they were roughlooking desperadoes with sunblackened faces and an immensity of beard their wide short trousers were confined about the waist by belts often clasped with a rough plate of gold and sustaining always a long knife and in some instances a sword
from beneath their broadbrimmed hats of palmleaf gleamed eyes which even in goodnature and merriment had a kind of animal ferocity
they transgressed without fear or scruple the rules of behaviour that were binding on all others smoking tobacco under the beadles very nose although each whiff would have cost a townsman a shilling and quaffing at their pleasure draughts of wine or aquavit from pocket flasks which they freely tendered to the gaping crowd around them
it remarkably characterised the incomplete morality of the age rigid as we call it that a licence was allowed the seafaring class not merely for their freaks on shore but for far more desperate deeds on their proper element
the sailor of that day would go near to be arraigned as a pirate in our own
there could be little doubt for instance that this very ships crew though no unfavourable specimens of the nautical brotherhood had been guilty as we should phrase it of depredations on the spanish commerce such as would have perilled all their necks in a modern court of justice
but the sea in those old times heaved swelled and foamed very much at its own will or subject only to the tempestuous wind with hardly any attempts at regulation by human law
the buccaneer on the wave might relinquish his calling and become at once if he chose a man of probity and piety on land nor even in the full career of his reckless life was he regarded as a personage with whom it was disreputable to traffic or casually associate
thus the puritan elders in their black cloaks starched bands and steeplecrowned hats smiled not unbenignantly at the clamour and rude deportment of these jolly seafaring men and it excited neither surprise nor animadversion when so reputable a citizen as old roger chillingworth the physician was seen to enter the marketplace in close and familiar talk with the commander of the questionable vessel
the latter was by far the most showy and gallant figure so far as apparel went anywhere to be seen among the multitude
he wore a profusion of ribbons on his garment and gold lace on his hat which was also encircled by a gold chain and surmounted with a feather
there was a sword at his side and a swordcut on his forehead which by the arrangement of his hair he seemed anxious rather to display than hide
a landsman could hardly have worn this garb and shown this face and worn and shown them both with such a galliard air without undergoing stern question before a magistrate and probably incurring a fine or imprisonment or perhaps an exhibition in the stocks
as regarded the shipmaster however all was looked upon as pertaining to the character as to a fish his glistening scales
after parting from the physician the commander of the bristol ship strolled idly through the marketplace until happening to approach the spot where hester prynne was standing he appeared to recognise and did not hesitate to address her
as was usually the case wherever hester stood a small vacant areaa sort of magic circlehad formed itself about her into which though the people were elbowing one another at a little distance none ventured or felt disposed to intrude
it was a forcible type of the moral solitude in which the scarlet letter enveloped its fated wearer partly by her own reserve and partly by the instinctive though no longer so unkindly withdrawal of her fellowcreatures
now if never before it answered a good purpose by enabling hester and the seaman to speak together without risk of being overheard and so changed was hester prynnes repute before the public that the matron in town most eminent for rigid morality could not have held such intercourse with less result of scandal than herself
so mistress said the mariner i must bid the steward make ready one more berth than you bargained for
no fear of scurvy or ship fever this voyage
what with the ships surgeon and this other doctor our only danger will be from drug or pill more by token as there is a lot of apothecarys stuff aboard which i traded for with a spanish vessel  what mean you inquired hester startled more than she permitted to appear
have you another passenger  why know you not cried the shipmaster that this physician herechillingworth he calls himselfis minded to try my cabinfare with you
ay ay you must have known it for he tells me he is of your party and a close friend to the gentleman you spoke ofhe that is in peril from these sour old puritan rulers  they know each other well indeed replied hester with a mien of calmness though in the utmost consternation
they have long dwelt together  nothing further passed between the mariner and hester prynne
but at that instant she beheld old roger chillingworth himself standing in the remotest corner of the marketplace and smiling on her a smile whichacross the wide and bustling square and through all the talk and laughter and various thoughts moods and interests of the crowdconveyed secret and fearful meaning
xxii
the procession   before hester prynne could call together her thoughts and consider what was practicable to be done in this new and startling aspect of affairs the sound of military music was heard approaching along a contiguous street
it denoted the advance of the procession of magistrates and citizens on its way towards the meetinghouse where in compliance with a custom thus early established and ever since observed the reverend mr dimmesdale was to deliver an election sermon
soon the head of the procession showed itself with a slow and stately march turning a corner and making its way across the marketplace
first came the music
it comprised a variety of instruments perhaps imperfectly adapted to one another and played with no great skill but yet attaining the great object for which the harmony of drum and clarion addresses itself to the multitudethat of imparting a higher and more heroic air to the scene of life that passes before the eye
little pearl at first clapped her hands but then lost for an instant the restless agitation that had kept her in a continual effervescence throughout the morning she gazed silently and seemed to be borne upward like a floating seabird on the long heaves and swells of sound
but she was brought back to her former mood by the shimmer of the sunshine on the weapons and bright armour of the military company which followed after the music and formed the honorary escort of the procession
this body of soldierywhich still sustains a corporate existence and marches down from past ages with an ancient and honourable famewas composed of no mercenary materials
its ranks were filled with gentlemen who felt the stirrings of martial impulse and sought to establish a kind of college of arms where as in an association of knights templars they might learn the science and so far as peaceful exercise would teach them the practices of war
the high estimation then placed upon the military character might be seen in the lofty port of each individual member of the company
some of them indeed by their services in the low countries and on other fields of european warfare had fairly won their title to assume the name and pomp of soldiership
the entire array moreover clad in burnished steel and with plumage nodding over their bright morions had a brilliancy of effect which no modern display can aspire to equal
and yet the men of civil eminence who came immediately behind the military escort were better worth a thoughtful observers eye
even in outward demeanour they showed a stamp of majesty that made the warriors haughty stride look vulgar if not absurd
it was an age when what we call talent had far less consideration than now but the massive materials which produce stability and dignity of character a great deal more
the people possessed by hereditary right the quality of reverence which in their descendants if it survive at all exists in smaller proportion and with a vastly diminished force in the selection and estimate of public men
the change may be for good or ill and is partly perhaps for both
in that old day the english settler on these rude shoreshaving left king nobles and all degrees of awful rank behind while still the faculty and necessity of reverence was strong in himbestowed it on the white hair and venerable brow of ageon longtried integrityon solid wisdom and sadcoloured experienceon endowments of that grave and weighty order which gave the idea of permanence and comes under the general definition of respectability
these primitive statesmen thereforebradstreet endicott dudley bellingham and their compeerswho were elevated to power by the early choice of the people seem to have been not often brilliant but distinguished by a ponderous sobriety rather than activity of intellect
they had fortitude and selfreliance and in time of difficulty or peril stood up for the welfare of the state like a line of cliffs against a tempestuous tide
the traits of character here indicated were well represented in the square cast of countenance and large physical development of the new colonial magistrates
so far as a demeanour of natural authority was concerned the mother country need not have been ashamed to see these foremost men of an actual democracy adopted into the house of peers or make the privy council of the sovereign
next in order to the magistrates came the young and eminently distinguished divine from whose lips the religious discourse of the anniversary was expected
his was the profession at that era in which intellectual ability displayed itself far more than in political life forleaving a higher motive out of the questionit offered inducements powerful enough in the almost worshipping respect of the community to win the most aspiring ambition into its service
even political poweras in the case of increase matherwas within the grasp of a successful priest
it was the observation of those who beheld him now that never since mr dimmesdale first set his foot on the new england shore had he exhibited such energy as was seen in the gait and air with which he kept his pace in the procession
there was no feebleness of step as at other times his frame was not bent nor did his hand rest ominously upon his heart
yet if the clergyman were rightly viewed his strength seemed not of the body
it might be spiritual and imparted to him by angelical ministrations
it might be the exhilaration of that potent cordial which is distilled only in the furnaceglow of earnest and longcontinued thought
or perchance his sensitive temperament was invigorated by the loud and piercing music that swelled heavenward and uplifted him on its ascending wave
nevertheless so abstracted was his look it might be questioned whether mr dimmesdale even heard the music
there was his body moving onward and with an unaccustomed force
but where was his mind
far and deep in its own region busying itself with preternatural activity to marshal a procession of stately thoughts that were soon to issue thence and so he saw nothing heard nothing knew nothing of what was around him but the spiritual element took up the feeble frame and carried it along unconscious of the burden and converting it to spirit like itself
men of uncommon intellect who have grown morbid possess this occasional power of mighty effort into which they throw the life of many days and then are lifeless for as many more
hester prynne gazing steadfastly at the clergyman felt a dreary influence come over her but wherefore or whence she knew not unless that he seemed so remote from her own sphere and utterly beyond her reach
one glance of recognition she had imagined must needs pass between them
she thought of the dim forest with its little dell of solitude and love and anguish and the mossy treetrunk where sitting handinhand they had mingled their sad and passionate talk with the melancholy murmur of the brook
how deeply had they known each other then
and was this the man
she hardly knew him now
he moving proudly past enveloped as it were in the rich music with the procession of majestic and venerable fathers he so unattainable in his worldly position and still more so in that far vista of his unsympathizing thoughts through which she now beheld him
her spirit sank with the idea that all must have been a delusion and that vividly as she had dreamed it there could be no real bond betwixt the clergyman and herself
and thus much of woman was there in hester that she could scarcely forgive himleast of all now when the heavy footstep of their approaching fate might be heard nearer nearer nearerfor being able so completely to withdraw himself from their mutual worldwhile she groped darkly and stretched forth her cold hands and found him not
pearl either saw and responded to her mothers feelings or herself felt the remoteness and intangibility that had fallen around the minister
while the procession passed the child was uneasy fluttering up and down like a bird on the point of taking flight
when the whole had gone by she looked up into hesters face  mother said she was that the same minister that kissed me by the brook  hold thy peace dear little pearl whispered her mother
we must not always talk in the marketplace of what happens to us in the forest  i could not be sure that it was heso strange he looked continued the child
else i would have run to him and bid him kiss me now before all the people even as he did yonder among the dark old trees
what would the minister have said mother
would he have clapped his hand over his heart and scowled on me and bid me begone  what should he say pearl answered hester save that it was no time to kiss and that kisses are not to be given in the marketplace
well for thee foolish child that thou didst not speak to him  another shade of the same sentiment in reference to mr dimmesdale was expressed by a person whose eccentricitiesinsanity as we should term itled her to do what few of the townspeople would have ventured onto begin a conversation with the wearer of the scarlet letter in public
it was mistress hibbins who arrayed in great magnificence with a triple ruff a broidered stomacher a gown of rich velvet and a goldheaded cane had come forth to see the procession
as this ancient lady had the renown which subsequently cost her no less a price than her life of being a principal actor in all the works of necromancy that were continually going forward the crowd gave way before her and seemed to fear the touch of her garment as if it carried the plague among its gorgeous folds
seen in conjunction with hester prynnekindly as so many now felt towards the latterthe dread inspired by mistress hibbins had doubled and caused a general movement from that part of the marketplace in which the two women stood
now what mortal imagination could conceive it whispered the old lady confidentially to hester
yonder divine man
that saint on earth as the people uphold him to be and asi must needs sayhe really looks
who now that saw him pass in the procession would think how little while it is since he went forth out of his studychewing a hebrew text of scripture in his mouth i warrantto take an airing in the forest
aha
we know what that means hester prynne
but truly forsooth i find it hard to believe him the same man
many a church member saw i walking behind the music that has danced in the same measure with me when somebody was fiddler and it might be an indian powwow or a lapland wizard changing hands with us
that is but a trifle when a woman knows the world
but this minister
couldst thou surely tell hester whether he was the same man that encountered thee on the forest path  madam i know not of what you speak answered hester prynne feeling mistress hibbins to be of infirm mind yet strangely startled and awestricken by the confidence with which she affirmed a personal connexion between so many persons herself among them and the evil one
it is not for me to talk lightly of a learned and pious minister of the word like the reverend mr dimmesdale  fie womanfie cried the old lady shaking her finger at hester
dost thou think i have been to the forest so many times and have yet no skill to judge who else has been there
yea though no leaf of the wild garlands which they wore while they danced be left in their hair
i know thee hester for i behold the token
we may all see it in the sunshine
and it glows like a red flame in the dark
thou wearest it openly so there need be no question about that
but this minister
let me tell thee in thine ear
when the black man sees one of his own servants signed and sealed so shy of owning to the bond as is the reverend mr dimmesdale he hath a way of ordering matters so that the mark shall be disclosed in open daylight to the eyes of all the world
what is that the minister seeks to hide with his hand always over his heart
ha hester prynne  what is it good mistress hibbins eagerly asked little pearl
hast thou seen it  no matter darling responded mistress hibbins making pearl a profound reverence
thou thyself wilt see it one time or another
they say child thou art of the lineage of the prince of air
wilt thou ride with me some fine night to see thy father
then thou shalt know wherefore the minister keeps his hand over his heart  laughing so shrilly that all the marketplace could hear her the weird old gentlewoman took her departure
by this time the preliminary prayer had been offered in the meetinghouse and the accents of the reverend mr dimmesdale were heard commencing his discourse
an irresistible feeling kept hester near the spot
as the sacred edifice was too much thronged to admit another auditor she took up her position close beside the scaffold of the pillory
it was in sufficient proximity to bring the whole sermon to her ears in the shape of an indistinct but varied murmur and flow of the ministers very peculiar voice
this vocal organ was in itself a rich endowment insomuch that a listener comprehending nothing of the language in which the preacher spoke might still have been swayed to and fro by the mere tone and cadence
like all other music it breathed passion and pathos and emotions high or tender in a tongue native to the human heart wherever educated
muffled as the sound was by its passage through the church walls hester prynne listened with such intenseness and sympathized so intimately that the sermon had throughout a meaning for her entirely apart from its indistinguishable words
these perhaps if more distinctly heard might have been only a grosser medium and have clogged the spiritual sense
now she caught the low undertone as of the wind sinking down to repose itself then ascended with it as it rose through progressive gradations of sweetness and power until its volume seemed to envelop her with an atmosphere of awe and solemn grandeur
and yet majestic as the voice sometimes became there was for ever in it an essential character of plaintiveness
a loud or low expression of anguishthe whisper or the shriek as it might be conceived of suffering humanity that touched a sensibility in every bosom
at times this deep strain of pathos was all that could be heard and scarcely heard sighing amid a desolate silence
but even when the ministers voice grew high and commandingwhen it gushed irrepressibly upwardwhen it assumed its utmost breadth and power so overfilling the church as to burst its way through the solid walls and diffuse itself in the open airstill if the auditor listened intently and for the purpose he could detect the same cry of pain
what was it
the complaint of a human heart sorrowladen perchance guilty telling its secret whether of guilt or sorrow to the great heart of mankind beseeching its sympathy or forgivenessat every momentin each accentand never in vain
it was this profound and continual undertone that gave the clergyman his most appropriate power
during all this time hester stood statuelike at the foot of the scaffold
if the ministers voice had not kept her there there would nevertheless have been an inevitable magnetism in that spot whence she dated the first hour of her life of ignominy
there was a sense within hertoo illdefined to be made a thought but weighing heavily on her mindthat her whole orb of life both before and after was connected with this spot as with the one point that gave it unity
little pearl meanwhile had quitted her mothers side and was playing at her own will about the marketplace
she made the sombre crowd cheerful by her erratic and glistening ray even as a bird of bright plumage illuminates a whole tree of dusky foliage by darting to and fro half seen and half concealed amid the twilight of the clustering leaves
she had an undulating but oftentimes a sharp and irregular movement
it indicated the restless vivacity of her spirit which today was doubly indefatigable in its tiptoe dance because it was played upon and vibrated with her mothers disquietude
whenever pearl saw anything to excite her ever active and wandering curiosity she flew thitherward and as we might say seized upon that man or thing as her own property so far as she desired it but without yielding the minutest degree of control over her motions in requital
the puritans looked on and if they smiled were none the less inclined to pronounce the child a demon offspring from the indescribable charm of beauty and eccentricity that shone through her little figure and sparkled with its activity
she ran and looked the wild indian in the face and he grew conscious of a nature wilder than his own
thence with native audacity but still with a reserve as characteristic she flew into the midst of a group of mariners the swarthycheeked wild men of the ocean as the indians were of the land and they gazed wonderingly and admiringly at pearl as if a flake of the seafoam had taken the shape of a little maid and were gifted with a soul of the seafire that flashes beneath the prow in the nighttime
one of these seafaring men the shipmaster indeed who had spoken to hester prynne was so smitten with pearls aspect that he attempted to lay hands upon her with purpose to snatch a kiss
finding it as impossible to touch her as to catch a hummingbird in the air he took from his hat the gold chain that was twisted about it and threw it to the child
pearl immediately twined it around her neck and waist with such happy skill that once seen there it became a part of her and it was difficult to imagine her without it
thy mother is yonder woman with the scarlet letter said the seaman wilt thou carry her a message from me  if the message pleases me i will answered pearl
then tell her rejoined he that i spake again with the blackavisaged hump shouldered old doctor and he engages to bring his friend the gentleman she wots of aboard with him
so let thy mother take no thought save for herself and thee
wilt thou tell her this thou witchbaby  mistress hibbins says my father is the prince of the air cried pearl with a naughty smile
if thou callest me that illname i shall tell him of thee and he will chase thy ship with a tempest  pursuing a zigzag course across the marketplace the child returned to her mother and communicated what the mariner had said
hesters strong calm steadfastlyenduring spirit almost sank at last on beholding this dark and grim countenance of an inevitable doom which at the moment when a passage seemed to open for the minister and herself out of their labyrinth of miseryshowed itself with an unrelenting smile right in the midst of their path
with her mind harassed by the terrible perplexity in which the shipmasters intelligence involved her she was also subjected to another trial
there were many people present from the country round about who had often heard of the scarlet letter and to whom it had been made terrific by a hundred false or exaggerated rumours but who had never beheld it with their own bodily eyes
these after exhausting other modes of amusement now thronged about hester prynne with rude and boorish intrusiveness
unscrupulous as it was however it could not bring them nearer than a circuit of several yards
at that distance they accordingly stood fixed there by the centrifugal force of the repugnance which the mystic symbol inspired
the whole gang of sailors likewise observing the press of spectators and learning the purport of the scarlet letter came and thrust their sunburnt and desperadolooking faces into the ring
even the indians were affected by a sort of cold shadow of the white mans curiosity and gliding through the crowd fastened their snakelike black eyes on hesters bosom conceiving perhaps that the wearer of this brilliantly embroidered badge must needs be a personage of high dignity among her people
lastly the inhabitants of the town their own interest in this wornout subject languidly reviving itself by sympathy with what they saw others feel lounged idly to the same quarter and tormented hester prynne perhaps more than all the rest with their cool wellacquainted gaze at her familiar shame
hester saw and recognized the selfsame faces of that group of matrons who had awaited her forthcoming from the prisondoor seven years ago all save one the youngest and only compassionate among them whose burialrobe she had since made
at the final hour when she was so soon to fling aside the burning letter it had strangely become the centre of more remark and excitement and was thus made to sear her breast more painfully than at any time since the first day she put it on
while hester stood in that magic circle of ignominy where the cunning cruelty of her sentence seemed to have fixed her for ever the admirable preacher was looking down from the sacred pulpit upon an audience whose very inmost spirits had yielded to his control
the sainted minister in the church
the woman of the scarlet letter in the marketplace
what imagination would have been irreverent enough to surmise that the same scorching stigma was on them both
xxiii
the revelation of the scarlet letter   the eloquent voice on which the souls of the listening audience had been borne aloft as on the swelling waves of the sea at length came to a pause
there was a momentary silence profound as what should follow the utterance of oracles
then ensued a murmur and halfhushed tumult as if the auditors released from the high spell that had transported them into the region of anothers mind were returning into themselves with all their awe and wonder still heavy on them
in a moment more the crowd began to gush forth from the doors of the church
now that there was an end they needed more breath more fit to support the gross and earthly life into which they relapsed than that atmosphere which the preacher had converted into words of flame and had burdened with the rich fragrance of his thought
in the open air their rapture broke into speech
the street and the marketplace absolutely babbled from side to side with applauses of the minister
his hearers could not rest until they had told one another of what each knew better than he could tell or hear
according to their united testimony never had man spoken in so wise so high and so holy a spirit as he that spake this day nor had inspiration ever breathed through mortal lips more evidently than it did through his
its influence could be seen as it were descending upon him and possessing him and continually lifting him out of the written discourse that lay before him and filling him with ideas that must have been as marvellous to himself as to his audience
his subject it appeared had been the relation between the deity and the communities of mankind with a special reference to the new england which they were here planting in the wilderness
and as he drew towards the close a spirit as of prophecy had come upon him constraining him to its purpose as mightily as the old prophets of israel were constrained only with this difference that whereas the jewish seers had denounced judgments and ruin on their country it was his mission to foretell a high and glorious destiny for the newly gathered people of the lord
but throughout it all and through the whole discourse there had been a certain deep sad undertone of pathos which could not be interpreted otherwise than as the natural regret of one soon to pass away
yes their minister whom they so lovedand who so loved them all that he could not depart heavenward without a sighhad the foreboding of untimely death upon him and would soon leave them in their tears
this idea of his transitory stay on earth gave the last emphasis to the effect which the preacher had produced it was as if an angel in his passage to the skies had shaken his bright wings over the people for an instantat once a shadow and a splendourand had shed down a shower of golden truths upon them
thus there had come to the reverend mr dimmesdaleas to most men in their various spheres though seldom recognised until they see it far behind theman epoch of life more brilliant and full of triumph than any previous one or than any which could hereafter be
he stood at this moment on the very proudest eminence of superiority to which the gifts or intellect rich lore prevailing eloquence and a reputation of whitest sanctity could exalt a clergyman in new englands earliest days when the professional character was of itself a lofty pedestal
such was the position which the minister occupied as he bowed his head forward on the cushions of the pulpit at the close of his election sermon
meanwhile hester prynne was standing beside the scaffold of the pillory with the scarlet letter still burning on her breast
now was heard again the clamour of the music and the measured tramp of the military escort issuing from the church door
the procession was to be marshalled thence to the town hall where a solemn banquet would complete the ceremonies of the day
once more therefore the train of venerable and majestic fathers were seen moving through a broad pathway of the people who drew back reverently on either side as the governor and magistrates the old and wise men the holy ministers and all that were eminent and renowned advanced into the midst of them
when they were fairly in the marketplace their presence was greeted by a shout
thisthough doubtless it might acquire additional force and volume from the childlike loyalty which the age awarded to its rulerswas felt to be an irrepressible outburst of enthusiasm kindled in the auditors by that high strain of eloquence which was yet reverberating in their ears
each felt the impulse in himself and in the same breath caught it from his neighbour
within the church it had hardly been kept down beneath the sky it pealed upward to the zenith
there were human beings enough and enough of highly wrought and symphonious feeling to produce that more impressive sound than the organ tones of the blast or the thunder or the roar of the sea even that mighty swell of many voices blended into one great voice by the universal impulse which makes likewise one vast heart out of the many
never from the soil of new england had gone up such a shout
never on new england soil had stood the man so honoured by his mortal brethren as the preacher
how fared it with him then
were there not the brilliant particles of a halo in the air about his head
so etherealised by spirit as he was and so apotheosised by worshipping admirers did his footsteps in the procession really tread upon the dust of earth
as the ranks of military men and civil fathers moved onward all eyes were turned towards the point where the minister was seen to approach among them
the shout died into a murmur as one portion of the crowd after another obtained a glimpse of him
how feeble and pale he looked amid all his triumph
the energyor say rather the inspiration which had held him up until he should have delivered the sacred message that had brought its own strength along with it from heavenwas withdrawn now that it had so faithfully performed its office
the glow which they had just before beheld burning on his cheek was extinguished like a flame that sinks down hopelessly among the late decaying embers
it seemed hardly the face of a man alive with such a deathlike hue it was hardly a man with life in him that tottered on his path so nervously yet tottered and did not fall
one of his clerical brethrenit was the venerable john wilsonobserving the state in which mr dimmesdale was left by the retiring wave of intellect and sensibility stepped forward hastily to offer his support
the minister tremulously but decidedly repelled the old mans arm
he still walked onward if that movement could be so described which rather resembled the wavering effort of an infant with its mothers arms in view outstretched to tempt him forward
and now almost imperceptible as were the latter steps of his progress he had come opposite the wellremembered and weatherdarkened scaffold where long since with all that dreary lapse of time between hester prynne had encountered the worlds ignominious stare
there stood hester holding little pearl by the hand
and there was the scarlet letter on her breast
the minister here made a pause although the music still played the stately and rejoicing march to which the procession moved
it summoned him onwardinward to the festivalbut here he made a pause
bellingham for the last few moments had kept an anxious eye upon him
he now left his own place in the procession and advanced to give assistance judging from mr dimmesdales aspect that he must otherwise inevitably fall
but there was something in the latters expression that warned back the magistrate although a man not readily obeying the vague intimations that pass from one spirit to another
the crowd meanwhile looked on with awe and wonder
this earthly faintness was in their view only another phase of the ministers celestial strength nor would it have seemed a miracle too high to be wrought for one so holy had he ascended before their eyes waxing dimmer and brighter and fading at last into the light of heaven
he turned towards the scaffold and stretched forth his arms
hester said he come hither
come my little pearl  it was a ghastly look with which he regarded them but there was something at once tender and strangely triumphant in it
the child with the birdlike motion which was one of her characteristics flew to him and clasped her arms about his knees
hester prynneslowly as if impelled by inevitable fate and against her strongest willlikewise drew near but paused before she reached him
at this instant old roger chillingworth thrust himself through the crowdor perhaps so dark disturbed and evil was his look he rose up out of some nether regionto snatch back his victim from what he sought to do
be that as it might the old man rushed forward and caught the minister by the arm
madman hold
what is your purpose whispered he
wave back that woman
cast off this child
all shall be well
do not blacken your fame and perish in dishonour
i can yet save you
would you bring infamy on your sacred profession  ha tempter
methinks thou art too late answered the minister encountering his eye fearfully but firmly
thy power is not what it was
with gods help i shall escape thee now  he again extended his hand to the woman of the scarlet letter
hester prynne cried he with a piercing earnestness in the name of him so terrible and so merciful who gives me grace at this last moment to do whatfor my own heavy sin and miserable agonyi withheld myself from doing seven years ago come hither now and twine thy strength about me
thy strength hester but let it be guided by the will which god hath granted me
this wretched and wronged old man is opposing it with all his mightwith all his own might and the fiends
come hestercome
support me up yonder scaffold  the crowd was in a tumult
the men of rank and dignity who stood more immediately around the clergyman were so taken by surprise and so perplexed as to the purport of what they sawunable to receive the explanation which most readily presented itself or to imagine any otherthat they remained silent and inactive spectators of the judgement which providence seemed about to work
they beheld the minister leaning on hesters shoulder and supported by her arm around him approach the scaffold and ascend its steps while still the little hand of the sinborn child was clasped in his
old roger chillingworth followed as one intimately connected with the drama of guilt and sorrow in which they had all been actors and well entitled therefore to be present at its closing scene
hadst thou sought the whole earth over said he looking darkly at the clergyman there was no one place so secretno high place nor lowly place where thou couldst have escaped mesave on this very scaffold  thanks be to him who hath led me hither answered the minister
yet he trembled and turned to hester with an expression of doubt and anxiety in his eyes not the less evidently betrayed that there was a feeble smile upon his lips
is not this better murmured he than what we dreamed of in the forest  i know not
i know not she hurriedly replied
better
yea so we may both die and little pearl die with us  for thee and pearl be it as god shall order said the minister and god is merciful
let me now do the will which he hath made plain before my sight
for hester i am a dying man
so let me make haste to take my shame upon me  partly supported by hester prynne and holding one hand of little pearls the reverend mr dimmesdale turned to the dignified and venerable rulers to the holy ministers who were his brethren to the people whose great heart was thoroughly appalled yet overflowing with tearful sympathy as knowing that some deep lifematterwhich if full of sin was full of anguish and repentance likewisewas now to be laid open to them
the sun but little past its meridian shone down upon the clergyman and gave a distinctness to his figure as he stood out from all the earth to put in his plea of guilty at the bar of eternal justice
people of new england cried he with a voice that rose over them high solemn and majesticyet had always a tremor through it and sometimes a shriek struggling up out of a fathomless depth of remorse and woeye that have loved meye that have deemed me holybehold me here the one sinner of the world
at lastat lasti stand upon the spot where seven years since i should have stood here with this woman whose arm more than the little strength wherewith i have crept hitherward sustains me at this dreadful moment from grovelling down upon my face
lo the scarlet letter which hester wears
ye have all shuddered at it
wherever her walk hath beenwherever so miserably burdened she may have hoped to find reposeit hath cast a lurid gleam of awe and horrible repugnance round about her
but there stood one in the midst of you at whose brand of sin and infamy ye have not shuddered  it seemed at this point as if the minister must leave the remainder of his secret undisclosed
but he fought back the bodily weaknessand still more the faintness of heartthat was striving for the mastery with him
he threw off all assistance and stepped passionately forward a pace before the woman and the children
it was on him he continued with a kind of fierceness so determined was he to speak out the whole
gods eye beheld it
the angels were for ever pointing at it
the devil knew it well and fretted it continually with the touch of his burning finger
but he hid it cunningly from men and walked among you with the mien of a spirit mournful because so pure in a sinful worldand sad because he missed his heavenly kindred
now at the deathhour he stands up before you
he bids you look again at hesters scarlet letter
he tells you that with all its mysterious horror it is but the shadow of what he bears on his own breast and that even this his own red stigma is no more than the type of what has seared his inmost heart
stand any here that question gods judgment on a sinner
behold
behold a dreadful witness of it  with a convulsive motion he tore away the ministerial band from before his breast
it was revealed
but it were irreverent to describe that revelation
for an instant the gaze of the horrorstricken multitude was concentrated on the ghastly miracle while the minister stood with a flush of triumph in his face as one who in the crisis of acutest pain had won a victory
then down he sank upon the scaffold
hester partly raised him and supported his head against her bosom
old roger chillingworth knelt down beside him with a blank dull countenance out of which the life seemed to have departed
thou hast escaped me he repeated more than once
thou hast escaped me  may god forgive thee said the minister
thou too hast deeply sinned  he withdrew his dying eyes from the old man and fixed them on the woman and the child
my little pearl said he feebly and there was a sweet and gentle smile over his face as of a spirit sinking into deep repose nay now that the burden was removed it seemed almost as if he would be sportive with the childdear little pearl wilt thou kiss me now
thou wouldst not yonder in the forest
but now thou wilt  pearl kissed his lips
a spell was broken
the great scene of grief in which the wild infant bore a part had developed all her sympathies and as her tears fell upon her fathers cheek they were the pledge that she would grow up amid human joy and sorrow nor forever do battle with the world but be a woman in it
towards her mother too pearls errand as a messenger of anguish was fulfilled
hester said the clergyman farewell  shall we not meet again whispered she bending her face down close to his
shall we not spend our immortal life together
surely surely we have ransomed one another with all this woe
thou lookest far into eternity with those bright dying eyes
then tell me what thou seest  hush hesterhush said he with tremulous solemnity
the law we brokethe sin here awfully revealedlet these alone be in thy thoughts
i fear
i fear
it may be that when we forgot our godwhen we violated our reverence each for the others soulit was thenceforth vain to hope that we could meet hereafter in an everlasting and pure reunion
god knows and he is merciful
he hath proved his mercy most of all in my afflictions
by giving me this burning torture to bear upon my breast
by sending yonder dark and terrible old man to keep the torture always at redheat
by bringing me hither to die this death of triumphant ignominy before the people
had either of these agonies been wanting i had been lost for ever
praised be his name
his will be done
farewell  that final word came forth with the ministers expiring breath
the multitude silent till then broke out in a strange deep voice of awe and wonder which could not as yet find utterance save in this murmur that rolled so heavily after the departed spirit
xxiv
conclusion   after many days when time sufficed for the people to arrange their thoughts in reference to the foregoing scene there was more than one account of what had been witnessed on the scaffold
most of the spectators testified to having seen on the breast of the unhappy minister a scarlet letterthe very semblance of that worn by hester prynneimprinted in the flesh
as regarded its origin there were various explanations all of which must necessarily have been conjectural
some affirmed that the reverend mr dimmesdale on the very day when hester prynne first wore her ignominious badge had begun a course of penancewhich he afterwards in so many futile methods followed outby inflicting a hideous torture on himself
others contended that the stigma had not been produced until a long time subsequent when old roger chillingworth being a potent necromancer had caused it to appear through the agency of magic and poisonous drugs
others again and those best able to appreciate the ministers peculiar sensibility and the wonderful operation of his spirit upon the bodywhispered their belief that the awful symbol was the effect of the everactive tooth of remorse gnawing from the inmost heart outwardly and at last manifesting heavens dreadful judgment by the visible presence of the letter
the reader may choose among these theories
we have thrown all the light we could acquire upon the portent and would gladly now that it has done its office erase its deep print out of our own brain where long meditation has fixed it in very undesirable distinctness
it is singular nevertheless that certain persons who were spectators of the whole scene and professed never once to have removed their eyes from the reverend mr dimmesdale denied that there was any mark whatever on his breast more than on a newborn infants
neither by their report had his dying words acknowledged nor even remotely implied anythe slightestconnexion on his part with the guilt for which hester prynne had so long worn the scarlet letter
according to these highlyrespectable witnesses the minister conscious that he was dyingconscious also that the reverence of the multitude placed him already among saints and angelshad desired by yielding up his breath in the arms of that fallen woman to express to the world how utterly nugatory is the choicest of mans own righteousness
after exhausting life in his efforts for mankinds spiritual good he had made the manner of his death a parable in order to impress on his admirers the mighty and mournful lesson that in the view of infinite purity we are sinners all alike
it was to teach them that the holiest amongst us has but attained so far above his fellows as to discern more clearly the mercy which looks down and repudiate more utterly the phantom of human merit which would look aspiringly upward
without disputing a truth so momentous we must be allowed to consider this version of mr dimmesdales story as only an instance of that stubborn fidelity with which a mans friendsand especially a clergymanswill sometimes uphold his character when proofs clear as the midday sunshine on the scarlet letter establish him a false and sinstained creature of the dust
the authority which we have chiefly followeda manuscript of old date drawn up from the verbal testimony of individuals some of whom had known hester prynne while others had heard the tale from contemporary witnesses fully confirms the view taken in the foregoing pages
among many morals which press upon us from the poor ministers miserable experience we put only this into a sentencebe true
be true
be true
show freely to the world if not your worst yet some trait whereby the worst may be inferred  nothing was more remarkable than the change which took place almost immediately after mr dimmesdales death in the appearance and demeanour of the old man known as roger chillingworth
all his strength and energyall his vital and intellectual forceseemed at once to desert him insomuch that he positively withered up shrivelled away and almost vanished from mortal sight like an uprooted weed that lies wilting in the sun
this unhappy man had made the very principle of his life to consist in the pursuit and systematic exercise of revenge and when by its completest triumph consummation that evil principle was left with no further material to support itwhen in short there was no more devils work on earth for him to do it only remained for the unhumanised mortal to betake himself whither his master would find him tasks enough and pay him his wages duly
but to all these shadowy beings so long our near acquaintancesas well roger chillingworth as his companions we would fain be merciful
it is a curious subject of observation and inquiry whether hatred and love be not the same thing at bottom
each in its utmost development supposes a high degree of intimacy and heartknowledge each renders one individual dependent for the food of his affections and spiritual fife upon another each leaves the passionate lover or the no less passionate hater forlorn and desolate by the withdrawal of his subject
philosophically considered therefore the two passions seem essentially the same except that one happens to be seen in a celestial radiance and the other in a dusky and lurid glow
in the spiritual world the old physician and the ministermutual victims as they have beenmay unawares have found their earthly stock of hatred and antipathy transmuted into golden love
leaving this discussion apart we have a matter of business to communicate to the reader
at old roger chillingworths decease which took place within the year and by his last will and testament of which governor bellingham and the reverend mr wilson were executors he bequeathed a very considerable amount of property both here and in england to little pearl the daughter of hester prynne
so pearlthe elf childthe demon offspring as some people up to that epoch persisted in considering herbecame the richest heiress of her day in the new world
not improbably this circumstance wrought a very material change in the public estimation and had the mother and child remained here little pearl at a marriageable period of life might have mingled her wild blood with the lineage of the devoutest puritan among them all
but in no long time after the physicians death the wearer of the scarlet letter disappeared and pearl along with her
for many years though a vague report would now and then find its way across the sealike a shapeless piece of driftwood tossed ashore with the initials of a name upon ityet no tidings of them unquestionably authentic were received
the story of the scarlet letter grew into a legend
its spell however was still potent and kept the scaffold awful where the poor minister had died and likewise the cottage by the seashore where hester prynne had dwelt
near this latter spot one afternoon some children were at play when they beheld a tall woman in a gray robe approach the cottagedoor
in all those years it had never once been opened but either she unlocked it or the decaying wood and iron yielded to her hand or she glided shadowlike through these impedimentsand at all events went in
on the threshold she pausedturned partly roundfor perchance the idea of entering alone and all so changed the home of so intense a former life was more dreary and desolate than even she could bear
but her hesitation was only for an instant though long enough to display a scarlet letter on her breast
and hester prynne had returned and taken up her longforsaken shame
but where was little pearl
if still alive she must now have been in the flush and bloom of early womanhood
none knewnor ever learned with the fulness of perfect certaintywhether the elfchild had gone thus untimely to a maiden grave or whether her wild rich nature had been softened and subdued and made capable of a womans gentle happiness
but through the remainder of hesters life there were indications that the recluse of the scarlet letter was the object of love and interest with some inhabitant of another land
letters came with armorial seals upon them though of bearings unknown to english heraldry
in the cottage there were articles of comfort and luxury such as hester never cared to use but which only wealth could have purchased and affection have imagined for her
there were trifles too little ornaments beautiful tokens of a continual remembrance that must have been wrought by delicate fingers at the impulse of a fond heart
and once hester was seen embroidering a babygarment with such a lavish richness of golden fancy as would have raised a public tumult had any infant thus apparelled been shown to our soberhued community
in fine the gossips of that day believedand mr surveyor pue who made investigations a century later believedand one of his recent successors in office moreover faithfully believesthat pearl was not only alive but married and happy and mindful of her mother and that she would most joyfully have entertained that sad and lonely mother at her fireside
but there was a more real life for hester prynne here in new england than in that unknown region where pearl had found a home
here had been her sin here her sorrow and here was yet to be her penitence
she had returned therefore and resumedof her own free will for not the sternest magistrate of that iron period would have imposed itresumed the symbol of which we have related so dark a tale
never afterwards did it quit her bosom
but in the lapse of the toilsome thoughtful and selfdevoted years that made up hesters life the scarlet letter ceased to be a stigma which attracted the worlds scorn and bitterness and became a type of something to be sorrowed over and looked upon with awe yet with reverence too
and as hester prynne had no selfish ends nor lived in any measure for her own profit and enjoyment people brought all their sorrows and perplexities and besought her counsel as one who had herself gone through a mighty trouble
women more especiallyin the continually recurring trials of wounded wasted wronged misplaced or erring and sinful passionor with the dreary burden of a heart unyielded because unvalued and unsought came to hesters cottage demanding why they were so wretched and what the remedy
hester comforted and counselled them as best she might
she assured them too of her firm belief that at some brighter period when the world should have grown ripe for it in heavens own time a new truth would be revealed in order to establish the whole relation between man and woman on a surer ground of mutual happiness
earlier in life hester had vainly imagined that she herself might be the destined prophetess but had long since recognised the impossibility that any mission of divine and mysterious truth should be confided to a woman stained with sin bowed down with shame or even burdened with a lifelong sorrow
the angel and apostle of the coming revelation must be a woman indeed but lofty pure and beautiful and wise moreover not through dusky grief but the ethereal medium of joy and showing how sacred love should make us happy by the truest test of a life successful to such an end
so said hester prynne and glanced her sad eyes downward at the scarlet letter
and after many many years a new grave was delved near an old and sunken one in that burialground beside which kings chapel has since been built
it was near that old and sunken grave yet with a space between as if the dust of the two sleepers had no right to mingle
yet one tombstone served for both
all around there were monuments carved with armorial bearings and on this simple slab of slateas the curious investigator may still discern and perplex himself with the purportthere appeared the semblance of an engraved escutcheon
it bore a device a heralds wording of which may serve for a motto and brief description of our now concluded legend so sombre is it and relieved only by one everglowing point of light gloomier than the shadow  on a field sable the letter a gules
