illustration allan quatermain by h rider haggard contents introduction note by george curtis esq
authorities i inscribe this book of adventure to my son arthur john rider haggard in the hope that in days to come he and many other boys whom i shall never know may in the acts and thoughts of allan quatermain and his companions as herein recorded find something to help him and them to reach to what with sir henry curtis i hold to be the highest rank whereto we can attainthe state and dignity of english gentlemen
introduction december i have just buried my boy my poor handsome boy of whom i was so proud and my heart is broken
it is very hard having only one son to lose him thus but gods will be done
who am i that i should complain
the great wheel of fate rolls on like a juggernaut and crushes us all in turn some soon some lateit does not matter when in the end it crushes us all
we do not prostrate ourselves before it like the poor indians we fly hither and thitherwe cry for mercy but it is of no use the black fate thunders on and in its season reduces us to powder
poor harry to go so soon
just when his life was opening to him
he was doing so well at the hospital he had passed his last examination with honours and i was proud of them much prouder than he was i think
and then he must needs go to that smallpox hospital
he wrote to me that he was not afraid of smallpox and wanted to gain the experience and now the disease has killed him and i old and grey and withered am left to mourn over him without a chick or child to comfort me
i might have saved him tooi have money enough for both of us and much more than enoughking solomons mines provided me with that but i said no let the boy earn his living let him labour that he may enjoy rest but the rest has come to him before the labour
oh my boy my boy
i am like the man in the bible who laid up much goods and builded barnsgoods for my boy and barns for him to store them in and now his soul has been required of him and i am left desolate
i would that it had been my soul and not my boys
we buried him this afternoon under the shadow of the grey and ancient tower of the church of this village where my house is
it was a dreary december afternoon and the sky was heavy with snow but not much was falling
the coffin was put down by the grave and a few big flakes lit upon it
they looked very white upon the black cloth
there was a little hitch about getting the coffin down into the gravethe necessary ropes had been forgotten so we drew back from it and waited in silence watching the big flakes fall gently one by one like heavenly benedictions and melt in tears on harrys pall
but that was not all
a robin redbreast came as bold as could be and lit upon the coffin and began to sing
and then i am afraid that i broke down and so did sir henry curtis strong man though he is and as for captain good i saw him turn away too even in my own distress i could not help noticing it the above signed allan quatermain is an extract from my diary written two years and more ago
i copy it down here because it seems to me that it is the fittest beginning to the history that i am about to write if it please god to spare me to finish it
if not well it does not matter
that extract was penned seven thousand miles or so from the spot where i now lie painfully and slowly writing this with a pretty girl standing by my side fanning the flies from my august countenance
harry is there and i am here and yet somehow i cannot help feeling that i am not far off harry
when i was in england i used to live in a very fine houseat least i call it a fine house speaking comparatively and judging from the standard of the houses i have been accustomed to all my life in africanot five hundred yards from the old church where harry is asleep and thither i went after the funeral and ate some food for it is no good starving even if one has just buried all ones earthly hopes
but i could not eat much and soon i took to walking or rather limpingbeing permanently lame from the bite of a lionup and down up and down the oakpanelled vestibule for there is a vestibule in my house in england
on all the four walls of this vestibule were placed pairs of hornsabout a hundred pairs altogether all of which i had shot myself
they are beautiful specimens as i never keep any horns which are not in every way perfect unless it may be now and again on account of the associations connected with them
in the centre of the room however over the wide fireplace there was a clear space left on which i had fixed up all my rifles
some of them i have had for forty years old muzzleloaders that nobody would look at nowadays
one was an elephant gun with strips of rimpi or green hide lashed round the stock and locks such as used to be owned by the dutchmena roer they call it
that gun the boer i bought it from many years ago told me had been used by his father at the battle of the blood river just after dingaan swept into natal and slaughtered six hundred men women and children so that the boers named the place where they died weenen or the place of weeping and so it is called to this day and always will be called
and many an elephant have i shot with that old gun
she always took a handful of black powder and a threeounce ball and kicked like the very deuce
well up and down i walked staring at the guns and the horns which the guns had brought low and as i did so there rose up in me a great cravingi would go away from this place where i lived idly and at ease back again to the wild land where i had spent my life where i met my dear wife and poor harry was born and so many things good bad and indifferent had happened to me
the thirst for the wilderness was on me i could tolerate this place no more i would go and die as i had lived among the wild game and the savages
yes as i walked i began to long to see the moonlight gleaming silvery white over the wide veldt and mysterious sea of bush and watch the lines of game travelling down the ridges to the water
the ruling passion is strong in death they say and my heart was dead that night
but independently of my trouble no man who has for forty years lived the life i have can with impunity go coop himself in this prim english country with its trim hedgerows and cultivated fields its stiff formal manners and its welldressed crowds
he begins to longah how he longsfor the keen breath of the desert air he dreams of the sight of zulu impis breaking on their foes like surf upon the rocks and his heart rises up in rebellion against the strict limits of the civilized life
ah
this civilization what does it all come to
for forty years and more i lived among savages and studied them and their ways and now for several years i have lived here in england and have in my own stupid manner done my best to learn the ways of the children of light and what have i found
a great gulf fixed
no only a very little one that a plain mans thought may spring across
i say that as the savage is so is the white man only the latter is more inventive and possesses the faculty of combination save and except also that the savage as i have known him is to a large extent free from the greed of money which eats like a cancer into the heart of the white man
it is a depressing conclusion but in all essentials the savage and the child of civilization are identical
i dare say that the highly civilized lady reading this will smile at an old fool of a hunters simplicity when she thinks of her black beadbedecked sister and so will the superfine cultured idler scientifically eating a dinner at his club the cost of which would keep a starving family for a week
and yet my dear young lady what are those pretty things round your own neckthey have a strong family resemblance especially when you wear that very low dress to the savage womans beads
your habit of turning round and round to the sound of horns and tomtoms your fondness for pigments and powders the way in which you love to subjugate yourself to the rich warrior who has captured you in marriage and the quickness with which your taste in feathered headdresses variesall these things suggest touches of kinship and you remember that in the fundamental principles of your nature you are quite identical
as for you sir who also laugh let some man come and strike you in the face whilst you are enjoying that marvellouslooking dish and we shall soon see how much of the savage there is in you
there i might go on for ever but what is the good
civilization is only savagery silvergilt
a vainglory is it and like a northern light comes but to fade and leave the sky more dark
out of the soil of barbarism it has grown like a tree and as i believe into the soil like a tree it will once more sooner or later fall again as the egyptian civilization fell as the hellenic civilization fell and as the roman civilization and many others of which the world has now lost count fell also
do not let me however be understood as decrying our modern institutions representing as they do the gathered experience of humanity applied for the good of all
of course they have great advantageshospitals for instance but then remember we breed the sickly people who fill them
in a savage land they do not exist
besides the question will arise how many of these blessings are due to christianity as distinct from civilization
and so the balance sways and the story runshere a gain there a loss and natures great average struck across the two whereof the sum total forms one of the factors in that mighty equation in which the result will equal the unknown quantity of her purpose
i make no apology for this digression especially as this is an introduction which all young people and those who never like to think and it is a bad habit will naturally skip
it seems to me very desirable that we should sometimes try to understand the limitations of our nature so that we may not be carried away by the pride of knowledge
mans cleverness is almost indefinite and stretches like an elastic band but human nature is like an iron ring
you can go round and round it you can polish it highly you can even flatten it a little on one side whereby you will make it bulge out the other but you will never while the world endures and man is man increase its total circumference
it is the one fixed unchangeable thingfixed as the stars more enduring than the mountains as unalterable as the way of the eternal
human nature is gods kaleidoscope and the little bits of coloured glass which represent our passions hopes fears joys aspirations towards good and evil and what not are turned in his mighty hand as surely and as certainly as it turns the stars and continually fall into new patterns and combinations
but the composing elements remain the same nor will there be one more bit of coloured glass nor one less for ever and ever
this being so supposing for the sake of argument we divide ourselves into twenty parts nineteen savage and one civilized we must look to the nineteen savage portions of our nature if we would really understand ourselves and not to the twentieth which though so insignificant in reality is spread all over the other nineteen making them appear quite different from what they really are as the blacking does a boot or the veneer a table
it is on the nineteen rough serviceable savage portions that we fall back in emergencies not on the polished but unsubstantial twentieth
civilization should wipe away our tears and yet we weep and cannot be comforted
warfare is abhorrent to her and yet we strike out for hearth and home for honour and fair fame and can glory in the blow
and so on through everything
so when the heart is stricken and the head is humbled in the dust civilization fails us utterly
back back we creep and lay us like little children on the great breast of nature she that perchance may soothe us and make us forget or at least rid remembrance of its sting
who has not in his great grief felt a longing to look upon the outward features of the universal mother to lie on the mountains and watch the clouds drive across the sky and hear the rollers break in thunder on the shore to let his poor struggling life mingle for a while in her life to feel the slow beat of her eternal heart and to forget his woes and let his identity be swallowed in the vast imperceptibly moving energy of her of whom we are from whom we came and with whom we shall again be mingled who gave us birth and will in a day to come give us our burial also
and so in my trouble as i walked up and down the oakpanelled vestibule of my house there in yorkshire i longed once more to throw myself into the arms of nature
not the nature which you know the nature that waves in wellkept woods and smiles out in cornfields but nature as she was in the age when creation was complete undefiled as yet by any human sinks of sweltering humanity
i would go again where the wild game was back to the land whereof none know the history back to the savages whom i love although some of them are almost as merciless as political economy
there perhaps i should be able to learn to think of poor harry lying in the churchyard without feeling as though my heart would break in two
and now there is an end of this egotistical talk and there shall be no more of it
but if you whose eyes may perchance one day fall upon my written thoughts have got so far as this i ask you to persevere since what i have to tell you is not without its interest and it has never been told before nor will again
the consuls yarn a week had passed since the funeral of my poor boy harry and one evening i was in my room walking up and down and thinking when there was a ring at the outer door
going down the steps i opened it myself and in came my old friends sir henry curtis and captain john good rn
they entered the vestibule and sat themselves down before the wide hearth where i remember a particularly good fire of logs was burning
it is very kind of you to come round i said by way of making a remark it must have been heavy walking in the snow they said nothing but sir henry slowly filled his pipe and lit it with a burning ember
as he leant forward to do so the fire got hold of a gassy bit of pine and flared up brightly throwing the whole scene into strong relief and i thought what a splendidlooking man he is
calm powerful face clearcut features large grey eyes yellow beard and hairaltogether a magnificent specimen of the higher type of humanity
nor did his form belie his face
i have never seen wider shoulders or a deeper chest
indeed sir henrys girth is so great that though he is six feet two high he does not strike one as a tall man
as i looked at him i could not help thinking what a curious contrast my little driedup self presented to his grand face and form
imagine to yourself a small withered yellowfaced man of sixtythree with thin hands large brown eyes a head of grizzled hair cut short and standing up like a halfworn scrubbingbrushtotal weight in my clothes nine stone sixand you will get a very fair idea of allan quatermain commonly called hunter quatermain or by the natives macumazahnanglic he who keeps a bright lookout at night or in vulgar english a sharp fellow who is not to be taken in
then there was good who is not like either of us being short dark stoutvery stoutwith twinkling black eyes in one of which an eyeglass is everlastingly fixed
i say stout but it is a mild term i regret to state that of late years good has been running to fat in a most disgraceful way
sir henry tells him that it comes from idleness and overfeeding and good does not like it at all though he cannot deny it
we sat for a while and then i got a match and lit the lamp that stood ready on the table for the halflight began to grow dreary as it is apt to do when one has a short week ago buried the hope of ones life
next i opened a cupboard in the wainscoting and got a bottle of whisky and some tumblers and water
i always like to do these things for myself it is irritating to me to have somebody continually at my elbow as though i were an eighteenmonthold baby
all this while curtis and good had been silent feeling i suppose that they had nothing to say that could do me any good and content to give me the comfort of their presence and unspoken sympathy for it was only their second visit since the funeral
and it is by the way from the presence of others that we really derive support in our dark hours of grief and not from their talk which often only serves to irritate us
before a bad storm the game always herd together but they cease their calling
they sat and smoked and drank whisky and water and i stood by the fire also smoking and looking at them
at last i spoke
old friends i said how long is it since we got back from kukuanaland three years said good
why do you ask i ask because i think that i have had a long enough spell of civilization
i am going back to the veldt sir henry laid his head back in his armchair and laughed one of his deep laughs
how very odd he said eh good good beamed at me mysteriously through his eyeglass and murmured yes oddvery odd i dont quite understand said i looking from one to the other for i dislike mysteries
dont you old fellow said sir henry then i will explain
as good and i were walking up here we had a talk if good was there you probably did i put in sarcastically for good is a great hand at talking
and what may it have been about what do you think asked sir henry
i shook my head
it was not likely that i should know what good might be talking about
he talks about so many things
well it was about a little plan that i have formednamely that if you were willing we should pack up our traps and go off to africa on another expedition i fairly jumped at his words
you dont say so i said
yes i do though and so does good dont you good rather said that gentleman
listen old fellow went on sir henry with considerable animation of manner
im tired of it too deadtired of doing nothing more except play the squire in a country that is sick of squires
for a year or more i have been getting as restless as an old elephant who scents danger
i am always dreaming of kukuanaland and gagool and king solomons mines
i can assure you i have become the victim of an almost unaccountable craving
i am sick of shooting pheasants and partridges and want to have a go at some large game again
there you know the feelingwhen one has once tasted brandy and water milk becomes insipid to the palate
that year we spent together up in kukuanaland seems to me worth all the other years of my life put together
i dare say that i am a fool for my pains but i cant help it i long to go and what is more i mean to go he paused and then went on again
and after all why should i not go
i have no wife or parent no chick or child to keep me
if anything happens to me the baronetcy will go to my brother george and his boy as it would ultimately do in any case
i am of no importance to any one ah i said i thought you would come to that sooner or later
and now good what is your reason for wanting to trek have you got one i have said good solemnly
i never do anything without a reason and it isnt a ladyat least if it is its several i looked at him again
good is so overpoweringly frivolous
what is it i said
well if you really want to know though id rather not speak of a delicate and strictly personal matter ill tell you im getting too fat shut up good said sir henry
and now quatermain tell us where do you propose going to i lit my pipe which had gone out before answering
have you people ever heard of mt kenia i asked
dont know the place said good
did you ever hear of the island of lamu i asked again
no
stop thoughisnt it a place about miles north of zanzibar yes
now listen
what i have to propose is this
that we go to lamu and thence make our way about miles inland to mt kenia from mt kenia on inland to mt lekakisera another miles or thereabouts beyond which no white man has to the best of my belief ever been and then if we get so far right on into the unknown interior
what do you say to that my hearties its a big order said sir henry reflectively
you are right i answered it is but i take it that we are all three of us in search of a big order
we want a change of scene and we are likely to get onea thorough change
all my life i have longed to visit those parts and i mean to do it before i die
my poor boys death has broken the last link between me and civilization and im off to my native wilds
and now ill tell you another thing and that is that for years and years i have heard rumours of a great white race which is supposed to have its home somewhere up in this direction and i have a mind to see if there is any truth in them
if you fellows like to come well and good if not ill go alone im your man though i dont believe in your white race said sir henry curtis rising and placing his arm upon my shoulder
ditto remarked good
ill go into training at once
by all means lets go to mt kenia and the other place with an unpronounceable name and look for a white race that does not exist
its all one to me when do you propose to start asked sir henry
this day month i answered by the british india steamboat and dont you be so certain that things have no existence because you do not happen to have heard of them
remember king solomons mines some fourteen weeks or so had passed since the date of this conversation and this history goes on its way in very different surroundings
after much deliberation and inquiry we came to the conclusion that our best startingpoint for mt kenia would be from the neighbourhood of the mouth of the tana river and not from mombassa a place over miles nearer zanzibar
this conclusion we arrived at from information given to us by a german trader whom we met upon the steamer at aden
i think that he was the dirtiest german i ever knew but he was a good fellow and gave us a great deal of valuable information
lamu said he you goes to lamuoh ze beautiful place and he turned up his fat face and beamed with mild rapture
one year and a half i live there and never change my shirtnever at all and so it came to pass that on arriving at the island we disembarked with all our goods and chattels and not knowing where to go marched boldly up to the house of her majestys consul where we were most hospitably received
lamu is a very curious place but the things which stand out most clearly in my memory in connection with it are its exceeding dirtiness and its smells
these last are simply awful
just below the consulate is the beach or rather a mud bank that is called a beach
it is left quite bare at low tide and serves as a repository for all the filth offal and refuse of the town
here it is too that the women come to bury coconuts in the mud leaving them there till the outer husk is quite rotten when they dig them up again and use the fibres to make mats with and for various other purposes
as this process has been going on for generations the condition of the shore can be better imagined than described
i have smelt many evil odours in the course of my life but the concentrated essence of stench which arose from that beach at lamu as we sat in the moonlit nightnot under but on our friend the consuls hospitable roofand sniffed it makes the remembrance of them very poor and faint
no wonder people get fever at lamu
and yet the place was not without a certain quaintness and charm of its own though possiblyindeed probablyit was one which would quickly pall
well where are you gentlemen steering for asked our friend the hospitable consul as we smoked our pipes after dinner
we propose to go to mt kenia and then on to mt lekakisera answered sir henry
quatermain has got hold of some yarn about there being a white race up in the unknown territories beyond the consul looked interested and answered that he had heard something of that too
what have you heard i asked
oh not much
all i know about it is that a year or so ago i got a letter from mackenzie the scotch missionary whose station the highlands is placed at the highest navigable point of the tana river in which he said something about it have you the letter i asked
no i destroyed it but i remember that he said that a man had arrived at his station who declared that two months journey beyond mt lekakisera which no white man has yet visitedat least so far as i knowhe found a lake called laga and that then he went off to the northeast a months journey over desert and thorn veldt and great mountains till he came to a country where the people are white and live in stone houses
here he was hospitably entertained for a while till at last the priests of the country set it about that he was a devil and the people drove him away and he journeyed for eight months and reached mackenzies place as i heard dying
thats all i know and if you ask me i believe that it is a lie but if you want to find out more about it you had better go up the tana to mackenzies place and ask him for information sir henry and i looked at each other
here was something tangible
i think that we will go to mr mackenzies i said
well answered the consul that is your best way but i warn you that you are likely to have a rough journey for i hear that the masai are about and as you know they are not pleasant customers
your best plan will be to choose a few picked men for personal servants and hunters and to hire bearers from village to village
it will give you an infinity of trouble but perhaps on the whole it will prove a cheaper and more advantageous course than engaging a caravan and you will be less liable to desertion fortunately there were at lamu at this time a party of wakwafi askari soldiers
the wakwafi who are a cross between the masai and the wataveta are a fine manly race possessing many of the good qualities of the zulu and a great capacity for civilization
they are also great hunters
as it happened these particular men had recently been on a long trip with an englishman named jutson who had started from mombasa a port about miles below lamu and journeyed right round kilimanjaro one of the highest known mountains in africa
poor fellow he had died of fever when on his return journey and within a days march of mombasa
it does seem hard that he should have gone off thus when within a few hours of safety and after having survived so many perils but so it was
his hunters buried him and then came on to lamu in a dhow
our friend the consul suggested to us that we had better try and hire these men and accordingly on the following morning we started to interview the party accompanied by an interpreter
in due course we found them in a mud hut on the outskirts of the town
three of the men were sitting outside the hut and fine franklooking fellows they were having a more or less civilized appearance
to them we cautiously opened the object of our visit at first with very scant success
they declared that they could not entertain any such idea that they were worn and weary with long travelling and that their hearts were sore at the loss of their master
they meant to go back to their homes and rest awhile
this did not sound very promising so by way of effecting a diversion i asked where the remainder of them were
i was told there were six and i saw but three
one of the men said they slept in the hut and were yet resting after their labourssleep weighed down their eyelids and sorrow made their hearts as lead it was best to sleep for with sleep came forgetfulness
but the men should be awakened presently they came out of the hut yawningthe first two men being evidently of the same race and style as those already before us but the appearance of the third and last nearly made me jump out of my skin
he was a very tall broad man quite six foot three i should say but gaunt with lean wirylooking limbs
my first glance at him told me that he was no wakwafi he was a pure bred zulu
he came out with his thin aristocraticlooking hand placed before his face to hide a yawn so i could only see that he was a keshla or ringed man and that he had a great threecornered hole in his forehead
in another second he removed his hand revealing a powerfullooking zulu face with a humorous mouth a short woolly beard tinged with grey and a pair of brown eyes keen as a hawks
i knew my man at once although i had not seen him for twelve years
how do you do umslopogaas i said quietly in zulu
among the zulus a man assumes the ring which is made of a species of black gum twisted in with the hair and polished a brilliant black when he has reached a certain dignity and age or is the husband of a sufficient number of wives
till he is in a position to wear a ring he is looked on as a boy though he may be thirtyfive years of age or even morea
q
the tall man who among his own people was commonly known as the woodpecker and also as the slaughterer started and almost let the longhandled battleaxe he held in his hand fall in his astonishment
next second he had recognized me and was saluting me in an outburst of sonorous language which made his companions the wakwafi stare
koos chief he began koosypagete

wise is the voice of our people that says mountain never meets with mountain but at daybreak or at even man shall meet again with man behold
a messenger came up from natal macumazahn is dead cried he
the land knows macumazahn no more that is years ago
and now behold now in this strange place of stinks i find macumazahn my friend
there is no room for doubt
the brush of the old jackal has gone a little grey but is not his eye as keen and are not his teeth as sharp
ha
ha
macumazahn mindest thou how thou didst plant the ball in the eye of the charging buffalomindest thou i had let him run on thus because i saw that his enthusiasm was producing a marked effect upon the minds of the five wakwafi who appeared to understand something of his talk but now i thought it time to put a stop to it for there is nothing that i hate so much as this zulu system of extravagant praisingbongering as they call it
silence i said
has all thy noisy talk been stopped up since last i saw thee that it breaks out thus and sweeps us away
what doest thou here with these menthou whom i left a chief in zululand
how is it that thou art far from thine own place and gathered together with strangers umslopogaas leant himself upon the head of his long battleaxe which was nothing else but a poleaxe with a beautiful handle of rhinoceros horn and his grim face grew sad
my father he answered i have a word to tell thee but i cannot speak it before these low people umfagozana and he glanced at the wakwafi askari it is for thine own ear
my father this will i say and here his face grew stern again a woman betrayed me to the death and covered my name with shameay my own wife a roundfaced girl betrayed me but i escaped from death ay i broke from the very hands of those who came to slay me
i struck but three blows with this mine axe inkosikaassurely my father will remember itone to the right one to the left and one in front and yet i left three men dead
and then i fled and as my father knows even now that i am old my feet are as the feet of the sassaby and there breathes not the man who by running can touch me again when once i have bounded from his side
on i sped and after me came the messengers of death and their voice was as the voice of dogs that hunt
from my own kraal i flew and as i passed she who had betrayed me was drawing water from the spring
i fleeted by her like the shadow of death and as i went i smote with mine axe and lo
her head fell it fell into the water pan
then i fled north
day after day i journeyed on for three moons i journeyed resting not stopping not but running on towards forgetfulness till i met the party of the white hunter who is now dead and am come hither with his servants
and nought have i brought with me
i who was highborn ay of the blood of chaka the great kinga chief and a captain of the regiment of the nkomabakosiam a wanderer in strange places a man without a kraal
nought have i brought save this mine axe of all my belongings this remains alone
they have divided my cattle they have taken my wives and my children know my face no more
yet with this axeand he swung the formidable weapon round his head making the air hiss as he clove itwill i cut another path to fortune
i have spoken one of the fleetest of the african antelopesa
q i shook my head at him
umslopogaas i said i know thee from of old
ever ambitious ever plotting to be great i fear me that thou hast overreached thyself at last
years ago when thou wouldst have plotted against cetywayo son of panda i warned thee and thou didst listen
but now when i was not by thee to stay thy hand thou hast dug a pit for thine own feet to fall in
is it not so
but what is done is done
who can make the dead tree green or gaze again upon last years light
who can recall the spoken word or bring back the spirit of the fallen
that which time swallows comes not up again
let it be forgotten
and now behold umslopogaas i know thee for a great warrior and a brave man faithful to the death
even in zululand where all the men are brave they called thee the slaughterer and at night told stories round the fire of thy strength and deeds
hear me now
thou seest this great man my friendand i pointed to sir henry he also is a warrior as great as thou and strong as thou art he could throw thee over his shoulder
incubu is his name
and thou seest this one also him with the round stomach the shining eye and the pleasant face
bougwan glass eye is his name and a good man is he and a true being of a curious tribe who pass their life upon the water and live in floating kraals
now we three whom thou seest would travel inland past dongo egere the great white mountain mt kenia and far into the unknown beyond
we know not what we shall find there we go to hunt and seek adventures and new places being tired of sitting still with the same old things around us
wilt thou come with us
to thee shall be given command of all our servants but what shall befall thee that i know not
once before we three journeyed thus in search of adventure and we took with us a man such as thouone umbopa and behold we left him the king of a great country with twenty impis regiments each of plumed warriors waiting on his word
how it shall go with thee i know not mayhap death awaits thee and us
wilt thou throw thyself to fortune and come or fearest thou umslopogaas the great man smiled
thou art not altogether right macumazahn he said i have plotted in my time but it was not ambition that led me to my fall but shame on me that i should have to say it a fair womans face
let it pass
so we are going to see something like the old times again macumazahn when we fought and hunted in zululand
ay i will come
come life come death what care i so that the blows fall fast and the blood runs red
i grow old i grow old and i have not fought enough
and yet am i a warrior among warriors see my scarsand he pointed to countless cicatrices stabs and cuts that marked the skin of his chest and legs and arms
see the hole in my head the brains gushed out therefrom yet did i slay him who smote and live
knowest thou how many men i have slain in fair handtohand combat macumazahn
see here is the tale of themand he pointed to long rows of notches cut in the rhinoceroshorn handle of his axe
number them macumazahnone hundred and threeand i have never counted but those whom i have ripped open nor have i reckoned those whom another man had struck alluding to the zulu custom of opening the stomach of a dead foe
they have a superstition that if this is not done as the body of their enemy swells up so will the bodies of those who killed him swell upa
q
be silent i said for i saw that he was getting the bloodfever on him be silent well art thou called the slaughterer
we would not hear of thy deeds of blood
remember if thou comest with us we fight not save in selfdefence
listen we need servants
these men and i pointed to the wakwafi who had retired a little way during our indaba talk say they will not come will not come shouted umslopogaas where is the dog who says he will not come when my father orders
here thouand with a single bound he sprang upon the wakwafi with whom i had first spoken and seizing him by the arm dragged him towards us
thou dog he said giving the terrified man a shake didst thou say that thou wouldst not go with my father
say it once more and i will choke theeand his long fingers closed round his throat as he said itthee and those with thee
hast thou forgotten how i served thy brother nay we will come with the white man gasped the man
white man went on umslopogaas in simulated fury which a very little provocation would have made real enough of whom speakest thou insolent dog nay we will go with the great chief so said umslopogaas in a quiet voice as he suddenly released his hold so that the man fell backward
i thought you would that man umslopogaas seems to have a curious moral ascendency over his companions good afterwards remarked thoughtfully
the black hand in due course we left lamu and ten days afterwards we found ourselves at a spot called charra on the tana river having gone through many adventures which need not be recorded here
amongst other things we visited a ruined city of which there are many on this coast and which must once to judge from their extent and the numerous remains of mosques and stone houses have been very populous places
these ruined cities are immeasurably ancient having i believe been places of wealth and importance as far back as the old testament times when they were centres of trade with india and elsewhere
but their glory has departed nowthe slave trade has finished themand where wealthy merchants from all parts of the then civilized world stood and bargained in the crowded marketplaces the lion holds his court at night and instead of the chattering of slaves and the eager voices of the bidders his awful note goes echoing down the ruined corridors
at this particular place we discovered on a mound covered up with rank growth and rubbish two of the most beautiful stone doorways that it is possible to conceive
the carving on them was simply exquisite and i only regret that we had no means of getting them away
no doubt they had once been the entrances to a palace of which however no traces were now to be seen though probably its ruins lay under the rising mound
gone
quite gone
the way that everything must go
like the nobles and the ladies who lived within their gates these cities have had their day and now they are as babylon and nineveh and as london and paris will one day be
nothing may endure
that is the inexorable law
men and women empires and cities thrones principalities and powers mountains rivers and unfathomed seas worlds spaces and universes all have their day and all must go
in this ruined and forgotten place the moralist may behold a symbol of the universal destiny
for this system of ours allows no room for standing stillnothing can loiter on the road and check the progress of things upwards towards life or the rush of things downwards towards death
the stern policeman fate moves us and them on on uphill and downhill and across the level there is no restingplace for the weary feet till at last the abyss swallows us and from the shores of the transitory we are hurled into the sea of the eternal
at charra we had a violent quarrel with the headman of the bearers we had hired to go as far as this and who now wished to extort large extra payment from us
in the result he threatened to set the masaiabout whom more anonon to us
that night he with all our hired bearers ran away stealing most of the goods which had been entrusted to them to carry
luckily however they had not happened to steal our rifles ammunition and personal effects not because of any delicacy of feeling on their part but owing to the fact that they chanced to be in the charge of the five wakwafis
after that it was clear to us that we had had enough of caravans and of bearers
indeed we had not much left for a caravan to carry
and yet how were we to get on
it was good who solved the question
here is water he said pointing to the tana river and yesterday i saw a party of natives hunting hippopotami in canoes
i understand that mr mackenzies mission station is on the tana river
why not get into canoes and paddle up to it this brilliant suggestion was needless to say received with acclamation and i instantly set to work to buy suitable canoes from the surrounding natives
i succeeded after a delay of three days in obtaining two large ones each hollowed out of a single log of some light wood and capable of holding six people and baggage
for these two canoes we had to pay nearly all our remaining cloth and also many other articles
on the day following our purchase of the two canoes we effected a start
in the first canoe were good sir henry and three of our wakwafi followers in the second myself umslopogaas and the other two wakwafis
as our course lay upstream we had to keep four paddles at work in each canoe which meant that the whole lot of us except good had to row away like galleyslaves and very exhausting work it was
i say except good for of course the moment that good got into a boat his foot was on his native heath and he took command of the party
and certainly he worked us
on shore good is a gentle mildmannered man and given to jocosity but as we found to our cost good in a boat was a perfect demon
to begin with he knew all about it and we didnt
on all nautical subjects from the torpedo fittings of a manofwar down to the best way of handling the paddle of an african canoe he was a perfect mine of information which to say the least of it we were not
also his ideas of discipline were of the sternest and in short he came the royal naval officer over us pretty considerably and paid us out amply for all the chaff we were wont to treat him to on land but on the other hand i am bound to say that he managed the boats admirably
after the first day good succeeded with the help of some cloth and a couple of poles in rigging up a sail in each canoe which lightened our labours not a little
but the current ran very strong against us and at the best we were not able to make more than twenty miles a day
our plan was to start at dawn and paddle along till about halfpast ten by which time the sun got too hot to allow of further exertion
then we moored our canoes to the bank and ate our frugal meal after which we ate or otherwise amused ourselves till about three oclock when we again started and rowed till within an hour of sundown when we called a halt for the night
on landing in the evening good would at once set to work with the help of the askari to build a little scherm or small enclosure fenced with thorn bushes and to light a fire
i with sir henry and umslopogaas would go out to shoot something for the pot
generally this was an easy task for all sorts of game abounded on the banks of the tana
one night sir henry shot a young cowgiraffe of which the marrowbones were excellent on another i got a couple of waterbuck right and left and once to his own intense satisfaction umslopogaas who like most zulus was a vile shot with a rifle managed to kill a fine fat eland with a martini i had lent him
sometimes we varied our food by shooting some guineafowl or bushbustard paauboth of which were numerouswith a shotgun or by catching a supply of beautiful yellow fish with which the waters of the tana swarmed and which form i believe one of the chief foodsupplies of the crocodiles
three days after our start an ominous incident occurred
we were just drawing in to the bank to make our camp as usual for the night when we caught sight of a figure standing on a little knoll not forty yards away and intensely watching our approach
one glance was sufficientalthough i was personally unacquainted with the tribeto tell me that he was a masai elmoran or young warrior
indeed had i had any doubts they would have quickly been dispelled by the terrified ejaculation of masai that burst simultaneously from the lips of our wakwafi followers who are as i think i have said themselves bastard masai
and what a figure he presented as he stood there in his savage wargear
accustomed as i have been to savages all my life i do not think that i have ever before seen anything quite so ferocious or aweinspiring
to begin with the man was enormously tall quite as tall as umslopogaas i should say and beautifully though somewhat slightly shaped but with the face of a devil
in his right hand he held a spear about five and a half feet long the blade being two and a half feet in length by nearly three inches in width and having an iron spike at the end of the handle that measured more than a foot
on his left arm was a large and wellmade elliptical shield of buffalo hide on which were painted strange heraldiclooking devices
on his shoulders was a huge cape of hawks feathers and round his neck was a naibere or strip of cotton about seventeen feet long by one and a half broad with a stripe of colour running down the middle of it
the tanned goatskin robe which formed his ordinary attire in times of peace was tied lightly round his waist so as to serve the purposes of a belt and through it were stuck on the right and left sides respectively his short pearshaped sime or sword which is made of a single piece of steel and carried in a wooden sheath and an enormous knobkerrie
but perhaps the most remarkable feature of his attire consisted of a headdress of ostrichfeathers which was fixed on the chin and passed in front of the ears to the forehead and being shaped like an ellipse completely framed the face so that the diabolical countenance appeared to project from a sort of feather firescreen
round the ankles he wore black fringes of hair and projecting from the upper portion of the calves to which they were attached were long spurs like spikes from which flowed down tufts of the beautiful black and waving hair of the colobus monkey
such was the elaborate array of the masai elmoran who stood watching the approach of our two canoes but it is one which to be appreciated must be seen only those who see it do not often live to describe it
of course i could not make out all these details of his full dress on the occasion of this my first introduction being indeed amply taken up with the consideration of the general effect but i had plenty of subsequent opportunities of becoming acquainted with the items that went to make it up
whilst we were hesitating what to do the masai warrior drew himself up in a dignified fashion shook his huge spear at us and turning vanished on the further side of the slope
hulloa holloaed sir henry from the other boat our friend the caravan leader has been as good as his word and set the masai after us
do you think it will be safe to go ashore i did not think it would be at all safe but on the other hand we had no means of cooking in the canoes and nothing that we could eat raw so it was difficult to know what to do
at last umslopogaas simplified matters by volunteering to go and reconnoitre which he did creeping off into the bush like a snake while we hung off in the stream waiting for him
in half an hour he returned and told us that there was not a masai to be seen anywhere about but that he had discovered a spot where they had recently been encamped and that from various indications he judged that they must have moved on an hour or so before the man we saw having no doubt been left to report upon our movements
thereupon we landed and having posted a sentry proceeded to cook and eat our evening meal
this done we took the situation into our serious consideration
of course it was possible that the apparition of the masai warrior had nothing to do with us that he was merely one of a band bent upon some marauding and murdering expedition against another tribe
but when we recalled the threat of the caravan leader and reflected on the ominous way in which the warrior had shaken his spear at us this did not appear very probable
on the contrary what did seem probable was that the party was after us and awaiting a favourable opportunity to attack us
this being so there were two things that we could doone of which was to go on and the other to go back
the latter idea was however rejected at once it being obvious that we should encounter as many dangers in retreat as in advance and besides we had made up our minds to journey onwards at any price
under these circumstances however we did not consider it safe to sleep ashore so we got into our canoes and paddling out into the middle of the stream which was not very wide here managed to anchor them by means of big stones fastened to ropes made of coconutfibre of which there were several fathoms in each canoe
here the mosquitoes nearly ate us up alive and this combined with anxiety as to our position effectually prevented me from sleeping as the others were doing notwithstanding the attacks of the aforesaid tana mosquitoes
and so i lay awake smoking and reflecting on many things but being of a practical turn of mind chiefly on how we were to give those masai villains the slip
it was a beautiful moonlight night and notwithstanding the mosquitoes and the great risk we were running from fever from sleeping in such a spot and forgetting that i had the cramp very badly in my right leg from squatting in a constrained position in the canoe and that the wakwafi who was sleeping beside me smelt horribly i really began to enjoy myself
the moonbeams played upon the surface of the running water that speeded unceasingly past us towards the sea like mens lives towards the grave till it glittered like a wide sheet of silver that is in the open where the trees threw no shadows
near the banks however it was very dark and the night wind sighed sadly in the reeds
to our left on the further side of the river was a little sandy bay which was clear of trees and here i could make out the forms of numerous antelopes advancing to the water till suddenly there came an ominous roar whereupon they all made off hurriedly
then after a pause i caught sight of the massive form of his majesty the lion coming down to drink his fill after meat
presently he moved on then came a crashing of the reeds about fifty yards above us and a few minutes later a huge black mass rose out of the water about twenty yards from me and snorted
it was the head of a hippopotamus
down it went without a sound only to rise again within five yards of where i sat
this was decidedly too near to be comfortable more especially as the hippopotamus was evidently animated by intense curiosity to know what on earth our canoes were
he opened his great mouth to yawn i suppose and gave me an excellent view of his ivories and i could not help reflecting how easily he could crunch up our frail canoe with a single bite
indeed i had half a mind to give him a ball from my eightbore but on reflection determined to let him alone unless he actually charged the boat
presently he sank again as noiselessly as before and i saw no more of him
just then on looking towards the bank on our right i fancied that i caught sight of a dark figure flitting between the tree trunks
i have very keen sight and i was almost sure that i saw something but whether it was bird beast or man i could not say
at the moment however a dark cloud passed over the moon and i saw no more of it
just then too although all the other sounds of the forest had ceased a species of horned owl with which i was well acquainted began to hoot with great persistency
after that save for the rustling of trees and reeds when the wind caught them there was complete silence
but somehow in the most unaccountable way i had suddenly become nervous
there was no particular reason why i should be beyond the ordinary reasons which surround the central african traveller and yet i undoubtedly was
if there is one thing more than another of which i have the most complete and entire scorn and disbelief it is of presentiments and yet here i was all of a sudden filled with and possessed by a most undoubted presentiment of approaching evil
i would not give way to it however although i felt the cold perspiration stand out upon my forehead
i would not arouse the others
worse and worse i grew my pulse fluttered like a dying mans my nerves thrilled with the horrible sense of impotent terror which anybody who is subject to nightmare will be familiar with but still my will triumphed over my fears and i lay quiet for i was half sitting half lying in the bow of the canoe only turning my face so as to command a view of umslopogaas and the two wakwafi who were sleeping alongside of and beyond me
in the distance i heard a hippopotamus splash faintly then the owl hooted again in a kind of unnatural screaming note and the wind began to moan plaintively through the trees making a heartchilling music
above was the black bosom of the cloud and beneath me swept the black flood of the water and i felt as though i and death were utterly alone between them
it was very desolate
no doubt this owl was a wingless bird
i afterwards learnt that the hooting of an owl is a favourite signal among the masai tribesa
q
suddenly my blood seemed to freeze in my veins and my heart to stand still
was it fancy or were we moving
i turned my eyes to look for the other canoe which should be alongside of us
i could not see it but instead i saw a lean and clutching black hand lifting itself above the gunwale of the little boat
surely it was a nightmare
at the same instant a dim but devilishlooking face appeared to rise out of the water and then came a lurch of the canoe the quick flash of a knife and an awful yell from the wakwafi who was sleeping by my side the same poor fellow whose odour had been annoying me and something warm spurted into my face
in an instant the spell was broken i knew that it was no nightmare but that we were attacked by swimming masai
snatching at the first weapon that came to hand which happened to be umslopogaas battleaxe i struck with all my force in the direction in which i had seen the flash of the knife
the blow fell upon a mans arm and catching it against the thick wooden gunwale of the canoe completely severed it from the body just above the wrist
as for its owner he uttered no sound or cry
like a ghost he came and like a ghost he went leaving behind him a bloody hand still gripping a great knife or rather a short sword that was buried in the heart of our poor servant
instantly there arose a hubbub and confusion and i fancied rightly or wrongly that i made out several dark heads gliding away towards the righthand bank whither we were rapidly drifting for the rope by which we were moored had been severed with a knife
as soon as i had realised this fact i also realised that the scheme had been to cut the boat loose so that it should drift on to the right bank as it would have done with the natural swing of the current where no doubt a party of masai were waiting to dig their shovelheaded spears into us
seizing one paddle myself i told umslopogaas to take another for the remaining askari was too frightened and bewildered to be of any use and together we rowed vigorously out towards the middle of the stream and not an instant too soon for in another minute we should have been aground and then there would have been an end of us
as soon as we were well out we set to work to paddle the canoe upstream again to where the other was moored and very hard and dangerous work it was in the dark and with nothing but the notes of goods stentorian shouts which he kept firing off at intervals like a foghorn to guide us
but at last we fetched up and were thankful to find that they had not been molested at all
no doubt the owner of the same hand that severed our rope should have severed theirs also but was led away from his purpose by an irresistible inclination to murder when he got the chance which while it cost us a man and him his hand undoubtedly saved all the rest of us from massacre
had it not been for that ghastly apparition over the side of the boatan apparition that i shall never forget till my dying hourthe canoe would undoubtedly have drifted ashore before i realised what had happened and this history would never have been written by me
the mission station we made the remains of our rope fast to the other canoe and sat waiting for the dawn and congratulating ourselves upon our merciful escape which really seemed to result more from the special favour of providence than from our own care or prowess
at last it came and i have not often been more grateful to see the light though so far as my canoe was concerned it revealed a ghastly sight
there in the bottom of the little boat lay the unfortunate askari the sime or sword in his bosom and the severed hand gripping the handle
i could not bear the sight so hauling up the stone which had served as an anchor to the other canoe we made it fast to the murdered man and dropped him overboard and down he went to the bottom leaving nothing but a train of bubbles behind him
alas
when our time comes most of us like him leave nothing but bubbles behind to show that we have been and the bubbles soon burst
the hand of his murderer we threw into the stream where it slowly sank
the sword of which the handle was ivory inlaid with gold evidently arab work i kept and used as a huntingknife and very useful it proved
then a man having been transferred to my canoe we once more started on in very low spirits and not feeling at all comfortable as to the future but fondly hoping to arrive at the highlands station by night
to make matters worse within an hour of sunrise it came on to rain in torrents wetting us to the skin and even necessitating the occasional baling of the canoes and as the rain beat down the wind we could not use the sails and had to get along as best as we could with our paddles
at eleven oclock we halted on an open piece of ground on the left bank of the river and the rain abating a little managed to make a fire and catch and broil some fish
we did not dare to wander about to search for game
at two oclock we got off again taking a supply of broiled fish with us and shortly afterwards the rain came on harder than ever
also the river began to get exceedingly difficult to navigate on account of the numerous rocks reaches of shallow water and the increased force of the current so that it soon became clear to us that we should not reach the rev
mackenzies hospitable roof that nighta prospect that did not tend to enliven us
toil as we would we could not make more than an average of a mile an hour and at five oclock in the afternoon by which time we were all utterly worn out we reckoned that we were still quite ten miles below the station
this being so we set to work to make the best arrangements we could for the night
after our recent experience we simply did not dare to land more especially as the banks of the tana were clothed with dense bush that would have given cover to five thousand masai and at first i thought that we were going to have another night of it in the canoes
fortunately however we espied a little rocky islet not more than fifteen miles or so square situated nearly in the middle of the river
for this we paddled and making fast the canoes landed and made ourselves as comfortable as circumstances would permit which was very uncomfortable indeed
as for the weather it continued to be simply vile the rain coming down in sheets till we were chilled to the marrow and utterly preventing us from lighting a fire
there was however one consoling circumstance about this rain our askari declared that nothing would induce the masai to make an attack in it as they intensely disliked moving about in the wet perhaps as good suggested because they hate the idea of washing
we ate some insipid and sodden cold fishthat is with the exception of umslopogaas who like most zulus cannot bear fishand took a pull of brandy of which we fortunately had a few bottles left and then began what with one exceptionwhen we same three white men nearly perished of cold on the snow of shebas breast in the course of our journey to kukuanalandwas i think the most trying night i ever experienced
it seemed absolutely endless and once or twice i feared that two of the askari would have died of the wet cold and exposure
indeed had it not been for timely doses of brandy i am sure that they would have died for no african people can stand much exposure which first paralyses and then kills them
i could see that even that iron old warrior umslopogaas felt it keenly though in strange contrast to the wakwafis who groaned and bemoaned their fate unceasingly he never uttered a single complaint
to make matters worse about one in the morning we again heard the owls ominous hooting and had at once to prepare ourselves for another attack though if it had been attempted i do not think that we could have offered a very effective resistance
but either the owl was a real one this time or else the masai were themselves too miserable to think of offensive operations which indeed they rarely if ever undertake in bush veldt
at any rate we saw nothing of them
at last the dawn came gliding across the water wrapped in wreaths of ghostly mist and with the daylight the rain ceased and then out came the glorious sun sucking up the mists and warming the chill air
benumbed and utterly exhausted we dragged ourselves to our feet and went and stood in the bright rays and were thankful for them
i can quite understand how it is that primitive people become sun worshippers especially if their conditions of life render them liable to exposure
in half an hour more we were once again making fair progress with the help of a good wind
our spirits had returned with the sunshine and we were ready to laugh at difficulties and dangers that had been almost crushing on the previous day
and so we went on cheerily till about eleven oclock
just as we were thinking of halting as usual to rest and try to shoot something to eat a sudden bend in the river brought us in sight of a substantiallooking european house with a veranda round it splendidly situated upon a hill and surrounded by a high stone wall with a ditch on the outer side
right against and overshadowing the house was an enormous pine the top of which we had seen through a glass for the last two days but of course without knowing that it marked the site of the mission station
i was the first to see the house and could not restrain myself from giving a hearty cheer in which the others including the natives joined lustily
there was no thought of halting now
on we laboured for unfortunately though the house seemed quite near it was still a long way off by river until at last by one oclock we found ourselves at the bottom of the slope on which the building stood
running the canoes to the bank we disembarked and were just hauling them up on to the shore when we perceived three figures dressed in ordinary englishlooking clothes hurrying down through a grove of trees to meet us
a gentleman a lady and a little girl ejaculated good after surveying the trio through his eyeglass walking in a civilized fashion through a civilized garden to meet us in this place
hang me if this isnt the most curious thing we have seen yet good was right it certainly did seem odd and out of placemore like a scene out of a dream or an italian opera than a real tangible fact and the sense of unreality was not lessened when we heard ourselves addressed in good broad scotch which however i cannot reproduce
how do you do sirs said mr mackenzie a greyhaired angular man with a kindly face and red cheeks i hope i see you very well
my natives told me an hour ago they spied two canoes with white men in them coming up the river so we have just come down to meet you and it is very glad that we are to see a white face again let me tell you put in the ladya charming and refinedlooking person
we took off our hats in acknowledgment and proceeded to introduce ourselves
and now said mr mackenzie you must all be hungry and weary so come on gentlemen come on and right glad we are to see you
the last white who visited us was alphonseyou will see alphonse presentlyand that was a year ago meanwhile we had been walking up the slope of the hill the lower portion of which was fenced off sometimes with quince fences and sometimes with rough stone walls into kaffir gardens just now full of crops of mealies pumpkins potatoes etc
in the corners of these gardens were groups of neat mushroomshaped huts occupied by mr mackenzies mission natives whose women and children came pouring out to meet us as we walked
through the centre of the gardens ran the roadway up which we were walking
it was bordered on each side by a line of orange trees which although they had only been planted ten years had in the lovely climate of the uplands below mt kenia the base of which is about feet above the coastline level already grown to imposing proportions and were positively laden with golden fruit
after a stiffish climb of a quarter of a mile or sofor the hillside was steepwe came to a splendid quince fence also covered with fruit which enclosed mr mackenzie told us a space of about four acres of ground that contained his private garden house church and outbuildings and indeed the whole hilltop
and what a garden it was
i have always loved a good garden and i could have thrown up my hands for joy when i saw mr mackenzies
first there were rows upon rows of standard european fruittrees all grafted for on top of this hill the climate was so temperate that nearly all the english vegetables trees and flowers flourished luxuriantly even including several varieties of the apple which generally runs to wood in a warm climate and obstinately refuses to fruit
then there were strawberries and tomatoes such tomatoes
and melons and cucumbers and indeed every sort of vegetable and fruit
well you have something like a garden i said overpowered with admiration not untouched by envy
yes answered the missionary it is a very good garden and has well repaid my labour but it is the climate that i have to thank
if you stick a peachstone into the ground it will bear fruit the fourth year and a rosecutting will bloom in a year
it is a lovely clime just then we came to a ditch about ten feet wide and full of water on the other side of which was a loopholed stone wall eight feet high and with sharp flints plentifully set in mortar on the coping
there said mr mackenzie pointing to the ditch and wall this is my magnum opus at least this and the church which is the other side of the house
it took me and twenty natives two years to dig the ditch and build the wall but i never felt safe till it was done and now i can defy all the savages in africa for the spring that fills the ditch is inside the wall and bubbles out at the top of the hill winter and summer alike and i always keep a store of four months provision in the house crossing over a plank and through a very narrow opening in the wall we entered into what mrs mackenzie called her domainnamely the flower garden the beauty of which is really beyond my power to describe
i do not think i ever saw such roses gardenias or camellias all reared from seeds or cuttings sent from england and there was also a patch given up to a collection of bulbous roots mostly collected by miss flossie mr mackenzies little daughter from the surrounding country some of which were surpassingly beautiful
in the middle of this garden and exactly opposite the veranda a beautiful fountain of clear water bubbled up from the ground and fell into a stonework basin which had been carefully built to receive it whence the overflow found its way by means of a drain to the moat round the outer wall this moat in its turn serving as a reservoir whence an unfailing supply of water was available to irrigate all the gardens below
the house itself a massively built singlestoried building was roofed with slabs of stone and had a handsome veranda in front
it was built on three sides of a square the fourth side being taken up by the kitchens which stood separate from the housea very good plan in a hot country
in the centre of this square thus formed was perhaps the most remarkable object that we had yet seen in this charming place and that was a single tree of the conifer tribe varieties of which grow freely on the highlands of this part of africa
this splendid tree which mr mackenzie informed us was a landmark for fifty miles round and which we had ourselves seen for the last forty miles of our journey must have been nearly three hundred feet in height the trunk measuring about sixteen feet in diameter at a yard from the ground
for some seventy feet it rose a beautiful tapering brown pillar without a single branch but at that height splendid dark green boughs which looked at from below had the appearance of gigantic fernleaves sprang out horizontally from the trunk projecting right over the house and flowergarden to both of which they furnished a grateful proportion of shade withoutbeing so high upoffering any impediment to the passage of light and air
what a beautiful tree exclaimed sir henry
yes you are right it is a beautiful tree
there is not another like it in all the country round that i know of answered mr mackenzie
i call it my watch tower
as you see i have a rope ladder fixed to the lowest bough and if i want to see anything that is going on within fifteen miles or so all i have to do is to run up it with a spyglass
but you must be hungry and i am sure the dinner is cooked
come in my friends it is but a rough place but well enough for these savage parts and i can tell you what we have gota french cook and he led the way on to the veranda
as i was following him and wondering what on earth he could mean by this there suddenly appeared through the door that opened on to the veranda from the house a dapper little man dressed in a neat blue cotton suit with shoes made of tanned hide and remarkable for a bustling air and most enormous black mustachios shaped into an upward curve and coming to a point for all the world like a pair of buffalohorns
madame bids me for to say that dinnar is sarved
messieurs my compliments then suddenly perceiving umslopogaas who was loitering along after us and playing with his battleaxe he threw up his hands in astonishment
ah mais quel homme he ejaculated in french quel sauvage affreux take but note of his huge choppare and the great pit in his head ay said mr mackenzie what are you talking about alphonse talking about replied the little frenchman his eyes still fixed upon umslopogaas whose general appearance seemed to fascinate him why i talk of himand he rudely pointedof ce monsieur noir at this everybody began to laugh and umslopogaas perceiving that he was the object of remark frowned ferociously for he had a most lordly dislike of anything like a personal liberty
parbleu said alphonse he is angeredhe makes the grimace
i like not his air
i vanish and he did with considerable rapidity
mr mackenzie joined heartily in the shout of laughter which we indulged in
he is a queer characteralphonse he said
by and by i will tell you his history in the meanwhile let us try his cooking might i ask said sir henry after we had eaten a most excellent dinner how you came to have a french cook in these wilds oh answered mrs mackenzie he arrived here of his own accord about a year ago and asked to be taken into our service
he had got into some trouble in france and fled to zanzibar where he found an application had been made by the french government for his extradition
whereupon he rushed off upcountry and fell in when nearly starved with our caravan of men who were bringing us our annual supply of goods and was brought on here
you should get him to tell you the story when dinner was over we lit our pipes and sir henry proceeded to give our host a description of our journey up here over which he looked very grave
it is evident to me he said that those rascally masai are following you and i am very thankful that you have reached this house in safety
i do not think that they will dare to attack you here
it is unfortunate though that nearly all my men have gone down to the coast with ivory and goods
there are two hundred of them in the caravan and the consequence is that i have not more than twenty men available for defensive purposes in case they should attack us
but still i will just give a few orders and calling a black man who was loitering about outside in the garden he went to the window and addressed him in a swahili dialect
the man listened and then saluted and departed
i am sure i devoutly hope that we shall bring no such calamity upon you said i anxiously when he had taken his seat again
rather than bring those bloodthirsty villains about your ears we will move on and take our chance you will do nothing of the sort
if the masai come they come and there is an end on it and i think we can give them a pretty warm greeting
i would not show any man the door for all the masai in the world that reminds me i said the consul at lamu told me that he had had a letter from you in which you said that a man had arrived here who reported that he had come across a white people in the interior
do you think that there was any truth in his story
i ask because i have once or twice in my life heard rumours from natives who have come down from the far north of the existence of such a race mr mackenzie by way of answer went out of the room and returned bringing with him a most curious sword
it was long and all the blade which was very thick and heavy was to within a quarter of an inch of the cutting edge worked into an ornamental pattern exactly as we work soft wood with a fretsaw the steel however being invariably pierced in such a way as not to interfere with the strength of the sword
this in itself was sufficiently curious but what was still more so was that all the edges of the hollow spaces cut through the substance of the blade were most beautifully inlaid with gold which was in some way that i cannot understand welded on to the steel
since i saw the above i have examined hundreds of these swords but have never been able to discover how the gold plates were inlaid in the fretwork
the armourers who make them in zuvendis bind themselves by oath not to reveal the secreta
q
there said mr mackenzie did you ever see a sword like that we all examined it and shook our heads
well i have got it to show you because this is what the man who said he had seen the white people brought with him and because it does more or less give an air of truth to what i should otherwise have set down as a lie
look here i will tell you all that i know about the matter which is not much
one afternoon just before sunset i was sitting on the veranda when a poor miserable starvedlooking man came limping up and squatted down before me
i asked him where he came from and what he wanted and thereon he plunged into a long rambling narrative about how he belonged to a tribe far in the north and how his tribe was destroyed by another tribe and he with a few other survivors driven still further north past a lake named laga
thence it appears he made his way to another lake that lay up in the mountains a lake without a bottom he called it and here his wife and brother died of an infectious sicknessprobably smallpoxwhereon the people drove him out of their villages into the wilderness where he wandered miserably over mountains for ten days after which he got into dense thorn forest and was one day found there by some white men who were hunting and who took him to a place where all the people were white and lived in stone houses
here he remained a week shut up in a house till one night a man with a white beard whom he understood to be a medicineman came and inspected him after which he was led off and taken through the thorn forest to the confines of the wilderness and given food and this sword at least so he said and turned loose well said sir henry who had been listening with breathless interest and what did he do then oh
he seems according to his account to have gone through sufferings and hardships innumerable and to have lived for weeks on roots and berries and such things as he could catch and kill
but somehow he did live and at last by slow degrees made his way south and reached this place
what the details of his journey were i never learnt for i told him to return on the morrow bidding one of my headmen look after him for the night
the headman took him away but the poor man had the itch so badly that the headmans wife would not have him in the hut for fear of catching it so he was given a blanket and told to sleep outside
as it happened we had a lion hanging about here just then and most unhappily he winded this unfortunate wanderer and springing on him bit his head almost off without the people in the hut knowing anything about it and there was an end of him and his story about the white people and whether or no there is any truth in it is more than i can tell you
what do you think mr quatermain i shook my head and answered i dont know
there are so many queer things hidden away in the heart of this great continent that i should be sorry to assert that there was no truth in it
anyhow we mean to try and find out
we intend to journey to lekakisera and thence if we live to get so far to this lake laga and if there are any white people beyond we will do our best to find them you are very venturesome people said mr mackenzie with a smile and the subject dropped
alphonse and his annette after dinner we thoroughly inspected all the outbuildings and grounds of the station which i consider the most successful as well as the most beautiful place of the sort that i have seen in africa
we then returned to the veranda where we found umslopogaas taking advantage of this favourable opportunity to clean all the rifles thoroughly
this was the only work that he ever did or was asked to do for as a zulu chief it was beneath his dignity to work with his hands but such as it was he did it very well
it was a curious sight to see the great zulu sitting there upon the floor his battleaxe resting against the wall behind him whilst his long aristocraticlooking hands were busily employed delicately and with the utmost care cleaning the mechanism of the breechloaders
he had a name for each gun
onea double fourbore belonging to sir henrywas the thunderer another my express which had a peculiarly sharp report was the little one who spoke like a whip the winchester repeaters were the women who talked so fast that you could not tell one word from another the six martinis were the common people and so on with them all
it was very curious to hear him addressing each gun as he cleaned it as though it were an individual and in a vein of the quaintest humour
he did the same with his battleaxe which he seemed to look upon as an intimate friend and to which he would at times talk by the hour going over all his old adventures with itand dreadful enough some of them were
by a piece of grim humour he had named this axe inkosikaas which is the zulu word for chieftainess
for a long while i could not make out why he gave it such a name and at last i asked him when he informed me that the axe was very evidently feminine because of her womanly habit of prying very deep into things and that she was clearly a chieftainess because all men fell down before her struck dumb at the sight of her beauty and power
in the same way he would consult inkosikaas if in any dilemma and when i asked him why he did so he informed me it was because she must needs be wise having looked into so many peoples brains
i took up the axe and closely examined this formidable weapon
it was as i have said of the nature of a poleaxe
the haft made out of an enormous rhinoceros horn was three feet three inches long about an inch and a quarter thick and with a knob at the end as large as a maltese orange left there to prevent the hand from slipping
this horn haft though so massive was as flexible as cane and practically unbreakable but to make assurance doubly sure it was whipped round at intervals of a few inches with copper wireall the parts where the hands grip being thus treated
just above where the haft entered the head were scored a number of little nicks each nick representing a man killed in battle with the weapon
the axe itself was made of the most beautiful steel and apparently of european manufacture though umslopogaas did not know where it came from having taken it from the hand of a chief he had killed in battle many years before
it was not very heavy the head weighing two and a half pounds as nearly as i could judge
the cutting part was slightly concave in shapenot convex as is generally the case with savage battleaxesand sharp as a razor measuring five and threequarter inches across the widest part
from the back of the axe sprang a stout spike four inches long for the last two of which it was hollow and shaped like a leather punch with an opening for anything forced into the hollow at the punch end to be pushed out abovein fact in this respect it exactly resembled a butchers poleaxe
it was with this punch end as we afterwards discovered that umslopogaas usually struck when fighting driving a neat round hole in his adversarys skull and only using the broad cutting edge for a circular sweep or sometimes in a mle
i think he considered the punch a neater and more sportsmanlike tool and it was from his habit of pecking at his enemy with it that he got his name of woodpecker
certainly in his hands it was a terribly efficient one
such was umslopogaas axe inkosikaas the most remarkable and fatal handtohand weapon that i ever saw and one which he cherished as much as his own life
it scarcely ever left his hand except when he was eating and then he always sat with it under his leg
just as i returned his axe to umslopogaas miss flossie came up and took me off to see her collection of flowers african liliums and blooming shrubs some of which are very beautiful many of the varieties being quite unknown to me and also i believe to botanical science
i asked her if she had ever seen or heard of the goya lily which central african explorers have told me they have occasionally met with and whose wonderful loveliness has filled them with astonishment
this lily which the natives say blooms only once in ten years flourishes in the most arid soil
compared to the size of the bloom the bulb is small generally weighing about four pounds
as for the flower itself which i afterwards saw under circumstances likely to impress its appearance fixedly in my mind i know not how to describe its beauty and splendour or the indescribable sweetness of its perfume
the flowerfor it has only one bloomrises from the crown of the bulb on a thick fleshy and flatsided stem the specimen that i saw measured fourteen inches in diameter and is somewhat trumpetshaped like the bloom of an ordinary longiflorum set vertically
first there is the green sheath which in its early stage is not unlike that of a waterlily but which as the bloom opens splits into four portions and curls back gracefully towards the stem
then comes the bloom itself a single dazzling arch of white enclosing another cup of richest velvety crimson from the heart of which rises a goldencoloured pistil
i have never seen anything to equal this bloom in beauty or fragrance and as i believe it is but little known i take the liberty to describe it at length
looking at it for the first time i well remember that i realised how even in a flower there dwells something of the majesty of its maker
to my great delight miss flossie told me that she knew the flower well and had tried to grow it in her garden but without success adding however that as it should be in bloom at this time of the year she thought that she could procure me a specimen
after that i fell to asking her if she was not lonely up here among all these savage people and without any companions of her own age
lonely she said
oh indeed no
i am as happy as the day is long and besides i have my own companions
why i should hate to be buried in a crowd of white girls all just like myself so that nobody could tell the difference
here she said giving her head a little toss i am i and every native for miles around knows the waterlilyfor that is what they call meand is ready to do what i want but in the books that i have read about little girls in england it is not like that
everybody thinks them a trouble and they have to do what their schoolmistress likes
oh
it would break my heart to be put in a cage like that and not to be freefree as the air would you not like to learn i asked
so i do learn
father teaches me latin and french and arithmetic and are you never afraid among all these wild men afraid
oh no
they never interfere with me
i think they believe that i am ngai of the divinity because i am so white and have fair hair
and look here and diving her little hand into the bodice of her dress she produced a doublebarrelled nickelplated derringer i always carry that loaded and if anybody tried to touch me i should shoot him
once i shot a leopard that jumped upon my donkey as i was riding along
it frightened me very much but i shot it in the ear and it fell dead and i have its skin upon my bed
look there she went on in an altered voice touching me on the arm and pointing to some faraway object i said just now that i had companions there is one of them i looked and for the first time there burst upon my sight the glory of mount kenia
hitherto the mountain had always been hidden in mist but now its radiant beauty was unveiled for many thousand feet although the base was still wrapped in vapour so that the lofty peak or pillar towering nearly twenty thousand feet into the sky appeared to be a fairy vision hanging between earth and heaven and based upon the clouds
the solemn majesty and beauty of this white peak are together beyond the power of my poor pen to describe
there it rose straight and sheera glittering white glory its crest piercing the very blue of heaven
as i gazed at it with that little girl i felt my whole heart lifted up with an indescribable emotion and for a moment great and wonderful thoughts seemed to break upon my mind even as the arrows of the setting sun were breaking upon kenias snows
mr mackenzies natives call the mountain the finger of god and to me it did seem eloquent of immortal peace and of the pure high calm that surely lies above this fevered world
somewhere i had heard a line of poetry a thing of beauty is a joy for ever and now it came into my mind and for the first time i thoroughly understood what it meant
base indeed would be the man who could look upon that mighty snowwreathed pile that white old tombstone of the yearsand not feel his own utter insignificance and by whatever name he calls him worship god in his heart
such sights are like visions of the spirit they throw wide the windows of the chamber of our small selfishness and let in a breath of that air that rushes round the rolling spheres and for a while illumine our darkness with a faroff gleam of the white light which beats upon the throne
yes such things of beauty are indeed a joy for ever and i can well understand what little flossie meant when she talked of kenia as her companion
as umslopogaas savage old zulu that he was said when i pointed out to him the peak hanging in the glittering air a man might look thereon for a thousand years and yet be hungry to see but he gave rather another colour to his poetical idea when he added in a sort of chant and with a touch of that weird imagination for which the man was remarkable that when he was dead he should like his spirit to sit upon that snowclad peak for ever and to rush down the steep white sides in the breath of the whirlwind or on the flash of the lightning and slay and slay and slay
slay what you old bloodhound i asked
this rather puzzled him but at length he answered the other shadows so thou wouldst continue thy murdering even after death i said
i murder not he answered hotly i kill in fair fight
man is born to kill
he who kills not when his blood is hot is a woman and no man
the people who kill not are slaves
i say i kill in fair fight and when i am in the shadow as you white men say i hope to go on killing in fair fight
may my shadow be accursed and chilled to the bone for ever if it should fall to murdering like a bushman with his poisoned arrows and he stalked away with much dignity and left me laughing
just then the spies whom our host had sent out in the morning to find out if there were any traces of our masai friends about returned and reported that the country had been scoured for fifteen miles round without a single elmoran being seen and that they believed that those gentry had given up the pursuit and returned whence they came
mr mackenzie gave a sigh of relief when he heard this and so indeed did we for we had had quite enough of the masai to last us for some time
indeed the general opinion was that finding we had reached the mission station in safety they had knowing its strength given up the pursuit of us as a bad job
how illjudged that view was the sequel will show
after the spies had gone and mrs mackenzie and flossie had retired for the night alphonse the little frenchman came out and sir henry who is a very good french scholar got him to tell us how he came to visit central africa which he did in a most extraordinary lingo that for the most part i shall not attempt to reproduce
my grandfather he began was a soldier of the guard and served under napoleon
he was in the retreat from moscow and lived for ten days on his own leggings and a pair he stole from a comrade
he used to get drunkhe died drunk and i remember playing at drums on his coffin
my father here we suggested that he might skip his ancestry and come to the point
bien messieurs replied this comical little man with a polite bow
i did only wish to demonstrate that the military principle is not hereditary
my grandfather was a splendid man six feet two high broad in proportion a swallower of fire and gaiters
also he was remarkable for his moustache
to me there remains the moustache andnothing more
i am messieurs a cook and i was born at marseilles
in that dear town i spent my happy youth
for years and years i washed the dishes at the htel continental
ah those were golden days and he sighed
i am a frenchman
need i say messieurs that i admire beauty
nay i adore the fair
messieurs we admire all the roses in a garden but we pluck one
i plucked one and alas messieurs it pricked my finger
she was a chambermaid her name annette her figure ravishing her face an angels her heartalas messieurs that i should have to own itblack and slippery as a patent leather boot
i loved to desperation i adored her to despair
she transported mein every sense she inspired me
never have i cooked as i cooked for i had been promoted at the hotel when annette my adored annette smiled on me
neverand here his manly voice broke into a sobnever shall i cook so well again here he melted into tears
come cheer up said sir henry in french smacking him smartly on the back
theres no knowing what may happen you know
to judge from your dinner today i should say you were in a fair way to recovery alphonse stopped weeping and began to rub his back
monsieur he said doubtless means to console but his hand is heavy
to continue we loved and were happy in each others love
the birds in their little nest could not be happier than alphonse and his annette
then came the blowsapristiwhen i think of it
messieurs will forgive me if i wipe away a tear
mine was an evil number i was drawn for the conscription
fortune would be avenged on me for having won the heart of annette
the evil moment came i had to go
i tried to run away but i was caught by brutal soldiers and they banged me with the buttend of muskets till my mustachios curled with pain
i had a cousin a linendraper welltodo but very ugly
he had drawn a good number and sympathized when they thumped me
to thee my cousin i said to thee in whose veins flows the blue blood of our heroic grandparent to thee i consign annette
watch over her whilst i hunt for glory in the bloody field make your mind easy said he i will as the sequel shows he did
i went
i lived in barracks on black soup
i am a refined man and a poet by nature and i suffered tortures from the coarse horror of my surroundings
there was a drill sergeant and he had a cane
ah that cane how it curled
alas never can i forget it
one morning came the news my battalion was ordered to tonquin
the drill sergeant and the other coarse monsters rejoiced
ii made enquiries about tonquin
they were not satisfactory
in tonquin are savage chinese who rip you open
my artistic tastesfor i am also an artistrecoiled from the idea of being ripped open
the great man makes up his mind quickly
i made up my mind
i determined not to be ripped open
i deserted
i reached marseilles disguised as an old man
i went to the house of my cousinhe in whom runs my grandfathers heroic bloodand there sat annette
it was the season of cherries
they took a double stalk
at each end was a cherry
my cousin put one into his mouth annette put the other in hers
then they drew the stalks in till their eyes metand alas alas that i should have to say itthey kissed
the game was a pretty one but it filled me with fury
the heroic blood of my grandfather boiled up in me
i rushed into the kitchen
i struck my cousin with the old mans crutch
he felli had slain him
alas i believe that i did slay him
annette screamed
the gendarmes came
i fled
i reached the harbour
i hid aboard a vessel
the vessel put to sea
the captain found me and beat me
he took an opportunity
he posted a letter from a foreign port to the police
he did not put me ashore because i cooked so well
i cooked for him all the way to zanzibar
when i asked for payment he kicked me
the blood of my heroic grandfather boiled within me and i shook my fist in his face and vowed to have my revenge
he kicked me again
at zanzibar there was a telegram
i cursed the man who invented telegraphs
now i curse him again
i was to be arrested for desertion for murder and que saisje i escaped from the prison
i fled i starved
i met the men of monsieur le cur
they brought me here
i am full of woe
but i return not to france
better to risk my life in these horrible places than to know the bagne he paused and we nearly choked with laughter having to turn our faces away
ah
you weep messieurs he said
no wonderit is a sad story perhaps said sir henry the heroic blood of your grandparent will triumph after all perhaps you will still be great
at any rate we shall see
and now i vote we go to bed
i am dead tired and we had not much sleep on that confounded rock last night and so we did and very strange the tidy rooms and clean white sheets seemed to us after our recent experiences
umslopogaas makes a promise next morning at breakfast i missed flossie and asked where she was
well said her mother when i got up this morning i found a note put outside my door in whichbut here it is you can read it for yourself and she gave me the slip of paper on which the following was written dearest mit is just dawn and i am off to the hills to get mr qa bloom of the lily he wants so dont expect me till you see me
i have taken the white donkey and nurse and a couple of boys are coming with mealso something to eat as i may be away all day for i am determined to get the lily if i have to go twenty miles for itflossie i hope she will be all right i said a little anxiously i never meant her to trouble after the flower ah flossie can look after herself said her mother she often goes off in this way like a true child of the wilderness but mr mackenzie who came in just then and saw the note for the first time looked rather grave though he said nothing
after breakfast was over i took him aside and asked him whether it would not be possible to send after the girl and get her back having in view the possibility of there still being some masai hanging about at whose hands she might come to harm
i fear it would be of no use he answered
she may be fifteen miles off by now and it is impossible to say what path she has taken
there are the hills and he pointed to a long range of rising ground stretching almost parallel with the course followed by the river tana but gradually sloping down to a dense bushclad plain about five miles short of the house
here i suggested that we might get up the great tree over the house and search the country round with a spyglass and this after mr mackenzie had given some orders to his people to try and follow flossies spoor we did
the ascent of the mighty tree was rather an alarming performance even with a sound ropeladder fixed at both ends to climb up at least to a landsman but good came up like a lamplighter
on reaching the height at which the first fernshaped boughs sprang from the bole we stepped without any difficulty upon a platform made of boards nailed from one bough to another and large enough to accommodate a dozen people
as for the view it was simply glorious
in every direction the bush rolled away in great billows for miles and miles as far as the glass would show only here and there broken by the brighter green of patches of cultivation or by the glittering surface of lakes
to the northwest kenia reared his mighty head and we could trace the tana river curling like a silver snake almost from his feet and far away beyond us towards the ocean
it is a glorious country and only wants the hand of civilized man to make it a most productive one
but look as we would we could see no signs of flossie and her donkey so at last we had to come down disappointed
on reaching the veranda i found umslopogaas sitting there slowly and lightly sharpening his axe with a small whetstone he always carried with him
what doest thou umslopogaas i asked
i smell blood was the answer and i could get no more out of him
after dinner we again went up the tree and searched the surrounding country with a spyglass but without result
when we came down umslopogaas was still sharpening inkosikaas although she already had an edge like a razor
standing in front of him and regarding him with a mixture of fear and fascination was alphonse
and certainly he did seem an alarming objectsitting there zulu fashion on his haunches a wild look upon his intensely savage and yet intellectual face sharpening sharpening sharpening at the murderouslooking axe
oh the monster the horrible man said the little french cook lifting his hands in amazement
see but the hole in his head the skin beats on it up and down like a babys
who would nurse such a baby and he burst out laughing at the idea
for a moment umslopogaas looked up from his sharpening and a sort of evil light played in his dark eyes
what does the little buffaloheifer so named by umslopogaas on account of his mustachios and feminine characteristics say
let him be careful or i will cut his horns
beware little man monkey beware unfortunately alphonse who was getting over his fear of him went on laughing at ce drle dun monsieur noir
i was about to warn him to desist when suddenly the huge zulu bounded off the veranda on to the open space where alphonse was standing his features alive with a sort of malicious enthusiasm and began swinging the axe round and round over the frenchmans head
stand still i shouted do not move as you value your lifehe will not hurt you but i doubt if alphonse heard me being fortunately for himself almost petrified with horror
then followed the most extraordinary display of sword or rather of axemanship that i ever saw
first of all the axe went flying round and round over the top of alphonses head with an angry whirl and such extraordinary swiftness that it looked like a continuous band of steel ever getting nearer and yet nearer to that unhappy individuals skull till at last it grazed it as it flew
then suddenly the motion was changed and it seemed to literally flow up and down his body and limbs never more than an eighth of an inch from them and yet never striking them
it was a wonderful sight to see the little man fixed there having apparently realised that to move would be to run the risk of sudden death while his black tormentor towered over him and wrapped him round with the quick flashes of the axe
for a minute or more this went on till suddenly i saw the moving brightness travel down the side of alphonses face and then outwards and stop
as it did so a tuft of something black fell to the ground it was the tip of one of the little frenchmans curling mustachios
umslopogaas leant upon the handle of inkosikaas and broke into a long low laugh and alphonse overcome with fear sank into a sitting posture on the ground while we stood astonished at this exhibition of almost superhuman skill and mastery of a weapon
inkosikaas is sharp enough he shouted the blow that clipped the buffaloheifers horn would have split a man from the crown to the chin
few could have struck it but i none could have struck it and not taken off the shoulder too
look thou little heifer
am i a good man to laugh at thinkest thou
for a space hast thou stood within a hairsbreadth of death
laugh not again lest the hairsbreadth be wanting
i have spoken what meanest thou by such mad tricks i asked of umslopogaas indignantly
surely thou art mad
twenty times didst thou go near to slaying the man and yet macumazahn i slew not
thrice as inkosikaas flew the spirit entered into me to end him and send her crashing through his skull but i did not
nay it was but a jest but tell the heifer that it is not well to mock at such as i
now i go to make a shield for i smell blood macumazahnof a truth i smell blood
before the battle hast thou not seen the vulture grow of a sudden in the sky
they smell the blood macumazahn and my scent is more keen than theirs
there is a dry oxhide down yonder i go to make a shield that is an uncomfortable retainer of yours said mr mackenzie who had witnessed this extraordinary scene
he has frightened alphonse out of his wits look and he pointed to the frenchman who with a scared white face and trembling limbs was making his way into the house
i dont think that he will ever laugh at le monsieur noir again yes answered i it is ill jesting with such as he
when he is roused he is like a fiend and yet he has a kind heart in his own fierce way
i remember years ago seeing him nurse a sick child for a week
he is a strange character but true as steel and a strong stick to rest on in danger he says he smells blood said mr mackenzie
i only trust he is not right
i am getting very fearful about my little girl
she must have gone far or she would be home by now
it is halfpast three oclock i pointed out that she had taken food with her and very likely would not in the ordinary course of events return till nightfall but i myself felt very anxious and fear that my anxiety betrayed itself
shortly after this the people whom mr mackenzie had sent out to search for flossie returned stating that they had followed the spoor of the donkey for a couple of miles and had then lost it on some stony ground nor could they discover it again
they had however scoured the country far and wide but without success
after this the afternoon wore drearily on and towards evening there still being no signs of flossie our anxiety grew very keen
as for the poor mother she was quite prostrated by her fears and no wonder but the father kept his head wonderfully well
everything that could be done was done people were sent out in all directions shots were fired and a continuous outlook kept from the great tree but without avail
and then it grew dark and still no sign of fairhaired little flossie
at eight oclock we had supper
it was but a sorrowful meal and mrs mackenzie did not appear at it
we three also were very silent for in addition to our natural anxiety as to the fate of the child we were weighed down by the sense that we had brought this trouble on the head of our kind host
when supper was nearly at an end i made an excuse to leave the table
i wanted to get outside and think the situation over
i went on to the veranda and having lit my pipe sat down on a seat about a dozen feet from the righthand end of the structure which was as the reader may remember exactly opposite one of the narrow doors of the protecting wall that enclosed the house and flower garden
i had been sitting there perhaps six or seven minutes when i thought i heard the door move
i looked in that direction and i listened but being unable to make out anything concluded that i must have been mistaken
it was a darkish night the moon not having yet risen
another minute passed when suddenly something round fell with a soft but heavy thud upon the stone flooring of the veranda and came bounding and rolling along past me
for a moment i did not rise but sat wondering what it could be
finally i concluded it must have been an animal
just then however another idea struck me and i got up quick enough
the thing lay quite still a few feet beyond me
i put down my hand towards it and it did not move clearly it was not an animal
my hand touched it
it was soft and warm and heavy
hurriedly i lifted it and held it up against the faint starlight
it was a newly severed human head i am an old hand and not easily upset but i own that that ghastly sight made me feel sick
how had the thing come there
whose was it
i put it down and ran to the little doorway
i could see nothing hear nobody
i was about to go out into the darkness beyond but remembering that to do so was to expose myself to the risk of being stabbed i drew back shut the door and bolted it
then i returned to the veranda and in as careless a voice as i could command called curtis
i fear however that my tones must have betrayed me for not only sir henry but also good and mackenzie rose from the table and came hurrying out
what is it said the clergyman anxiously
then i had to tell them
mr mackenzie turned pale as death under his red skin
we were standing opposite the hall door and there was a light in it so that i could see
he snatched the head up by the hair and held it against the light
it is the head of one of the men who accompanied flossie he said with a gasp
thank god it is not hers we all stood and stared at each other aghast
what was to be done
just then there was a knocking at the door that i had bolted and a voice cried open my father open the door was unlocked and in sped a terrified man
he was one of the spies who had been sent out
my father he cried the masai are on us
a great body of them have passed round the hill and are moving towards the old stone kraal down by the little stream
my father make strong thy heart
in the midst of them i saw the white ass and on it sat the waterlily flossie
an elmoran young warrior led the ass and by its side walked the nurse weeping
the men who went with her in the morning i saw not was the child alive asked mr mackenzie hoarsely
she was white as the snow but well my father
they passed quite close to me and looking up from where i lay hid i saw her face against the sky god help her and us groaned the clergyman
how many are there of them i asked
more than two hundredtwo hundred and half a hundred once more we looked one on the other
what was to be done
just then there rose a loud insistent cry outside the wall
open the door white man open the door
a heralda herald to speak with thee thus cried the voice
umslopogaas ran to the wall and reaching with his long arms to the coping lifted his head above it and gazed over
i see but one man he said
he is armed and carries a basket in his hand open the door i said
umslopogaas take thine axe and stand thereby
let one man pass
if another follows slay the door was unbarred
in the shadow of the wall stood umslopogaas his axe raised above his head to strike
just then the moon came out
there was a moments pause and then in stalked a masai elmoran clad in the full war panoply that i have already described but bearing a large basket in his hand
the moonlight shone bright upon his great spear as he walked
he was physically a splendid man apparently about thirtyfive years of age
indeed none of the masai that i saw were under six feet high though mostly quite young
when he got opposite to us he halted put down the basket and stuck the spike of his spear into the ground so that it stood upright
let us talk he said
the first messenger we sent to you could not talk and he pointed to the head which lay upon the paving of the stoepa ghastly sight in the moonlight but i have words to speak if ye have ears to hear
also i bring presents and he pointed to the basket and laughed with an air of swaggering insolence that is perfectly indescribable and yet which one could not but admire seeing that he was surrounded by enemies
say on said mr mackenzie
i am the lygonani war captain of a party of the masai of the guasa amboni
i and my men followed these three white men and he pointed to sir henry good and myself but they were too clever for us and escaped hither
we have a quarrel with them and are going to kill them are you my friend said i to myself
in following these men we this morning caught two black men one black woman a white donkey and a white girl
one of the black men we killedthere is his head upon the pavement the other ran away
the black woman the little white girl and the white ass we took and brought with us
in proof thereof have i brought this basket that she carried
is it not thy daughters basket mr mackenzie nodded and the warrior went on
good
with thee and thy daughter we have no quarrel nor do we wish to harm thee save as to thy cattle which we have already gathered two hundred and forty heada beast for every mans father the masai elmoran or young warriors can own no property so all the booty they may win in battle belongs to their fathers alonea
q
here mr mackenzie gave a groan as he greatly valued this herd of cattle which he bred with much care and trouble
so save for the cattle thou mayst go free more especially he added frankly glancing at the wall as this place would be a difficult one to take
but as to these men it is otherwise we have followed them for nights and days and must kill them
were we to return to our kraal without having done so all the girls would make a mock of us
so however troublesome it may be they must die
now i have a proposition for thee
we would not harm the little girl she is too fair to harm and has besides a brave spirit
give us one of these three mena life for a lifeand we will let her go and throw in the black woman with her also
this is a fair offer white man
we ask but for one not for the three we must take another opportunity to kill the other two
i do not even pick my man though i should prefer the big one pointing to sir henry he looks strong and would die more slowly and if i say i will not yield the man said mr mackenzie
nay say not so white man answered the masai for then thy daughter dies at dawn and the woman with her says thou hast no other child
were she older i would take her for a servant but as she is so young i will slay her with my own handay with this very spear
thou canst come and see an thou wilt
i give thee a safe conduct and the fiend laughed aloud at his brutal jest
meanwhile i had been thinking rapidly as one does in emergencies and had come to the conclusion that i would exchange myself against flossie
i scarcely like to mention the matter for fear it should be misunderstood
pray do not let any one be misled into thinking that there was anything heroic about this or any such nonsense
it was merely a matter of common sense and common justice
my life was an old and worthless one hers was young and valuable
her death would pretty well kill her father and mother also whilst nobody would be much the worse for mine indeed several charitable institutions would have cause to rejoice thereat
it was indirectly through me that the dear little girl was in her present position
lastly a man was better fitted to meet death in such a peculiarly awful form than a sweet young girl
not however that i meant to let these gentry torture me to deathi am far too much of a coward to allow that being naturally a timid man my plan was to see the girl safely exchanged and then to shoot myself trusting that the almighty would take the peculiar circumstances of the case into consideration and pardon the act
all this and more went through my mind in very few seconds
all right mackenzie i said you can tell the man that i will exchange myself against flossie only i stipulate that she shall be safely in this house before they kill me eh said sir henry and good simultaneously
that you dont no no said mr mackenzie
i will have no mans blood upon my hands
if it please god that my daughter should die this awful death his will be done
you are a brave man which i am not by any means and a noble man quatermain but you shall not go if nothing else turns up i shall go i said decidedly
this is an important matter said mackenzie addressing the lygonani and we must think it over
you shall have our answer at dawn very well white man answered the savage indifferently only remember if thy answer is late thy little white bud will never grow into a flower that is all for i shall cut it with this and he touched the spear
i should have thought that thou wouldst play a trick and attack us at night but i know from the woman with the girl that your men are down at the coast and that thou hast but twenty men here
it is not wise white man he added with a laugh to keep so small a garrison for your boma kraal
well good night and good night to you also other white men whose eyelids i shall soon close once and for all
at dawn thou wilt bring me word
if not remember it shall be as i have said then turning to umslopogaas who had all the while been standing behind him and shepherding him as it were open the door for me fellow quick now this was too much for the old chiefs patience
for the last ten minutes his lips had been figuratively speaking positively watering over the masai lygonani and this he could not stand
placing his long hand on the elmorans shoulder he gripped it and gave him such a twist as brought him face to face with himself
then thrusting his fierce countenance to within a few inches of the masais evil featherframed features he said in a low growling voice seest thou me ay fellow i see thee and seest thou this and he held inkosikaas before his eyes
ay fellow i see the toy what of it thou masai dog thou boasting windbag thou capturer of little girls with this toy will i hew thee limb from limb
well for thee that thou art a herald or even now would i strew thy members about the grass the masai shook his great spear and laughed loud and long as he answered i would that thou stoodst against me man to man and we would see and again he turned to go still laughing
thou shalt stand against me man to man be not afraid replied umslopogaas still in the same ominous voice
thou shalt stand face to face with umslopogaas of the blood of chaka of the people of the amazulu a captain in the regiment of the nkomabakosi as many have done before and bow thyself to inkosikaas as many have done before
ay laugh on laugh on
tomorrow night shall the jackals laugh as they crunch thy ribs when the lygonani had gone one of us thought of opening the basket he had brought as a proof that flossie was really their prisoner
on lifting the lid it was found to contain a most lovely specimen of both bulb and flower of the goya lily which i have already described in full bloom and quite uninjured and what was more a note in flossies childish hand written in pencil upon a greasy piece of paper that had been used to wrap up some food in dearest father and mother ran the note the masai caught us when we were coming home with the lily
i tried to escape but could not
they killed tom the other man ran away
they have not hurt nurse and me but say that they mean to exchange us against one of mr quatermains party
i will have nothing of the sort
do not let anybody give his life for me
try and attack them at night they are going to feast on three bullocks they have stolen and killed
i have my pistol and if no help comes by dawn i will shoot myself
they shall not kill me
if so remember me always dearest father and mother
i am very frightened but i trust in god
i dare not write any more as they are beginning to notice
goodbyeflossie scrawled across the outside of this was love to mr quatermain
they are going to take the basket so he will get the lily when i read those words written by that brave little girl in an hour of danger sufficiently near and horrible to have turned the brain of a strong man i own i wept and once more in my heart i vowed that she should not die while my life could be given to save her
then eagerly quickly almost fiercely we fell to discussing the situation
again i said that i would go and again mackenzie negatived it and curtis and good like the true men that they are vowed that if i did they would go with me and die back to back with me
it is i said at last absolutely necessary that an effort of some sort should be made before the morning then let us attack them with what force we can muster and take our chance said sir henry
ay ay growled umslopogaas in zulu spoken like a man incubu
what is there to be afraid of
two hundred and fifty masai forsooth
how many are we
the chief there mr mackenzie has twenty men and thou macumazahn hast five men and there are also five white menthat is thirty men in allenough enough
listen now macumazahn thou who art very clever and old in war
what says the maid
these men eat and make merry let it be their funeral feast
what said the dog whom i hope to hew down at daybreak
that he feared no attack because we were so few
knowest thou the old kraal where the men have camped
i saw it this morning it is thus and he drew an oval on the floor here is the big entrance filled up with thorn bushes and opening on to a steep rise
why incubu thou and i with axes will hold it against an hundred men striving to break out
look now thus shall the battle go
just as the light begins to glint upon the oxens hornsnot before or it will be too dark and not later or they will be awakening and perceive uslet bougwan creep round with ten men to the top end of the kraal where the narrow entrance is
let them silently slay the sentry there so that he makes no sound and stand ready
then incubu let thee and me and one of the askarithe one with the broad chesthe is a brave mancreep to the wide entrance that is filled with thorn bushes and there also slay the sentry and armed with battleaxes take our stand also one on each side of the pathway and one a few paces beyond to deal with such as pass the twain at the gate
it is there that the rush will come
that will leave sixteen men
let these men be divided into two parties with one of which shalt thou go macumazahn and with one the praying man mr mackenzie and all armed with rifles let them make their way one to the right side of the kraal and one to the left and when thou macumazahn lowest like an ox all shall open fire with the guns upon the sleeping men being very careful not to hit the little maid
then shall bougwan at the far end and his ten men raise the warcry and springing over the wall put the masai there to the sword
and it shall happen that being yet heavy with food and sleep and bewildered by the firing of the guns the falling of men and the spears of bougwan the soldiers shall rise and rush like wild game towards the thornstopped entrance and there the bullets from either side shall plough through them and there shall incubu and the askari and i wait for those who break across
such is my plan macumazahn if thou hast a better name it when he had done i explained to the others such portions of his scheme as they had failed to understand and they all joined with me in expressing the greatest admiration of the acute and skilful programme devised by the old zulu who was indeed in his own savage fashion the finest general i ever knew
after some discussion we determined to accept the scheme as it stood it being the only one possible under the circumstances and giving the best chance of success that such a forlorn hope would admit ofwhich however considering the enormous odds and the character of our foe was not very great
ah old lion i said to umslopogaas thou knowest how to lie in wait as well as how to bite where to seize as well as where to hang on ay ay macumazahn he answered
for thirty years have i been a warrior and have seen many things
it will be a good fight
i smell bloodi tell thee i smell blood the night wears on as may be imagined at the very first sign of a masai the entire population of the mission station had sought refuge inside the stout stone wall and were now to be seenmen women and countless childrenhuddled up together in little groups and all talking at once in awed tones of the awfulness of masai manners and customs and of the fate that they had to expect if those bloodthirsty savages succeeded in getting over the stone wall
immediately after we had settled upon the outline of our plan of action as suggested by umslopogaas mr mackenzie sent for four sharp boys of from twelve to fifteen years of age and despatched them to various points where they could keep an outlook upon the masai camp with others to report from time to time what was going on
other lads and even women were stationed at intervals along the wall in order to guard against the possibility of surprise
after this the twenty men who formed his whole available fighting force were summoned by our host into the square formed by the house and there standing by the bole of the great conifer he earnestly addressed them and our four askari
indeed it formed a very impressive sceneone not likely to be forgotten by anybody who witnessed it
immediately by the tree stood the angular form of mr mackenzie one arm outstretched as he talked and the other resting against the giant bole his hat off and his plain but kindly face clearly betraying the anguish of his mind
next to him was his poor wife who seated on a chair had her face hidden in her hand
on the other side of her was alphonse looking exceedingly uncomfortable and behind him stood the three of us with umslopogaas grim and towering form in the background resting as usual on his axe
in front stood and squatted the group of armed mensome with rifles in their hands and others with spears and shieldsfollowing with eager attention every word that fell from the speakers lips
the white light of the moon peering in beneath the lofty boughs threw a strange wild glamour over the scene whilst the melancholy soughing of the night wind passing through the millions of pine needles overhead added a sadness of its own to what was already a sufficiently tragic occasion
men said mr mackenzie after he had put all the circumstances of the case fully and clearly before them and explained to them the proposed plan of our forlorn hopemen for years i have been a good friend to you protecting you teaching you guarding you and yours from harm and ye have prospered with me
ye have seen my childthe waterlily as ye call hergrow year by year from tenderest infancy to tender childhood and from childhood on towards maidenhood
she has been your childrens playmate she has helped to tend you when sick and ye have loved her we have said a deep voice and we will die to save her i thank you from my hearti thank you
sure am i that now in this hour of darkest trouble now that her young life is like to be cut off by cruel and savage menwho of a truth know not what they doye will strive your best to save her and to save me and her mother from broken hearts
think too of your own wives and children
if she dies her death will be followed by an attack upon us here and at the best even if we hold our own your houses and gardens will be destroyed and your goods and cattle swept away
i am as ye well know a man of peace
never in all these years have i lifted my hand to shed mans blood but now i say strike strike in the name of god who bade us protect our lives and homes
swear to me he went on with added fervourswear to me that whilst a man of you remains alive ye will strive your uttermost with me and with these brave white men to save the child from a bloody and cruel death say no more my father said the same deep voice that belonged to a stalwart elder of the mission we swear it
may we and ours die the death of dogs and our bones be thrown to the jackals and the kites if we break the oath
it is a fearful thing to do my father so few to strike at so many yet will we do it or die in the doing
we swear ay thus say we all chimed in the others
thus say we all said i
it is well went on mr mackenzie
ye are true men and not broken reeds to lean on
and now friendswhite and black togetherlet us kneel and offer up our humble supplication to the throne of power praying that he in the hollow of whose hand lie all our lives who giveth life and giveth death may be pleased to make strong our arms that we may prevail in what awaits us at the mornings light and he knelt down an example that we all followed except umslopogaas who still stood in the background grimly leaning on inkosikaas
the fierce old zulu had no gods and worshipped nought unless it were his battleaxe
oh god of gods began the clergyman his deep voice tremulous with emotion echoing up in the silence even to the leafy roof protector of the oppressed refuge of those in danger guardian of the helpless hear thou our prayer
almighty father to thee we come in supplication
hear thou our prayer
behold one child hast thou given usan innocent child nurtured in thy knowledgeand now she lies beneath the shadow of the sword in danger of a fearful death at the hands of savage men
be with her now oh god and comfort her
save her oh heavenly father
oh god of battle who teacheth our hands to war and our fingers to fight in whose strength are hid the destinies of men be thou with us in the hour of strife
when we go forth into the shadow of death make thou us strong to conquer
breathe thou upon our foes and scatter them turn thou their strength to water and bring their highblown pride to nought compass us about with thy protection throw over us the shield of thy power forget us not now in the hour of our sore distress help us now that the cruel man would dash our little ones against the stones
hear thou our prayer
and for those of us who kneeling now on earth in health before thee shall at the sunrise adore thy presence on the throne hear our prayer
make them clean oh god wash away their offences in the blood of the lamb and when their spirits pass oh receive thou them into the haven of the just
go forth oh father go forth with us into the battle as with the israelites of old
oh god of battle hear thou our prayer he ceased and after a moments silence we all rose and then began our preparations in good earnest
as umslopogaas said it was time to stop talking and get to business
the men who were to form each little party were carefully selected and still more carefully and minutely instructed as to what was to be done
after much consideration it was agreed that the ten men led by good whose duty it was to stampede the camp were not to carry firearms that is with the exception of good himself who had a revolver as well as a short swordthe masai sime which i had taken from the body of our poor servant who was murdered in the canoe
we feared that if they had firearms the result of three crossfires carried on at once would be that some of our own people would be shot besides it appeared to all of us that the work they had to do would best be carried out with cold steelespecially to umslopogaas who was indeed a great advocate of cold steel
we had with us four winchester repeating rifles besides half a dozen martinis
i armed myself with one of the repeatersmy own an excellent weapon for this kind of work where great rapidity of fire is desirable and fitted with ordinary flapsights instead of the cumbersome sliding mechanism which they generally have
mr mackenzie took another and the two remaining ones were given to two of his men who understood the use of them and were noted shots
the martinis and some rifles of mr mackenzies were served out together with a plentiful supply of ammunition to the other natives who were to form the two parties whose duty it was to be to open fire from separate sides of the kraal on the sleeping masai and who were fortunately all more or less accustomed to the use of a gun
as for umslopogaas we know how he was armedwith an axe
it may be remembered that he sir henry and the strongest of the askari were to hold the thornstopped entrance to the kraal against the anticipated rush of men striving to escape
of course for such a purpose as this guns were useless
therefore sir henry and the askari proceeded to arm themselves in like fashion
it so happened that mr mackenzie had in his little store a selection of the very best and englishmade hammerbacked axeheads
sir henry selected one of these weighing about two and a half pounds and very broad in the blade and the askari took another a size smaller
after umslopogaas had put an extra edge on these two axeheads we fixed them to three feet six helves of which mr mackenzie fortunately had some in stock made of a light but exceedingly tough native wood something like english ash only more springy
when two suitable helves had been selected with great care and the ends of the hafts notched to prevent the hand from slipping the axeheads were fixed on them as firmly as possible and the weapons immersed in a bucket of water for half an hour
the result of this was to swell the wood in the socket in such a fashion that nothing short of burning would get it out again
when this important matter had been attended to by umslopogaas i went into my room and proceeded to open a little tinlined deal case which containedwhat do you thinknothing more or less than four mail shirts
it had happened to us three on a previous journey that we had made in another part of africa to owe our lives to iron shirts of native make and remembering this i had suggested before we started on our present hazardous expedition that we should have some made to fit us
there was a little difficulty about this as armourmaking is pretty well an extinct art but they can do most things in the way of steel work in birmingham if they are put to it and you will pay the price and the end of it was that they turned us out the loveliest steel shirts it is possible to see
the workmanship was exceedingly fine the web being composed of thousands upon thousands of stout but tiny rings of the best steel made
these shirts or rather steelsleeved and highnecked jerseys were lined with ventilated wash leather were not bright but browned like the barrel of a gun and mine weighed exactly seven pounds and fitted me so well that i found i could wear it for days next to my skin without being chafed
sir henry had two one of the ordinary make viz
a jersey with little dependent flaps meant to afford some protection to the upper part of the thighs and another of his own design fashioned on the pattern of the garments advertised as combinations and weighing twelve pounds
this combination shirt of which the seat was made of washleather protected the whole body down to the knees but was rather more cumbersome inasmuch as it had to be laced up at the back and of course involved some extra weight
with these shirts were what looked like four brown cloth travelling caps with ear pieces
each of these caps was however quilted with steel links so as to afford a most valuable protection for the head
it seems almost laughable to talk of steel shirts in these days of bullets against which they are of course quite useless but where one has to do with savages armed with cutting weapons such as assegais or battleaxes they afford the most valuable protection being if well made quite invulnerable to them
i have often thought that if only the english government had in our savage wars and more especially in the zulu war thought fit to serve out light steel shirts there would be many a man alive today who as it is is dead and forgotten
to return on the present occasion we blessed our foresight in bringing these shirts and also our good luck in that they had not been stolen by our rascally bearers when they ran away with our goods
as curtis had two and after considerable deliberation had made up his mind to wear his combination one himselfthe extra three or four pounds weight being a matter of no account to so strong a man and the protection afforded to the thighs being a very important matter to a fighting man not armed with a shield of any kindi suggested that he should lend the other to umslopogaas who was to share the danger and the glory of his post
he readily consented and called the zulu who came bearing sir henrys axe which he had now fixed up to his satisfaction with him
when we showed him the steel shirt and explained to him that we wanted him to wear it he at first declined saying that he had fought in his own skin for thirty years and that he was not going to begin now to fight in an iron one
thereupon i took a heavy spear and spreading the shirt upon the floor drove the spear down upon it with all my strength the weapon rebounding without leaving a mark upon the tempered steel
this exhibition half converted him and when i pointed out to him how necessary it was that he should not let any oldfashioned prejudices he might possess stand in the way of a precaution which might preserve a valuable life at a time when men were scarce and also that if he wore this shirt he might dispense with a shield and so have both hands free he yielded at once and proceeded to invest his frame with the iron skin
and indeed although made for sir henry it fitted the great zulu like a skin
the two men were almost of a height and though curtis looked the bigger man i am inclined to think that the difference was more imaginary than real the fact being that although he was plumper and rounder he was not really bigger except in the arm
umslopogaas had comparatively speaking thin arms but they were as strong as wire ropes
at any rate when they both stood axe in hand invested in the brown mail which clung to their mighty forms like a web garment showing the swell of every muscle and the curve of every line they formed a pair that any ten men might shrink from meeting
it was now nearly one oclock in the morning and the spies reported that after having drunk the blood of the oxen and eaten enormous quantities of meat the masai were going to sleep round their watchfires but that sentries had been posted at each opening of the kraal
flossie they added was sitting not far from the wall in the centre of the western side of the kraal and by her were the nurse and the white donkey which was tethered to a peg
her feet were bound with a rope and warriors were lying about all round her
as there was absolutely nothing further that could be done then we all took some supper and went to lie down for a couple of hours
i could not help admiring the way in which old umslopogaas flung himself upon the floor and unmindful of what was hanging over him instantly sank into a deep sleep
i do not know how it was with the others but i could not do as much
indeed as is usual with me on these occasions i am sorry to say that i felt rather frightened and now that some of the enthusiasm had gone out of me and i began to calmly contemplate what we had undertaken to do truth compels me to add that i did not like it
we were but thirty men all told a good many of whom were no doubt quite unused to fighting and we were going to engage two hundred and fifty of the fiercest bravest and most formidable savages in africa who to make matters worse were protected by a stone wall
it was indeed a mad undertaking and what made it even madder was the exceeding improbability of our being able to take up our positions without attracting the notice of the sentries
of course if we once did thatand any slight accident such as the chance discharge of a gun might do itwe were done for for the whole camp would be up in a second and our only hope lay in surprise
the bed whereon i lay indulging in these uncomfortable reflections was near an open window that looked on to the veranda through which came an extraordinary sound of groaning and weeping
for a time i could not make out what it was but at last i got up and putting my head out of the window stared about
presently i saw a dim figure kneeling on the end of the veranda and beating his breastin which i recognized alphonse
not being able to understand his french talk or what on earth he was at i called to him and asked him what he was doing
ah monsieur he sighed i do make prayer for the souls of those whom i shall slay tonight indeed i said then i wish that you would do it a little more quietly alphonse retreated and i heard no more of his groans
and so the time passed till at length mr mackenzie called me in a whisper through the window for of course everything had now to be done in the most absolute silence
three oclock he said we must begin to move at halfpast i told him to come in and presently he entered and i am bound to say that if it had not been that just then i had not got a laugh anywhere about me i should have exploded at the sight he presented armed for battle
to begin with he had on a clergymans black swallowtail and a kind of broadrimmed black felt hat both of which he had donned on account he said of their dark colour
in his hand was the winchester repeating rifle we had lent him and stuck in an elastic cricketing belt like those worn by english boys were first a huge buckhornhandled carving knife with a guard to it and next a longbarrelled colts revolver
ah my friend he said seeing me staring at his belt you are looking at my carver
i thought it might come in handy if we came to close quarters it is excellent steel and many is the pig i have killed with it by this time everybody was up and dressing
i put on a light norfolk jacket over my mail shirt in order to have a pocket handy to hold my cartridges and buckled on my revolver
good did the same but sir henry put on nothing except his mail shirt steellined cap and a pair of veldtschoons or soft hide shoes his legs being bare from the knees down
his revolver he strapped on round his middle outside the armoured shirt
meanwhile umslopogaas was mustering the men in the square under the big tree and going the rounds to see that each was properly armed etc
at the last moment we made one change
finding that two of the men who were to have gone with the firing parties knew little or nothing of guns but were good spearsmen we took away their rifles supplied them with shields and long spears of the masai pattern and took them off to join curtis umslopogaas and the askari in holding the wide opening it having become clear to us that three men however brave and strong were too few for the work
a slaughter grim and great then there was a pause and we stood there in the chilly silent darkness waiting till the moment came to start
it was perhaps the most trying time of allthat slow slow quarter of an hour
the minutes seemed to drag along with leaden feet and the quiet the solemn hush that brooded over allbig as it were with a coming fate was most oppressive to the spirits
i once remember having to get up before dawn to see a man hanged and i then went through a very similar set of sensations only in the present instance my feelings were animated by that more vivid and personal element which naturally appertains rather to the person to be operated on than to the most sympathetic spectator
the solemn faces of the men well aware that the short passage of an hour would mean for some and perhaps all of them the last great passage to the unknown or oblivion the bated whispers in which they spoke even sir henrys continuous and thoughtful examination of his woodcutters axe and the fidgety way in which good kept polishing his eyeglass all told the same tale of nerves stretched pretty nigh to breakingpoint
only umslopogaas leaning as usual upon inkosikaas and taking an occasional pinch of snuff was to all appearance perfectly and completely unmoved
nothing could touch his iron nerves
the moon went down
for a long while she had been getting nearer and nearer to the horizon
now she finally sank and left the world in darkness save for a faint grey tinge in the eastern sky that palely heralded the dawn
mr mackenzie stood watch in hand his wife clinging to his arm and striving to stifle her sobs
twenty minutes to four he said it ought to be light enough to attack at twenty minutes past four
captain good had better be moving he will want three or four minutes start good gave one final polish to his eyeglass nodded to us in a jocular sort of waywhich i could not help feeling it must have cost him something to muster upand ever polite took off his steellined cap to mrs mackenzie and started for his position at the head of the kraal to reach which he had to make a detour by some paths known to the natives
just then one of the boys came in and reported that everybody in the masai camp with the exception of the two sentries who were walking up and down in front of the respective entrances appeared to be fast asleep
then the rest of us took the road
first came the guide then sir henry umslopogaas the wakwafi askari and mr mackenzies two mission natives armed with long spears and shields
i followed immediately after with alphonse and five natives all armed with guns and mr mackenzie brought up the rear with the six remaining natives
the cattle kraal where the masai were camped lay at the foot of the hill on which the house stood or roughly speaking about eight hundred yards from the mission buildings
the first five hundred yards of this distance we traversed quietly indeed but at a good pace after that we crept forward as silently as a leopard on his prey gliding like ghosts from bush to bush and stone to stone
when i had gone a little way i chanced to look behind me and saw the redoubtable alphonse staggering along with white face and trembling knees and his rifle which was at full cock pointed directly at the small of my back
having halted and carefully put the rifle at safety we started again and all went well till we were within one hundred yards or so of the kraal when his teeth began to chatter in the most aggressive way
if you dont stop that i will kill you i whispered savagely for the idea of having all our lives sacrificed to a toothchattering cook was too much for me
i began to fear that he would betray us and heartily wished we had left him behind
but monsieur i cannot help it he answered it is the cold here was a dilemma but fortunately i devised a plan
in the pocket of the coat i had on was a small piece of dirty rag that i had used some time before to clean a gun with
put this in your mouth i whispered again giving him the rag and if i hear another sound you are a dead man i knew that that would stifle the clatter of his teeth
i must have looked as if i meant what i said for he instantly obeyed me and continued his journey in silence
then we crept on again
at last we were within fifty yards of the kraal
between us and it was an open space of sloping grass with only one mimosa bush and a couple of tussocks of a sort of thistle for cover
we were still hidden in fairly thick bush
it was beginning to grow light
the stars had paled and a sickly gleam played about the east and was reflected on the earth
we could see the outline of the kraal clearly enough and could also make out the faint glimmer of the dying embers of the masai campfires
we halted and watched for the sentry we knew was posted at the opening
presently he appeared a fine tall fellow walking idly up and down within five paces of the thornstopped entrance
we had hoped to catch him napping but it was not to be
he seemed particularly wide awake
if we could not kill that man and kill him silently we were lost
there we crouched and watched him
presently umslopogaas who was a few paces ahead of me turned and made a sign and next second i saw him go down on his stomach like a snake and taking an opportunity when the sentrys head was turned begin to work his way through the grass without a sound
the unconscious sentry commenced to hum a little tune and umslopogaas crept on
he reached the shelter of the mimosa bush unperceived and there waited
still the sentry walked up and down
presently he turned and looked over the wall into the camp
instantly the human snake who was stalking him glided on ten yards and got behind one of the tussocks of the thistlelike plant reaching it as the elmoran turned again
as he did so his eye fell upon this patch of thistles and it seemed to strike him that it did not look quite right
he advanced a pace towards ithalted yawned stooped down picked up a little pebble and threw it at it
it hit umslopogaas upon the head luckily not upon the armour shirt
had it done so the clink would have betrayed us
luckily too the shirt was browned and not bright steel which would certainly have been detected
apparently satisfied that there was nothing wrong he then gave over his investigations and contented himself with leaning on his spear and standing gazing idly at the tuft
for at least three minutes did he stand thus plunged apparently in a gentle reverie and there we lay in the last extremity of anxiety expecting every moment that we should be discovered or that some untoward accident would happen
i could hear alphonses teeth going like anything on the oiled rag and turning my head round made an awful face at him
but i am bound to state that my own heart was at much the same game as the frenchmans castanets while the perspiration was pouring from my body causing the washleatherlined shirt to stick to me unpleasantly and altogether i was in the pitiable state known by schoolboys as a blue fright
at last the ordeal came to an end
the sentry glanced at the east and appeared to note with satisfaction that his period of duty was coming to an endas indeed it was once and for allfor he rubbed his hands and began to walk again briskly to warm himself
the moment his back was turned the long black snake glided on again and reached the other thistle tuft which was within a couple of paces of his return beat
back came the sentry and strolled right past the tuft utterly unconscious of the presence that was crouching behind it
had he looked down he could scarcely have failed to see but he did not do so
he passed and then his hidden enemy erected himself and with outstretched hand followed in his tracks
a moment more and just as the elmoran was about to turn the great zulu made a spring and in the growing light we could see his long lean hands close round the masais throat
then followed a convulsive twining of the two dark bodies and in another second i saw the masais head bent back and heard a sharp crack something like that of a dry twig snapping and he fell down upon the ground his limbs moving spasmodically
umslopogaas had put out all his iron strength and broken the warriors neck
for a moment he knelt upon his victim still gripping his throat till he was sure that there was nothing more to fear from him and then he rose and beckoned to us to advance which we did on all fours like a colony of huge apes
on reaching the kraal we saw that the masai had still further choked this entrance which was about ten feet wideno doubt in order to guard against attackby dragging four or five tops of mimosa trees up to it
so much the better for us i reflected the more obstruction there was the slower would they be able to come through
here we separated mackenzie and his party creeping up under the shadow of the wall to the left while sir henry and umslopogaas took their stations one on each side of the thorn fence the two spearmen and the askari lying down in front of it
i and my men crept on up the right side of the kraal which was about fifty paces long
when i was twothirds up i halted and placed my men at distances of four paces from one another keeping alphonse close to me however
then i peeped for the first time over the wall
it was getting fairly light now and the first thing i saw was the white donkey exactly opposite to me and close by it i could make out the pale face of little flossie who was sitting as the lad had described some ten paces from the wall
round her lay many warriors sleeping
at distances all over the surface of the kraal were the remains of fires round each of which slept some fiveandtwenty masai for the most part gorged with food
now and then a man would raise himself yawn and look at the east which was turning primrose but none got up
i determined to wait another five minutes both to allow the light to increase so that we could make better shooting and to give good and his partyof whom we could see or hear nothingevery opportunity to make ready
the quiet dawn began to throw her everwidening mantle over plain and forest and rivermighty kenia wrapped in the silence of eternal snows looked out across the earthtill presently a beam from the unrisen sun lit upon his heavenkissing crest and purpled it with blood the sky above grew blue and tender as a mothers smile a bird began to pipe his morning song and a little breeze passing through the bush shook down the dewdrops in millions to refresh the waking world
everywhere was peace and the happiness of arising strength everywhere save in the heart of cruel man
suddenly just as i was nerving myself for the signal having already selected my man on whom i meant to open firea great fellow sprawling on the ground within three feet of little flossiealphonses teeth began to chatter again like the hoofs of a galloping giraffe making a great noise in the silence
the rag had dropped out in the agitation of his mind
instantly a masai within three paces of us woke and sitting up gazed about him looking for the cause of the sound
moved beyond myself i brought the buttend of my rifle down on to the pit of the frenchmans stomach
this stopped his chattering but as he doubled up he managed to let off his gun in such a manner that the bullet passed within an inch of my head
there was no need for a signal now
from both sides of the kraal broke out a waving line of fire in which i myself joined managing with a snap shot to knock over my masai by flossie just as he was jumping up
then from the top end of the kraal there rang an awful yell in which i rejoiced to recognize goods piercing notes rising clear and shrill above the din and in another second followed such a scene as i have never seen before nor shall again
with an universal howl of terror and fury the brawny crowd of savages within the kraal sprang to their feet many of them to fall again beneath our welldirected hail of lead before they had moved a yard
for a moment they stood undecided and then hearing the cries and curses that rose unceasingly from the top end of the kraal and bewildered by the storm of bullets they as by one impulse rushed down towards the thornstopped entrance
as they went we kept pouring our fire with terrible effect into the thickening mob as fast as we could load
i had emptied my repeater of the ten shots it contained and was just beginning to slip in some more when i bethought me of little flossie
looking up i saw that the white donkey was lying kicking having been knocked over either by one of our bullets or a masai spearthrust
there were no living masai near but the black nurse was on her feet and with a spear cutting the rope that bound flossies feet
next second she ran to the wall of the kraal and began to climb over it an example which the little girl followed
but flossie was evidently very stiff and cramped and could only go slowly and as she went two masai flying down the kraal caught sight of her and rushed towards her to kill her
the first fellow came up just as the poor little girl after a desperate effort to climb the wall fell back into the kraal
up flashed the great spear and as it did so a bullet from my rifle found its home in the holders ribs and over he went like a shot rabbit
but behind him was the other man and alas i had only that one cartridge in the magazine
flossie had scrambled to her feet and was facing the second man who was advancing with raised spear
i turned my head aside and felt sick as death
i could not bear to see him stab her
glancing up again to my surprise i saw the masais spear lying on the ground while the man himself was staggering about with both hands to his head
suddenly i saw a puff of smoke proceeding apparently from flossie and the man fell down headlong
then i remembered the derringer pistol she carried and saw that she had fired both barrels of it at him thereby saving her life
in another instant she had made an effort and assisted by the nurse who was lying on the top had scrambled over the wall and i knew that she was comparatively speaking safe
all this takes time to tell but i do not suppose that it took more than fifteen seconds to enact
i soon got the magazine of the repeater filled again with cartridges and once more opened fire not on the seething black mass which was gathering at the end of the kraal but on fugitives who bethought them to climb the wall
i picked off several of these men moving down towards the end of the kraal as i did so and arriving at the corner or rather the bend of the oval in time to see and by means of my rifle to assist in the mighty struggle that took place there
by this time some two hundred masaiallowing that we had up to the present accounted for fiftyhad gathered together in front of the thornstopped entrance driven thither by the spears of goods men whom they doubtless supposed were a large force instead of being but ten strong
for some reason it never occurred to them to try and rush the wall which they could have scrambled over with comparative ease they all made for the fence which was really a strongly interwoven fortification
with a bound the first warrior went at it and even before he touched the ground on the other side i saw sir henrys great axe swing up and fall with awful force upon his feather headpiece and he sank into the middle of the thorns
then with a yell and a crash they began to break through as they might and ever as they came the great axe swung and inkosikaas flashed and they fell dead one by one each man thus helping to build up a barrier against his fellows
those who escaped the axes of the pair fell at the hands of the askari and the two mission kaffirs and those who passed scatheless from them were brought low by my own and mackenzies fire
faster and more furious grew the fighting
single masai would spring upon the dead bodies of their comrades and engage one or other of the axemen with their long spears but thanks chiefly to the mail shirts the result was always the same
presently there was a great swing of the axe a crashing sound and another dead masai
that is if the man was engaged with sir henry
if it was umslopogaas that he fought with the result indeed would be the same but it would be differently attained
it was but rarely that the zulu used the crashing doublehanded stroke on the contrary he did little more than tap continually at his adversarys head pecking at it with the poleaxe end of the axe as a woodpecker pecks at rotten wood
presently a peck would go home and his enemy would drop down with a neat little circular hole in his forehead or skull exactly similar to that which a cheesescoop makes in a cheese
he never used the broad blade of the axe except when hard pressed or when striking at a shield
he told me afterwards that he did not consider it sportsmanlike
as i think i have already said one of umslopogaass zulu names was the woodpecker
i could never make out why he was called so until i saw him in action with inkosikaas when i at once recognized the resemblancea
q
good and his men were quite close by now and our people had to cease firing into the mass for fear of killing some of them as it was one of them was slain in this way
mad and desperate with fear the masai by a frantic effort burst through the thorn fence and piledup dead and sweeping curtis umslopogaas and the other three before them into the open
and now it was that we began to lose men fast
down went our poor askari who was armed with the axe a great spear standing out a foot behind his back and before long the two spearsmen who had stood with him went down too dying fighting like tigers and others of our party shared their fate
for a moment i feared the fight was lostcertainly it trembled in the balance
i shouted to my men to cast down their rifles and to take spears and throw themselves into the mle
they obeyed their blood being now thoroughly up and mr mackenzies people followed their example
this move had a momentary good result but still the fight hung in the balance
our people fought magnificently hurling themselves upon the dark mass of elmoran hewing thrusting slaying and being slain
and ever above the din rose goods awful yell of encouragement as he plunged to wherever the fight was thickest and ever with an almost machinelike regularity the two axes rose and fell carrying death and disablement at every stroke
but i could see that the strain was beginning to tell upon sir henry who was bleeding from several flesh wounds his breath was coming in gasps and the veins stood out on his forehead like blue and knotted cords
even umslopogaas man of iron that he was was hard pressed
i noticed that he had given up woodpecking and was now using the broad blade of inkosikaas browning his enemy wherever he could hit him instead of drilling scientific holes in his head
i myself did not go into the mle but hovered outside like the swift back in a football scrimmage putting a bullet through a masai whenever i got a chance
i was more use so
i fired fortynine cartridges that morning and i did not miss many shots
presently do as we would the beam of the balance began to rise against us
we had not more than fifteen or sixteen effectives left now and the masai had at least fifty
of course if they had kept their heads and shaken themselves together they could soon have made an end of the matter but that is just what they did not do not having yet recovered from their start and some of them having actually fled from their sleepingplaces without their weapons
still by now many individuals were fighting with their normal courage and discretion and this alone was sufficient to defeat us
to make matters worse just then when mackenzies rifle was empty a brawny savage armed with a sime or sword made a rush for him
the clergyman flung down his gun and drawing his huge carver from his elastic belt his revolver had dropped out in the fight they closed in desperate struggle
presently locked in a close embrace missionary and masai rolled on the ground behind the wall and for some time i being amply occupied with my own affairs and in keeping my skin from being pricked remained in ignorance of his fate or how the duel had ended
to and fro surged the fight slowly turning round like the vortex of a human whirlpool and the matter began to look very bad for us
just then however a fortunate thing happened
umslopogaas either by accident or design broke out of the ring and engaged a warrior at some few paces from it
as he did so another man ran up and struck him with all his force between his shoulders with his great spear which falling on the tough steel shirt failed to pierce it and rebounded
for a moment the man stared aghastprotective armour being unknown among these tribesand then he yelled out at the top of his voice they are devilsbewitched bewitched and seized by a sudden panic he threw down his spear and began to fly
i cut short his career with a bullet and umslopogaas brained his man and then the panic spread to the others
bewitched bewitched they cried and tried to escape in every direction utterly demoralized and brokenspirited for the most part even throwing down their shields and spears
on the last scene of that dreadful fight i need not dwell
it was a slaughter great and grim in which no quarter was asked or given
one incident however is worth detailing
just as i was hoping that it was all done with suddenly from under a heap of slain where he had been hiding an unwounded warrior sprang up and clearing the piles of dying dead like an antelope sped like the wind up the kraal towards the spot where i was standing at the moment
but he was not alone for umslopogaas came gliding on his tracks with the peculiar swallowlike motion for which he was noted and as they neared me i recognized in the masai the herald of the previous night
finding that run as he would his pursuer was gaining on him the man halted and turned round to give battle
umslopogaas also pulled up
ah ah he cried in mockery to the elmoran it is thou whom i talked with last nightthe lygonani
the herald
the capturer of little girlshe who would kill a little girl
and thou didst hope to stand man to man and face to face with umslopogaas an induna of the tribe of the maquilisini of the people of the amazulu
behold thy prayer is granted
and i didst swear to hew thee limb from limb thou insolent dog
behold i will do it even now the masai ground his teeth with fury and charged at the zulu with his spear
as he came umslopogaas deftly stepped aside and swinging inkosikaas high above his head with both hands brought the broad blade down with such fearful force from behind upon the masais shoulder just where the neck is set into the frame that its razor edge shore right through bone and flesh and muscle almost severing the head and one arm from the body
ou ejaculated umslopogaas contemplating the corpse of his foe i have kept my word
it was a good stroke alphonse explains and so the fight was ended
on returning from the shocking scene it suddenly struck me that i had seen nothing of alphonse since the moment some twenty minutes beforefor though this fight has taken a long while to describe it did not take long in realitywhen i had been forced to hit him in the wind with the result of nearly getting myself shot
fearing that the poor little man had perished in the battle i began to hunt among the dead for his body but not being able either to see or hear anything of it i concluded that he must have survived and walked down the side of the kraal where we had first taken our stand calling him by name
now some fifteen paces back from the kraal wall stood a very ancient tree of the banyan species
so ancient was it that all the inside had in the course of ages decayed away leaving nothing but a shell of bark
alphonse i called as i walked down the wall
alphonse oui monsieur answered a voice
here am i i looked round but could see nobody
where i cried
here am i monsieur in the tree i looked and there peering out of a hole in the trunk of the banyan about five feet from the ground i saw a pale face and a pair of large mustachios one clipped short and the other as lamentably out of curl as the tail of a newly whipped pug
then for the first time i realised what i had suspected beforenamely that alphonse was an arrant coward
i walked up to him
come out of that hole i said
is it finished monsieur he asked anxiously quite finished
ah the horrors i have undergone and the prayers i have uttered come out you little wretch i said for i did not feel amiable it is all over so monsieur then my prayers have prevailed
i emerge and he did
as we were walking down together to join the others who were gathered in a group by the wide entrance to the kraal which now resembled a veritable charnelhouse a masai who had escaped so far and been hiding under a bush suddenly sprang up and charged furiously at us
off went alphonse with a howl of terror and after him flew the masai bent upon doing some execution before he died
he soon overtook the poor little frenchman and would have finished him then and there had i not just as alphonse made a last agonized double in the vain hope of avoiding the yard of steel that was flashing in his immediate rear managed to plant a bullet between the elmorans broad shoulders which brought matters to a satisfactory conclusion so far as the frenchman was concerned
but just then he tripped and fell flat and the body of the masai fell right on the top of him moving convulsively in the death struggle
thereupon there arose such a series of piercing howls that i concluded that before he died the savage must have managed to stab poor alphonse
i ran up in a hurry and pulled the masai off and there beneath him lay alphonse covered with blood and jerking himself about like a galvanized frog
poor fellow
thought i he is done for and kneeling down by him i began to search for his wound as well as his struggles would allow
oh the hole in my back he yelled
i am murdered
i am dead
oh annette i searched again but could see no wound
then the truth dawned on methe man was frightened not hurt
get up i shouted get up
arent you ashamed of yourself
you are not touched thereupon he rose not a penny the worse
but monsieur i thought i was he said apologetically i did not know that i had conquered then giving the body of the masai a kick he ejaculated triumphantly ah dog of a black savage thou art dead what victory thoroughly disgusted i left alphonse to look after himself which he did by following me like a shadow and proceeded to join the others by the large entrance
the first thing that i saw was mackenzie seated on a stone with a handkerchief twisted round his thigh from which he was bleeding freely having indeed received a spearthrust that passed right through it and still holding in his hand his favourite carving knife now bent nearly double from which i gathered that he had been successful in his rough and tumble with the elmoran
ah quatermain he sang out in a trembling excited voice so we have conquered but it is a sorry sight a sorry sight and then breaking into broad scotch and glancing at the bent knife in his hand it fashes me sair to have bent my best carver on the breastbone of a savage and he laughed hysterically
poor fellow what between his wound and the killing excitement he had undergone his nerves were much shaken and no wonder
it is hard upon a man of peace and kindly heart to be called upon to join in such a gruesome business
but there fate puts us sometimes into very comical positions
at the kraal entrance the scene was a strange one
the slaughter was over by now and the wounded men had been put out of their pain for no quarter had been given
the bushclosed entrance was trampled flat and in place of bushes it was filled with the bodies of dead men
dead men everywhere dead menthey lay about in knots they were flung by ones and twos in every position upon the open spaces for all the world like the people on the grass in one of the london parks on a particularly hot sunday in august
in front of this entrance on a space which had been cleared of dead and of the shields and spears which were scattered in all directions as they had fallen or been thrown from the hands of their owners stood and lay the survivors of the awful struggle and at their feet were four wounded men
we had gone into the fight thirty strong and of the thirty but fifteen remained alive and five of them including mr mackenzie were wounded two mortally
of those who held the entrance curtis and the zulu alone remained
good had lost five men killed i had lost two killed and mackenzie no less than five out of the six with him
as for the survivors they were with the exception of myself who had never come to close quarters red from head to footsir henrys armour might have been painted that colourand utterly exhausted except umslopogaas who as he grimly stood on a little mound above a heap of dead leaning as usual upon his axe did not seem particularly distressed although the skin over the hole in his head palpitated violently
ah macumazahn he said to me as i limped up feeling very sick i told thee that it would be a good fight and it has
never have i seen a better or one more bravely fought
as for this iron shirt surely it is tagati bewitched nothing could pierce it
had it not been for the garment i should have been there and he nodded towards the great pile of dead men beneath him
i give it thee thou art a brave man said sir henry briefly
koos answered the zulu deeply pleased both at the gift and the compliment
thou too incubu didst bear thyself as a man but i must give thee some lessons with the axe thou dost waste thy strength just then mackenzie asked about flossie and we were all greatly relieved when one of the men said he had seen her flying towards the house with the nurse
then bearing such of the wounded as could be moved at the moment with us we slowly made our way towards the missionhouse spent with toil and bloodshed but with the glorious sense of victory against overwhelming odds glowing in our hearts
we had saved the life of the little maid and taught the masai of those parts a lesson that they will not forget for ten yearsbut at what a cost
painfully we made our way up the hill which just a little more than an hour before we had descended under such different circumstances
at the gate of the wall stood mrs mackenzie waiting for us
when her eyes fell upon us however she shrieked out and covered her face with her hands crying horrible horrible nor were her fears allayed when she discovered her worthy husband being borne upon an improvised stretcher but her doubts as to the nature of his injury were soon set at rest
then when in a few brief words i had told her the upshot of the struggle of which flossie who had arrived in safety had been able to explain something she came up to me and solemnly kissed me on the forehead
god bless you all mr quatermain you have saved my childs life she said simply
then we went in and got our clothes off and doctored our wounds i am glad to say i had none and sir henrys and goods were thanks to those invaluable chain shirts of a comparatively harmless nature and to be dealt with by means of a few stitches and stickingplaster
mackenzies however were serious though fortunately the spear had not severed any large artery
after that we had a bath and what a luxury it was
and having clad ourselves in ordinary clothes proceeded to the diningroom where breakfast was set as usual
it was curious sitting down there drinking tea and eating toast in an ordinary nineteenthcentury sort of way just as though we had not employed the early hours in a regular primitive handtohand middleages kind of struggle
as good said the whole thing seemed more as though one had had a bad nightmare just before being called than as a deed done
when we were finishing our breakfast the door opened and in came little flossie very pale and tottery but quite unhurt
she kissed us all and thanked us
i congratulated her on the presence of mind she had shown in shooting the masai with her derringer pistol and thereby saving her own life
oh dont talk of it she said beginning to cry hysterically i shall never forget his face as he went turning round and round neveri can see it now i advised her to go to bed and get some sleep which she did and awoke in the evening quite recovered so far as her strength was concerned
it struck me as an odd thing that a girl who could find the nerve to shoot a huge black ruffian rushing to kill her with a spear should have been so affected at the thought of it afterwards but it is after all characteristic of the sex
poor flossie
i fear that her nerves will not get over that night in the masai camp for many a long year
she told me afterwards that it was the suspense that was so awful having to sit there hour after hour through the livelong night utterly ignorant as to whether or not any attempt was to be made to rescue her
she said that on the whole she did not expect it knowing how few of us and how many of the masaiwho by the way came continually to stare at her most of them never having seen a white person before and handled her arms and hair with their filthy paws
she said also that she had made up her mind that if she saw no signs of succour by the time the first rays of the rising sun reached the kraal she would kill herself with the pistol for the nurse had heard the lygonani say that they were to be tortured to death as soon as the sun was up if one of the white men did not come in their place
it was an awful resolution to have to take but she meant to act on it and i have little doubt but what she would have done so
although she was at an age when in england girls are in the schoolroom and come down to dessert this child of the wilderness had more courage discretion and power of mind than many a woman of mature age nurtured in idleness and luxury with minds carefully drilled and educated out of any originality or selfresource that nature may have endowed them with
when breakfast was over we all turned in and had a good sleep only getting up in time for dinner after which meal we once more adjourned together with all the available populationmen women youths and girlsto the scene of the mornings slaughter our object being to bury our own dead and get rid of the masai by flinging them into the tana river which ran within fifty yards of the kraal
on reaching the spot we disturbed thousands upon thousands of vultures and a sort of brown bush eagle which had been flocking to the feast from miles and miles away
often have i watched these great and repulsive birds and marvelled at the extraordinary speed with which they arrive on a scene of slaughter
a buck falls to your rifle and within a minute high in the blue ether appears a speck that gradually grows into a vulture then another and another
i have heard many theories advanced to account for the wonderful power of perception nature has given these birds
my own founded on a good deal of observation is that the vultures gifted as they are with powers of sight greater than those given by the most powerful glass quarter out the heavens among themselves and hanging in midair at a vast heightprobably from two to three miles above the earthkeep watch each of them over an enormous stretch of country
presently one of them spies food and instantly begins to sink towards it
thereon his next neighbour in the airy heights sailing leisurely through the blue gulf at a distance perhaps of some miles follows his example knowing that food has been sighted
down he goes and all the vultures within sight of him follow after and so do all those in sight of them
in this way the vultures for twenty miles round can be summoned to the feast in a few minutes
we buried our dead in solemn silence good being selected to read the burial service over them in the absence of mr mackenzie confined to bed as he was generally allowed to possess the best voice and most impressive manner
it was melancholy in the extreme but as good said it might have been worse for we might have had to bury ourselves
i pointed out that this would have been a difficult feat but i knew what he meant
next we set to work to load an oxwagon which had been brought round from the mission with the dead bodies of the masai having first collected the spears shields and other arms
we loaded the wagon five times about fifty bodies to the load and emptied it into the tana
from this it was evident that very few of the masai could have escaped
the crocodiles must have been well fed that night
one of the last bodies we picked up was that of the sentry at the upper end
i asked good how he managed to kill him and he told me that he had crept up much as umslopogaas had done and stabbed him with his sword
he groaned a good deal but fortunately nobody heard him
as good said it was a horrible thing to have to do and most unpleasantly like coldblooded murder
and so with the last body that floated away down the current of the tana ended the incident of our attack on the masai camp
the spears and shields and other arms we took up to the mission where they filled an outhouse
one incident however i must not forget to mention
as we were returning from performing the obsequies of our masai friends we passed the hollow tree where alphonse had secreted himself in the morning
it so happened that the little man himself was with us assisting in our unpleasant task with a far better will than he had shown where live masai were concerned
indeed for each body that he handled he found an appropriate sarcasm
alphonse throwing masai into the tana was a very different creature from alphonse flying for dear life from the spear of a live masai
he was quite merry and gay he clapped his hands and warbled snatches of french songs as the grim dead warriors went splash into the running waters to carry a message of death and defiance to their kindred a hundred miles below
in short thinking that he wanted taking down a peg i suggested holding a courtmartial on him for his conduct in the morning
accordingly we brought him to the tree where he had hidden and proceeded to sit in judgment on him sir henry explaining to him in the very best french the unheardof cowardice and enormity of his conduct more especially in letting the oiled rag out of his mouth whereby he nearly aroused the masai camp with teethchattering and brought about the failure of our plans ending up with a request for an explanation
but if we expected to find alphonse at a loss and put him to open shame we were destined to be disappointed
he bowed and scraped and smiled and acknowledged that his conduct might at first blush appear strange but really it was not inasmuch as his teeth were not chattering from fearoh dear no
oh certainly not
he marvelled how the messieurs could think of such a thingbut from the chill air of the morning
as for the rag if monsieur could have but tasted its evil flavour being compounded indeed of a mixture of stale paraffin oil grease and gunpowder monsieur himself would have spat it out
but he did nothing of the sort he determined to keep it there till alas
his stomach revolted and the rag was ejected in an access of involuntary sickness
and what have you to say about getting into the hollow tree asked sir henry keeping his countenance with difficulty
but monsieur the explanation is easy oh most easy
it was thus i stood there by the kraal wall and the little grey monsieur hit me in the stomach so that my rifle exploded and the battle began
i watched whilst recovering myself from monsieurs cruel blow then messieurs i felt the heroic blood of my grandfather boil up in my veins
the sight made me mad
i ground my teeth
fire flashed from my eyes
i shouted en avant and longed to slay
before my eyes there rose a vision of my heroic grandfather
in short i was mad
i was a warrior indeed
but then in my heart i heard a small voice alphonse said the voice restrain thyself alphonse
give not way to this evil passion
these men though black are brothers
and thou wouldst slay them
cruel alphonse the voice was right
i knew it i was about to perpetrate the most horrible cruelties to wound
to massacre
to tear limb from limb
and how restrain myself
i looked round i saw the tree i perceived the hole
entomb thyself said the voice and hold on tight
thou wilt thus overcome temptation by main force it was bitter just when the blood of my heroic grandfather boiled most fiercely but i obeyed
i dragged my unwilling feet along i entombed myself
through the hole i watched the battle
i shouted curses and defiance on the foe
i noted them fall with satisfaction
why not
i had not robbed them of their lives
their gore was not upon my head
the blood of my heroic oh get along with you you little cur broke out sir henry with a shout of laughter and giving alphonse a good kick which sent him flying off with a rueful face
in the evening i had an interview with mr mackenzie who was suffering a good deal from his wounds which good who was a skilful though unqualified doctor was treating him for
he told me that this occurrence had taught him a lesson and that if he recovered safely he meant to hand over the mission to a younger man who was already on his road to join him in his work and return to england
you see quatermain he said i made up my mind to it this very morning when we were creeping down those benighted savages
if we live through this and rescue flossie alive i said to myself i will go home to england i have had enough of savages well i did not think that we should live through it at the time but thanks be to god and you four we have lived through it and i mean to stick to my resolution lest a worse thing befall us
another such time would kill my poor wife
and besides quatermain between you and me i am well off it is thirty thousand pounds i am worth today and every farthing of it made by honest trade and savings in the bank at zanzibar for living here costs me next to nothing
so though it will be hard to leave this place which i have made to blossom like a rose in the wilderness and harder still to leave the people i have taught i shall go i congratulate you on your decision answered i for two reasons
the first is that you owe a duty to your wife and daughter and more especially to the latter who should receive some education and mix with girls of her own race otherwise she will grow up wild shunning her kind
the other is that as sure as i am standing here sooner or later the masai will try to avenge the slaughter inflicted on them today
two or three men are sure to have escaped the confusion who will carry the story back to their people and the result will be that a great expedition will one day be sent against you
it might be delayed for a year but sooner or later it will come
therefore if only for that reason i should go
when once they have learnt that you are no longer here they may perhaps leave the place alone by a sad coincidence since the above was written by mr quatermain the masai have in april massacred a missionary and his wifemr and mrs houghtonon this very tana river and at the spot described
these are i believe the first white people who are known to have fallen victims to this cruel tribeeditor
you are quite right answered the clergyman
i will turn my back upon this place in a month
but it will be a wrench it will be a wrench into the unknown a week had passed and we all sat at supper one night in the mission diningroom feeling very much depressed in spirits for the reason that we were going to say goodbye to our kind friends the mackenzies and depart upon our way at dawn on the morrow
nothing more had been seen or heard of the masai and save for a spear or two which had been overlooked and was rusting in the grass and a few empty cartridges where we had stood outside the wall it would have been difficult to tell that the old cattle kraal at the foot of the slope had been the scene of so desperate a struggle
mackenzie was thanks chiefly to his being so temperate a man rapidly recovering from his wound and could get about on a pair of crutches and as for the other wounded men one had died of gangrene and the rest were in a fair way to recovery
mr mackenzies caravan of men had also returned from the coast so that the station was now amply garrisoned
under these circumstances we concluded warm and pressing as were the invitations for us to stay that it was time to move on first to mount kenia and thence into the unknown in search of the mysterious white race which we had set our hearts on discovering
this time we were going to progress by means of the humble but useful donkey of which we had collected no less than a dozen to carry our goods and chattels and if necessary ourselves
we had now but two wakwafis left for servants and found it quite impossible to get other natives to venture with us into the unknown parts we proposed to exploreand small blame to them
after all as mr mackenzie said it was odd that three men each of whom possessed many of those things that are supposed to make life worth livinghealth sufficient means and position etcshould from their own pleasure start out upon a wildgoose chase from which the chances were they never would return
but then that is what englishmen are adventurers to the backbone and all our magnificent musterroll of colonies each of which will in time become a great nation testify to the extraordinary value of the spirit of adventure which at first sight looks like a mild form of lunacy
adventurerhe that goes out to meet whatever may come
well that is what we all do in the world one way or another and speaking for myself i am proud of the title because it implies a brave heart and a trust in providence
besides when many and many a noted croesus at whose feet the people worship and many and many a timeserving and wordcoining politician are forgotten the names of those grandhearted old adventurers who have made england what she is will be remembered and taught with love and pride to little children whose unshaped spirits yet slumber in the womb of centuries to be
not that we three can expect to be numbered with such as these yet have we done somethingenough perhaps to throw a garment over the nakedness of our folly
that evening whilst we were sitting on the veranda smoking a pipe before turning in who should come up to us but alphonse and with a magnificent bow announce his wish for an interview
being requested to fire away he explained at some length that he was anxious to attach himself to our partya statement that astonished me not a little knowing what a coward the little man was
the reason however soon appeared
mr mackenzie was going down to the coast and thence on to england
now if he went down country alphonse was persuaded that he would be seized extradited sent to france and to penal servitude
this was the idea that haunted him as king charless head haunted mr dick and he brooded over it till his imagination exaggerated the danger ten times
as a matter of fact the probability is that his offence against the laws of his country had long ago been forgotten and that he would have been allowed to pass unmolested anywhere except in france but he could not be got to see this
constitutional coward as the little man was he infinitely preferred to face the certain hardships and great risks and dangers of such an expedition as ours than to expose himself notwithstanding his intense longing for his native land to the possible scrutiny of a police officerwhich is after all only another exemplification of the truth that to the majority of men a faroff foreseen danger however shadowy is much more terrible than the most serious present emergency
after listening to what he had to say we consulted among ourselves and finally agreed with mr mackenzies knowledge and consent to accept his offer
to begin with we were very shorthanded and alphonse was a quick active fellow who could turn his hand to anything and cookah he could cook
i believe that he would have made a palatable dish of those gaiters of his heroic grandfather which he was so fond of talking about
then he was a goodtempered little man and merry as a monkey whilst his pompous vainglorious talk was a source of infinite amusement to us and what is more he never bore malice
of course his being so pronounced a coward was a great drawback to him but now that we knew his weakness we could more or less guard against it
so after warning him of the undoubted risks he was exposing himself to we told him that we would accept his offer on condition that he would promise implicit obedience to our orders
we also promised to give him wages at the rate of ten pounds a month should he ever return to a civilized country to receive them
to all of this he agreed with alacrity and retired to write a letter to his annette which mr mackenzie promised to post when he got down country
he read it to us afterwards sir henry translating and a wonderful composition it was
i am sure the depth of his devotion and the narration of his sufferings in a barbarous country far far from thee annette for whose adored sake i endure such sorrow ought to have touched the feelings of the stoniesthearted chambermaid
well the morrow came and by seven oclock the donkeys were all loaded and the time of parting was at hand
it was a melancholy business especially saying goodbye to dear little flossie
she and i were great friends and often used to have talks togetherbut her nerves had never got over the shock of that awful night when she lay in the power of those bloodthirsty masai
oh mr quatermain she cried throwing her arms round my neck and bursting into tears i cant bear to say goodbye to you
i wonder when we shall meet again i dont know my dear little girl i said i am at one end of life and you are at the other
i have but a short time before me at best and most things lie in the past but i hope that for you there are many long and happy years and everything lies in the future
byandby you will grow into a beautiful woman flossie and all this wild life will be like a faroff dream to you but i hope even if we never do meet again that you will think of your old friend and remember what i say to you now
always try to be good my dear and to do what is right rather than what happens to be pleasant for in the end whatever sneering people may say what is good and what is happy are the same
be unselfish and whenever you can give a helping hand to othersfor the world is full of suffering my dear and to alleviate it is the noblest end that we can set before us
if you do that you will become a sweet and godfearing woman and make many peoples lives a little brighter and then you will not have lived as so many of your sex do in vain
and now i have given you a lot of oldfashioned advice and so i am going to give you something to sweeten it with
you see this little piece of paper
it is what is called a cheque
when we are gone give it to your father with this notenot before mind
you will marry one day my dear little flossie and it is to buy you a wedding present which you are to wear and your daughter after you if you have one in remembrance of hunter quatermain poor little flossie cried very much and gave me a lock of her bright hair in return which i still have
the cheque i gave her was for a thousand pounds which being now well off and having no calls upon me except those of charity i could well afford and in the note i directed her father to invest it for her in government security and when she married or came of age to buy her the best diamond necklace he could get for the money and accumulated interest
i chose diamonds because i think that now that king solomons mines are lost to the world their price will never be much lower than it is at present so that if in afterlife she should ever be in pecuniary difficulties she will be able to turn them into money
well at last we got off after much handshaking hatwaving and also farewell saluting from the natives alphonse weeping copiously for he has a warm heart at parting with his master and mistress and i was not sorry for it at all for i hate those goodbyes
perhaps the most affecting thing of all was to witness umslopogaas distress at parting with flossie for whom the grim old warrior had conceived a strong affection
he used to say that she was as sweet to see as the only star on a dark night and was never tired of loudly congratulating himself on having killed the lygonani who had threatened to murder her
and that was the last we saw of the pleasant missionhousea true oasis in the desertand of european civilization
but i often think of the mackenzies and wonder how they got down country and if they are now safe and well in england and will ever see these words
dear little flossie
i wonder how she fares there where there are no black folk to do her imperious bidding and no skypiercing snowclad kenia for her to look at when she gets up in the morning
and so goodbye to flossie
after leaving the missionhouse we made our way comparatively unmolested past the base of mount kenia which the masai call donyo egere or the speckled mountain on account of the black patches of rock that appear upon its mighty spire where the sides are too precipitous to allow of the snow lying on them then on past the lonely lake baringo where one of our two remaining askari having unfortunately trodden on a puffadder died of snakebite in spite of all our efforts to save him
thence we proceeded a distance of about a hundred and fifty miles to another magnificent snowclad mountain called lekakisera which has never to the best of my belief been visited before by a european but which i cannot now stop to describe
there we rested a fortnight and then started out into the trackless and uninhabited forest of a vast district called elgumi
in this forest alone there are more elephants than i ever met with or heard of before
the mighty mammals literally swarm there entirely unmolested by man and only kept down by the natural law that prevents any animals increasing beyond the capacity of the country they inhabit to support them
needless to say however we did not shoot many of them first because we could not afford to waste ammunition of which our stock was getting perilously low a donkey loaded with it having been swept away in fording a flooded river and secondly because we could not carry away the ivory and did not wish to kill for the mere sake of slaughter
so we let the great beasts be only shooting one or two in selfprotection
in this district the elephants being unacquainted with the hunter and his tender mercies would allow one to walk up to within twenty yards of them in the open while they stood with their great ears cocked for all the world like puzzled and gigantic puppydogs and stared at that new and extraordinary phenomenonman
occasionally when the inspection did not prove satisfactory the staring ended in a trumpet and a charge but this did not often happen
when it did we had to use our rifles
nor were elephants the only wild beasts in the great elgumi forest
all sorts of large game abounded including lionsconfound them
i have always hated the sight of a lion since one bit my leg and lamed me for life
as a consequence another thing that abounded was the dreadful tsetse fly whose bite is death to domestic animals
donkeys have together with men hitherto been supposed to enjoy a peculiar immunity from its attacks but all i have to say whether it was on account of their poor condition or because the tsetse in those parts is more poisonous than usual i do not know but ours succumbed to its onslaught
fortunately however that was not till two months or so after the bites had been inflicted when suddenly after a two days cold rain they all died and on removing the skins of several of them i found the long yellow streaks upon the flesh which are characteristic of death from bites from the tsetse marking the spot where the insect had inserted his proboscis
on emerging from the great elgumi forest we still steering northwards in accordance with the information mr mackenzie had collected from the unfortunate wanderer who reached him only to die so tragically struck the base in due course of the large lake called laga by the natives which is about fifty miles long by twenty broad and of which it may be remembered he made mention
thence we pushed on nearly a months journey over great rolling uplands something like those in the transvaal but diversified by patches of bush country
all this time we were continually ascending at the rate of about one hundred feet every ten miles
indeed the country was on a slope which appeared to terminate at a mass of snowtipped mountains for which we were steering and where we learnt the second lake of which the wanderer had spoken as the lake without a bottom was situated
at length we arrived there and having ascertained that there was a large lake on top of the mountains ascended three thousand feet more till we came to a precipitous cliff or edge to find a great sheet of water some twenty miles square lying fifteen hundred feet below us and evidently occupying an extinct volcanic crater or craters of vast extent
perceiving villages on the border of this lake we descended with great difficulty through forests of pine trees which now clothed the precipitous sides of the crater and were well received by the people a simple unwarlike folk who had never seen or even heard of a white man before and treated us with great reverence and kindness supplying us with as much food and milk as we could eat and drink
this wonderful and beautiful lake lay according to our aneroid at a height of no less than feet above sealevel and its climate was quite cold and not at all unlike that of england
indeed for the first three days of our stay there we saw little or nothing of the scenery on account of an unmistakable scotch mist which prevailed
it was this rain that set the tsetse poison working in our remaining donkeys so that they all died
this disaster left us in a very awkward position as we had now no means of transport whatever though on the other hand we had not much to carry
ammunition too was very short amounting to but one hundred and fifty rounds of rifle cartridges and some fifty shotgun cartridges
how to get on we did not know indeed it seemed to us that we had about reached the end of our tether
even if we had been inclined to abandon the object of our search which shadow as it was was by no means the case it was ridiculous to think of forcing our way back some seven hundred miles to the coast in our present plight so we came to the conclusion that the only thing to be done was to stop where we werethe natives being so well disposed and food plentifulfor the present and abide events and try to collect information as to the countries beyond
accordingly having purchased a capital log canoe large enough to hold us all and our baggage from the headman of the village we were staying in presenting him with three empty colddrawn brass cartridges by way of payment with which he was perfectly delighted we set out to make a tour of the lake in order to find the most favourable place to make a camp
as we did not know if we should return to this village we put all our gear into the canoe and also a quarter of cooked waterbuck which when young is delicious eating and off we set natives having already gone before us in light canoes to warn the inhabitants of the other villages of our approach
as we were paddling leisurely along good remarked upon the extraordinary deep blue colour of the water and said that he understood from the natives who were great fishermenfish indeed being their principal foodthat the lake was supposed to be wonderfully deep and to have a hole at the bottom through which the water escaped and put out some great fire that was raging below
i pointed out to him that what he had heard was probably a legend arising from a tradition among the people which dated back to the time when one of the extinct parasitic volcanic cones was in activity
we saw several round the borders of the lake which had no doubt been working at a period long subsequent to the volcanic death of the central crater which now formed the bed of the lake itself
when it finally became extinct the people would imagine that the water from the lake had run down and put out the big fire below more especially as though it was constantly fed by streams running from the snowtipped peaks about there was no visible exit to it
the farther shore of the lake we found on approaching it to consist of a vast perpendicular wall of rock which held the water without any intermediate sloping bank as elsewhere
accordingly we paddled parallel with this precipice at a distance of about a hundred paces from it shaping our course for the end of the lake where we knew that there was a large village
as we went we began to pass a considerable accumulation of floating rushes weed boughs of trees and other rubbish brought good supposed to this spot by some current which he was much puzzled to account for
whilst we were speculating about this sir henry pointed out a flock of large white swans which were feeding on the drift some little way ahead of us
now i had already noticed swans flying about this lake and having never come across them before in africa was exceedingly anxious to obtain a specimen
i had questioned the natives about them and learnt that they came from over the mountain always arriving at certain periods of the year in the early morning when it was very easy to catch them on account of their exhausted condition
i also asked them what country they came from when they shrugged their shoulders and said that on the top of the great black precipice was stony inhospitable land and beyond that were mountains with snow and full of wild beasts where no people lived and beyond the mountains were hundreds of miles of dense thorn forest so thick that even the elephants could not get through it much less men
next i asked them if they had ever heard of white people like ourselves living on the farther side of the mountains and the thorn forest whereat they laughed
but afterwards a very old woman came and told me that when she was a little girl her grandfather had told her that in his youth his grandfather had crossed the desert and the mountains and pierced the thorn forest and seen a white people who lived in stone kraals beyond
of course as this took the tale back some two hundred and fifty years the information was very indefinite but still there it was again and on thinking it over i grew firmly convinced that there was some truth in all these rumours and equally firmly determined to solve the mystery
little did i guess in what an almost miraculous way my desire was to be gratified
well we set to work to stalk the swans which kept drawing as they fed nearer and nearer to the precipice and at last we pushed the canoe under shelter of a patch of drift within forty yards of them
sir henry had the shotgun loaded with no
and waiting for a chance got two in a line and firing at their necks killed them both
up rose the rest thirty or more of them with a mighty splashing and as they did so he gave them the other barrel
down came one fellow with a broken wing and i saw the leg of another drop and a few feathers start out of his back but he went on quite strong
up went the swans circling ever higher till at last they were mere specks level with the top of the frowning precipice when i saw them form into a triangle and head off for the unknown northeast
meanwhile we had picked up our two dead ones and beautiful birds they were weighing not less than about thirty pounds each and were chasing the winged one which had scrambled over a mass of driftweed into a pool of clear water beyond
finding a difficulty in forcing the canoe through the rubbish i told our only remaining wakwafi servant whom i knew to be an excellent swimmer to jump over dive under the drift and catch him knowing that as there were no crocodiles in this lake he could come to no harm
entering into the fun of the thing the man obeyed and soon was dodging about after the winged swan in fine style getting gradually nearer to the rock wall against which the water washed as he did so
presently he gave up swimming after the swan and began to cry out that he was being carried away and indeed we saw that though he was swimming with all his strength towards us he was being drawn slowly to the precipice
with a few desperate strokes of our paddles we pushed the canoe through the crust of drift and rowed towards the man as hard as we could but fast as we went he was drawn faster to the rock
suddenly i saw that before us just rising eighteen inches or so above the surface of the lake was what looked like the top of the arch of a submerged cave or railway tunnel
evidently from the watermark on the rock several feet above it it was generally entirely submerged but there had been a dry season and the cold had prevented the snow from melting as freely as usual so the lake was low and the arch showed
towards this arch our poor servant was being sucked with frightful rapidity
he was not more than ten fathoms from it and we were about twenty when i saw it and with little help from us the canoe flew along after him
he struggled bravely and i thought that we should have saved him when suddenly i perceived an expression of despair come upon his face and there before our eyes he was sucked down into the cruel swirling blue depths and vanished
at the same moment i felt our canoe seized as with a mighty hand and propelled with resistless force towards the rock
we realised our danger now and rowed or rather paddled furiously in our attempt to get out of the vortex
in vain in another second we were flying straight for the arch like an arrow and i thought that we were lost
luckily i retained sufficient presence of mind to shout out instantly setting the example by throwing myself into the bottom of the canoe down on your facesdown and the others had the sense to take the hint
in another instant there was a grinding noise and the boat was pushed down till the water began to trickle over the sides and i thought that we were gone
but no suddenly the grinding ceased and we could again feel the canoe flying along
i turned my head a littlei dared not lift itand looked up
by the feeble light that yet reached the canoe i could make out that a dense arch of rock hung just over our heads and that was all
in another minute i could not even see as much as that for the faint light had merged into shadow and the shadows had been swallowed up in darkness utter and complete
for an hour or so we lay there not daring to lift our heads for fear lest the brains should be dashed out of them and scarcely able to speak even on account of the noise of the rushing water which drowned our voices
not indeed that we had much inclination to speak seeing that we were overwhelmed by the awfulness of our position and the imminent fear of instant death either by being dashed against the sides of the cavern or on a rock or being sucked down in the raging waters or perhaps asphyxiated by want of air
all of these and many other modes of death presented themselves to my imagination as i lay at the bottom of the canoe listening to the swirl of the hurrying waters which ran whither we knew not
one only other sound could i hear and that was alphonses intermittent howl of terror coming from the centre of the canoe and even that seemed faint and unnatural
indeed the whole thing overpowered my brain and i began to believe that i was the victim of some ghastly spiritshaking nightmare
the rose of fire on we flew drawn by the mighty current till at last i noticed that the sound of the water was not half so deafening as it had been and concluded that this must be because there was more room for the echoes to disperse in
i could now hear alphonses howls much more distinctly they were made up of the oddest mixture of invocations to the supreme power and the name of his beloved annette that it is possible to conceive and in short though their evident earnestness saved them from profanity were to say the least very remarkable
taking up a paddle i managed to drive it into his ribs whereon he thinking that the end had come howled louder than ever
then i slowly and cautiously raised myself on my knees and stretched my hand upwards but could touch no roof
next i took the paddle and lifted it above my head as high as i could but with the same result
i also thrust it out laterally to the right and left but could touch nothing except water
then i bethought me that there was in the boat amongst our other remaining possessions a bullseye lantern and a tin of oil
i groped about and found it and having a match on me carefully lit it and as soon as the flame had got a hold of the wick i turned it on down the boat
as it happened the first thing the light lit on was the white and scared face of alphonse who thinking that it was all over at last and that he was witnessing a preliminary celestial phenomenon gave a terrific yell and was with difficulty reassured with the paddle
as for the other three good was lying on the flat of his back his eyeglass still fixed in his eye and gazing blankly into the upper darkness
sir henry had his head resting on the thwarts of the canoe and with his hand was trying to test the speed of the water
but when the beam of light fell upon old umslopogaas i could really have laughed
i think i have said that we had put a roast quarter of waterbuck into the canoe
well it so happened that when we all prostrated ourselves to avoid being swept out of the boat and into the water by the rock roof umslopogaass head had come down uncommonly near this roast buck and so soon as he had recovered a little from the first shock of our position it occurred to him that he was hungry
thereupon he coolly cut off a chop with inkosikaas and was now employed in eating it with every appearance of satisfaction
as he afterwards explained he thought that he was going on a long journey and preferred to start on a full stomach
it reminded me of the people who are going to be hanged and who are generally reported in the english daily papers to have made an excellent breakfast
sir henry afterwards wrote down one of alphonses prayers as he overheard it
it ran thus oh save me
lake me out of this hole
i will promise never to go exploring again
oh annette why did i leave thee
oh my false cousin
oh deliver me from this horrible main drain
never mind the others
let them drown they are more used to it than i am and they cannot cook
oh annette
annette cresendo
annette fortissimo as soon as the others saw that i had managed to light the lamp we bundled alphonse into the farther end of the canoe with a threat which calmed him down wonderfully that if he would insist upon making the darkness hideous with his cries we would put him out of suspense by sending him to join the wakwafi and wait for annette in another sphere and began to discuss the situation as well as we could
first however at goods suggestion we bound two paddles mastfashion in the bows so that they might give us warning against any sudden lowering of the roof of the cave or waterway
it was clear to us that we were in an underground river or as alphonse defined it main drain which carried off the superfluous waters of the lake
such rivers are well known to exist in many parts of the world but it has not often been the evil fortune of explorers to travel by them
that the river was wide we could clearly see for the light from the bullseye lantern failed to reach from shore to shore although occasionally when the current swept us either to one side or the other we could distinguish the rock wall of the tunnel which as far as we could make out appeared to arch about twentyfive feet above our heads
as for the current itself it ran good estimated at least eight knots and fortunately for us was as is usual fiercest in the middle of the stream
still our first act was to arrange that one of us with the lantern and a pole there was in the canoe should always be in the bows ready if possible to prevent us from being stove in against the side of the cave or any projecting rock
umslopogaas having already dined took the first turn
this was absolutely with one exception all that we could do towards preserving our safety
the exception was that another of us took up a position in the stern with a paddle by means of which it was possible to steer the canoe more or less and to keep her from the sides of the cave
these matters attended to we made a somewhat sparing meal off the cold bucks meat for we did not know how long it might have to last us and then feeling in rather better spirits i gave my opinion that serious as it undoubtedly was i did not consider our position altogether without hope unless indeed the natives were right and the river plunged straight down into the bowels of the earth
if not it was clear that it must emerge somewhere probably on the other side of the mountains and in that case all we had to think of was to keep ourselves alive till we got there wherever there might be
but of course as good lugubriously pointed out on the other hand we might fall victims to a hundred unsuspected horrorsor the river might go on winding away inside the earth till it dried up in which case our fate would indeed be an awful one
well let us hope for the best and prepare ourselves for the worst said sir henry who is always cheerful and even spiriteda very tower of strength in the time of trouble
we have come out of so many queer scrapes together that somehow i almost fancy we shall come out of this he added
this was excellent advice and we proceeded to take it each in our separate waythat is except alphonse who had by now sunk into a sort of terrified stupor
good was at the helm and umslopogaas in the bows so there was nothing left for sir henry and myself to do except to lie down in the canoe and think
it certainly was a curious and indeed almost a weird position to be placed inrushing along as we were through the bowels of the earth borne on the bosom of a stygian river something after the fashion of souls being ferried by charon as curtis said
and how dark it was
the feeble ray from our little lamp did but serve to show the darkness
there in the bows sat old umslopogaas like pleasure in the poem watchful and untiring the pole ready to his hand and behind in the shadow i could just make out the form of good peering forward at the ray of light in order to make out how to steer with the paddle that he held and now and again dipped into the water
mr allan quatermain misquotespleasure sat at the helmeditor
well well thought i you have come in search of adventures allan my boy and you have certainly got them
at your time of life too
you ought to be ashamed of yourself but somehow you are not and awful as it all is perhaps you will pull through after all and if you dont why you cannot help it you see
and when alls said and done an underground river will make a very appropriate buryingplace at first however i am bound to say that the strain upon the nerves was very great
it is trying to the coolest and most experienced person not to know from one hour to another if he has five minutes more to live but there is nothing in this world that one cannot get accustomed to and in time we began to get accustomed even to that
and after all our anxiety though no doubt natural was strictly speaking illogical seeing that we never know what is going to happen to us the next minute even when we sit in a welldrained house with two policemen patrolling under the windownor how long we have to live
it is all arranged for us my sons so what is the use of bothering
it was nearly midday when we made our dive into darkness and we had set our watch good and umslopogaas at two having agreed that it should be of a duration of five hours
at seven oclock accordingly sir henry and i went on sir henry at the bow and i at the stern and the other two lay down and went to sleep
for three hours all went well sir henry only finding it necessary once to push us off from the side and i that but little steering was required to keep us straight as the violent current did all that was needed though occasionally the canoe showed a tendency which had to be guarded against to veer and travel broadside on
what struck me as the most curious thing about this wonderful river was how did the air keep fresh
it was muggy and thick no doubt but still not sufficiently so to render it bad or even remarkably unpleasant
the only explanation that i can suggest is that the water of the lake had sufficient air in it to keep the atmosphere of the tunnel from absolute stagnation this air being given out as it proceeded on its headlong way
of course i only give the solution of the mystery for what it is worth which perhaps is not much
when i had been for three hours or so at the helm i began to notice a decided change in the temperature which was getting warmer
at first i took no notice of it but when at the expiration of another halfhour i found that it was getting hotter and hotter i called to sir henry and asked him if he noticed it or if it was only my imagination
noticed it he answered i should think so
i am in a sort of turkish bath just about then the others woke up gasping and were obliged to begin to discard their clothes
here umslopogaas had the advantage for he did not wear any to speak of except a moocha
hotter it grew and hotter yet till at last we could scarcely breathe and the perspiration poured out of us
half an hour more and though we were all now stark naked we could hardly bear it
the place was like an antechamber of the infernal regions proper
i dipped my hand into the water and drew it out almost with a cry it was nearly boiling
we consulted a little thermometer we hadthe mercury stood at degrees
from the surface of the water rose a dense cloud of steam
alphonse groaned out that we were already in purgatory which indeed we were though not in the sense that he meant it
sir henry suggested that we must be passing near the seat of some underground volcanic fire and i am inclined to think especially in the light of what subsequently occurred that he was right
our sufferings for some time after this really pass my powers of description
we no longer perspired for all the perspiration had been sweated out of us
we simply lay in the bottom of the boat which we were now physically incapable of directing feeling like hot embers and i fancy undergoing very much the same sensations that the poor fish do when they are dying on landnamely that of slow suffocation
our skins began to crack and the blood to throb in our heads like the beating of a steamengine
this had been going on for some time when suddenly the river turned a little and i heard sir henry call out from the bows in a hoarse startled voice and looking up saw a most wonderful and awful thing
about half a mile ahead of us and a little to the left of the centre of the streamwhich we could now see was about ninety feet broada huge pillarlike jet of almost white flame rose from the surface of the water and sprang fifty feet into the air when it struck the roof and spread out some forty feet in diameter falling back in curved sheets of fire shaped like the petals of a fullblown rose
indeed this awful gas jet resembled nothing so much as a great flaming flower rising out of the black water
below was the straight stalk a foot or more thick and above the dreadful bloom
and as for the fearfulness of it and its fierce and awesome beauty who can describe it
certainly i cannot
although we were now some five hundred yards away it notwithstanding the steam lit up the whole cavern as clear as day and we could see that the roof was here about forty feet above us and washed perfectly smooth with water
the rock was black and here and there i could make out long shining lines of ore running through it like great veins but of what metal they were i know not
on we rushed towards this pillar of fire which gleamed fiercer than any furnace ever lit by man
keep the boat to the right quatermainto the right shouted sir henry and a minute afterwards i saw him fall forward senseless
alphonse had already gone
good was the next to go
there they lay as though dead only umslopogaas and i kept our senses
we were within fifty yards of it now and i saw the zulus head fall forward on his hands
he had gone too and i was alone
i could not breathe the fierce heat dried me up
for yards and yards round the great rose of fire the rockroof was redhot
the wood of the boat was almost burning
i saw the feathers on one of the dead swans begin to twist and shrivel up but i would not give in
i knew that if i did we should pass within three or four yards of the gas jet and perish miserably
i set the paddle so as to turn the canoe as far from it as possible and held on grimly
my eyes seemed to be bursting from my head and through my closed lids i could see the fierce light
we were nearly opposite now it roared like all the fires of hell and the water boiled furiously around it
five seconds more
we were past i heard the roar behind me
then i too fell senseless
the next thing that i recollect is feeling a breath of air upon my face
my eyes opened with great difficulty
i looked up
far far above me there was light though around me was great gloom
then i remembered and looked
the canoe still floated down the river and in the bottom of it lay the naked forms of my companions
were they dead i wondered
was i left alone in this awful place i knew not
next i became conscious of a burning thirst
i put my hand over the edge of the boat into the water and drew it up again with a cry
no wonder nearly all the skin was burnt off the back of it
the water however was cold or nearly so and i drank pints and splashed myself all over
my body seemed to suck up the fluid as one may see a brick wall suck up rain after a drought but where i was burnt the touch of it caused intense pain
then i bethought myself of the others and dragging myself towards them with difficulty i sprinkled them with water and to my joy they began to recoverumslopogaas first then the others
next they drank absorbing water like so many sponges
then feeling chillya queer contrast to our recent sensationswe began as best we could to get into our clothes
as we did so good pointed to the port side of the canoe it was all blistered with heat and in places actually charred
had it been built like our civilized boats good said that the planks would certainly have warped and let in enough water to sink us but fortunately it was dug out of the soft willowy wood of a single great tree and had sides nearly three inches and a bottom four inches thick
what that awful flame was we never discovered but i suppose that there was at this spot a crack or hole in the bed of the river through which a vast volume of gas forced its way from its volcanic home in the bowels of the earth towards the upper air
how it first became ignited is of course impossible to sayprobably i should think from some spontaneous explosion of mephitic gases
as soon as we had got some things together and shaken ourselves together a little we set to work to make out where we were now
i have said that there was light above and on examination we found that it came from the sky
our river that was sir henry said a literal realization of the wild vision of the poet was no longer underground but was running on its darksome way not now through caverns measureless to man but between two frightful cliffs which cannot have been less than two thousand feet high
so high were they indeed that though the sky was above us where we were was dense gloomnot darkness indeed but the gloom of a room closely shuttered in the daytime
up on either side rose the great straight cliffs grim and forbidding till the eye grew dizzy with trying to measure their sheer height
the little space of sky that marked where they ended lay like a thread of blue upon their soaring blackness which was unrelieved by any tree or creeper
here and there however grew ghostly patches of a long grey lichen hanging motionless to the rock as the white beard to the chin of a dead man
it seemed as though only the dregs or heavier part of the light had sunk to the bottom of this awful place
no brightwinged sunbeam could fall so low they died far far above our heads
in kubla khan a river ran through caverns measureless to man down to a sunless sea by the rivers edge was a little shore formed of round fragments of rock washed into this shape by the constant action of water and giving the place the appearance of being strewn with thousands of fossil cannon balls
evidently when the water of the underground river is high there is no beach at all or very little between the border of the stream and the precipitous cliffs but now there was a space of seven or eight yards
and here on this beach we determined to land in order to rest ourselves a little after all that we had gone through and to stretch our limbs
it was a dreadful place but it would give an hours respite from the terrors of the river and also allow of our repacking and arranging the canoe
accordingly we selected what looked like a favourable spot and with some little difficulty managed to beach the canoe and scramble out on to the round inhospitable pebbles
my word called out good who was on shore the first what an awful place
its enough to give one a fit and he laughed
instantly a thundering voice took up his words magnifying them a hundred times
give one a fitho
ho
hoa fit ho
ho
ho answered another voice in wild accents from far up the cliffa fit
a fit
a fit chimed in voice after voiceeach flinging the words to and fro with shouts of awful laughter to the invisible lips of the other till the whole place echoed with the words and with shrieks of fiendish merriment which at last ceased as suddenly as they had begun
oh mon dieu yelled alphonse startled quite out of such selfcommand as he possessed
mon dieu
mon dieu
mon dieu the titanic echoes thundered shrieked and wailed in every conceivable tone
ah said umslopogaas calmly i clearly perceive that devils live here
well the place looks like it i tried to explain to him that the cause of all the hubbub was a very remarkable and interesting echo but he would not believe it
ah he said i know an echo when i hear one
there was one lived opposite my kraal in zululand and the intombis maidens used to talk with it
but if what we hear is a fullgrown echo mine at home can only have been a baby
no nothey are devils up there
but i dont think much of them though he added taking a pinch of snuff
they can copy what one says but they dont seem to be able to talk on their own account and they dare not show their faces and he relapsed into silence and apparently paid no further attention to such contemptible fiends
after this we found it necessary to keep our conversation down to a whisperfor it was really unbearable to have every word one uttered tossed to and fro like a tennisball as precipice called to precipice
but even our whispers ran up the rocks in mysterious murmurs till at last they died away in longdrawn sighs of sound
echoes are delightful and romantic things but we had more than enough of them in that dreadful gulf
as soon as we had settled ourselves a little on the round stones we went on to wash and dress our burns as well as we could
as we had but a little oil for the lantern we could not spare any for this purpose so we skinned one of the swans and used the fat off its breast which proved an excellent substitute
then we repacked the canoe and finally began to take some food of which i need scarcely say we were in need for our insensibility had endured for many hours and it was as our watches showed midday
accordingly we seated ourselves in a circle and were soon engaged in discussing our cold meat with such appetite as we could muster which in my case at any rate was not much as i felt sick and faint after my sufferings of the previous night and had besides a racking headache
it was a curious meal
the gloom was so intense that we could scarcely see the way to cut our food and convey it to our mouths
still we got on pretty well till i happened to look behind memy attention being attracted by a noise of something crawling over the stones and perceived sitting upon a rock in my immediate rear a huge species of black freshwater crab only it was five times the size of any crab i ever saw
this hideous and loathsomelooking animal had projecting eyes that seemed to glare at one very long and flexible antennae or feelers and gigantic claws
nor was i especially favoured with its company
from every quarter dozens of these horrid brutes were creeping up drawn i suppose by the smell of the food from between the round stones and out of holes in the precipice
some were already quite close to us
i stared quite fascinated by the unusual sight and as i did so i saw one of the beasts stretch out its huge claw and give the unsuspecting good such a nip behind that he jumped up with a howl and set the wild echoes flying in sober earnest
just then too another a very large one got hold of alphonses leg and declined to part with it and as may be imagined a considerable scene ensued
umslopogaas took his axe and cracked the shell of one with the flat of it whereon it set up a horrid screaming which the echoes multiplied a thousandfold and began to foam at the mouth a proceeding that drew hundreds more of its friends out of unsuspected holes and corners
those on the spot perceiving that the animal was hurt fell upon it like creditors on a bankrupt and literally rent it limb from limb with their huge pincers and devoured it using their claws to convey the fragments to their mouths
seizing whatever weapons were handy such as stones or paddles we commenced a war upon the monsterswhose numbers were increasing by leaps and bounds and whose stench was overpowering
so fast as we cracked their armour others seized the injured ones and devoured them foaming at the mouth and screaming as they did so
nor did the brutes stop at that
when they could they nipped hold of usand awful nips they wereor tried to steal the meat
one enormous fellow got hold of the swan we had skinned and began to drag it off
instantly a score of others flung themselves upon the prey and then began a ghastly and disgusting scene
how the monsters foamed and screamed and rent the flesh and each other
it was a sickening and unnatural sight and one that will haunt all who saw it till their dying dayenacted as it was in the deep oppressive gloom and set to the unceasing music of the manytoned nerveshaking echoes
strange as it may seem to say so there was something so shockingly human about these fiendish creaturesit was as though all the most evil passions and desires of man had got into the shell of a magnified crab and gone mad
they were so dreadfully courageous and intelligent and they looked as if they understood
the whole scene might have furnished material for another canto of dantes inferno as curtis said
i say you fellows lets get out of this or we shall all go off our heads sung out good and we were not slow to take the hint
pushing the canoe around which the animals were now crawling by hundreds and making vain attempts to climb off the rocks we bundled into it and got out into midstream leaving behind us the fragments of our meal and the screaming foaming stinking mass of monsters in full possession of the ground
those are the devils of the place said umslopogaas with the air of one who has solved a problem and upon my word i felt almost inclined to agree with him
umslopogaas remarks were like his axevery much to the point
whats to be done next said sir henry blankly
drift i suppose i answered and we drifted accordingly
all the afternoon and well into the evening we floated on in the gloom beneath the faroff line of blue sky scarcely knowing when day ended and night began for down in that vast gulf the difference was not marked till at length good pointed out a star hanging right above us which having nothing better to do we observed with great interest
suddenly it vanished the darkness became intense and a familiar murmuring sound filled the air
underground again i said with a groan holding up the lamp
yes there was no doubt about it
i could just make out the roof
the chasm had come to an end and the tunnel had recommenced
and then there began another long long night of danger and horror
to describe all its incidents would be too wearisome so i will simply say that about midnight we struck on a flat projecting rock in midstream and were as nearly as possible overturned and drowned
however at last we got off and went upon the uneven tenor of our way
and so the hours passed till it was nearly three oclock
sir henry good and alphonse were asleep utterly worn out umslopogaas was at the bow with the pole and i was steering when i perceived that the rate at which we were travelling had perceptibly increased
then suddenly i heard umslopogaas make an exclamation and next second came a sound as of parting branches and i became aware that the canoe was being forced through hanging bushes or creepers
another minute and the breath of sweet open air fanned my face and i felt that we had emerged from the tunnel and were floating upon clear water
i say felt for i could see nothing the darkness being absolutely pitchy as it often is just before the dawn
but even this could scarcely damp my joy
we were out of that dreadful river and wherever we might have got to this at least was something to be thankful for
and so i sat down and inhaled the sweet night air and waited for the dawn with such patience as i could command
the frowning city for an hour or more i sat waiting umslopogaas having meanwhile gone to sleep also till at length the east turned grey and huge misty shapes moved over the surface of the water like ghosts of longforgotten dawns
they were the vapours rising from their watery bed to greet the sun
then the grey turned to primrose and the primrose grew to red
next glorious bars of light sprang up across the eastern sky and through them the radiant messengers of the dawn came speeding upon their arrowy way scattering the ghostly vapours and awaking the mountains with a kiss as they flew from range to range and longitude to longitude
another moment and the golden gates were open and the sun himself came forth as a bridegroom from his chamber with pomp and glory and a flashing as of ten million spears and embraced the night and covered her with brightness and it was day
but as yet i could see nothing save the beautiful blue sky above for over the water was a thick layer of mist exactly as though the whole surface had been covered with billows of cotton wool
by degrees however the sun sucked up the mists and then i saw that we were afloat upon a glorious sheet of blue water of which i could not make out the shore
some eight or ten miles behind us however there stretched as far as the eye could reach a range of precipitous hills that formed a retaining wall of the lake and i have no doubt but that it was through some entrance in these hills that the subterranean river found its way into the open water
indeed i afterwards ascertained this to be the fact and it will be some indication of the extraordinary strength and directness of the current of the mysterious river that the canoe even at this distance was still answering to it
presently too i or rather umslopogaas who woke up just then discovered another indication and a very unpleasant one it was
perceiving some whitish object upon the water umslopogaas called my attention to it and with a few strokes of the paddle brought the canoe to the spot whereupon we discovered that the object was the body of a man floating face downwards
this was bad enough but imagine my horror when umslopogaas having turned him on to his back with the paddle we recognized in the sunken features the lineaments ofwhom do you suppose
none other than our poor servant who had been sucked down two days before in the waters of the subterranean river
it quite frightened me
i thought that we had left him behind for ever and behold
borne by the current he had made the awful journey with us and with us had reached the end
his appearance also was dreadful for he bore traces of having touched the pillar of fireone arm being completely shrivelled up and all his hair being burnt off
the features were as i have said sunken and yet they preserved upon them that awful look of despair that i had seen upon his living face as the poor fellow was sucked down
really the sight unnerved me weary and shaken as i felt with all that we had gone through and i was heartily glad when suddenly and without any warning the body began to sink just as though it had had a mission which having been accomplished it retired the real reason no doubt being that turning it on its back allowed a free passage to the gas
down it went to the transparent depthsfathom after fathom we could trace its course till at last a long line of bright airbubbles swiftly chasing each other to the surface alone remained where it had passed
at length these too were gone and that was an end of our poor servant
umslopogaas thoughtfully watched the body vanish
what did he follow us for he asked
tis an ill omen for thee and me macumazahn and he laughed
i turned on him angrily for i dislike these unpleasant suggestions
if people have such ideas they ought in common decency to keep them to themselves
i detest individuals who make on the subject of their disagreeable presentiments or who when they dream that they saw one hanged as a common felon or some such horror will insist upon telling one all about it at breakfast even if they have to get up early to do it
just then however the others woke up and began to rejoice exceedingly at finding that we were out of that dreadful river and once more beneath the blue sky
then followed a babel of talk and suggestions as to what we were to do next the upshot of all of which was that as we were excessively hungry and had nothing whatsoever left to eat except a few scraps of biltong dried gameflesh having abandoned all that remained of our provisions to those horrible freshwater crabs we determined to make for the shore
but a new difficulty arose
we did not know where the shore was and with the exception of the cliffs through which the subterranean river made its entry could see nothing but a wide expanse of sparkling blue water
observing however that the long flights of aquatic birds kept flying from our left we concluded that they were advancing from their feedinggrounds on shore to pass the day in the lake and accordingly headed the boat towards the quarter whence they came and began to paddle
before long however a stiffish breeze sprang up blowing directly in the direction we wanted so we improvised a sail with a blanket and the pole which took us along merrily
this done we devoured the remnants of our biltong washed down with the sweet lake water and then lit our pipes and awaited whatever might turn up
when we had been sailing for an hour good who was searching the horizon with the spyglass suddenly announced joyfully that he saw land and pointed out that from the change in the colour of the water he thought we must be approaching the mouth of a river
in another minute we perceived a great golden dome not unlike that of st pauls piercing the morning mists and while we were wondering what in the world it could be good reported another and still more important discovery namely that a small sailingboat was advancing towards us
this bit of news which we were very shortly able to verify with our own eyes threw us into a considerable flutter
that the natives of this unknown lake should understand the art of sailing seemed to suggest that they possessed some degree of civilization
in a few more minutes it became evident that the occupant or occupants of the advancing boat had made us out
for a moment or two she hung in the wind as though in doubt and then came tacking towards us with great swiftness
in ten more minutes she was within a hundred yards and we saw that she was a neat little boatnot a canoe dug out but built more or less in the european fashion with planks and carrying a singularly large sail for her size
but our attention was soon diverted from the boat to her crew which consisted of a man and a woman nearly as white as ourselves
we stared at each other in amazement thinking that we must be mistaken but no there was no doubt about it
they were not fair but the two people in the boat were decidedly of a white as distinguished from a black race as white for instance as spaniards or italians
it was a patent fact
so it was true after all and mysteriously led by a power beyond our own we had discovered this wonderful people
i could have shouted for joy when i thought of the glory and the wonder of the thing and as it was we all shook hands and congratulated each other on the unexpected success of our wild search
all my life had i heard rumours of a white race that existed in the highlands of this vast continent and longed to put them to the proof and now here i saw it with my own eyes and was dumbfounded
truly as sir henry said the old roman was right when he wrote ex africa semper aliquid novi which he tells me means that out of africa there always comes some new thing
the man in the boat was of a good but not particularly fine physique and possessed straight black hair regular aquiline features and an intelligent face
he was dressed in a brown cloth garment something like a flannel shirt without the sleeves and in an unmistakable kilt of the same material
the legs and feet were bare
round the right arm and left leg he wore thick rings of yellow metal that i judged to be gold
the woman had a sweet face wild and shy with large eyes and curling brown hair
her dress was made of the same material as the mans and consisted as we afterwards discovered first of a linen undergarment that hung down to her knee and then of a single long strip of cloth about four feet wide by fifteen long which was wound round the body in graceful folds and finally flung over the left shoulder so that the end which was dyed blue or purple or some other colour according to the social standing of the wearer hung down in front the right arm and breast being however left quite bare
a more becoming dress especially when as in the present case the wearer was young and pretty it is quite impossible to conceive
good who has an eye for such things was greatly struck with it and so indeed was i
it was so simple and yet so effective
meanwhile if we had been astonished at the appearance of the man and woman it was clear that they were far more astonished at us
as for the man he appeared to be overcome with fear and wonder and for a while hovered round our canoe but would not approach
at last however he came within hailing distance and called to us in a language that sounded soft and pleasing enough but of which we could not understand one word
so we hailed back in english french latin greek german zulu dutch sisutu kukuana and a few other native dialects that i am acquainted with but our visitor did not understand any of these tongues indeed they appeared to bewilder him
as for the lady she was busily employed in taking stock of us and good was returning the compliment by staring at her hard through his eyeglass a proceeding that she seemed rather to enjoy than otherwise
at length the man being unable to make anything of us suddenly turned his boat round and began to head off for the shore his little boat skimming away before the wind like a swallow
as she passed across our bows the man turned to attend to the large sail and good promptly took the opportunity to kiss his hand to the young lady
i was horrified at this proceeding both on general grounds and because i feared that she might take offence but to my delight she did not for first glancing round and seeing that her husband or brother or whoever he was was engaged she promptly kissed hers back
ah said i
it seems that we have at last found a language that the people of this country understand in which case said sir henry good will prove an invaluable interpreter i frowned for i do not approve of goods frivolities and he knows it and i turned the conversation to more serious subjects
it is very clear to me i said that the man will be back before long with a host of his fellows so we had best make up our minds as to how we are going to receive them the question is how will they receive us said sir henry
as for good he made no remark but began to extract a small square tin case that had accompanied us in all our wanderings from under a pile of baggage
now we had often remonstrated with good about this tin case inasmuch as it had been an awkward thing to carry and he had never given any very explicit account as to its contents but he had insisted on keeping it saying mysteriously that it might come in very useful one day
what on earth are you going to do good asked sir henry
dowhy dress of course
you dont expect me to appear in a new country in these things do you and he pointed to his soiled and worn garments which were however like all goods things very tidy and with every tear neatly mended
we said no more but watched his proceedings with breathless interest
his first step was to get alphonse who was thoroughly competent in such matters to trim his hair and beard in the most approved fashion
i think that if he had had some hot water and a cake of soap at hand he would have shaved off the latter but he had not
this done he suggested that we should lower the sail of the canoe and all take a bath which we did greatly to the horror and astonishment of alphonse who lifted his hands and ejaculated that these english were indeed a wonderful people
umslopogaas who though he was like most highbred zulus scrupulously cleanly in his person did not see the fun of swimming about in a lake also regarded the proceeding with mild amusement
we got back into the canoe much refreshed by the cold water and sat to dry in the sun whilst good undid his tin box and produced first a beautiful clean white shirt just as it had left a london steam laundry and then some garments wrapped first in brown then in white and finally in silver paper
we watched this undoing with the tenderest interest and much speculation
one by one good removed the dull husks that hid their splendours carefully folding and replacing each piece of paper as he did so and there at last lay in all the majesty of its golden epaulettes lace and buttons a commander of the royal navys fulldress uniformdress sword cocked hat shiny patent leather boots and all
we literally gasped
what we said what are you going to put those things on certainly he answered composedly you see so much depends upon a first impression especially he added as i observe that there are ladies about
one at least of us ought to be decently dressed we said no more we were simply dumbfounded especially when we considered the artful way in which good had concealed the contents of that box for all these months
only one suggestion did we makenamely that he should wear his mail shirt next his skin
he replied that he feared it would spoil the set of his coat now carefully spread in the sun to take the creases out but finally consented to this precautionary measure
the most amusing part of the affair however was to see old umslopogaass astonishment and alphonses delight at goods transformation
when at last he stood up in all his glory even down to the medals on his breast and contemplated himself in the still waters of the lake after the fashion of the young gentleman in ancient history whose name i cannot remember but who fell in love with his own shadow the old zulu could no longer restrain his feelings
oh bougwan he said
oh bougwan
i always thought thee an ugly little man and fatfat as the cows at calving time and now thou art like a blue jay when he spreads his tail out
surely bougwan it hurts my eyes to look at thee good did not much like this allusion to his fat which to tell the truth was not very well deserved for hard exercise had brought him down three inches but on the whole he was pleased at umslopogaass admiration
as for alphonse he was quite delighted
ah
but monsieur has the beautiful airthe air of the warrior
it is the ladies who will say so when we come to get ashore
monsieur is complete he puts me in mind of my heroic grand here we stopped alphonse
as we gazed upon the beauties thus revealed by good a spirit of emulation filled our breasts and we set to work to get ourselves up as well as we could
the most however that we were able to do was to array ourselves in our spare suits of shooting clothes of which we each had several all the fine clothes in the world could never make it otherwise than scrubby and insignificant but sir henry looked what he is a magnificent man in his nearly new tweed suit gaiters and boots
alphonse also got himself up to kill giving an extra turn to his enormous moustaches
even old umslopogaas who was not in a general way given to the vain adorning of his body took some oil out of the lantern and a bit of tow and polished up his headring with it till it shone like goods patent leather boots
then he put on the mail shirt sir henry had given him and his moocha and having cleaned up inkosikaas a little stood forth complete
all this while having hoisted the sail again as soon as we had finished bathing we had been progressing steadily for the land or rather for the mouth of a great river
presentlyin all about an hour and a half after the little boat had left uswe saw emerging from the river or harbour a large number of boats ranging up to ten or twelve tons burden
one of these was propelled by twentyfour oars and most of the rest sailed
looking through the glass we soon made out that the rowboat was an official vessel her crew being all dressed in a sort of uniform whilst on the halfdeck forward stood an old man of venerable appearance and with a flowing white beard and a sword strapped to his side who was evidently the commander of the craft
the other boats were apparently occupied by people brought out by curiosity and were rowing or sailing towards us as quickly as they could
now for it said i
what is the betting
are they going to be friendly or to put an end to us nobody could answer this question and not liking the warlike appearance of the old gentleman and his sword we felt a little anxious
just then good spied a school of hippopotami on the water about two hundred yards off us and suggested that it would not be a bad plan to impress the natives with a sense of our power by shooting some of them if possible
this unluckily enough struck us as a good idea and accordingly we at once got out our eightbore rifles for which we still had a few cartridges left and prepared for action
there were four of the animals a big bull a cow and two young ones one three parts grown
we got up to them without difficulty the great animals contenting themselves with sinking down into the water and rising again a few yards farther on indeed their excessive tameness struck me as being peculiar
when the advancing boats were about five hundred yards away sir henry opened the ball by firing at the three parts grown young one
the heavy bullet struck it fair between the eyes and crashing through the skull killed it and it sank leaving a long train of blood behind it
at the same moment i fired at the cow and good at the old bull
my shot took effect but not fatally and down went the hippopotamus with a prodigious splashing only to rise again presently blowing and grunting furiously dyeing all the water round her crimson when i killed her with the left barrel
good who is an execrable shot missed the head of the bull altogether the bullet merely cutting the side of his face as it passed
on glancing up after i had fired my second shot i perceived that the people we had fallen among were evidently ignorant of the nature of firearms for the consternation caused by our shots and their effect upon the animals was prodigious
some of the parties in the boats began to cry out in fear others turned and made off as hard as they could and even the old gentleman with the sword looked greatly puzzled and alarmed and halted his big rowboat
we had however but little time for observation for just then the old bull rendered furious by the wound he had received rose fair within forty yards of us glaring savagely
we all fired and hit him in various places and down he went badly wounded
curiosity now began to overcome the fear of the onlookers and some of them sailed on up close to us amongst these being the man and woman whom we had first seen a couple of hours or so before who drew up almost alongside
just then the great brute rose again within ten yards of their base and instantly with a roar of fury made at it openmouthed
the woman shrieked and the man tried to give the boat way but without success
in another second i saw the huge red jaws and gleaming ivories close with a crunch on the frail craft taking an enormous mouthful out of its side and capsizing it
down went the boat leaving its occupants struggling in the water
next moment before we could do anything towards saving them the huge and furious creature was up again and making openmouthed at the poor girl who was struggling in the water
lifting my rifle just as the grinding jaws were about to close on her i fired over her head right down the hippopotamuss throat
over he went and commenced turning round and round snorting and blowing red streams of blood through his nostrils
before he could recover himself however i let him have the other barrel in the side of the throat and that finished him
he never moved or struggled again but instantly sank
our next effort was directed towards saving the girl the man having swum off towards another boat and in this we were fortunately successful pulling her into the canoe amidst the shouts of the spectators considerably exhausted and frightened but otherwise unhurt
meanwhile the boats had gathered together at a distance and we could see that the occupants who were evidently much frightened were consulting what to do
without giving them time for further consideration which we thought might result unfavourably to ourselves we instantly took our paddles and advanced towards them good standing in the bow and taking off his cocked hat politely in every direction his amiable features suffused by a bland but intelligent smile
most of the craft retreated as we advanced but a few held their ground while the big rowboat came on to meet us
presently we were alongside and i could see that our appearanceand especially goods and umslopogaassfilled the venerablelooking commander with astonishment not unmixed with awe
he was dressed after the same fashion as the man we first met except that his shirt was not made of brown cloth but of pure white linen hemmed with purple
the kilt however was identical and so were the thick rings of gold around the arm and beneath the left knee
the rowers wore only a kilt their bodies being naked to the waist
good took off his hat to the old gentleman with an extra flourish and inquired after his health in the purest english to which he replied by laying the first two fingers of his right hand horizontally across his lips and holding them there for a moment which we took as his method of salutation
then he also addressed some remarks to us in the same soft accents that had distinguished our first interviewer which we were forced to indicate we did not understand by shaking our heads and shrugging our shoulders
this last alphonse being to the manner born did to perfection and in so polite a way that nobody could take any offence
then we came to a standstill till i being exceedingly hungry thought i might as well call attention to the fact and did so first by opening my mouth and pointing down it and then rubbing my stomach
these signals the old gentleman clearly understood for he nodded his head vigorously and pointed towards the harbour and at the same time one of the men on his boat threw us a line and motioned to us to make it fast which we did
the rowboat then took us in tow and went with great rapidity towards the mouth of the river accompanied by all the other boats
in about twenty minutes more we reached the entrance to the harbour which was crowded with boats full of people who had come out to see us
we observed that all the occupants were more or less of the same type though some were fairer than others
indeed we noticed certain ladies whose skin was of a most dazzling whiteness and the darkest shade of colour which we saw was about that of a rather swarthy spaniard
presently the wide river gave a sweep and when it did so an exclamation of astonishment and delight burst from our lips as we caught our first view of the place that we afterwards knew as milosis or the frowning city from the prefix mi which means city and losis a frown
at a distance of some five hundred yards from the rivers bank rose a sheer precipice of granite two hundred feet or so in height which had no doubt once formed the bank itselfthe intermediate space of land now utilized as docks and roadways having been gained by draining and deepening and embanking the stream
on the brow of this precipice stood a great building of the same granite that formed the cliff built on three sides of a square the fourth side being open save for a kind of battlement pierced at its base by a little door
this imposing place we afterwards discovered was the palace of the queen or rather of the queens
at the back of the palace the town sloped gently upwards to a flashing building of white marble crowned by the golden dome which we had already observed
the city was with the exception of this one building entirely built of red granite and laid out in regular blocks with splendid roadways between
so far as we could see also the houses were all onestoried and detached with gardens round them which gave some relief to the eye wearied with the vista of red granite
at the back of the palace a road of extraordinary width stretched away up the hill for a distance of a mile and a half or so and appeared to terminate at an open space surrounding the gleaming building that crowned the hill
but right in front of us was the wonder and glory of milosisthe great staircase of the palace the magnificence of which took our breath away
let the reader imagine if he can a splendid stairway sixtyfive feet from balustrade to balustrade consisting of two vast flights each of one hundred and twentyfive steps of eight inches in height by three feet broad connected by a flat restingplace sixty feet in length and running from the palace wall on the edge of the precipice down to meet a waterway or canal cut to its foot from the river
this marvellous staircase was supported upon a single enormous granite arch of which the restingplace between the two flights formed the crown that is the connecting open space lay upon it
from this archway sprang a subsidiary flying arch or rather something that resembled a flying arch in shape such as none of us had seen in any other country and of which the beauty and wonder surpassed all that we had ever imagined
three hundred feet from point to point and no less than five hundred and fifty round the curve that halfarc soared touching the bridge it supported for a space of fifty feet only one end resting on and built into the parent archway and the other embedded in the solid granite of the side of the precipice
this staircase with its supports was indeed a work of which any living man might have been proud both on account of its magnitude and its surpassing beauty
four times as we afterwards learnt did the work which was commenced in remote antiquity fail and was then abandoned for three centuries when halffinished till at last there rose a youthful engineer named rademas who said that he would complete it successfully and staked his life upon it
if he failed he was to be hurled from the precipice he had undertaken to scale if he succeeded he was to be rewarded by the hand of the kings daughter
five years was given to him to complete the work and an unlimited supply of labour and material
three times did his arch fall till at last seeing failure to be inevitable he determined to commit suicide on the morrow of the third collapse
that night however a beautiful woman came to him in a dream and touched his forehead and of a sudden he saw a vision of the completed work and saw too through the masonry and how the difficulties connected with the flying arch that had hitherto baffled his genius were to be overcome
then he awoke and once more commenced the work but on a different plan and behold
he achieved it and on the last day of the five years he led the princess his bride up the stair and into the palace
and in due course he became king by right of his wife and founded the present zuvendi dynasty which is to this day called the house of the stairway thus proving once more how energy and talent are the natural steppingstones to grandeur
and to commemorate his triumph he fashioned a statue of himself dreaming and of the fair woman who touched him on the forehead and placed it in the great hall of the palace and there it stands to this day
such was the great stair of milosis and such the city beyond
no wonder they named it the frowning city for certainly those mighty works in solid granite did seem to frown down upon our littleness in their sombre splendour
this was so even in the sunshine but when the stormclouds gathered on her imperial brow milosis looked more like a supernatural dwellingplace or some imagining of a poets brain than what she isa mortal city carven by the patient genius of generations out of the red silence of the mountain side
the sister queens the big rowingboat glided on up the cutting that ran almost to the foot of the vast stairway and then halted at a flight of steps leading to the landingplace
here the old gentleman disembarked and invited us to do so likewise which having no alternative and being nearly starved we did without hesitationtaking our rifles with us however
as each of us landed our guide again laid his fingers on his lips and bowed deeply at the same time ordering back the crowds which had assembled to gaze on us
the last to leave the canoe was the girl we had picked out of the water for whom her companion was waiting
before she went away she kissed my hand i suppose as a token of gratitude for having saved her from the fury of the hippopotamus and it seemed to me that she had by this time quite got over any fear she might have had of us and was by no means anxious to return in such a hurry to her lawful owners
at any rate she was going to kiss goods hand as well as mine when the young man interfered and led her off
as soon as we were on shore a number of the men who had rowed the big boat took possession of our few goods and chattels and started with them up the splendid staircase our guide indicating to us by means of motions that the things were perfectly safe
this done he turned to the right and led the way to a small house which was as i afterwards discovered an inn
entering into a goodsized room we saw that a wooden table was already furnished with food presumably in preparation for us
here our guide motioned us to be seated on a bench that ran the length of the table
we did not require a second invitation but at once fell to ravenously on the viands before us which were served on wooden platters and consisted of cold goatsflesh wrapped up in some kind of leaf that gave it a delicious flavour green vegetables resembling lettuces brown bread and red wine poured from a skin into horn mugs
this wine was peculiarly soft and good having something of the flavour of burgundy
twenty minutes after we sat down at that hospitable board we rose from it feeling like new men
after all that we had gone through we needed two things food and rest and the food of itself was a great blessing to us
two girls of the same charming cast of face as the first whom we had seen waited on us while we ate and very nicely they did it
they were also dressed in the same fashion namely in a white linen petticoat coming to the knee and with the togalike garment of brown cloth leaving bare the right arm and breast
i afterwards found out that this was the national dress and regulated by an iron custom though of course subject to variations
thus if the petticoat was pure white it signified that the wearer was unmarried if white with a straight purple stripe round the edge that she was married and a first or legal wife if with a black stripe that she was a widow
in the same way the toga or kaf as they call it was of different shades of colour from pure white to the deepest brown according to the rank of the wearer and embroidered at the end in various ways
this also applies to the shirts or tunics worn by the men which varied in material and colour but the kilts were always the same except as regards quality
one thing however every man and woman in the country wore as the national insignia and that was the thick band of gold round the right arm above the elbow and the left leg beneath the knee
people of high rank also wore a torque of gold round the neck and i observed that our guide had one on
so soon as we had finished our meal our venerable conductor who had been standing all the while regarding us with inquiring eyes and our guns with something as like fear as his pride would allow him to show bowed towards good whom he evidently took for the leader of the party on account of the splendour of his apparel and once more led the way through the door and to the foot of the great staircase
here we paused for a moment to admire two colossal lions each hewn from a single block of pure black marble and standing rampant on the terminations of the wide balustrades of the staircase
these lions are magnificently executed and it is said were sculptured by rademas the great prince who designed the staircase and who was without doubt to judge from the many beautiful examples of his art that we saw afterwards one of the finest sculptors who ever lived either in this or any other country
then we climbed almost with a feeling of awe up that splendid stair a work executed for all time and that will i do not doubt be admired thousands of years hence by generations unborn unless an earthquake should throw it down
even umslopogaas who as a general rule made it a point of honour not to show astonishment which he considered undignified was fairly startled out of himself and asked if the bridge had been built by men or devils which was his vague way of alluding to any supernatural power
but alphonse did not care about it
its solid grandeur jarred upon the frivolous little frenchman who said that it was all tres magnifique mais tristeah triste and went on to suggest that it would be improved if the balustrades were gilt
on we went up the first flight of one hundred and twenty steps across the broad platform joining it to the second flight where we paused to admire the glorious view of one of the most beautiful stretches of country that the world can show edged by the blue waters of the lake
then we passed on up the stair till at last we reached the top where we found a large standing space to which there were three entrances all of small size
two of these opened on to rather narrow galleries or roadways cut in the face of the precipice that ran round the palace walls and led to the principal thoroughfares of the city and were used by the inhabitants passing up and down from the docks
these were defended by gates of bronze and also as we afterwards learnt it was possible to let down a portion of the roadways themselves by withdrawing certain bolts and thus render it quite impracticable for an enemy to pass
the third entrance consisted of a flight of ten curved black marble steps leading to a doorway cut in the palace wall
this wall was in itself a work of art being built of huge blocks of granite to the height of forty feet and so fashioned that its face was concave whereby it was rendered practically impossible for it to be scaled
to this doorway our guide led us
the door which was massive and made of wood protected by an outer gate of bronze was closed but on our approach it was thrown wide and we were met by the challenge of a sentry who was armed with a heavy triangularbladed spear not unlike a bayonet in shape and a cutting sword and protected by breast and back plates of skilfully prepared hippopotamus hide and a small round shield fashioned of the same tough material
the sword instantly attracted our attention it was practically identical with the one in the possession of mr mackenzie which he had obtained from the illstarred wanderer
there was no mistaking the goldlined fretwork cut in the thickness of the blade
so the man had told the truth after all
our guide instantly gave a password which the soldier acknowledged by letting the iron shaft of his spear fall with a ringing sound upon the pavement and we passed on through the massive wall into the courtyard of the palace
this was about forty yards square and laid out in flowerbeds full of lovely shrubs and plants many of which were quite new to me
through the centre of this garden ran a broad walk formed of powdered shells brought from the lake in the place of gravel
following this we came to another doorway with a round heavy arch which is hung with thick curtains for there are no doors in the palace itself
then came another short passage and we were in the great hall of the palace and once more stood astonished at the simple and yet overpowering grandeur of the place
the hall is as we afterwards learnt one hundred and fifty feet long by eighty wide and has a magnificent arched roof of carved wood
down the entire length of the building there are on either side and at a distance of twenty feet from the wall slender shafts of black marble springing sheer to the roof beautifully fluted and with carved capitals
at one end of this great place which these pillars support is the group of which i have already spoken as executed by the king rademas to commemorate his building of the staircase and really when we had time to admire it its loveliness almost struck us dumb
the group of which the figures are in white and the rest is black marble is about half as large again as life and represents a young man of noble countenance and form sleeping heavily upon a couch
one arm is carelessly thrown over the side of this couch and his head reposes upon the other its curling locks partially hiding it
bending over him her hand resting on his forehead is a draped female form of such white loveliness as to make the beholders breath stand still
and as for the calm glory that shines upon her perfect facewell i can never hope to describe it
but there it rests like the shadow of an angels smile and power love and divinity all have their part in it
her eyes are fixed upon the sleeping youth and perhaps the most extraordinary thing about this beautiful work is the success with which the artist has succeeded in depicting on the sleepers worn and weary face the sudden rising of a new and spiritual thought as the spell begins to work within his mind
you can see that an inspiration is breaking in upon the darkness of the mans soul as the dawn breaks in upon the darkness of night
it is a glorious piece of statuary and none but a genius could have conceived it
between each of the black marble columns is some such group of figures some allegorical and some representing the persons and wives of deceased monarchs or great men but none of them in our opinion comes up to the one i have described although several are from the hand of the sculptor and engineer king rademas
in the exact centre of the hall was a solid mass of black marble about the size of a babys armchair which it rather resembled in appearance
this as we afterwards learnt was the sacred stone of this remarkable people and on it their monarchs laid their hand after the ceremony of coronation and swore by the sun to safeguard the interests of the empire and to maintain its customs traditions and laws
this stone was evidently exceedingly ancient as indeed all stones are and was scored down its sides with long marks or lines which sir henry said proved it to have been a fragment that at some remote period in its history had been ground in the iron jaws of glaciers
there was a curious prophecy about this block of marble which was reported among the people to have fallen from the sun to the effect that when it was shattered into fragments a king of alien race should rule over the land
as the stone however looked remarkably solid the native princes seemed to have a fair chance of keeping their own for many a long year
at the end of the hall is a dais spread with rich carpets on which two thrones are set side by side
these thrones are shaped like great chairs and made of solid gold
the seats are richly cushioned but the backs are left bare and on each is carved the emblem of the sun shooting out his fiery rays in all directions
the footstools are golden lions couchant with yellow topazes set in them for eyes
there are no other gems about them
the place is lighted by numerous but narrow windows placed high up cut on the principle of the loopholes to be seen in ancient castles but innocent of glass which was evidently unknown here
such is a brief description of this splendid hall in which we now found ourselves compiled of course from our subsequent knowledge of it
on this occasion we had but little time for observation for when we entered we perceived that a large number of men were gathered together in front of the two thrones which were unoccupied
the principal among them were seated on carved wooden chairs ranged to the right and the left of the thrones but not in front of them and were dressed in white tunics with various embroideries and different coloured edgings and armed with the usual pierced and goldinlaid swords
to judge from the dignity of their appearance they seemed one and all to be individuals of very great importance
behind each of these great men stood a small knot of followers and attendants
seated by themselves in a little group to the left of the throne were six men of a different stamp
instead of wearing the ordinary kilt they were clothed in long robes of pure white linen with the same symbol of the sun that is to be seen on the back of the chairs emblazoned in gold thread upon the breast
this garment was girt up at the waist with a simple golden curblike chain from which hung long elliptic plates of the same metal fashioned in shiny scales like those of a fish that as their wearers moved jingled and reflected the light
they were all men of mature age and of a severe and impressive cast of features which was rendered still more imposing by the long beards they wore
the personality of one individual among them however impressed us at once
he seemed to stand out among his fellows and refuse to be overlooked
he was very oldeighty at leastand extremely tall with a long snowwhite beard that hung nearly to his waist
his features were aquiline and deeply cut and his eyes were grey and coldlooking
the heads of the others were bare but this man wore a round cap entirely covered with gold embroidery from which we judged that he was a person of great importance and indeed we afterwards discovered that he was agon the high priest of the country
as we approached all these men including the priests rose and bowed to us with the greatest courtesy at the same time placing the two fingers across the lips in salutation
then softfooted attendants advanced from between the pillars bearing seats which were placed in a line in front of the thrones
we three sat down alphonse and umslopogaas standing behind us
scarcely had we done so when there came a blare of trumpets from some passage to the right and a similar blare from the left
next a man with a long white wand of ivory appeared just in front of the righthand throne and cried out something in a loud voice ending with the word nyleptha repeated three times and another man similarly attired called out a similar sentence before the other throne but ending with the word sorais also repeated thrice
then came the tramp of armed men from each side entrance and in filed about a score of picked and magnificently accoutred guards who formed up on each side of the thrones and let their heavy ironhandled spears fall simultaneously with a clash upon the black marble flooring
another double blare of trumpets and in from either side each attended by six maidens swept the two queens of zuvendis everybody in the hall rising to greet them as they came
i have seen beautiful women in my day and am no longer thrown into transports at the sight of a pretty face but language fails me when i try to give some idea of the blaze of loveliness that then broke upon us in the persons of these sister queens
both were youngperhaps fiveandtwenty years of ageboth were tall and exquisitely formed but there the likeness stopped
one nyleptha was a woman of dazzling fairness her right arm and breast bare after the custom of her people showed like snow even against her white and goldembroidered kaf or toga
and as for her sweet face all i can say is that it was one that few men could look on and forget
her hair a veritable crown of gold clustered in short ringlets over her shapely head half hiding the ivory brow beneath which eyes of deep and glorious grey flashed out in tender majesty
i cannot attempt to describe her other features only the mouth was most sweet and curved like cupids bow and over the whole countenance there shone an indescribable look of lovingkindness lit up by a shadow of delicate humour that lay upon her face like a touch of silver on a rosy cloud
she wore no jewels but on her neck arm and knee were the usual torques of gold in this instance fashioned like a snake and her dress was of pure white linen of excessive fineness plentifully embroidered with gold and with the familiar symbols of the sun
her twin sister sorais was of a different and darker type of beauty
her hair was wavy like nylepthas but coalblack and fell in masses on her shoulders her complexion was olive her eyes large dark and lustrous the lips were full and i thought rather cruel
somehow her face quiet and even cold as it is gave an idea of passion in repose and caused one to wonder involuntarily what its aspect would be if anything occurred to break the calm
it reminded me of the deep sea that even on the bluest days never loses its visible stamp of power and in its murmuring sleep is yet instinct with the spirit of the storm
her figure like her sisters was almost perfect in its curves and outlines but a trifle more rounded and her dress was absolutely the same
as this lovely pair swept onwards to their respective thrones amid the deep attentive silence of the court i was bound to confess to myself that they did indeed fulfil my idea of royalty
royal they were in every wayin form in grace and queenly dignity and in the barbaric splendour of their attendant pomp
but methought that they needed no guards or gold to proclaim their power and bind the loyalty of wayward men
a glance from those bright eyes or a smile from those sweet lips and while the red blood runs in the veins of youth women such as these will never lack subjects ready to do their biddings to the death
but after all they were women first and queens afterwards and therefore not devoid of curiosity
as they passed to their seats i saw both of them glance swiftly in our direction
i saw too that their eyes passed by me seeing nothing to charm them in the person of an insignificant and grizzled old man
then they looked with evident astonishment on the grim form of old umslopogaas who raised his axe in salutation
attracted next by the splendour of goods apparel for a second their glance rested on him like a humming moth upon a flower then off it darted to where sir henry curtis stood the sunlight from a window playing upon his yellow hair and peaked beard and marking the outlines of his massive frame against the twilight of the somewhat gloomy hall
he raised his eyes and they met the fair nylepthas full and thus for the first time the goodliest man and woman that it has ever been my lot to see looked one upon another
and why it was i know not but i saw the swift blood run up nylepthas skin as the pink lights run up the morning sky
red grew her fair bosom and shapely arm red the swanlike neck the rounded cheeks blushed red as the petals of a rose and then the crimson flood sank back to whence it came and left her pale and trembling
i glanced at sir henry
he too had coloured up to the eyes
oh my word thought i to myself the ladies have come on the stage and now we may look to the plot to develop itself and i sighed and shook my head knowing that the beauty of a woman is like the beauty of the lightninga destructive thing and a cause of desolation
by the time that i had finished my reflections both the queens were on the thrones for all this had happened in about six seconds
once more the unseen trumpets blared out and then the court seated itself and queen sorais motioned to us to do likewise
next from among the crowd whither he had withdrawn stepped forward our guide the old gentleman who had towed us ashore holding by the hand the girl whom we had seen first and afterwards rescued from the hippopotamus
having made obeisance he proceeded to address the queens evidently describing to them the way and place where we had been found
it was most amusing to watch the astonishment not unmixed with fear reflected upon their faces as they listened to his tale
clearly they could not understand how we had reached the lake and been found floating on it and were inclined to attribute our presence to supernatural causes
then the narrative proceeded as i judged from the frequent appeals that our guide made to the girl to the point where we had shot the hippopotami and we at once perceived that there was something very wrong about those hippopotami for the history was frequently interrupted by indignant exclamations from the little group of whiterobed priests and even from the courtiers while the two queens listened with an amazed expression especially when our guide pointed to the rifles in our hands as being the means of destruction
and here to make matters clear i may as well explain at once that the inhabitants of zuvendis are sunworshippers and that for some reason or another the hippopotamus is sacred among them
not that they do not kill it because at a certain season of the year they slaughter thousandswhich are specially preserved in large lakes up the countryand use their hides for armour for soldiers but this does not prevent them from considering these animals as sacred to the sun
now as ill luck would have it the particular hippopotami we had shot were a family of tame animals that were kept in the mouth of the port and daily fed by priests whose special duty it was to attend to them
when we shot them i thought that the brutes were suspiciously tame and this was as we afterwards ascertained the cause of it
thus it came about that in attempting to show off we had committed sacrilege of a most aggravated nature
mr quatermain does not seem to have been aware that it is common for animalworshipping people to annually sacrifice the beasts they adore
see herodotus ii
editor
when our guide had finished his tale the old man with the long beard and round cap whose appearance i have already described and who was as i have said the high priest of the country and known by the name of agon rose and commenced an impassioned harangue
i did not like the look of his cold grey eye as he fixed it on us
i should have liked it still less had i known that in the name of the outraged majesty of his god he was demanding that the whole lot of us should be offered up as a sacrifice by means of being burnt alive
after he had finished speaking the queen sorais addressed him in a soft and musical voice and appeared to judge from his gestures of dissent to be putting the other side of the question before him
then nyleptha spoke in liquid accents
little did we know that she was pleading for our lives
finally she turned and addressed a tall soldierlike man of middle age with a black beard and a long plain sword whose name as we afterwards learnt was nasta and who was the greatest lord in the country apparently appealing to him for support
now when sir henry had caught her eye and she had blushed so rosy red i had seen that the incident had not escaped this mans notice and what is more that it was eminently disagreeable to him for he bit his lip and his hand tightened on his swordhilt
afterwards we learnt that he was an aspirant for the hand of this queen in marriage which accounted for it
this being so nyleptha could not have appealed to a worse person for speaking in slow heavy tones he appeared to confirm all that the high priest agon had said
as he spoke sorais put her elbow on her knee and resting her chin on her hand looked at him with a suppressed smile upon her lips as though she saw through the man and was determined to be his match but nyleptha grew very angry her cheek flushed her eyes flashed and she did indeed look lovely
finally she turned to agon and seemed to give some sort of qualified assent for he bowed at her words and as she spoke she moved her hands as though to emphasize what she said while all the time sorais kept her chin on her hand and smiled
then suddenly nyleptha made a sign the trumpets blew again and everybody rose to leave the hall save ourselves and the guards whom she motioned to stay
when they were all gone she bent forward and smiling sweetly partially by signs and partially by exclamations made it clear to us that she was very anxious to know where we came from
the difficulty was how to explain but at last an idea struck me
i had my large pocketbook in my pocket and a pencil
taking it out i made a little sketch of a lake and then as best i could i drew the underground river and the lake at the other end
when i had done this i advanced to the steps of the throne and gave it to her
she understood it at once and clapped her hands with delight and then descending from the throne took it to her sister sorais who also evidently understood
next she took the pencil from me and after examining it with curiosity proceeded to make a series of delightful little sketches the first representing herself holding out both hands in welcome and a man uncommonly like sir henry taking them
next she drew a lovely little picture of a hippopotamus rolling about dying in the water and of an individual in whom we had no difficulty in recognizing agon the high priest holding up his hands in horror on the bank
then followed a most alarming picture of a dreadful fiery furnace and of the same figure agon poking us into it with a forked stick
this picture perfectly horrified me but i was a little reassured when she nodded sweetly and proceeded to make a fourth drawinga man again uncommonly like sir henry and of two women in whom i recognized sorais and herself each with one arm around him and holding a sword in protection over him
to all of these sorais who i saw was employed in carefully taking us all inespecially curtissignified her approval by nodding
at last nyleptha drew a final sketch of a rising sun indicating that she must go and that we should meet on the following morning whereat sir henry looked so disappointed that she saw it and i suppose by way of consolation extended her hand to him to kiss which he did with pious fervour
at the same time sorais off whom good had never taken his eyeglass during the whole indaba interview rewarded him by giving him her hand to kiss though while she did so her eyes were fixed upon sir henry
i am glad to say that i was not implicated in these proceedings neither of them gave me her hand to kiss
then nyleptha turned and addressed the man who appeared to be in command of the bodyguard apparently from her manner and his frequent obeisances giving him very stringent and careful orders after which with a somewhat coquettish nod and smile she left the hall followed by sorais and most of the guards
when the queens had gone the officer whom nyleptha had addressed came forward and with many tokens of deep respect led us from the hall through various passages to a sumptuous set of apartments opening out of a large central room lighted with brazen swinging lamps for it was now dusk and richly carpeted and strewn with couches
on a table in the centre of the room was set a profusion of food and fruit and what is more flowers
there was a delicious wine also in ancientlooking sealed earthenware flagons and beautifully chased golden and ivory cups to drink it from
servants male and female also were there to minister to us and whilst we ate from some recess outside the apartment the silver lute did speak between the trumpets lordly blowing and altogether we found ourselves in a sort of earthly paradise which was only disturbed by the vision of that disgusting high priest who intended to commit us to the flames
but so very weary were we with our labours that we could scarcely keep ourselves awake through the sumptuous meal and as soon as it was over we indicated that we desired to sleep
as a further precaution against surprise we left umslopogaas with his axe to sleep in the main chamber near the curtained doorways leading to the apartments which we occupied respectively good and i in the one and sir henry and alphonse in the other
then throwing off our clothes with the exception of the mail shirts which we considered it safer to keep on we flung ourselves down upon the low and luxurious couches and drew the silkembroidered coverlids over us
in two minutes i was just dropping off when i was aroused by goods voice
i say quatermain he said did you ever see such eyes eyes i said crossly what eyes why the queens of course
sorais i meanat least i think that is her name oh i dont know i yawned i didnt notice them much i suppose they are good eyes and again i dropped off
five minutes or so elapsed and i was once more awakened
i say quatermain said the voice
well i answered testily what is it now did you notice her ankle
the shape this was more than i could stand
by my bed stood the veldtschoons i had been wearing
moved quite beyond myself i took them up and threw them straight at goods headand hit it
afterwards i slept the sleep of the just and a very heavy sleep it must be
as for good i dont know if he went to sleep or if he continued to pass sorais beauties in mental review and what is more i dont care
about the zuvendi people and now the curtain is down for a few hours and the actors in this novel drama are plunged in dewy sleep
perhaps we should except nyleptha whom the reader may if poetically inclined imagine lying in her bed of state encompassed by her maidens tiring women guards and all the other people and appurtenances that surround a throne and yet not able to slumber for thinking of the strangers who had visited a country where no such strangers had ever come before and wondering as she lay awake who they were and what their past has been and if she was ugly compared to the women of their native place
i however not being poetically inclined will take advantage of the lull to give some account of the people among whom we found ourselves compiled needless to state from information which we subsequently collected
the name of this country to begin at the beginning is zuvendis from zu yellow and vendis place or country
why it is called the yellow country i have never been able to ascertain accurately nor do the inhabitants themselves know
three reasons are however given each of which would suffice to account for it
the first is that the name owes its origin to the great quantity of gold that is found in the land
indeed in this respect zuvendis is a veritable eldorado the precious metal being extraordinarily plentiful
at present it is collected from purely alluvial diggings which we subsequently inspected and which are situated within a days journey from milosis being mostly found in pockets and in nuggets weighing from an ounce up to six or seven pounds in weight
but other diggings of a similar nature are known to exist and i have besides seen great veins of goldbearing quartz
in zuvendis gold is a much commoner metal than silver and thus it has curiously enough come to pass that silver is the legal tender of the country
the second reason given is that at certain times of the year the native grasses of the country which are very sweet and good turn as yellow as ripe corn and the third arises from a tradition that the people were originally yellow skinned but grew white after living for many generations upon these high lands
zuvendis is a country about the size of france is roughly speaking oval in shape and on every side cut off from the surrounding territory by illimitable forests of impenetrable thorn beyond which are said to be hundreds of miles of morasses deserts and great mountains
it is in short a huge high tableland rising up in the centre of the dark continent much as in southern africa flattopped mountains rise from the level of the surrounding veldt
milosis itself lies according to my aneroid at a level of about nine thousand feet above the sea but most of the land is even higher the greatest elevation of the open country being i believe about eleven thousand feet
as a consequence the climate is comparatively speaking a cold one being very similar to that of southern england only brighter and not so rainy
the land is however exceedingly fertile and grows all cereals and temperate fruits and timber to perfection and in the lowerlying parts even produces a hardy variety of sugarcane
coal is found in great abundance and in many places crops out from the surface and so is pure marble both black and white
the same may be said of almost every metal except silver which is scarce and only to be obtained from a range of mountains in the north
zuvendis comprises in her boundaries a great variety of scenery including two ranges of snowclad mountains one on the western boundary beyond the impenetrable belt of thorn forest and the other piercing the country from north to south and passing at a distance of about eighty miles from milosis from which town its higher peaks are distinctly visible
this range forms the chief watershed of the land
there are also three large lakesthe biggest namely that whereon we emerged and which is named milosis after the city covering some two hundred square miles of countryand numerous small ones some of them salt
the population of this favoured land is comparatively speaking dense numbering at a rough estimate from ten to twelve millions
it is almost purely agricultural in its habits and divided into great classes as in civilized countries
there is a territorial nobility a considerable middle class formed principally of merchants officers of the army etc
but the great bulk of the people are welltodo peasants who live upon the lands of the lords from whom they hold under a species of feudal tenure
the best bred people in the country are as i think i have said pure whites with a somewhat southern cast of countenance but the common herd are much darker though they do not show any negro or other african characteristics
as to their descent i can give no certain information
their written records which extend back for about a thousand years give no hint of it
one very ancient chronicler does indeed in alluding to some old tradition that existed in his day talk of it as having probably originally come down with the people from the coast but that may mean little or nothing
in short the origin of the zuvendi is lost in the mists of time
whence they came or of what race they are no man knows
their architecture and some of their sculptures suggest an egyptian or possibly an assyrian origin but it is well known that their present remarkable style of building has only sprung up within the last eight hundred years and they certainly retain no traces of egyptian theology or customs
again their appearance and some of their habits are rather jewish but here again it seems hardly conceivable that they should have utterly lost all traces of the jewish religion
still for aught i know they may be one of the lost ten tribes whom people are so fond of discovering all over the world or they may not
i do not know and so can only describe them as i find them and leave wiser heads than mine to make what they can out of it if indeed this account should ever be read at all which is exceedingly doubtful
and now after i have said all this i am after all going to hazard a theory of my own though it is only a very little one as the young lady said in mitigation of her baby
this theory is founded on a legend which i have heard among the arabs on the east coast which is to the effect that more than two thousand years ago there were troubles in the country which was known as babylonia and that thereon a vast horde of persians came down to bushire where they took ship and were driven by the northeast monsoon to the east coast of africa where according to the legend the sun and fire worshippers fell into conflict with the belt of arab settlers who even then were settled on the east coast and finally broke their way through them and vanishing into the interior were no more seen
now i ask is it not at least possible that the zuvendi people are the descendants of these sun and fire worshippers who broke through the arabs and vanished
as a matter of fact there is a good deal in their characters and customs that tallies with the somewhat vague ideas that i have of persians
of course we have no books of reference here but sir henry says that if his memory does not fail him there was a tremendous revolt in babylon about bc whereon a vast multitude were expelled from the city
anyhow it is a wellestablished fact that there have been many separate emigrations of persians from the persian gulf to the east coast of africa up to as lately as seven hundred years ago
there are persian tombs at kilwa on the east coast still in good repair which bear dates showing them to be just seven hundred years old
there is another theory which might account for the origin of the zuvendi which does not seem to have struck my friend mr quatermain and his companions and that is that they are descendants of the phnicians
the cradle of the phnician race is supposed to have been on the western shore of the persian gulf
thence as there is good evidence to show they emigrated in two streams one of which took possession of the shores of palestine while the other is supposed by savants to have immigrated down the coast of eastern africa where near mozambique signs and remains of their occupation are not wanting
indeed it would have been very extraordinary if they did not when leaving the persian gulf make straight for the east coast seeing that the northeast monsoon blows for six months in the year dead in that direction while for the other six months it blows back again
and by the way of illustrating the probability i may add that to this day a very extensive trade is carried on between the persian gulf and lamu and other east african ports as far south as madagascar which is of course the ancient ebony isle of the arabian nightseditor
in addition to being an agricultural people the zuvendi are oddly enough excessively warlike and as they cannot from the exigencies of their position make war upon other nations they fight among each other like the famed kilkenny cats with the happy result that the population never outgrows the power of the country to support it
this habit of theirs is largely fostered by the political condition of the country
the monarchy is nominally an absolute one save in so far as it is tempered by the power of the priests and the informal council of the great lords but as in many other institutions the kings writ does not run unquestioned throughout the length and breadth of the land
in short the whole system is a purely feudal one though absolute serfdom or slavery is unknown all the great lords holding nominally from the throne but a number of them being practically independent having the power of life and death waging war against and making peace with their neighbours as the whim or their interests lead them and even on occasion rising in open rebellion against their royal master or mistress and safely shut up in their castles and fenced cities as far from the seat of government successfully defying them for years
zuvendis has had its kingmakers as well as england a fact that will be well appreciated when i state that eight different dynasties have sat upon the throne in the last one thousand years every one of which took its rise from some noble family that succeeded in grasping the purple after a sanguinary struggle
at the date of our arrival in the country things were a little better than they had been for some centuries the last king the father of nyleptha and sorais having been an exceptionally able and vigorous ruler and as a consequence he kept down the power of the priests and nobles
on his death two years before we reached zuvendis the twin sisters his children were following an ancient precedent called to the throne since an attempt to exclude either would instantly have provoked a sanguinary civil war but it was generally felt in the country that this measure was a most unsatisfactory one and could hardly be expected to be permanent
indeed as it was the various intrigues that were set on foot by ambitious nobles to obtain the hand of one or other of the queens in marriage had disquieted the country and the general opinion was that there would be bloodshed before long
i will now pass on to the question of the zuvendi religion which is nothing more or less than sunworship of a pronounced and highly developed character
around this sunworship is grouped the entire social system of the zuvendi
it sends its roots through every institution and custom of the land
from the cradle to the grave the zuvendi follows the sun in every sense of the saying
as an infant he is solemnly held up in its light and dedicated to the symbol of good the expression of power and the hope of eternity the ceremony answering to our baptism
whilst still a tiny child his parents point out the glorious orb as the presence of a visible and beneficent god and he worships it at its uprising and downsetting
then when still quite small he goes holding fast to the pendent end of his mothers kaf toga up to the temple of the sun of the nearest city and there when at midday the bright beams strike down upon the golden central altar and beat back the fire that burns thereon he hears the whiterobed priests raise their solemn chant of praise and sees the people fall down to adore and then amidst the blowing of the golden trumpets watches the sacrifice thrown into the fiery furnace beneath the altar
here he comes again to be declared a man by the priests and consecrated to war and to good works here before the solemn altar he leads his bride and here too if differences shall unhappily arise he divorces her
and so on down lifes long pathway till the last mile is travelled and he comes again armed indeed and with dignity but no longer a man
here they bear him dead and lay his bier upon the falling brazen doors before the eastern altar and when the last ray from the setting sun falls upon his white face the bolts are drawn and he vanishes into the raging furnace beneath and is ended
the priests of the sun do not marry but are recruited as young men specially devoted to the work by their parents and supported by the state
the nomination to the higher offices of the priesthood lies with the crown but once appointed the nominees cannot be dispossessed and it is scarcely too much to say that they really rule the land
to begin with they are a united body sworn to obedience and secrecy so that an order issued by the high priest at milosis will be instantly and unhesitatingly acted upon by the resident priest of a little country town three or four hundred miles off
they are the judges of the land criminal and civil an appeal lying only to the lord paramount of the district and from him to the king and they have of course practically unlimited jurisdiction over religious and moral offences together with a right of excommunication which as in the faiths of more highly civilized lands is a very effective weapon
indeed their rights and powers are almost unlimited but i may as well state here that the priests of the sun are wise in their generation and do not push things too far
it is but very seldom that they go to extremes against anybody being more inclined to exercise the prerogative of mercy than run the risk of exasperating the powerful and vigorousminded people on whose neck they have set their yoke lest it should rise and break it off altogether
another source of the power of the priests is their practical monopoly of learning and their very considerable astronomical knowledge which enables them to keep a hold on the popular mind by predicting eclipses and even comets
in zuvendis only a few of the upper classes can read and write but nearly all the priests have this knowledge and are therefore looked upon as learned men
the law of the country is on the whole mild and just but differs in several respects from our civilized law
for instance the law of england is much more severe upon offences against property than against the person as becomes a people whose ruling passion is money
a man may half kick his wife to death or inflict horrible sufferings upon his children at a much cheaper rate of punishment than he can compound for the theft of a pair of old boots
in zuvendis this is not so for there they rightly or wrongly look upon the person as of more consequence than goods and chattels and not as in england as a sort of necessary appendage to the latter
for murder the punishment is death for treason death for defrauding the orphan and the widow for sacrilege and for attempting to quit the country which is looked on as a sacrilege death
in each case the method of execution is the same and a rather awful one
the culprit is thrown alive into the fiery furnace beneath one of the altars to the sun
for all other offences including the offence of idleness the punishment is forced labour upon the vast national buildings which are always going on in some part of the country with or without periodical floggings according to the crime
the social system of the zuvendi allows considerable liberty to the individual provided he does not offend against the laws and customs of the country
they are polygamous in theory though most of them have only one wife on account of the expense
by law a man is bound to provide a separate establishment for each wife
the first wife also is the legal wife and her children are said to be of the house of the father
the children of the other wives are of the houses of their respective mothers
this does not however imply any slur upon either mother or children
again a first wife can on entering into the married state make a bargain that her husband shall marry no other wife
this however is very rarely done as the women are the great upholders of polygamy which not only provides for their surplus numbers but gives greater importance to the first wife who is thus practically the head of several households
marriage is looked upon as primarily a civil contract and subject to certain conditions and to a proper provision for children is dissoluble at the will of both contracting parties the divorce or unloosing being formally and ceremoniously accomplished by going through certain portions of the marriage ceremony backwards
the zuvendi are on the whole a very kindly pleasant and lighthearted people
they are not great traders and care little about money only working to earn enough to support themselves in that class of life in which they were born
they are exceedingly conservative and look with disfavour upon changes
their legal tender is silver cut into little squares of different weights gold is the baser coin and is about of the same value as our silver
it is however much prized for its beauty and largely used for ornaments and decorative purposes
most of the trade however is carried on by means of sale and barter payment being made in kind
agriculture is the great business of the country and is really well understood and carried out most of the available acreage being under cultivation
great attention is also given to the breeding of cattle and horses the latter being unsurpassed by any i have ever seen either in europe or africa
the land belongs theoretically to the crown and under the crown to the great lords who again divide it among smaller lords and so on down to the little peasant farmer who works his forty reestu acres on a system of halfprofits with his immediate lord
in fact the whole system is as i have said distinctly feudal and it interested us much to meet with such an old friend far in the unknown heart of africa
the taxes are very heavy
the state takes a third of a mans total earnings and the priesthood about five per cent on the remainder
but on the other hand if a man through any cause falls into bona fide misfortune the state supports him in the position of life to which he belongs
if he is idle however he is sent to work on the government undertakings and the state looks after his wives and children
the state also makes all the roads and builds all town houses about which great care is shown letting them out to families at a small rent
it also keeps up a standing army of about twenty thousand men and provides watchmen etc
in return for their five per cent the priests attend to the service of the temples carry out all religious ceremonies and keep schools where they teach whatever they think desirable which is not very much
some of the temples also possess private property but priests as individuals cannot hold property
and now comes a question which i find some difficulty in answering
are the zuvendi a civilized or barbarous people
sometimes i think the one sometimes the other
in some branches of art they have attained the very highest proficiency
take for instance their buildings and their statuary
i do not think that the latter can be equalled either in beauty or imaginative power anywhere in the world and as for the former it may have been rivalled in ancient egypt but i am sure that it has never been since
but on the other hand they are totally ignorant of many other arts
till sir henry who happened to know something about it showed them how to do it by mixing silica and lime they could not make a piece of glass and their crockery is rather primitive
a waterclock is their nearest approach to a watch indeed ours delighted them exceedingly
they know nothing about steam electricity or gunpowder and mercifully for themselves nothing about printing or the penny post
thus they are spared many evils for of a truth our age has learnt the wisdom of the oldworld saying he who increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow as regards their religion it is a natural one for imaginative people who know no better and might therefore be expected to turn to the sun and worship him as the allfather but it cannot justly be called elevating or spiritual
it is true that they do sometimes speak of the sun as the garment of the spirit but it is a vague term and what they really adore is the fiery orb himself
they also call him the hope of eternity but here again the meaning is vague and i doubt if the phrase conveys any very clear impression to their minds
some of them do indeed believe in a future life for the goodi know nyleptha does firmlybut it is a private faith arising from the promptings of the spirit not an essential of their creed
so on the whole i cannot say that i consider this sunworship as a religion indicative of a civilized people however magnificent and imposing its ritual or however moral and highsounding the maxims of its priests many of whom i am sure have their own opinions on the whole subject though of course they have nothing but praise for a system which provides them with so many of the good things of this world
there are now only two more matters to which i need alludenamely the language and the system of calligraphy
as for the former it is softsounding and very rich and flexible
sir henry says that it sounds something like modern greek but of course it has no connection with it
it is easy to acquire being simple in its construction and a peculiar quality about it is its euphony and the way in which the sound of the words adapts itself to the meaning to be expressed
long before we mastered the language we could frequently make out what was meant by the ring of the sentence
it is on this account that the language lends itself so well to poetical declamation of which these remarkable people are very fond
the zuvendi alphabet seems sir henry says to be derived like every other known system of letters from a phnician source and therefore more remotely still from the ancient egyptian hieratic writing
whether this is a fact i cannot say not being learned in such matters
all i know about it is that their alphabet consists of twentytwo characters of which a few notably b e and o are not very unlike our own
the whole affair is however clumsy and puzzling
but as the people of zuvendi are not given to the writing of novels or of anything except business documents and records of the briefest character it answers their purpose well enough
there are twentytwo letters in the phnician alphabet see appendix masperos histoire ancienne des peuples de lorient etc
unfortunately mr quatermain gives us no specimen of the zuvendi writing but what he here states seems to go a long way towards substantiating the theory advanced in the note on p editor
the flower temple it was halfpast eight by my watch when i woke on the morning following our arrival at milosis having slept almost exactly twelve hours and i must say that i did indeed feel better
ah what a blessed thing is sleep
and what a difference twelve hours of it or so makes to us after days and nights of toil and danger
it is like going to bed one man and getting up another
i sat up upon my silken couchnever had i slept upon such a bed beforeand the first thing that i saw was goods eyeglass fixed on me from the recesses of his silken couch
there was nothing else of him to be seen except his eyeglass but i knew from the look of it that he was awake and waiting till i woke up to begin
i say quatermain he commenced sure enough did you observe her skin
it is as smooth as the back of an ivory hairbrush now look here good i remonstrated when there came a sound at the curtain which on being drawn admitted a functionary who signified by signs that he was there to lead us to the bath
we gladly consented and were conducted to a delightful marble chamber with a pool of running crystal water in the centre of it into which we gaily plunged
when we had bathed we returned to our apartment and dressed and then went into the central room where we had supped on the previous evening to find a morning meal already prepared for us and a capital meal it was though i should be puzzled to describe the dishes
after breakfast we lounged round and admired the tapestries and carpets and some pieces of statuary that were placed about wondering the while what was going to happen next
indeed by this time our minds were in such a state of complete bewilderment that we were as a matter of fact ready for anything that might arrive
as for our sense of astonishment it was pretty well obliterated
whilst we were still thus engaged our friend the captain of the guard presented himself and with many obeisances signified that we were to follow him which we did not without doubts and heartsearchingsfor we guessed that the time had come when we should have to settle the bill for those confounded hippopotami with our coldeyed friend agon the high priest
however there was no help for it and personally i took great comfort in the promise of the protection of the sister queens knowing that if ladies have a will they can generally find a way so off we started as though we liked it
a minutes walk through a passage and an outer court brought us to the great double gates of the palace that open on to the wide highway which runs uphill through the heart of milosis to the temple of the sun a mile away and thence down the slope on the farther side of the temple to the outer wall of the city
these gates are very large and massive and an extraordinarily beautiful work in metal
between themfor one set is placed at the entrance to an interior and one at that of the exterior wallis a fosse fortyfive feet in width
this fosse is filled with water and spanned by a drawbridge which when lifted makes the palace nearly impregnable to anything except siege guns
as we came one half of the wide gates were flung open and we passed over the drawbridge and presently stood gazing up one of the most imposing if not the most imposing roadways in the world
it is a hundred feet from curb to curb and on either side not cramped and crowded together as is our european fashion but each standing in its own grounds and built equidistant from and in similar style to the rest are a series of splendid singlestoried mansions all of red granite
these are the town houses of the nobles of the court and stretch away in unbroken lines for a mile or more till the eye is arrested by the glorious vision of the temple of the sun that crowns the hill and heads the roadway
as we stood gazing at this splendid sight of which more anon there suddenly dashed up to the gateway four chariots each drawn by two white horses
these chariots are twowheeled and made of wood
they are fitted with a stout pole the weight of which is supported by leathern girths that form a portion of the harness
the wheels are made with four spokes only are tired with iron and quite innocent of springs
in the front of the chariot and immediately over the pole is a small seat for the driver railed round to prevent him from being jolted off
inside the machine itself are three low seats one at each side and one with the back to the horses opposite to which is the door
the whole vehicle is lightly and yet strongly made and owing to the grace of the curves though primitive not half so ugly as might be expected
but if the chariots left something to be desired the horses did not
they were simply splendid not very large but strongly built and well ribbed up with small heads remarkably large and round hoofs and a great look of speed and blood
i have often wondered whence this breed which presents many distinct characteristics came but like that of its owners its history is obscure
like the people the horses have always been there
the first and last of these chariots were occupied by guards but the centre two were empty except for the driver and to these we were conducted
alphonse and i got into the first and sir henry good and umslopogaas into the one behind and then suddenly off we went
and we did go
among the zuvendi it is not usual to trot horses either riding or driving especially when the journey to be made is a short onethey go at full gallop
as soon as we were seated the driver called out the horses sprang forward and we were whirled away at a speed sufficient to take ones breath and which till i got accustomed to it kept me in momentary fear of an upset
as for the wretched alphonse he clung with a despairing face to the side of what he called this devil of a fiacre thinking that every moment was his last
presently it occurred to him to ask where we were going and i told him that as far as i could ascertain we were going to be sacrificed by burning
you should have seen his face as he grasped the side of the vehicle and cried out in his terror
but the wildlooking charioteer only leant forward over his flying steeds and shouted and the air as it went singing past bore away the sound of alphonses lamentations
and now before us in all its marvellous splendour and dazzling loveliness shone out the temple of the sunthe peculiar pride of the zuvendi to whom it was what solomons or rather herods temple was to the jews
the wealth and skill and labour of generations had been given to the building of this wonderful place which had been only finally completed within the last fifty years
nothing was spared that the country could produce and the result was indeed worthy of the effort not so much on account of its sizefor there are larger fanes in the worldas because of its perfect proportions the richness and beauty of its materials and the wonderful workmanship
the building that stands by itself on a space of some eight acres of garden ground on the hilltop around which are the dwellingplaces of the priests is built in the shape of a sunflower with a domecovered central hall from which radiate twelve petalshaped courts each dedicated to one of the twelve months and serving as the repositories of statues reared in memory of the illustrious dead
the width of the circle beneath the dome is three hundred feet the height of the dome is four hundred feet and the length of the rays is one hundred and fifty feet and the height of their roofs three hundred feet so that they run into the central dome exactly as the petals of the sunflower run into the great raised heart
thus the exact measurement from the centre of the central altar to the extreme point of any one of the rounded rays would be three hundred feet the width of the circle itself or a total of six hundred feet from the rounded extremity of one ray or petal to the extremity of the opposite one
these are internal measurementsa
q
the building itself is of pure and polished white marble which shows out in marvellous contrast to the red granite of the frowning city on whose brow it glistens indeed like an imperial diadem upon the forehead of a dusky queen
the outer surface of the dome and of the twelve petal courts is covered entirely with thin sheets of beaten gold and from the extreme point of the roof of each of these petals a glorious golden form with a trumpet in its hand and widespread wings is figured in the very act of soaring into space
i really must leave whoever reads this to imagine the surpassing beauty of these golden roofs flashing when the sun strikesflashing like a thousand fires aflame on a mountain of polished marbleso fiercely that the reflection can be clearly seen from the great peaks of the range a hundred miles away
it is a marvellous sightthis golden flower upborne upon the cool white marble walls and i doubt if the world can show such another
what makes the whole effect even more gorgeous is that a belt of a hundred and fifty feet around the marble wall of the temple is planted with an indigenous species of sunflower which were at the time when we first saw them a sheet of golden bloom
the main entrance to this wonderful place is between the two northernmost of the rays or petal courts and is protected first by the usual bronze gates and then by doors made of solid marble beautifully carved with allegorical subjects and overlaid with gold
when these are passed there is only the thickness of the wall which is however twentyfive feet for the zuvendi build for all time and another slight wall also of white marble introduced in order to avoid causing a visible gap in the inner skin of the wall and you stand in the circular hall under the great dome
advancing to the central altar you look upon as beautiful a sight as the imagination of man can conceive
you are in the middle of the holy place and above you the great white marble dome for the inner skin like the outer is of polished marble throughout arches away in graceful curves something like that of st pauls in london only at a slighter angle and from the funnellike opening at the exact apex a bright beam of light pours down upon the golden altar
at the east and the west are other altars and other beams of light stab the sacred twilight to the heart
in every direction white mystic wonderful open out the raylike courts each pierced through by a single arrow of light that serves to illumine its lofty silence and dimly to reveal the monuments of the dead
light was also admitted by sliding shutters under the eaves of the dome and in the roofa
q
overcome at so aweinspiring a sight the vast loveliness of which thrills the nerves like a glance from beautys eyes you turn to the central golden altar in the midst of which though you cannot see it now there burns a pale but steady flame crowned with curls of faint blue smoke
it is of marble overlaid with pure gold in shape round like the sun four feet in height and thirtysix in circumference
here also hinged to the foundations of the altar are twelve petals of beaten gold
all night and except at one hour all day also these petals are closed over the altar itself exactly as the petals of a waterlily close over the yellow crown in stormy weather but when the sun at midday pierces through the funnel in the dome and lights upon the golden flower the petals open and reveal the hidden mystery only to close again when the ray has passed
nor is this all
standing in semicircles at equal distances from each other on the north and south of the sacred place are ten golden angels or female winged forms exquisitely shaped and draped
these figures which are slightly larger than lifesize stand with bent heads in an attitude of adoration their faces shadowed by their wings and are most imposing and of exceeding beauty
there is but one thing further which calls for description in this altar which is that to the east the flooring in front of it is not of pure white marble as elsewhere throughout the building but of solid brass and this is also the case in front of the other two altars
the eastern and western altars which are semicircular in shape and placed against the wall of the building are much less imposing and are not enfolded in golden petals
they are however also of gold the sacred fire burns on each and a goldenwinged figure stands on either side of them
two great golden rays run up the wall behind them but where the third or middle one should be is an opening in the wall wide on the outside but narrow within like a loophole turned inwards
through the eastern loophole stream the first beams of the rising sun and strike right across the circle touching the folded petals of the great gold flower as they pass till they impinge upon the western altar
in the same way at night the last rays of the sinking sun rest for a while on the eastern altar before they die away into darkness
it is the promise of the dawn to the evening and the evening to the dawn
with the exception of those three altars and the winged figures about them the whole space beneath the vast white dome is utterly empty and devoid of ornamentationa circumstance that to my fancy adds greatly to its splendour
such is a brief description of this wonderful and lovely building to the glories of which to my mind so much enhanced by their complete simplicity i only wish i had the power to do justice
but i cannot so it is useless talking more about it
but when i compare this great work of genius to some of the tawdry buildings and tinsel ornamentation produced in these latter days by european ecclesiastical architects i feel that even highly civilized art might learn something from the zuvendi masterpieces
i can only say that the exclamation which sprang to my lips as soon as my eyes first became accustomed to the dim light of that glorious building and its white and curving beauties perfect and thrilling as those of a naked goddess grew upon me one by one was well
a dog would feel religious here it is vulgarly put but perhaps it conveys my meaning more clearly than any polished utterance
at the temple gates our party was received by a guard of soldiers who appeared to be under the orders of a priest and by them we were conducted into one of the ray or petal courts as the priests call them and there left for at least halfanhour
here we conferred together and realizing that we stood in great danger of our lives determined if any attempt should be made upon us to sell them as dearly as we couldumslopogaas announcing his fixed intention of committing sacrilege on the person of agon the high priest by splitting his head with inkosikaas
from where we stood we could perceive that an immense multitude were pouring into the temple evidently in expectation of some unusual event and i could not help fearing that we had to do with it
and here i may explain that every day when the sunlight falls upon the central altar and the trumpets sound a burnt sacrifice is offered to the sun consisting generally of the carcase of a sheep or ox or sometimes of fruit or corn
this event comes off about midday of course not always exactly at that hour but as zuvendis is situated not far from the line althoughbeing so high above the sea it is very temperatemidday and the falling of the sunlight on the altar were generally simultaneous
today the sacrifice was to take place at about eight minutes past twelve
just at twelve oclock a priest appeared and made a sign and the officer of the guard signified to us that we were expected to advance which we did with the best grace that we could muster all except alphonse whose irrepressible teeth instantly began to chatter
in a few seconds we were out of the court and looking at a vast sea of human faces stretching away to the farthest limits of the great circle all straining to catch a glimpse of the mysterious strangers who had committed sacrilege the first strangers mind you who to the knowledge of the multitude had ever set foot in zuvendis since such time that the memory of man runneth not to the contrary
as we appeared there was a murmur through the vast crowd that went echoing away up the great dome and we saw a visible blush of excitement grow on the thousands of faces like a pink light on a stretch of pale cloud and a very curious effect it was
on we passed down a lane cut through the heart of the human mass till presently we stood upon the brazen patch of flooring to the east of the central altar and immediately facing it
for some thirty feet around the goldenwinged figures the space was roped off and the multitudes stood outside the ropes
within were a circle of whiterobed goldcinctured priests holding long golden trumpets in their hands and immediately in front of us was our friend agon the high priest with his curious cap upon his head
his was the only covered head in that vast assemblage
we took our stand upon the brazen space little knowing what was prepared for us beneath but i noticed a curious hissing sound proceeding apparently from the floor for which i could not account
then came a pause and i looked around to see if there was any sign of the two queens nyleptha and sorais but they were not there
to the right of us however was a bare space that i guessed was reserved for them
we waited and presently a faroff trumpet blew apparently high up in the dome
then came another murmur from the multitude and up a long lane leading to the open space to our right we saw the two queens walking side by side
behind them were some nobles of the court among whom i recognized the great lord nasta and behind them again a body of about fifty guards
these last i was very glad to see
presently they had all arrived and taken their stand the two queens in the front the nobles to the right and left and the guards in a double semicircle behind them
then came another silence and nyleptha looked up and caught my eye it seemed to me that there was meaning in her glance and i watched it narrowly
from my eye it travelled down to the brazen flooring on the outer edge of which we stood
then followed a slight and almost imperceptible sidelong movement of the head
i did not understand it and it was repeated
then i guessed that she meant us to move back off the brazen floor
one more glance and i was sure of itthere was danger in standing on the floor
sir henry was placed on one side of me umslopogaas on the other
keeping my eyes fixed straight before me i whispered to them first in zulu and then in english to draw slowly back inch by inch till half their feet were resting on the marble flooring where the brass ceased
sir henry whispered on to good and alphonse and slowly very very slowly we shifted backwards so slowly that nobody except nyleptha and sorais who saw everything seemed to notice the movement
then i glanced again at nyleptha and saw that by an almost imperceptible nod she indicated approval
all the while agons eyes were fixed upon the altar before him apparently in an ecstasy of contemplation and mine were fixed upon the small of his back in another sort of ecstasy
suddenly he flung up his long arm and in a solemn and resounding voice commenced a chant of which for convenience sake i append a rough a very rough translation here though of course i did not then comprehend its meaning
it was an invocation to the sun and ran somewhat as follows there is silence upon the face of the earth and the waters thereof
yea the silence doth brood on the waters like a nesting bird the silence sleepeth also upon the bosom of the profound darkness only high up in the great spaces star doth speak unto star the earth is faint with longing and wet with the tears of her desire the stargirdled night doth embrace her but she is not comforted
she lies enshrouded in mists like a corpse in the graveclothes and stretches her pale hands to the east
lo
away in the farthest east there is the shadow of a light the earth seeth and lifts herself
she looks out from beneath the hollow of her hand
then thy great angels fly forth from the holy place oh sun they shoot their fiery swords into the darkness and shrivel it up
they climb the heavens and cast down the pale stars from their thrones yea they hurl the changeful stars back into the womb of the night they cause the moon to become wan as the face of a dying man and behold
thy glory comes oh sun
oh thou beautiful one thou drapest thyself in fire
the wide heavens are thy pathway thou rollest oer them as a chariot
the earth is thy bride
thou dost embrace her and she brings forth children yea thou favourest her and she yields her increase
thou art the all father and the giver of life oh sun
the young children stretch out their hands and grow in thy brightness the old men creep forth and seeing remember their strength
only the dead forget thee oh sun
when thou art wroth then thou dost hide thy face thou drawest around thee a thick curtain of shadows
then the earth grows cold and the heavens are dismayed they tremble and the sound thereof is the sound of thunder they weep and their tears are outpoured in the rain they sigh and the wild winds are the voice of their sighing
the flowers die the fruitful fields languish and turn pale the old men and the little children go unto their appointed place when thou withdrawest thy light oh sun
say what art thou oh thou matchless splendour who set thee on high oh thou flaming terror
when didst thou begin and when is the day of thy ending
thou art the raiment of the living spirit
none did place thee on high for thou wast the beginning
thou shalt not be ended when thy children are forgotten nay thou shalt never end for thy hours are eternal
thou sittest on high within thy golden house and measurest out the centuries
oh father of life
oh darkdispelling sun
this line is interesting as being one of the few allusions to be found in the zuvendi ritual to a vague divine essence independent of the material splendour of the orb they worship
ptia the word used here has a very indeterminate meaning and signifies essence vital principle spirit or even god
he ceased this solemn chant which though it seems a poor enough thing after going through my mill is really beautiful and impressive in the original and then after a moments pause he glanced up towards the funnelsloped opening in the dome and added oh sun descend upon thine altar
as he spoke a wonderful and a beautiful thing happened
down from on high flashed a splendid living ray of light cleaving the twilight like a sword of fire
full upon the closed petals it fell and ran shimmering down their golden sides and then the glorious flower opened as though beneath the bright influence
slowly it opened and as the great petals fell wide and revealed the golden altar on which the fire ever burns the priests blew a blast upon the trumpets and from all the people there rose a shout of praise that beat against the domed roof and came echoing down the marble walls
and now the flower altar was open and the sunlight fell full upon the tongue of sacred flame and beat it down so that it wavered sank and vanished into the hollow recesses whence it rose
as it vanished the mellow notes of the trumpets rolled out once more
again the old priest flung up his hands and called aloud we sacrifice to thee oh sun
once more i caught nylepthas eye it was fixed upon the brazen flooring
look out i said aloud and as i said it i saw agon bend forward and touch something on the altar
as he did so the great white sea of faces around us turned red and then white again and a deep breath went up like a universal sigh
nyleptha leant forward and with an involuntary movement covered her eyes with her hand
sorais turned and whispered to the officer of the royal bodyguard and then with a rending sound the whole of the brazen flooring slid from before our feet and there in its place was suddenly revealed a smooth marble shaft terminating in a most awful raging furnace beneath the altar big enough and hot enough to heat the iron sternpost of a manofwar
with a cry of terror we sprang backwards all except the wretched alphonse who was paralysed with fear and would have fallen into the fiery furnace which had been prepared for us had not sir henry caught him in his strong hand as he was vanishing and dragged him back
instantly there arose the most fearful hubbub and we four got back to back alphonse dodging frantically round our little circle in his attempts to take shelter under our legs
we all had our revolvers onfor though we had been politely disarmed of our guns on leaving the palace of course these people did not know what a revolver was
umslopogaas too had his axe of which no effort had been made to deprive him and now he whirled it round his head and sent his piercing zulu warshout echoing up the marble walls in fine defiant fashion
next second the priests baffled of their prey had drawn swords from beneath their white robes and were leaping on us like hounds upon a stag at bay
i saw that dangerous as action might be we must act or be lost so as the first man came bounding alongand a great tall fellow he wasi sent a heavy revolver ball through him and down he fell at the mouth of the shaft and slid shrieking frantically into the fiery gulf that had been prepared for us
whether it was his cries or the to them awful sound and effect of the pistol shot or what i know not but the other priests halted paralysed and dismayed and before they could come on again sorais had called out something and we together with the two queens and most of the courtiers were being surrounded with a wall of armed men
in a moment it was done and still the priests hesitated and the people hung in the balance like a herd of startled buck as it were making no sign one way or the other
the last yell of the burning priest had died away the fire had finished him and a great silence fell upon the place
then the high priest agon turned and his face was as the face of a devil
let the sacrifice be sacrificed he cried to the queens
has not sacrilege enough been done by these strangers and would ye as queens throw the cloak of your majesty over evildoers
are not the creatures sacred to the sun dead
and is not a priest of the sun also dead but now slain by the magic of these strangers who come as the winds out of heaven whence we know not and who are what we know not
beware oh queens how ye tamper with the great majesty of the god even before his high altar
there is a power that is more than your power there is a justice that is higher than your justice
beware how ye lift an impious hand against it
let the sacrifice be sacrificed oh queens then sorais made answer in her deep quiet tones that always seemed to me to have a suspicion of mockery about them however serious the theme oh agon thou hast spoken according to thy desire and thou hast spoken truth
but it is thou who wouldst lift an impious hand against the justice of thy god
bethink thee the midday sacrifice is accomplished the sun hath claimed his priest as a sacrifice this was a novel idea and the people applauded it
bethink thee what are these men
they are strangers found floating on the bosom of a lake
who brought them here
how came they here
how know you that they also are not servants of the sun
is this the hospitality that ye would have our nation show to those whom chance brings to them to throw them to the flames
shame on you
shame on you
what is hospitality
to receive the stranger and show him favour
to bind up his wounds and find a pillow for his head and food for him to eat
but thy pillow is the fiery furnace and thy food the hot savour of the flame
shame on thee i say she paused a little to watch the effect of her speech upon the multitude and seeing that it was favourable changed her tone from one of remonstrance to one of command
ho
place there she cried place i say make way for the queens and those whom the queens cover with their kaf mantle and if i refuse oh queen said agon between his teeth
then will i cut a path with my guards was the proud answer ay even in the presence of thy sanctuary and through the bodies of thy priests agon turned livid with baffled fury
he glanced at the people as though meditating an appeal to them but saw clearly that their sympathies were all the other way
the zuvendi are a very curious and sociable people and great as was their sense of the enormity that we had committed in shooting the sacred hippopotami they did not like the idea of the only real live strangers they had seen or heard of being consigned to a fiery furnace thereby putting an end for ever to their chance of extracting knowledge and information from and gossiping about us
agon saw this and hesitated and then for the first time nyleptha spoke in her soft sweet voice
bethink thee agon she said as my sister queen has said these men may also be servants of the sun
for themselves they cannot speak for their tongues are tied
let the matter be adjourned till such time as they have learnt our language
who can be condemned without a hearing
when these men can plead for themselves then it will be time to put them to the proof here was a clever loophole of escape and the vindictive old priest took it little as he liked it
so be it oh queens he said
let the men go in peace and when they have learnt our tongue then let them speak
and i even i will make humble supplication at the altar lest pestilence fall on the land by cause of the sacrilege these words were received with a murmur of applause and in another minute we were marching out of the temple surrounded by the royal guards
but it was not till long afterwards that we learnt the exact substance of what had passed and how hardly our lives had been wrung out of the cruel grip of the zuvendi priesthood in the face of which even the queens were practically powerless
had it not been for their strenuous efforts to protect us we should have been slain even before we set foot in the temple of the sun
the attempt to drop us bodily into the fiery pit as an offering was a last artifice to attain this end when several others quite unsuspected by us had already failed
sorais song after our escape from agon and his pious crew we returned to our quarters in the palace and had a very good time
the two queens the nobles and the people vied with each other in doing us honour and showering gifts upon us
as for that painful little incident of the hippopotami it sank into oblivion where we were quite content to leave it
every day deputations and individuals waited on us to examine our guns and clothing our chain shirts and our instruments especially our watches with which they were much delighted
in short we became quite the rage so much so that some of the fashionable young swells among the zuvendi began to copy the cut of some of our clothes notably sir henrys shooting jacket
one day indeed a deputation waited on us and as usual good donned his fulldress uniform for the occasion
this deputation seemed somehow to be a different class to those who generally came to visit us
they were little insignificant men of an excessively polite not to say servile demeanour and their attention appeared to be chiefly taken up with observing the details of goods fulldress uniform of which they took copious notes and measurements
good was much flattered at the time not suspecting that he had to deal with the six leading tailors of milosis
a fortnight afterwards however when on attending court as usual he had the pleasure of seeing some seven or eight zuvendi mashers arrayed in all the glory of a very fair imitation of his fulldress uniform he changed his mind
i shall never forget his face of astonishment and disgust
it was after this chiefly to avoid remark and also because our clothes were wearing out and had to be saved up that we resolved to adopt the native dress and a very comfortable one we found it though i am bound to say that i looked sufficiently ridiculous in it and as for alphonse
only umslopogaas would have none of these things when his moocha was worn out the fierce old zulu made him a new one and went about unconcerned as grim and naked as his own battleaxe
meanwhile we pursued our study of the language steadily and made very good progress
on the morning following our adventure in the temple three grave and reverend signiors presented themselves armed with manuscript books inkhorns and feather pens and indicated that they had been sent to teach us
so with the exception of umslopogaas we all buckled to with a will doing four hours a day
as for umslopogaas he would have none of that either
he did not wish to learn that womans talk not he and when one of the teachers advanced on him with a book and an inkhorn and waved them before him in a mild persuasive way much as a churchwarden invitingly shakes the offertory bag under the nose of a rich but niggardly parishioner he sprang up with a fierce oath and flashed inkosikaas before the eyes of our learned friend and there was an end of the attempt to teach him zuvendi
thus we spent our mornings in useful occupation which grew more and more interesting as we proceeded and the afternoons were given up to recreation
sometimes we made trips notably one to the gold mines and another to the marble quarries both of which i wish i had space and time to describe and sometimes we went out hunting buck with dogs trained for that purpose and a very exciting sport it is as the country is full of agricultural enclosures and our horses were magnificent
this is not to be wondered at seeing that the royal stables were at our command in addition to which we had four splendid saddle horses given to us by nyleptha
sometimes again we went hawking a pastime that is in great favour among the zuvendi who generally fly their birds at a species of partridge which is remarkable for the swiftness and strength of its flight
when attacked by the hawk this bird appears to lose its head and instead of seeking cover flies high into the sky thus offering wonderful sport
i have seen one of these partridges soar up almost out of sight when followed by the hawk
still better sport is offered by a variety of solitary snipe as big as a small woodcock which is plentiful in this country and which is flown at with a very small agile and highlytrained hawk with an almost red tail
the zigzagging of the great snipe and the lightning rapidity of the flight and movements of the redtailed hawk make the pastime a delightful one
another variety of the same amusement is the hunting of a very small species of antelope with trained eagles and it certainly is a marvellous sight to see the great bird soar and soar till he is nothing but a black speck in the sunlight and then suddenly come dashing down like a cannonball upon some cowering buck that is hidden in a patch of grass from everything but that piercing eye
still finer is the spectacle when the eagle takes the buck running
on other days we would pay visits to the country seats at some of the great lords beautiful fortified places and the villages clustering beneath their walls
here we saw vineyards and cornfields and wellkept parklike grounds with such timber in them as filled me with delight for i do love a good tree
there it stands so strong and sturdy and yet so beautiful a very type of the best sort of man
how proudly it lifts its bare head to the winter storms and with what a full heart it rejoices when the spring has come again
how grand its voice is too when it talks with the wind a thousand aeolian harps cannot equal the beauty of the sighing of a great tree in leaf
all day it points to the sunshine and all night to the stars and thus passionless and yet full of life it endures through the centuries come storm come shine drawing its sustenance from the cool bosom of its mother earth and as the slow years roll by learning the great mysteries of growth and of decay
and so on and on through generations outliving individuals customs dynastiesall save the landscape it adorns and human naturetill the appointed day when the wind wins the long battle and rejoices over a reclaimed space or decay puts the last stroke to his fungusfingered work
ah one should always think twice before one cuts down a tree
in the evenings it was customary for sir henry good and myself to dine or rather sup with their majestiesnot every night indeed but about three or four times a week whenever they had not much company or the affairs of state would allow of it
and i am bound to say that those little suppers were quite the most charming things of their sort that i ever had to do with
how true is the saying that the very highest in rank are always the most simple and kindly
it is from your halfandhalf sort of people that you get pomposity and vulgarity the difference between the two being very much what one sees every day in england between the old outatelbows brokendown county family and the overbearing purseproud people who come and take the place
i really think that nylepthas greatest charm is her sweet simplicity and her kindly genuine interest even in little things
she is the simplest woman i ever knew and where her passions are not involved one of the sweetest but she can look queenly enough when she likes and be as fierce as any savage too
for instance never shall i forget that scene when i for the first time was sure that she was really in love with curtis
it came about in this wayall through goods weakness for ladies society
when we had been employed for some three months in learning zuvendi it struck master good that he was getting rather tired of the old gentlemen who did us the honour to lead us in the way that we should go so he proceeded without saying a word to anybody else to inform them that it was a peculiar fact but that we could not make any real progress in the deeper intricacies of a foreign language unless we were taught by ladiesyoung ladies he was careful to explain
in his own country he pointed out it was habitual to choose the very bestlooking and most charming girls who could be found to instruct any strangers who happened to come that way etc
all of this the old gentlemen swallowed openmouthed
there was they admitted reason in what he said since the contemplation of the beautiful as their philosophy taught induced a certain porosity of mind similar to that produced upon the physical body by the healthful influences of sun and air
consequently it was probable that we might absorb the zuvendi tongue a little faster if suitable teachers could be found
another thing was that as the female sex was naturally loquacious good practice would be gained in the viva voce department of our studies
to all of this good gravely assented and the learned gentlemen departed assuring him that their orders were to fall in with our wishes in every way and that if possible our views should be met
imagine therefore the surprise and disgust of myself and i trust and believe sir henry when on entering the room where we were accustomed to carry on our studies the following morning we found instead of our usual venerable tutors three of the bestlooking young women whom milosis could produceand that is saying a good dealwho blushed and smiled and curtseyed and gave us to understand that they were there to carry on our instruction
then good as we gazed at one another in bewilderment thought fit to explain saying that it had slipped his memory beforebut the old gentlemen had told him on the previous evening that it was absolutely necessary that our further education should be carried on by the other sex
i was overwhelmed and appealed to sir henry for advice in such a crisis
well he said you see the ladies are here aint they
if we sent them away dont you think it might hurt their feelings eh
one doesnt like to be rough you see and they look regular blues dont they eh by this time good had already begun his lessons with the handsomest of the three and so with a sigh i yielded
that day everything went very well the young ladies were certainly very clever and they only smiled when we blundered
i never saw good so attentive to his books before and even sir henry appeared to tackle zuvendi with a renewed zest
ah thought i will it always be thus next day we were much more lively our work was pleasingly interspersed with questions about our native country what the ladies were like there etc all of which we answered as best as we could in zuvendi and i heard good assuring his teacher that her loveliness was to the beauties of europe as the sun to the moon to which she replied with a little toss of the head that she was a plain teaching woman and nothing else and that it was not kind to deceive a poor girl so
then we had a little singing that was really charming so natural and unaffected
the zuvendi lovesongs are most touching
on the third day we were all quite intimate
good narrated some of his previous love affairs to his fair teacher and so moved was she that her sighs mingled with his own
i discoursed with mine a merry blueeyed girl upon zuvendian art and never saw that she was waiting for an opportunity to drop a specimen of the cockroach tribe down my back whilst in the corner sir henry and his governess appeared so far as i could judge to be going through a lesson framed on the great educational principles laid down by wackford squeers esq though in a very modified or rather spiritualized form
the lady softly repeated the zuvendi word for hand and he took hers eyes and he gazed deep into her brown orbs lips andbut just at that moment my young lady dropped the cockroach down my back and ran away laughing
now if there is one thing i loathe more than another it is cockroaches and moved quite beyond myself and yet laughing at her impudence i took up the cushion she had been sitting on and threw it after her
imagine then my shamemy horror and my distresswhen the door opened and attended by two guards only in walked nyleptha
the cushion could not be recalled it missed the girl and hit one of the guards on the head but i instantly and ineffectually tried to look as though i had not thrown it
good ceased his sighing and began to murder zuvendi at the top of his voice and sir henry whistled and looked silly
as for the poor girls they were utterly dumbfounded
and nyleptha
she drew herself up till her frame seemed to tower even above that of the tall guards and her face went first red and then pale as death
guards she said in a quiet choked voice and pointing at the fair but unconscious disciple of wackford squeers slay me that woman the men hesitated as well they might
will ye do my bidding she said again in the same voice or will ye not then they advanced upon the girl with uplifted spears
by this time sir henry had recovered himself and saw that the comedy was likely to turn into a tragedy
stand back he said in a voice of thunder at the same time getting in front of the terrified girl
shame on thee nylepthashame
thou shalt not kill her doubtless thou hast good reason to try to protect her
thou couldst hardly do less in honour answered the infuriated queen but she shall dieshe shall die and she stamped her little foot
it is well he answered then will i die with her
i am thy servant oh queen do with me even as thou wilt and he bowed towards her and fixed his clear eyes contemptuously on her face
i could wish to slay thee too she answered for thou dost make a mock of me and then feeling that she was mastered and i suppose not knowing what else to do she burst into such a storm of tears and looked so royally lovely in her passionate distress that old as i am i must say i envied curtis his task of supporting her
it was rather odd to see him holding her in his arms considering what had just passeda thought that seemed to occur to herself for presently she wrenched herself free and went leaving us all much disturbed
presently however one of the guards returned with a message to the girls that they were on pain of death to leave the city and return to their homes in the country and that no further harm would come to them and accordingly they went one of them remarking philosophically that it could not be helped and that it was a satisfaction to know that they had taught us a little serviceable zuvendi
mine was an exceedingly nice girl and overlooking the cockroach i made her a present of my favourite lucky sixpence with a hole in it when she went away
after that our former masters resumed their course of instruction needless to say to my great relief
that night when in fear and trembling we attended the royal supper table we found that nyleptha was laid up with a bad headache
that headache lasted for three whole days but on the fourth she was present at supper as usual and with the most gracious and sweet smile gave sir henry her hand to lead her to the table
no allusion was made to the little affair described above beyond her saying with a charming air of innocence that when she came to see us at our studies the other day she had been seized with a giddiness from which she had only now recovered
she supposed she added with a touch of the humour that was common to her that it was the sight of people working so hard which had affected her
in reply sir henry said dryly that he had thought she did not look quite herself on that day whereat she flashed one of those quick glances of hers at him which if he had the feelings of a man must have gone through him like a knife and the subject dropped entirely
indeed after supper was over nyleptha condescended to put us through an examination to see what we had learnt and to express herself well satisfied with the results
indeed she proceeded to give us especially sir henry a lesson on her own account and very interesting we found it
and all the while that we talked or rather tried to talk and laughed sorais would sit there in her carven ivory chair and look at us and read us all like a book only from time to time saying a few words and smiling that quick ominous smile of hers which was more like a flash of summer lightning on a dark cloud than anything else
and as near to her as he dared would sit good worshipping through his eyeglass for he really was getting seriously devoted to this sombre beauty of whom speaking personally i felt terribly afraid
i watched her keenly and soon i found out that for all her apparent impassibility she was at heart bitterly jealous of nyleptha
another thing i found out and the discovery filled me with dismay and that was that she also was growing devoted to sir henry curtis
of course i could not be sure it is not easy to read so cold and haughty a woman but i noticed one or two little things and as elephant hunters know dried grass shows which way the wind has set
and so another three months passed over us by which time we had all attained to a very considerable mastery of the zuvendi language which is an easy one to learn
and as the time went on we became great favourites with the people and even with the courtiers gaining an enormous reputation for cleverness because as i think i have said sir henry was able to show them how to make glass which was a national want and also by the help of a twentyyear almanac that we had with us to predict various heavenly combinations which were quite unsuspected by the native astronomers
we even succeeded in demonstrating the principle of the steamengine to a gathering of the learned men who were filled with amazement and several other things of the same sort we did
and so it came about that the people made up their minds that we must on no account be allowed to go out of the country which indeed was an apparent impossibility even if we had wished it and we were advanced to great honour and made officers to the bodyguards of the sister queens while permanent quarters were assigned to us in the palace and our opinion was asked upon questions of national policy
but blue as the sky seemed there was a cloud and a big one on the horizon
we had indeed heard no more of those confounded hippopotami but it is not on that account to be supposed that our sacrilege was forgotten or the enmity of the great and powerful priesthood headed by agon appeased
on the contrary it was burning the more fiercely because it was necessarily suppressed and what had perhaps begun in bigotry was ending in downright direct hatred born of jealousy
hitherto the priests had been the wise men of the land and were on this account as well as from superstitious causes looked on with peculiar veneration
but our arrival with our outlandish wisdom and our strange inventions and hints of unimagined things dealt a serious blow to this state of affairs and among the educated zuvendi went far towards destroying the priestly prestige
a still worse affront to them however was the favour with which we were regarded and the trust that was reposed in us
all these things tended to make us excessively obnoxious to the great sacerdotal clan the most powerful because the most united faction in the kingdom
another source of imminent danger to us was the rising envy of some of the great lords headed by nasta whose antagonism to us had at best been but thinly veiled and which now threatened to break out into open flame
nasta had for some years been a candidate for nylepthas hand in marriage and when we appeared on the scene i fancy from all i could gather that though there were still many obstacles in his path success was by no means out of his reach
but now all this had changed the coy nyleptha smiled no more in his direction and he was not slow to guess the cause
infuriated and alarmed he turned his attention to sorais only to find that he might as well try to woo a mountain side
with a bitter jest or two about his fickleness that door was closed on him for ever
so nasta bethought himself of the thirty thousand wild swordsmen who would pour down at his bidding through the northern mountain passes and no doubt vowed to adorn the gates of milosis with our heads
but first he determined as i learned to make one more attempt and to demand the hand of nyleptha in the open court after the formal annual ceremony of the signing of the laws that had been proclaimed by the queens during the year
of this astounding fact nyleptha heard with simulated nonchalance and with a little trembling of the voice herself informed us of it as we sat at supper on the night preceding the great ceremony of the lawgiving
sir henry bit his lip and do what he could to prevent it plainly showed his agitation
and what answer will the queen be pleased to give to the great lord asked i in a jesting manner
answer macumazahn for we had elected to pass by our zulu names in zuvendis she said with a pretty shrug of her ivory shoulder
nay i know not what is a poor woman to do when the wooer has thirty thousand swords wherewith to urge his love and from under her long lashes she glanced at curtis
just then we rose from the table to adjourn into another room
quatermain a word quick said sir henry to me
listen
i have never spoken about it but surely you have guessed i love nyleptha
what am i to do fortunately i had more or less already taken the question into consideration and was therefore able to give such answer as seemed the wisest to me
you must speak to nyleptha tonight i said
now is your time now or never
listen
in the sittingchamber get near to her and whisper to her to meet you at midnight by the rademas statue at the end of the great hall
i will keep watch for you there
now or never curtis we passed on into the other room
nyleptha was sitting her hands before her and a sad anxious look upon her lovely face
a little way off was sorais talking to good in her slow measured tones
the time went on in another quarter of an hour i knew that according to their habit the queens would retire
as yet sir henry had had no chance of saying a word in private indeed though we saw much of the royal sisters it was by no means easy to see them alone
i racked my brains and at last an idea came to me
will the queen be pleased i said bowing low before sorais to sing to her servants
our hearts are heavy this night sing to us oh lady of the night sorais favourite name among the people
my songs macumazahn are not such as to lighten the heavy heart yet will i sing if it pleases thee she answered and she rose and went a few paces to a table whereon lay an instrument not unlike a zither and struck a few wandering chords
then suddenly like the notes of some deepthroated bird her rounded voice rang out in song so wildly sweet and yet with so eerie and sad a refrain that it made the very blood stand still
up up soared the golden notes that seemed to melt far away and then to grow again and travel on laden with all the sorrow of the world and all the despair of the lost
it was a marvellous song but i had not time to listen to it properly
however i got the words of it afterwards and here is a translation of its burden so far as it admits of being translated at all
sorais song as a desolate bird that through darkness its lost way is winging as a hand that is helplessly raised when deaths sickle is swinging so is life
ay the life that lends passion and breath to my singing
as the nightingales song that is full of a sweetness unspoken as a spirit unbarring the gates of the skies for a token so is love
ay the love that shall fall when his pinion is broken
as the tramp of the legions when trumpets their challenge are sending as the shout of the stormgod when lightnings the black sky are rending so is power
ay the power that shall lie in the dust at its ending
so short is our life yet with space for all things to forsake us a bitter delusion a dream from which nought can awake us till deaths dogging footsteps at morn or at eve shall oertake us
refrain oh the world is fair at the dawningdawningdawning but the red sun sinks in bloodthe red sun sinks in blood
i only wish that i could write down the music too
now curtis now i whispered when she began the second verse and turned my back
nyleptha he saidfor my nerves were so much on the stretch that i could hear every word low as it was spoken even through sorais divine notesnyleptha i must speak with thee this night upon my life i must
say me not nay oh say me not nay how can i speak with thee she answered looking fixedly before her queens are not like other people
i am surrounded and watched listen nyleptha thus
i will be before the statue of rademas in the great hall at midnight
i have the countersign and can pass in
macumazahn will be there to keep guard and with him the zulu
oh come my queen deny me not it is not seemly she murmured and tomorrow just then the music began to die in the last wail of the refrain and sorais slowly turned her round
i will be there said nyleptha hurriedly on thy life see that thou fail me not before the statue it was nightdead nightand the silence lay on the frowning city like a cloud
secretly as evildoers sir henry curtis umslopogaas and myself threaded our way through the passages towards a byentrance to the great throne chamber
once we were met by the fierce rattling challenge of the sentry
i gave the countersign and the man grounded his spear and let us pass
also we were officers of the queens bodyguard and in that capacity had a right to come and go unquestioned
we gained the hall in safety
so empty and so still was it that even when we had passed the sound of our footsteps yet echoed up the lofty walls vibrating faintly and still more faintly against the carven roof like ghosts of the footsteps of dead men haunting the place that once they trod
it was an eerie spot and it oppressed me
the moon was full and threw great pencils and patches of light through the high windowless openings in the walls that lay pure and beautiful upon the blackness of the marble floor like white flowers on a coffin
one of these silver arrows fell upon the statue of the sleeping rademas and of the angel form bent over him illumining it and a small circle round it with a soft clear light reminding me of that with which catholics illumine the altars of their cathedrals
here by the statue we took our stand and waited
sir henry and i close together umslopogaas some paces off in the darkness so that i could only just make out his towering outline leaning on the outline of an axe
so long did we wait that i almost fell asleep resting against the cold marble but was suddenly aroused by hearing curtis give a quick catching breath
then from far away there came a little sound as though the statues that lined the walls were whispering to each other some message of the ages
it was the faint sweep of a ladys dress
nearer it grew and nearer yet
we could see a figure steal from patch to patch of moonlight and even hear the soft fall of sandalled feet
another second and i saw the black silhouette of the old zulu raise its arm in mute salute and nyleptha was before us
oh how beautiful she looked as she paused a moment just within the circle of the moonlight
her hand was pressed upon her heart and her white bosom heaved beneath it
round her head a broidered scarf was loosely thrown partially shadowing the perfect face and thus rendering it even more lovely for beauty dependent as it is to a certain extent upon the imagination is never so beautiful as when it is half hid
there she stood radiant but half doubting stately and yet so sweet
it was but a moment but i then and there fell in love with her myself and have remained so to this hour for indeed she looked more like an angel out of heaven than a loving passionate mortal woman
low we bowed before her and then she spoke
i have come she whispered but it was at great risk
ye know not how i am watched
the priests watch me
sorais watches me with those great eyes of hers
my very guards are spies upon me
nasta watches me too
oh let him be careful and she stamped her foot
let him be careful i am a woman and therefore hard to drive
ay and i am a queen too and can still avenge
let him be careful i say lest in place of giving him my hand i take his head and she ended the outburst with a little sob and then smiled up at us bewitchingly and laughed
thou didst bid me come hither my lord incubu curtis had taught her to call him so
doubtless it is about business of the state for i know that thou art ever full of great ideas and plans for my welfare and my peoples
so even as a queen should i have come though i greatly fear the dark alone and again she laughed and gave him a glance from her grey eyes
at this point i thought it wise to move a little since secrets of the state should not be made public property but she would not let me go far peremptorily stopping me within five yards or so saying that she feared surprise
so it came to pass that however unwillingly i heard all that passed
thou knowest nyleptha said sir henry that it was for none of these things that i asked thee to meet me at this lonely place
nyleptha waste not the time in pleasantry but listen to me fori love thee as he said the words i saw her face break up as it were and change
the coquetry went out of it and in its place there shone a great light of love which seemed to glorify it and make it like that of the marble angel overhead
i could not help thinking that it must have been a touch of prophetic instinct which made the long dead rademas limn in the features of the angel of his inspiring vision so strange a likeness of his own descendant
sir henry also must have observed and been struck by the likeness for catching the look upon nylepthas face he glanced quickly from it to the moonlit statue and then back again at his beloved
thou sayest thou dost love me she said in a low voice and thy voice rings true but how am i to know that thou dost speak the truth though she went on with proud humility and in the stately third person which is so largely used by the zuvendi i be as nothing in the eyes of my lord and she curtseyed towards him who comes from among a wonderful people to whom my people are but children yet here am i a queen and a leader of men and if i would go to battle a hundred thousand spears shall sparkle in my train like stars glimmering down the path of the bent moon
and although my beauty be a little thing in the eyes of my lord and she lifted her broidered skirt and curtseyed again yet here among my own people am i held right fair and ever since i was a woman the great lords of my kingdom have made quarrel concerning me as though forsooth she added with a flash of passion i were a deer to be pulled down by the hungriest wolf or a horse to be sold to the highest bidder
let my lord pardon me if i weary my lord but it hath pleased my lord to say that he loves me nyleptha a queen of the zuvendi and therefore would i say that though my love and my hand be not much to my lord yet to me are they all oh she cried with a sudden and thrilling change of voice and modifying her dignified mode of address
oh how can i know that thou lovest but me
how can i know that thou wilt not weary of me and seek thine own place again leaving me desolate
who is there to tell me but that thou lovest some other woman some fair woman unknown to me but who yet draws breath beneath this same moon that shines on me tonight
tell me how am i to know and she clasped her hands and stretched them out towards him and looked appealingly into his face
nyleptha answered sir henry adopting the zuvendi way of speech i have told thee that i love thee how am i to tell thee how much i love thee
is there then a measure for love
yet will i try
i say not that i have never looked upon another woman with favour but this i say that i love thee with all my life and with all my strength that i love thee now and shall love thee till i grow cold in death ay and as i believe beyond my death and on and on for ever i say that thy voice is music to my ear and thy touch as water to a thirsty land that when thou art there the world is beautiful and when i see thee not it is as though the light was dead
oh nyleptha i will never leave thee here and now for thy dear sake i will forget my people and my fathers house yea i renounce them all
by thy side will i live nyleptha and at thy side will i die he paused and gazed at her earnestly but she hung her head like a lily and said never a word
look he went on pointing to the statue on which the moonlight played so brightly
thou seest that angel woman who rests her hand upon the forehead of the sleeping man and thou seest how at her touch his soul flames up and shines out through his flesh even as a lamp at the touch of the fire so is it with me and thee nyleptha
thou hast awakened my soul and called it forth and now nyleptha it is not mine not mine but thine and thine only
there is no more for me to say in thy hands is my life and he leaned back against the pedestal of the statue looking very pale and his eyes shining but proud and handsome as a god
slowly slowly she raised her head and fixed her wonderful eyes all alight with the greatness of her passion full upon his face as though to read his very soul
then at last she spoke low indeed but clearly as a silver bell
of a truth weak woman that i am i do believe thee
ill will be the day for thee and for me also if it be my fate to learn that i have believed a lie
and now hearken to me oh man who hath wandered here from far to steal my heart and make me all thine own
i put my hand upon thy hand thus and thus i whose lips have never kissed before do kiss thee on the brow and now by my hand and by that first and holy kiss ay by my peoples weal and by my throne that like enough i shall lose for theeby the name of my high house by the sacred stone and by the eternal majesty of the sun i swear that for thee will i live and die
and i swear that i will love thee and thee only till death ay and beyond if as thou sayest there be a beyond and that thy will shall be my will and thy ways my ways
oh see see my lord
thou knowest not how humble is she who loves i who am a queen i kneel before thee even at thy feet i do my homage and the lovely impassioned creature flung herself down on her knees on the cold marble before him
and after that i really do not know for i could stand it no longer and cleared off to refresh myself with a little of old umslopogaas society leaving them to settle it their own way and a very long time they were about it
i found the old warrior leaning on inkosikaas as usual and surveying the scene in the patch of moonlight with a grim smile of amusement
ah macumazahn he said i suppose it is because i am getting old but i dont think that i shall ever learn to understand the ways of you white people
look there now i pray thee they are a pretty pair of doves but what is all the fuss about macumazahn
he wants a wife and she wants a husband then why does he not pay his cows down like a man and have done with it
it would save a deal of trouble and we should have had our nights sleep
but there they go talk talk talk and kiss kiss kiss like mad things
eugh alluding to the zulu customa
q
some threequarters of an hour afterwards the pair of doves came strolling towards us curtis looking slightly silly and nyleptha remarking calmly that the moonlight made very pretty effects on the marble
then for she was in a most gracious mood she took my hand and said that i was her lords dear friend and therefore most dear to hernot a word for my own sake you see
next she lifted umslopogaas axe and examined it curiously saying significantly as she did so that he might soon have cause to use it in defence of her
after that she nodded prettily to us all and casting a tender glance at her lover glided off into the darkness like a beautiful vision
when we got back to our quarters which we did without accident curtis asked me jocularly what i was thinking about
i am wondering i answered on what principle it is arranged that some people should find beautiful queens to fall in love with them while others find nobody at all or worse than nobody and i am also wondering how many brave mens lives this nights work will cost it was rather nasty of me perhaps but somehow all the feelings do not evaporate with age and i could not help being a little jealous of my old friends luck
vanity my sons vanity of vanities
on the following morning good was informed of the happy occurrence and positively rippled with smiles that originating somewhere about the mouth slowly travelled up his face like the rings in a duckpond till they flowed over the brim of his eyeglass and went where sweet smiles go
the fact of the matter however was that not only was good rejoiced about the thing on its own merits but also for personal reasons
he adored sorais quite as earnestly as sir henry adored nyleptha and his adoration had not altogether prospered
indeed it had seemed to him and to me also that the dark cleopatralike queen favoured curtis in her own curious inscrutable way much more than good
therefore it was a relief to him to learn that his unconscious rival was permanently and satisfactorily attached in another direction
his face fell a little however when he was told that the whole thing was to be kept as secret as the dead above all from sorais for the present inasmuch as the political convulsion which would follow such an announcement at the moment would be altogether too great to face and would very possibly if prematurely made shake nyleptha from her throne
that morning we again attended in the throne hall and i could not help smiling to myself when i compared the visit to our last and reflecting that if walls could speak they would have strange tales to tell
what actresses women are
there high upon her golden throne draped in her blazoned kaf or robe of state sat the fair nyleptha and when sir henry came in a little late dressed in the full uniform of an officer of her guard and humbly bent himself before her she merely acknowledged his salute with a careless nod and turned her head coldly aside
it was a very large court for not only did the signing of the laws attract many outside of those whose duty it was to attend but also the rumour that nasta was going to publicly ask the hand of nyleptha in marriage had gone abroad with the result that the great hall was crowded to its utmost capacity
there were our friends the priests in force headed by agon who regarded us with a vindictive eye and a most imposing band they were with their long white embroidered robes girt with a golden chain from which hung the fishlike scales
there too were a number of the lords each with a band of brilliantly attired attendants and prominent among them was nasta stroking his black beard meditatively and looking unusually pleasant
it was a splendid and impressive sight especially when the officer after having read out each law handed them to the queens to sign whereon the trumpets blared out and the queens guard grounded their spears with a crash in salute
this reading and signing of the laws took a long time but at length it came to an end the last one reciting that whereas distinguished strangers etc and proceeding to confer on the three of us the rank of lords together with certain military commands and large estates bestowed by the queen
when it was read the trumpets blared and the spears clashed down as usual but i saw some of the lords turn and whisper to each other while nasta ground his teeth
they did not like the favour that was shown to us which under all the circumstances was not perhaps unnatural
then there came a pause and nasta stepped forward and bowing humbly though with no humility in his eye craved a boon at the hands of the queen nyleptha
nyleptha turned a little pale but bowed graciously and prayed the wellbeloved lord to speak on whereon in a few straightforward soldierlike words he asked her hand in marriage
then before she could find words to answer the high priest agon took up the tale and in a speech of real eloquence and power pointed out the many advantages of the proposed alliance how it would consolidate the kingdom for nastas dominions of which he was virtually king were to zuvendis much what scotland used to be to england how it would gratify the wild mountaineers and be popular among the soldiery for nasta was a famous general how it would set her dynasty firmly on the throne and would gain the blessing and approval of the sun ie of the office of the high priest and so on
many of his arguments were undoubtedly valid and there was looking at it from a political point of view everything to be said for the marriage
but unfortunately it is difficult to play the game of politics with the persons of young and lovely queens as though they were ivory effigies of themselves on a chessboard
nylepthas face while agon spouted away was a perfect study she smiled indeed but beneath the smile it set like a stone and her eyes began to flash ominously
at last he stopped and she prepared herself to answer
before she did so however sorais leant towards her and said in a voice sufficiently loud for me to catch what she said bethink thee well my sister ere thou dost speak for methinks that our thrones may hang upon thy words nyleptha made no answer and with a shrug and a smile sorais leant back again and listened
of a truth a great honour has been done to me she said that my poor hand should not only have been asked in marriage but that agon here should be so swift to pronounce the blessing of the sun upon my union
methinks that in another minute he would have wed us fast ere the bride had said her say
nasta i thank thee and i will bethink me of thy words but now as yet i have no mind for marriage that is a cup of which none know the taste until they begin to drink it
again i thank thee nasta and she made as though she would rise
the great lords face turned almost as black as his beard with fury for he knew that the words amounted to a final refusal of his suit
thanks be to the queen for her gracious words he said restraining himself with difficulty and looking anything but grateful my heart shall surely treasure them
and now i crave another boon namely the royal leave to withdraw myself to my own poor cities in the north till such time as the queen shall say my suit nay or yea
mayhap he added with a sneer the queen will be pleased to visit me there and to bring with her these stranger lords and he scowled darkly towards us
it is but a poor country and a rough but we are a hardy race of mountaineers and there shall be gathered thirty thousand swordsmen to shout a welcome to her this speech which was almost a declaration of rebellion was received in complete silence but nyleptha flushed up and answered it with spirit
oh surely nasta i will come and the strange lords in my train and for every man of thy mountaineers who calls thee prince will i bring two from the lowlands who call me queen and we will see which is the staunchest breed
till then farewell the trumpets blared out the queens rose and the great assembly broke up in murmuring confusion and for myself i went home with a heavy heart foreseeing civil war
after this there was quiet for a few weeks
curtis and the queen did not often meet and exercised the utmost caution not to allow the true relation in which they stood to each other to leak out but do what they would rumours as hard to trace as a buzzing fly in a dark room and yet quite as audible began to hum round and round and at last to settle on her throne
the storm breaks and now it was that the trouble which at first had been but a cloud as large as a mans hand began to loom very black and big upon our horizon namely sorais preference for sir henry
i saw the storm drawing nearer and nearer and so poor fellow did he
the affection of so lovely and highlyplaced a woman was not a thing that could in a general way be considered a calamity by any man but situated as curtis was it was a grievous burden to bear
to begin with nyleptha though altogether charming was it must be admitted of a rather jealous disposition and was sometimes apt to visit on her lovers head her indignation at the marks of what alphonse would have called the distinguished consideration with which her royal sister favoured him
then the enforced secrecy of his relation to nyleptha prevented curtis from taking some opportunity of putting a stop or trying to put a stop to this false condition of affairs by telling sorais in a casual but confidential way that he was going to marry her sister
a third sting in sir henrys honey was that he knew that good was honestly and sincerely attached to the ominouslooking but most attractive lady of the night
indeed poor bougwan was wasting himself to a shadow of his fat and jolly self about her his face getting so thin that his eyeglass would scarcely stick in it while she with a sort of careless coquetry just gave him encouragement enough to keep him going thinking no doubt that he might be useful as a stalkinghorse
i tried to give him a hint in as delicate a way as i could but he flew into a huff and would not listen to me so i was determined to let ill alone for fear of making it worse
poor good he really was very ludicrous in his distress and went in for all sorts of absurdities under the belief that he was advancing his suit
one of them was the writingwith the assistance of one of the grave and revered signiors who instructed us and who whatever may have been the measure of his erudition did not understand how to scan a lineof a most interminable zuvendi lovesong of which the continually recurring refrain was something about i will kiss thee oh yes i will kiss thee now among the zuvendi it is a common and most harmless thing for young men to serenade ladies at night as i believe they do in the southern countries of europe and sing all sorts of nonsensical songs to them
the young men may or may not be serious but no offence is meant and none is taken even by ladies of the highest rank who accept the whole thing as an english girl would a gracefullyturned compliment
availing himself of this custom good bethought him that he would serenade sorais whose private apartments together with those of her maidens were exactly opposite our own on the further side of a narrow courtyard which divided one section of the great palace from another
accordingly having armed himself with a native zither on which being an adept with the light guitar he had easily learned to strum he proceeded at midnightthe fashionable hour for this sort of caterwaulingto make night hideous with his amorous yells
i was fast asleep when they began but they soon woke me upfor good possesses a tremendous voice and has no notion of timeand i ran to my windowplace to see what was the matter
and there standing in the full moonlight in the courtyard i perceived good adorned with an enormous ostrich feather headdress and a flowing silken cloak which it is the right thing to wear upon these occasions and shouting out the abominable song which he and the old gentleman had evolved to a jerky jingling accompaniment
from the direction of the quarters of the maids of honour came a succession of faint sniggerings but the apartments of sorais herselfwhom i devoutly pitied if she happened to be therewere silent as the grave
there was absolutely no end to that awful song with its eternal i will kiss thee and at last neither i nor sir henry whom i had summoned to enjoy the sight could stand it any longer so remembering the dear old story i put my head to the window opening and shouted for heavens sake good dont go on talking about it but kiss her and lets all go to sleep that choked him off and we had no more serenading
the whole thing formed a laughable incident in a tragic business
how deeply thankful we ought to be that even the most serious matters have generally a silver lining about them in the shape of a joke if only people could see it
the sense of humour is a very valuable possession in life and ought to be cultivated in the board schoolsespecially in scotland
well the more sir henry held off the more sorais came on as is not uncommon in such cases till at last things got very queer indeed
evidently she was by some strange perversity of mind quite blinded to the true state of the case and i for one greatly dreaded the moment of her awakening
sorais was a dangerous woman to be mixed up with either with or without ones consent
at last the evil moment came as i saw it must come
one fine day good having gone out hawking sir henry and i were sitting quietly talking over the situation especially with reference to sorais when a court messenger arrived with a written note which we with some difficulty deciphered and which was to the effect that the queen sorais commanded the attendance of the lord incubu in her private apartments whither he would be conducted by the bearer
oh my word groaned sir henry
cant you go instead old fellow not if i know it i said with vigour
i had rather face a wounded elephant with a shotgun
take care of your own business my boy
if you will be so fascinating you must take the consequences
i would not be in your place for an empire you remind me of when i was going to be flogged at school and the other boys came to console me he said gloomily
what right has this queen to command my attendance i should like to know
i wont go but you must you are one of her officers and bound to obey her and she knows it
and after all it will soon be over thats just what they used to say he said again
i only hope she wont put a knife into me
i believe that she is quite capable of it and off he started very faintheartedly and no wonder
i sat and waited and at the end of about fortyfive minutes he returned looking a good deal worse than when he went
give me something to drink he said hoarsely
i got him a cup of wine and asked what was the matter
what is the matter
why if ever there was trouble theres trouble now
you know when i left you
well i was shown straight into sorais private chamber and a wonderful place it is and there she sat quite alone upon a silken couch at the end of the room playing gently upon that zither of hers
i stood before her and for a while she took no notice of me but kept on playing and singing a little and very sweet music it was
at last she looked up and smiled
so thou art come she said
i thought perchance thou hadst gone about the queen nylepthas business
thou art ever on her business and i doubt not a good servant and a true to this i merely bowed and said i was there to receive the queens word
ah yes i would talk with thee but be thou seated
it wearies me to look so high and she made room for me beside her on the couch placing herself with her back against the end so as to have a view of my face
it is not meet i said that i should make myself equal with the queen i said be seated was her answer so i sat down and she began to look at me with those dark eyes of hers
there she sat like an incarnate spirit of beauty hardly talking at all and when she did very low but all the while looking at me
there was a white flower in her black hair and i tried to keep my eyes on it and count the petals but it was of no use
at last whether it was her gaze or the perfume in her hair or what i do not know but i almost felt as though i was being mesmerized
at last she roused herself
incubu she said lovest thou power i replied that i supposed all men loved power of one sort or another
thou shalt have it she said
lovest thou wealth i said i liked wealth for what it brought
thou shalt have it she said
and lovest thou beauty to this i replied that i was very fond of statuary and architecture or something silly of that sort at which she frowned and there was a pause
by this time my nerves were on such a stretch that i was shaking like a leaf
i knew that something awful was going to happen but she held me under a kind of spell and i could not help myself
incubu she said at length wouldst thou be a king
listen wouldst thou be a king
behold stranger i am minded to make thee king of all zuvendis ay and husband of sorais of the night
nay peace and hear me
to no man among my people had i thus opened out my secret heart but thou art an outlander and therefore i speak without shame knowing all i have to offer and how hard it had been thee to ask
see a crown lies at thy feet my lord incubu and with that fortune a woman whom some have wished to woo
now mayst thou answer oh my chosen and soft shall thy words fall upon mine ears oh sorais i said i pray thee speak not thusyou see i had not time to pick and choose my wordsfor this thing cannot be
i am betrothed to thy sister nyleptha oh sorais and i love her and her alone next moment it struck me that i had said an awful thing and i looked up to see the results
when i spoke sorais face was hidden in her hands and as my words reached her she slowly raised it and i shrank back dismayed
it was ashy white and her eyes were flaming
she rose to her feet and seemed to be choking but the awful thing was that she was so quiet about it all
once she looked at a side table on which lay a dagger and from it to me as though she thought of killing me but she did not take it up
at last she spoke one word and one only go and i went and glad enough i was to get out of it and here i am
give me another cup of wine theres a good fellow and tell me what is to be done i shook my head for the affair was indeed serious
as one of the poets says hell hath no fury like a woman scorned more especially if the woman is a queen and a sorais and indeed i feared the very worst including imminent danger to ourselves
nyleptha had better be told of this at once i said and perhaps i had better tell her she might receive your account with suspicion who is captain of her guard tonight i went on
good very well then there will be no chance of her being got at
dont look surprised
i dont think that her sister would stick at that
i suppose one must tell good of what has happened oh i dont know said sir henry
it would hurt his feelings poor fellow
you see he takes a lively personal interest in sorais thats true and after all perhaps there is no need to tell him
he will find out the truth soon enough
now you mark my words sorais will throw in her lot with nasta who is sulking up in the north there and there will be such a war as has not been known in zuvendis for centuries
look there and i pointed to two court messengers who were speeding away from the door of sorais private apartments
now follow me and i ran up a stairway into an outlook tower that rose from the roof of our quarters taking the spyglass with me and looked out over the palace wall
the first thing we saw was one of the messengers speeding towards the temple bearing without any doubt the queens word to the high priest agon but for the other i searched in vain
presently however i spied a horseman riding furiously through the northern gate of the city and in him i recognized the other messenger
ah i said sorais is a woman of spirit
she is acting at once and will strike quick and hard
you have insulted her my boy and the blood will flow in rivers before the stain is washed away and yours with it if she can get hold of you
well im off to nyleptha
just you stop where you are old fellow and try to get your nerves straight again
youll need them all i can tell you unless i have observed human nature in the rough for fifty years for nothing and off i went accordingly
i gained audience of the queen without trouble
she was expecting curtis and was not best pleased to see my mahoganycoloured face instead
is there aught wrong with my lord macumazahn that he waits not upon me
say is he sick i said that he was well enough and then without further ado i plunged into my story and told it from beginning to end
oh what a rage she flew into
it was a sight to see her she looked so lovely
how darest thou come to me with such a tale she cried
it is a lie to say that my lord was making love to sorais my sister pardon me oh queen i answered i said that sorais was making love to thy lord spin me no spiders webs of words
is not the thing the same thing
the one giveth the other taketh but the gift passes and what matters it which is the most guilty
sorais
oh i hate hersorais is a queen and my sister
she had not stooped so low had he not shown the way
oh truly hath the poet said that man is like a snake whom to touch is poison and whom none can hold the remark oh queen is excellent but methinks thou hast misread the poet
nyleptha i went on thou knowest well that thy words are empty foolishness and that this is no time for folly how darest thou she broke in stamping her foot
hast my false lord sent thee to me to insult me also
who art thou stranger that thou shouldst speak to me the queen after this sort
how darest thou yea i dare
listen
the moments which thou dost waste in idle anger may well cost thee thy crown and all of us our lives
already sorais horsemen go forth and call to arms
in three days time nasta will rouse himself in his fastnesses like a lion in the evening and his growling will be heard throughout the north
the lady of the night sorais hath a sweet voice and she will not sing in vain
her banner will be borne from range to range and valley to valley and warriors will spring up in its track like dust beneath a whirlwind half the army will echo her warcry and in every town and hamlet of this wide land the priests will call out against the foreigner and will preach her cause as holy
i have spoken oh queen nyleptha was quite calm now her jealous anger had passed and putting off the character of a lovely headstrong lady with a rapidity and completeness that distinguished her she put on that of a queen and a woman of business
the transformation was sudden but entire
thy words are very wise macumazahn
forgive me my folly
ah what a queen i should be if only i had no heart
to be heartlessthat is to conquer all
passion is like the lightning it is beautiful and it links the earth to heaven but alas it blinds
and thou thinkest that my sister sorais would levy war upon me
so be it
she shall not prevail against me
i too have my friends and my retainers
there are many i say who will shout nyleptha when my pennon runs up on peak and pinnacle and the light of my beacon fires leaps tonight from crag to crag bearing the message of my war
i will break her strength and scatter her armies
eternal night shall be the portion of sorais of the night
give me that parchment and the ink
so
now summon the officer in the anteroom
he is a trusty man i did as i was bid
and the man a veteran and quietlooking gentleman of the guard named kara entered bowing low
take this parchment said nyleptha it is thy warrant and guard every place of in and outgoing in the apartments of my sister sorais the lady of the night and a queen of the zuvendi
let none come in and none go out or thy life shall pay the cost the man looked startled but he merely said the queens word be done and departed
then nyleptha sent a messenger to sir henry and presently he arrived looking uncommonly uncomfortable
i thought that another outburst was about to follow but wonderful are the ways of woman she said not a word about sorais and his supposed inconstancy greeting him with a friendly nod and stating simply that she required his advice upon high matters
all the same there was a look in her eye and a sort of suppressed energy in her manner towards him that makes me think that she had not forgotten the affair but was keeping it for a private occasion
just after curtis arrived the officer returned and reported that sorais was gone
the bird had flown to the temple stating that she was going as was sometimes the custom among zuvendi ladies of rank to spend the night in meditation before the altar
we looked at each other significantly
the blow had fallen very soon
then we set to work
generals who could be trusted were summoned from their quarters and as much of the state affairs as was thought desirable was told to each strict injunctions being given to them to get all their available force together
the same was done with such of the more powerful lords as nyleptha knew she could rely on several of whom left that very day for distant parts of the country to gather up their tribesmen and retainers
sealed orders were dispatched to the rulers of faroff cities and some twenty messengers were sent off before nightfall with instructions to ride early and late till they reached the distant chiefs to whom their letters were addressed also many spies were set to work
all the afternoon and evening we laboured assisted by some confidential scribes nyleptha showing an energy and resource of mind that astonished me and it was eight oclock before we got back to our quarters
here we heard from alphonse who was deeply aggrieved because our nonreturn had spoilt his dinner for he had turned cook again now that good had come back from his hawking and gone on duty
as instructions had already been given to the officer of the outer guard to double the sentries at the gate and as we had no reason to fear any immediate danger we did not think it worth while to hunt him up and tell him anything of what had passed which at best was under the peculiar circumstances of the case one of those tasks that one prefers to postpone so after swallowing our food we turned in to get some muchneeded rest
before we did so however it occurred to curtis to tell old umslopogaas to keep a lookout in the neighbourhood of nylepthas private apartments
umslopogaas was now well known about the place and by the queens order allowed to pass whither he would by the guards a permission of which he often availed himself by roaming about the palace during the still hours in a nocturnal fashion that he favoured and which is by no means uncommon amongst black men generally
his presence in the corridors would not therefore be likely to excite remark
without any comment the zulu took up his axe and departed and we also departed to bed
i seemed to have been asleep but a few minutes when i was awakened by a peculiar sensation of uneasiness
i felt that somebody was in the room and looking at me and instantly sat up to see to my surprise that it was already dawn and that there standing at the foot of my couch and looking peculiarly grim and gaunt in the grey light was umslopogaas himself
how long hast thou been there i asked testily for it is not pleasant to be aroused in such a fashion
mayhap the half of an hour macumazahn
i have a word for thee speak on i said now wide enough awake
as i was bid i went last night to the place of the white queen and hid myself behind a pillar in the second anteroom beyond which is the sleepingplace of the queen
bougwan good was in the first anteroom alone and outside the curtain of that room was a sentry but i had a mind to see if i could pass in unseen and i did gliding behind them both
there i waited for many hours when suddenly i perceived a dark figure coming secretly towards me
it was the figure of a woman and in her hand she held a dagger
behind that figure crept another unseen by the woman
it was bougwan following in her tracks
his shoes were off and for so fat a man he followed very well
the woman passed me and the starlight shone upon her face who was it i asked impatiently
the face was the face of the lady of the night and of a truth she is well named
i waited and bougwan passed me also
then i followed
so we went slowly and without a sound up the long chamber
first the woman then bougwan and then i and the woman saw not bougwan and bougwan saw not me
at last the lady of the night came to the curtains that shut off the sleeping place of the white queen and put out her left hand to part them
she passed through and so did bougwan and so did i
at the far end of the room is the bed of the queen and on it she lay very fast asleep
i could hear her breathe and see one white arm lying on the coverlid like a streak of snow on the dry grass
the lady of the night doubled herself thus and with the long knife lifted crept towards the bed
so straight did she gaze thereat that she never thought to look behind her
when she was quite close bougwan touched her on the arm and she caught her breath and turned and i saw the knife flash and heard it strike
well was it for bougwan that he had the skin of iron on him or he had been pierced
then for the first time he saw who the woman was and without a word he fell back astonished and unable to speak
she too was astonished and spoke not but suddenly she laid her finger on her lip thus and walked towards and through the curtain and with her went bougwan
so close did she pass to me that her dress touched me and i was nigh to slaying her as she went
in the first outer room she spoke to bougwan in a whisper and clasping her hands thus she pleaded with him but what she said i know not
and so they passed on to the second outer room she pleading and he shaking his head and saying nay nay nay
and it seemed to me that he was about to call the guard when she stopped talking and looked at him with great eyes and i saw that he was bewitched by her beauty
then she stretched out her hand and he kissed it whereon i gathered myself together to advance and take her seeing that now had bougwan become a woman and no longer knew the good from the evil when behold
she was gone gone i ejaculated
ay gone and there stood bougwan staring at the wall like one asleep and presently he went too and i waited a while and came away also art thou sure umslopogaas said i that thou hast not been a dreamer this night in reply he opened his left hand and produced about three inches of a blade of a dagger of the finest steel
if i be macumazahn behold what the dream left with me
the knife broke upon bougwans bosom and as i passed i picked this up in the sleepingplace of the white queen war
red war
telling umslopogaas to wait i tumbled into my clothes and went off with him to sir henrys room where the zulu repeated his story word for word
it was a sight to watch curtis face as he heard it
great heavens he said here have i been sleeping away while nyleptha was nearly murderedand all through me too
what a fiend that sorais must be
it would have served her well if umslopogaas had cut her down in the act ay said the zulu
fear not i should have slain her ere she struck
i was but waiting the moment i said nothing but i could not help thinking that many a thousand doomed lives would have been saved if he had meted out to sorais the fate she meant for her sister
and as the issue proved i was right
after he had told his tale umslopogaas went off unconcernedly to get his morning meal and sir henry and i fell to talking
at first he was very bitter against good who he said was no longer to be trusted having designedly allowed sorais to escape by some secret stair when it was his duty to have handed her over to justice
indeed he spoke in the most unmeasured terms on the matter
i let him run on awhile reflecting to myself how easy we find it to be hard on the weaknesses of others and how tender we are to our own
really my dear fellow i said at length one would never think to hear you talk that you were the man who had an interview with this same lady yesterday and found it rather difficult to resist her fascinations notwithstanding your ties to one of the loveliest and most loving women in the world
now suppose it was nyleptha who had tried to murder sorais and you had caught her and she had pleaded with you would you have been so very eager to hand her over to an open shame and to death by fire
just look at the matter through goods eyeglass for a minute before you denounce an old friend as a scoundrel he listened to this jobation submissively and then frankly acknowledged that he had spoken hardly
it is one of the best points in sir henrys character that he is always ready to admit it when he is in the wrong
but though i spoke up thus for good i was not blind to the fact that however natural his behaviour might be it was obvious that he was being involved in a very awkward and disgraceful complication
a foul and wicked murder had been attempted and he had let the murderess escape and thereby among other things allowed her to gain a complete ascendency over himself
in fact he was in a fair way to become her tooland no more dreadful fate can befall a man than to become the tool of an unscrupulous woman or indeed of any woman
there is but one end to it when he is broken or has served her purpose he is thrown awayturned out on the world to hunt for his lost selfrespect
whilst i was pondering thus and wondering what was to be donefor the whole subject was a thorny onei suddenly heard a great clamour in the courtyard outside and distinguished the voice of umslopogaas and alphonse the former cursing furiously and the latter yelling in terror
hurrying out to see what was the matter i was met by a ludicrous sight
the little frenchman was running up the courtyard at an extraordinary speed and after him sped umslopogaas like a great greyhound
just as i came out he caught him and lifting him right off his legs carried him some paces to a beautiful but very dense flowering shrub which bore a flower not unlike the gardenia but was covered with short thorns
next despite his howls and struggles he with one mighty thrust plunged poor alphonse head first into the bush so that nothing but the calves of his legs and heels remained in evidence
then satisfied with what he had done the zulu folded his arms and stood grimly contemplating the frenchmans kicks and listening to his yells which were awful
what art thou doing i said running up
wouldst thou kill the man
pull him out of the bush with a savage grunt he obeyed seizing the wretched alphonse by the ankle and with a jerk that must have nearly dislocated it tearing him out of the heart of the shrub
never did i see such a sight as he presented his clothes half torn off his back and bleeding as he was in every direction from the sharp thorns
there he lay and yelled and rolled and there was no getting anything out of him
at last however he got up and ensconcing himself behind me cursed old umslopogaas by every saint in the calendar vowing by the blood of his heroic grandfather that he would poison him and have his revenge
at last i got to the truth of the matter
it appeared that alphonse habitually cooked umslopogaass porridge which the latter ate for breakfast in the corner of the courtyard just as he would have done at home in zululand from a gourd and with a wooden spoon
now umslopogaas had like many zulus a great horror of fish which he considered a species of watersnake so alphonse who was as fond of playing tricks as a monkey and who was also a consummate cook determined to make him eat some
accordingly he grated up a quantity of white fish very finely and mixed it with the zulus porridge who swallowed it nearly all down in ignorance of what he was eating
but unfortunately for alphonse he could not restrain his joy at this sight and came capering and peering round till at last umslopogaas who was very clever in his way suspected something and after a careful examination of the remains of his porridge discovered the buffalo heifers trick and in revenge served him as i have said
indeed the little man was fortunate not to get a broken neck for his pains for as one would have thought he might have learnt from the episode of his display of axemanship that le monsieur noir was an ill person to play practical jokes upon
this incident was unimportant enough in itself but i narrate it because it led to serious consequences
as soon as he had stanched the bleeding from his scratches and washed himself alphonse went off still cursing to recover his temper a process which i knew from experience would take a very long time
when he had gone i gave umslopogaas a jobation and told him that i was ashamed of his behaviour
ah well macumazahn he said you must be gentle with me for here is not my place
i am weary of it weary to death of eating and drinking of sleeping and giving in marriage
i love not this soft life in stone houses that takes the heart out of a man and turns his strength to water and his flesh to fat
i love not the white robes and the delicate women the blowing of trumpets and the flying of hawks
when we fought the masai at the kraal yonder ah then life was worth the living but here is never a blow struck in anger and i begin to think i shall go the way of my fathers and lift inkosikaas no more and he held up the axe and gazed at it in sorrow
ah i said that is thy complaint is it
thou hast the bloodsickness hast thou
and the woodpecker wants a tree
and at thy age too
shame on thee
umslopogaas ay macumazahn mine is a red trade yet is it better and more honest than some
better is it to slay a man in fair fight than to suck out his hearts blood in buying and selling and usury after your white fashion
many a man have i slain yet is there never a one that i should fear to look in the face again ay many are there who once were friends and whom i should be right glad to snuff with
but there
there
thou hast thy ways and i mine each to his own people and his own place
the highveldt ox will die in the fat bush country and so is it with me macumazahn
i am rough i know it and when my blood is warm i know not what to do but yet wilt thou be sorry when the night swallows me and i am utterly lost in blackness for in thy heart thou lovest me my father macumazahn the fox though i be nought but a brokendown zulu wardoga chief for whom there is no room in his own kraal an outcast and a wanderer in strange places ay i love thee macumazahn for we have grown grey together and there is that between us that cannot be seen and yet is too strong for breaking and he took his snuffbox which was made of an old brass cartridge from the slit in his ear where he always carried it and handed it to me for me to help myself
i took the pinch of snuff with some emotion
it was quite true i was much attached to the bloodthirsty old ruffian
i do not know what was the charm of his character but it had a charm perhaps it was its fierce honesty and directness perhaps one admired his almost superhuman skill and strength or it may have been simply that he was so absolutely unique
frankly with all my experience of savages i never knew a man quite like him he was so wise and yet such a child with it all and though it seems laughable to say so like the hero of the yankee parody he had a tender heart
anyway i was very fond of him though i should never have thought of telling him so
ay old wolf i said thine is a strange love
thou wouldst split me to the chin if i stood in thy path tomorrow thou speakest truth macumazahn that would i if it came in the way of duty but i should love thee all the same when the blow had gone fairly home
is there any chance of some fighting here macumazahn he went on in an insinuating voice
methought that what i saw last night did show that the two great queens were vexed one with another
else had the lady of the night not brought that dagger with her i agreed with him that it showed that more or less pique and irritation existed between the ladies and told him how things stood and that they were quarrelling over incubu
ah is it so he exclaimed springing up in delight then will there be war as surely as the rivers rise in the rainswar to the end
women love the last blow as well as the last word and when they fight for love they are pitiless as a wounded buffalo
see thou macumazahn a woman will swim through blood to her desire and think nought of it
with these eyes have i seen it once and twice also
ah macumazahn we shall see this fine place of houses burning yet and hear the battle cries come ringing up the street
after all i have not wandered for nothing
can this folk fight think ye just then sir henry joined us and good arrived too from another direction looking very pale and holloweyed
the moment umslopogaas saw the latter he stopped his bloodthirsty talk and greeted him
ah bougwan he cried greeting to thee inkoos
thou art surely weary
didst thou hunt too much yesterday then without waiting for an answer he went on listen bougwan and i will tell thee a story it is about a woman therefore wilt thou hear it is it not so
there was a man and he had a brother and there was a woman who loved the mans brother and was beloved of the man
but the mans brother had a favourite wife and loved not the woman and he made a mock of her
then the woman being very cunning and fiercehearted for revenge took counsel with herself and said to the man i love thee and if thou wilt make war upon thy brother i will marry thee and he knew it was a lie yet because of his great love of the woman who was very fair did he listen to her words and made war
and when many people had been killed his brother sent to him saying why slayest thou me
what hurt have i done unto thee
from my youth up have i not loved thee
when thou wast little did i not nurture thee and have we not gone down to war together and divided the cattle girl by girl ox by ox and cow by cow
why slayest thou me my brother son of my own mother then the mans heart was heavy and he knew that his path was evil and he put aside the tempting of the woman and ceased to make war on his brother and lived at peace in the same kraal with him
and after a time the woman came to him and said i have lost the past i will be thy wife and in his heart he knew that it was a lie and that she thought the evil thing yet because of his love did he take her to wife
and the very night that they were wed when the man was plunged into a deep sleep did the woman arise and take his axe from his hand and creep into the hut of his brother and slay him in his rest
then did she slink back like a gorged lioness and place the thong of the red axe back upon his wrist and go her ways
and at the dawning the people came shouting lousta is slain in the night and they came unto the hut of the man and there he lay asleep and by him was the red axe
then did they remember the war and say lo
he hath of a surety slain his brother and they would have taken and killed him but he rose and fled swiftly and as he fleeted by he slew the woman
but death could not wipe out the evil she had done and on him rested the weight of all her sin
therefore is he an outcast and his name a scorn among his own people for on him and him only resteth the burden of her who betrayed
and therefore does he wander afar without a kraal and without an ox or a wife and therefore will he die afar like a stricken buck and his name be accursed from generation to generation in that the people say that he slew his brother lousta by treachery in the nighttime the old zulu paused and i saw that he was deeply agitated by his own story
presently he lifted his head which he had bowed to his breast and went on i was the man bougwan
ou
i was that man and now hark thou
even as i am so wilt thou bea tool a plaything an ox of burden to carry the evil deeds of another
listen
when thou didst creep after the lady of the night i was hard upon thy track
when she struck thee with the knife in the sleeping place of the white queen i was there also when thou didst let her slip away like a snake in the stones i saw thee and i knew that she had bewitched thee and that a true man had abandoned the truth and he who aforetime loved a straight path had taken a crooked way
forgive me my father if my words are sharp but out of a full heart are they spoken
see her no more so shalt thou go down with honour to the grave
else because of the beauty of a woman that weareth as a garment of fur shalt thou be even as i am and perchance with more cause
i have said throughout this long and eloquent address good had been perfectly silent but when the tale began to shape itself so aptly to his own case he coloured up and when he learnt that what had passed between him and sorais had been overseen he was evidently much distressed
and now when at last he spoke it was in a tone of humility quite foreign to him
i must say he said with a bitter little laugh that i scarcely thought that i should live to be taught my duty by a zulu but it just shows what we can come to
i wonder if you fellows can understand how humiliated i feel and the bitterest part of it is that i deserve it all
of course i should have handed sorais over to the guard but i could not and that is a fact
i let her go and i promised to say nothing more is the shame to me
she told me that if i would side with her she would marry me and make me king of this country but thank goodness i did find the heart to say that even to marry her i could not desert my friends
and now you can do what you like i deserve it all
all i have to say is that i hope that you may never love a woman with all your heart and then be so sorely tempted of her and he turned to go
look here old fellow said sir henry just stop a minute
i have a little tale to tell you too and he went on to narrate what had taken place on the previous day between sorais and himself
this was a finishing stroke to poor good
it is not pleasant to any man to learn that he has been made a tool of but when the circumstances are as peculiarly atrocious as in the present case it is about as bitter a pill as anybody can be called on to swallow
do you know he said i think that between you you fellows have about worked a cure and he turned and walked away and i for one felt very sorry for him
ah if the moths would always carefully avoid the candle how few burnt wings there would be
that day was a court day when the queens sat in the great hall and received petitions discussed laws money grants and so forth and thither we adjourned shortly afterwards
on our way we were joined by good who was looking exceedingly depressed
when we got into the hall nyleptha was already on her throne and proceeding with business as usual surrounded by councillors courtiers lawyers priests and an unusually strong guard
it was however easy to see from the air of excitement and expectation on the faces of everybody present that nobody was paying much attention to ordinary affairs the fact being that the knowledge that civil war was imminent had now got abroad
we saluted nyleptha and took our accustomed places and for a little while things went on as usual when suddenly the trumpets began to call outside the palace and from the great crowd that was gathered there in anticipation of some unusual event there rose a roar of sorais
sorais then came the roll of many chariot wheels and presently the great curtains at the end of the hall were drawn wide and through them entered the lady of the night herself
nor did she come alone
preceding her was agon the high priest arrayed in his most gorgeous vestments and on either side were other priests
the reason for their presence was obviouscoming with them it would have been sacrilege to attempt to detain her
behind her were a number of the great lords and behind them a small body of picked guards
a glance at sorais herself was enough to show that her mission was of no peaceful kind for in place of her gold embroidered kaf she wore a shining tunic formed of golden scales and on her head a little golden helmet
in her hand too she bore a toy spear beautifully made and fashioned of solid silver
up the hall she came looking like a lioness in her conscious pride and beauty and as she came the spectators fell back bowing and made a path for her
by the sacred stone she halted and laying her hand on it she cried out with a loud voice to nyleptha on the throne hail oh queen all hail my royal sister answered nyleptha
draw thou near
fear not i give thee safe conduct sorais answered with a haughty look and swept on up the hall till she stood right before the thrones
a boon oh queen she cried again
speak on my sister what is there that i can give thee who hath half our kingdom thou canst tell me a true wordme and the people of zuvendis
art thou or art thou not about to take this foreign wolf and she pointed to sir henry with her toy spear to be a husband to thee and share thy bed and throne curtis winced at this and turning towards sorais said to her in a low voice methinks that yesterday thou hadst other names than wolf to call me by oh queen and i saw her bite her lips as like a danger flag the blood flamed red upon her face
as for nyleptha who is nothing if not original she seeing that the thing was out and that there was nothing further to be gained by concealment answered the question in a novel and effectual manner inspired thereto as i firmly believe by coquetry and a desire to triumph over her rival
up she rose and descending from the throne swept in all the glory of her royal grace on to where her lover stood
there she stopped and untwined the golden snake that was wound around her arm
then she bade him kneel and he dropped on one knee on the marble before her and next taking the golden snake with both her hands she bent the pure soft metal round his neck and when it was fast deliberately kissed him on the brow and called him her dear lord
thou seest she said when the excited murmur of the spectators had died away addressing her sister as sir henry rose to his feet i have put my collar round the wolfs neck and behold
he shall be my watchdog and that is my answer to thee queen sorais my sister and to those with thee
fear not she went on smiling sweetly on her lover and pointing to the golden snake she had twined round his massive throat if my yoke be heavy yet is it of pure gold and it shall not gall thee then turning to the audience she continued in a clear proud tone ay lady of the night lords priests and people here gathered together by this sign do i take the foreigner to husband even here in the face of you all
what am i a queen and yet not free to choose the man whom i will love
then should i be lower than the meanest girl in all my provinces
nay he hath won my heart and with it goes my hand and throne and all i haveay had he been a beggar instead of a great lord fairer and stronger than any here and having more wisdom and knowledge of strange things i had given him all how much more so being what he is and she took his hand and gazed proudly on him and holding it stood there boldly facing the people
and such was her sweetness and the power and dignity of her person and so beautiful she looked standing hand in hand there at her lovers side so sure of him and of herself and so ready to risk all things and endure all things for him that most of those who saw the sight which i am sure no one of them will ever forget caught the fire from her eyes and the happy colour from her blushing face and cheered her like wild things
it was a bold stroke for her to make and it appealed to the imagination but human nature in zuvendis as elsewhere loves that which is bold and not afraid to break a rule and is moreover peculiarly susceptible to appeals to its poetical side
and so the people cheered till the roof rang but sorais of the night stood there with downcast eyes for she could not bear to see her sisters triumph which robbed her of the man whom she had hoped to win and in the awfulness of her jealous anger she trembled and turned white like an aspen in the wind
i think i have said somewhere of her that she reminded me of the sea on a calm day having the same aspect of sleeping power about her
well it was all awake now and like the face of the furious ocean it awed and yet fascinated me
a really handsome woman in a royal rage is always a beautiful sight but such beauty and such a rage i never saw combined before and i can only say that the effect produced was well worthy of the two
she lifted her white face the teeth set and there were purple rings beneath her glowing eyes
thrice she tried to speak and thrice she failed but at last her voice came
raising her silver spear she shook it and the light gleamed from it and from the golden scales of her cuirass
and thinkest thou nyleptha she said in notes which pealed through the great hall like a clarion thinkest thou that i sorais a queen of the zuvendi will brook that this base outlander shall sit upon my fathers throne and rear up halfbreeds to fill the place of the great house of the stairway
never
never
while there is life in my bosom and a man to follow me and a spear to strike with
who is on my side
who
now hand thou over this foreign wolf and those who came hither to prey with him to the doom of fire for have they not committed the deadly sin against the sun
or nyleptha i give thee warred war
ay i say to thee that the path of thy passion shall be marked out by the blazing of thy towns and watered with the blood of those who cleave to thee
on thy head rest the burden of the deed and in thy ears ring the groans of the dying and the cries of the widows and those who are left fatherless for ever and for ever
i tell thee i will tear thee nyleptha the white queen from thy throne and that thou shalt be hurleday hurled even from the topmost stair of the great way to the foot thereof in that thou hast covered the name of the house of him who built it with black shame
and i tell ye strangersall save bougwan whom because thou didst do me a service i will save alive if thou wilt leave these men and follow me here poor good shook his head vigorously and ejaculated cant be done in englishthat i will wrap you in sheets of gold and hang you yet alive in chains from the four golden trumpets of the four angels that fly east and west and north and south from the giddiest pinnacles of the temple so that ye may be a token and a warning to the land
and as for thee incubu thou shalt die in yet another fashion that i will not tell thee now she ceased panting for breath for her passion shook her like a storm and a murmur partly of horror and partly of admiration ran through the hall
then nyleptha answered calmly and with dignity ill would it become my place and dignity oh sister so to speak as thou hast spoken and so to threat as thou hast threatened
yet if thou wilt make war then will i strive to bear up against thee for if my hand seem soft yet shalt thou find it of iron when it grips thine armies by the throat
sorais i fear thee not
i weep for that which thou wilt bring upon our people and on thyself but for myself i sayi fear thee not
yet thou who but yesterday didst strive to win my lover and my lord from me whom today thou dost call a foreign wolf to be thy lover and thy lord here there was an immense sensation in the hall thou who but last night as i have learnt but since thou didst enter here didst creep like a snake into my sleepingplaceay even by a secret way and wouldst have foully murdered me thy sister as i lay asleep it is false it is false rang out agons and a score of other voices
it is not false said i producing the broken point of the dagger and holding it up
where is the haft from which this flew oh sorais it is not false cried good determined at last to act like a loyal man
i took the lady of the night by the white queens bed and on my breast the dagger broke who is on my side cried sorais shaking her silver spear for she saw that public sympathy was turning against her
what bougwan thou comest not she said addressing good who was standing close to her in a low concentrated voice
thou palesouled fool for a reward thou shalt eat out thy heart with love of me and not be satisfied and thou mightest have been my husband and a king
at least i hold thee in chains that cannot be broken
war
war
war she cried
here with my hand upon the sacred stone that shall endure so runs the prophecy till the zuvendi set their necks beneath an alien yoke i declare war to the end
who follows sorais of the night to victory and honour instantly the whole concourse began to break up in indescribable confusion
many present hastened to throw in their lot with the lady of the night but some came from her following to us
amongst the former was an under officer of nylepthas own guard who suddenly turned and made a run for the doorway through which sorais people were already passing
umslopogaas who was present and had taken the whole scene in seeing with admirable presence of mind that if this soldier got away others would follow his example seized the man who drew his sword and struck at him
thereon the zulu sprang back with a wild shout and avoiding the sword cuts began to peck at his foe with his terrible axe till in a few seconds the mans fate overtook him and he fell with a clash heavily and quite dead upon the marble floor
this was the first blood spilt in the war
shut the gates i shouted thinking that we might perhaps catch sorais so and not being troubled with the idea of committing sacrilege
but the order came too late her guards were already passing through them and in another minute the streets echoed with the furious galloping of horses and the rolling of her chariots
so drawing half the people after her sorais was soon passing like a whirlwind through the frowning city on her road to her headquarters at marstuna a fortress situated a hundred and thirty miles to the north of milosis
and after that the city was alive with the endless tramp of regiments and preparations for the gathering war and old umslopogaas once more began to sit in the sunshine and go through a show of sharpening inkosikaass razor edge
a strange wedding one person however did not succeed in getting out in time before the gates were shut and that was the high priest agon who as we had every reason to believe was sorais great ally and the heart and soul of her party
this cunning and ferocious old man had not forgiven us for those hippopotami or rather that was what he said
what he meant was that he would never brook the introduction of our wider ways of thought and foreign learning and influence while there was a possibility of stamping us out
also he knew that we possessed a different system of religion and no doubt was in daily terror of our attempting to introduce it into zuvendis
one day he asked me if we had any religion in our country and i told him that so far as i could remember we had ninetyfive different ones
you might have knocked him down with a feather and really it is difficult not to pity a high priest of a wellestablished cult who is haunted by the possible approach of one or all of ninetyfive new religions
when we knew that agon was caught nyleptha sir henry and i discussed what was to be done with him
i was for closely incarcerating him but nyleptha shook her head saying that it would produce a disastrous effect throughout the country
ah she added with a stamp of her foot if i win and am once really queen i will break the power of those priests with their rites and revels and dark secret ways i only wished that old agon could have heard her it would have frightened him
well said sir henry if we are not to imprison him i suppose that we may as well let him go
he is of no use here nyleptha looked at him in a curious sort of way and said in a dry little voice thinkest thou so my lord eh said curtis
no i do not see what is the use of keeping him she said nothing but continued looking at him in a way that was as shy as it was sweet
then at last he understood
forgive me nyleptha he said rather tremulously
dost thou mean that thou wilt marry me even now nay i know not let my lord say was her rapid answer but if my lord wills the priest is there and the altar is therepointing to the entrance to a private chapeland am i not ready to do the will of my lord
listen oh my lord
in eight days or less thou must leave me and go down to war for thou shalt lead my armies and in warmen sometimes fall and so i would for a little space have had thee all my own if only for memorys sake and the tears overflowed her lovely eyes and rolled down her face like heavy drops of dew down the red heart of a rose
mayhap too she went on i shall lose my crown and with my crown my life and thine also
sorais is very strong and very bitter and if she prevails she will not spare
who can read the future
happiness is the worlds white bird that alights seldom and flies fast and far till one day he is lost in the clouds
therefore should we hold him fast if by any chance he rests for a little space upon our hand
it is not wise to neglect the present for the future for who knows what the future will be incubu
let us pluck our flowers while the dew is on them for when the sun is up they wither and on the morrow will others bloom that we shall never see and she lifted her sweet face to him and smiled into his eyes and once more i felt a curious pang of jealousy and turned and went away
they never took much notice of whether i was there or not thinking i suppose that i was an old fool and that it did not matter one way or the other and really i believe that they were right
so i went back to our quarters and ruminated over things in general and watched old umslopogaas whetting his axe outside the window as a vulture whets his beak beside a dying ox
and in about an hours time sir henry came tearing over looking very radiant and wildly excited and found good and myself and even umslopogaas and asked us if we should like to assist at a real wedding
of course we said yes and off we went to the chapel where we found agon looking as sulky as any high priest possibly could and no wonder
it appeared that he and nyleptha had a slight difference of opinion about the coming ceremony
he had flatly refused to celebrate it or to allow any of his priests to do so whereupon nyleptha became very angry and told him that she as queen was head of the church and meant to be obeyed
indeed she played the part of a zuvendi henry the eighth to perfection and insisted that if she wanted to be married she would be married and that he should marry her
in zuvendis members of the royal house can only be married by the high priest or a formally appointed deputya
q
he still refused to go through the ceremony so she clinched her argument thus well i cannot execute a high priest because there is an absurd prejudice against it and i cannot imprison him because all his subordinates would raise a crying that would bring the stars down on zuvendis and crush it but i can leave him to contemplate the altar of the sun without anything to eat because that is his natural vocation and if thou wilt not marry me o agon
thou shalt be placed before the altar yonder with nought but a little water till such time as thou hast reconsidered the matter now as it happened agon had been hurried away that morning without his breakfast and was already exceedingly hungry so he presently modified his views and consented to marry them saying at the same time that he washed his hands of all responsibility in the matter
so it chanced that presently attended only by two of her favourite maidens came the queen nyleptha with happy blushing face and downcast eyes dressed in pure white without embroidery of any sort as seems to be the fashion on these occasions in most countries of the world
she did not wear a single ornament even her gold circlets were removed and i thought that if possible she looked more lovely than ever without them as really superbly beautiful women do
she came curtseyed low to sir henry and then took his hand and led him up before the altar and after a little pause in a slow clear voice uttered the following words which are customary in zuvendis if the bride desires and the man consents thou dost swear by the sun that thou wilt take no other woman to wife unless i lay my hand upon her and bid her come i swear it answered sir henry adding in english one is quite enough for me then agon who had been sulking in a corner near the altar came forward and gabbled off something into his beard at such a rate that i could not follow it but it appeared to be an invocation to the sun to bless the union and make it fruitful
i observed that nyleptha listened very closely to every word and afterwards discovered that she was afraid lest agon should play her a trick and by going through the invocations backwards divorce them instead of marry them
at the end of the invocations they were asked as in our service if they took each other for husband and wife and on their assenting they kissed each other before the altar and the service was over so far as their rites were concerned
but it seemed to me that there was yet something wanting and so i produced a prayerbook which has together with the ingoldsby legends that i often read when i lie awake at night accompanied me in all my later wanderings
i gave it to my poor boy harry years ago and after his death i found it among his things and took it back again
curtis i said i am not a clergyman and i do not know if what i am going to propose is allowablei know it is not legalbut if you and the queen have no objection i should like to read the english marriage service over you
it is a solemn step which you are taking and i think that you ought so far as circumstances will allow to give it the sanction of your own religion i have thought of that he said and i wish you would
i do not feel half married yet nyleptha raised no objection fully understanding that her husband wished to celebrate the marriage according to the rites prevailing in his own country and so i set to work and read the service from dearly beloved to amazement as well as i could and when i came to i henry take thee nyleptha i translated and also i nyleptha take thee henry which she repeated after me very well
then sir henry took a plain gold ring from his little finger and placed it on hers and so on to the end
the ring had been curtis mothers weddingring and i could not help thinking how astonished the dear old yorkshire lady would have been if she could have foreseen that her weddingring was to serve a similar purpose for nyleptha a queen of the zuvendi
as for agon he was with difficulty kept calm while this second ceremony was going on for he at once understood that it was religious in its nature and doubtless bethought him of the ninetyfive new faiths which loomed so ominously in his eyes
indeed he at once set me down as a rival high priest and hated me accordingly
however in the end off he went positively bristling with indignation and i knew that we might look out for danger from his direction
and off went good and i and old umslopogaas also leaving the happy pair to themselves and very low we all felt
marriages are supposed to be cheerful things but my experience is that they are very much the reverse to everybody except perhaps the two people chiefly interested
they mean the breakingup of so many old ties as well as the undertaking of so many new ones and there is always something sad about the passing away of the old order
now to take this case for instance sir henry curtis is the best and kindest fellow and friend in the world but he has never been quite the same since that little scene in the chapel
it is always nyleptha this and nyleptha thatnyleptha in short from morning till night in one way or another either expressed or understood
and as for the old friendswell of course they have taken the place that old friends ought to take and which ladies are as a rule very careful to see they do take when a man marries and that is the second place
yes he would be angry if anybody said so but it is a fact for all that
he is not quite the same and nyleptha is very sweet and very charming but i think that she likes him to understand that she has married him and not quatermain good and co
but there
what is the use of grumbling
it is all very right and proper as any married lady would have no difficulty in explaining and i am a selfish jealous old man though i hope i never show it
so good and i went and ate in silence and then indulged in an extra fine flagon of old zuvendian to keep our spirits up and presently one of our attendants came and told a story that gave us something to think about
it may perhaps be remembered that after his quarrel with umslopogaas alphonse had gone off in an exceedingly ill temper to sulk over his scratches
well it appears that he walked right past the temple to the sun down the wide road on the further side of the slope it crowns and thence on into the beautiful park or pleasure gardens which are laid out just beyond the outer wall
after wandering about there for a little he started to return but was met near the outer gate by sorais train of chariots which were galloping furiously along the great northern road
when she caught sight of alphonse sorais halted her train and called to him
on approaching he was instantly seized and dragged into one of the chariots and carried off crying out loudly as our informant said and as from my general knowledge of him i can well believe
at first i was much puzzled to know what object sorais could have had in carrying off the poor little frenchman
she could hardly stoop so low as to try to wreak her fury on one whom she knew was only a servant
at last however an idea occurred to me
we three were as i think i have said much revered by the people of zuvendis at large both because we were the first strangers they had ever seen and because we were supposed to be the possessors of almost supernatural wisdom
indeed though sorais cry against the foreign wolvesor to translate it more accurately foreign hyenaswas sure to go down very well with the nobles and the priests it was not as we learnt likely to be particularly effectual amongst the bulk of the population
the zuvendi people like the athenians of old are ever seeking for some new thing and just because we were so new our presence was on the whole acceptable to them
again sir henrys magnificent personal appearance made a deep impression upon a race who possess a greater love of beauty than any other i have ever been acquainted with
beauty may be prized in other countries but in zuvendis it is almost worshipped as indeed the national love of statuary shows
the people said openly in the marketplaces that there was not a man in the country to touch curtis in personal appearance as with the exception of sorais there was no woman who could compete with nyleptha and that therefore it was meet that they should marry and that he had been sent by the sun as a husband for their queen
now from all this it will be seen that the outcry against us was to a considerable extent fictitious and nobody knew it better than sorais herself
consequently it struck me that it might have occurred to her that down in the country and among the country people it would be better to place the reason of her conflict with her sister upon other and more general grounds than nylepthas marriage with the stranger
it would be easy in a land where there had been so many civil wars to rake out some old cry that would stir up the recollection of buried feuds and indeed she soon found an effectual one
this being so it was of great importance to her to have one of the strangers with her whom she could show to the common people as a great outlander who had been so struck by the justice of her cause that he had elected to leave his companions and follow her standard
this no doubt was the cause of her anxiety to get a hold of good whom she would have used till he ceased to be of service and then cast off
but good having drawn back she grasped at the opportunity of securing alphonse who was not unlike him in personal appearance though smaller no doubt with the object of showing him off in the cities and country as the great bougwan himself
i told good that i thought that that was her plan and his face was a sight to seehe was so horrified at the idea
what he said dress up that little wretch to represent me
why i shall have to get out of the country
my reputation will be ruined for ever i consoled him as well as i could but it is not pleasant to be personated all over a strange country by an arrant little coward and i can quite sympathize with his vexation
well that night good and i messed as i have said in solitary grandeur feeling very much as though we had just returned from burying a friend instead of marrying one and next morning the work began in good earnest
the messages and orders which had been despatched by nyleptha two days before now began to take effect and multitudes of armed men came pouring into the city
we saw as may be imagined but very little of nyleptha and not too much of curtis during those next few days but good and i sat daily with the council of generals and loyal lords drawing up plans of action arranging commissariat matters the distribution of commands and a hundred and one other things
men came in freely and all the day long the great roads leading to milosis were spotted with the banners of lords arriving from their distant places to rally round nyleptha
after the first few days it became clear that we should be able to take the field with about forty thousand infantry and twenty thousand cavalry a very respectable force considering how short was the time we had to collect it and that about half the regular army had elected to follow sorais
but if our force was large sorais was according to the reports brought in day by day by our spies much larger
she had taken up her headquarters at a very strong town called marstuna situated as i have said to the north of milosis and all the countryside was flocking to her standard
nasta had poured down from his highlands and was on his way to join her with no less than twentyfive thousand of his mountaineers the most terrible soldiers to face in all zuvendis
another mighty lord named belusha who lived in the great horsebreeding district had come in with twelve thousand cavalry and so on
indeed what between one thing and another it seemed certain that she would gather a fully armed host of nearly one hundred thousand men
and then came news that sorais was proposing to break up her camp and march on the frowning city itself desolating the country as she came
thereon arose the question whether it would be best to meet her at milosis or to go out and give her battle
when our opinion was asked upon the subject good and i unhesitatingly gave it in favour of an advance
if we were to shut ourselves up in the city and wait to be attacked it seemed to us that our inaction would be set down to fear
it is so important especially on an occasion of this sort when a very little will suffice to turn mens opinions one way or the other to be up and doing something
ardour for a cause will soon evaporate if the cause does not move but sits down to conquer
therefore we cast our vote for moving out and giving battle in the open instead of waiting till we were drawn from our walls like a badger from a hole
sir henrys opinion coincided with ours and so needless to say did that of nyleptha who like a flint was always ready to flash out fire
a great map of the country was brought and spread out before her
about thirty miles this side of marstuna where sorais lay and ninety odd miles from milosis the road ran over a neck of land some two and a half miles in width and flanked on either side by forestclad hills which without being lofty would if the road were blocked be quite impracticable for a great baggageladen army to cross
she looked earnestly at the map and then with a quickness of perception that in some women amounts almost to an instinct she laid her finger upon this neck of rising ground and turning to her husband said with a proud air of confidence and a toss of the golden head here shalt thou meet sorais armies
i know the spot here shalt thou meet them and drive them before thee like dust before the storm but curtis looked grave and said nothing
the battle of the pass it was on the third morning after this incident of the map that sir henry and i started
with the exception of a small guard all the great host had moved on the night before leaving the frowning city very silent and empty
indeed it was found impossible to leave any garrison with the exception of a personal guard for nyleptha and about a thousand men who from sickness or one cause or another were unable to proceed with the army but as milosis was practically impregnable and as our enemy was in front of and not behind us this did not so much matter
good and umslopogaas had gone on with the army but nyleptha accompanied sir henry and myself to the city gates riding a magnificent white horse called daylight which was supposed to be the fleetest and most enduring animal in zuvendis
her face bore traces of recent weeping but there were no tears in her eyes now indeed she was bearing up bravely against what must have been a bitter trial to her
at the gate she reined in her horse and bade us farewell
on the previous day she had reviewed and addressed the officers of the great army speaking to them such high eloquent words and expressing so complete a confidence in their valour and in their ultimate victory that she quite carried their hearts away and as she rode from rank to rank they cheered her till the ground shook
and now today the same mood seemed to be on her
fare thee well macumazahn she said
remember i trust to thy wits which are as a needle to a spearhandle compared to those of my people to save us from sorais
i know that thou wilt do thy duty i bowed and explained to her my horror of fighting and my fear lest i should lose my head at which she laughed gently and turned to curtis
fare thee well my lord she said
come back with victory and as a king or on thy soldiers spears alluding to the zuvendi custom of carrying dead officers on a framework of spears
sir henry said nothing but turned his horse to go perhaps he had a bit of a lump in his throat
one gets over it afterwards but these sort of partings are trying when one has only been married a week
here added nyleptha will i greet thee when ye return in triumph
and now my lords once more farewell then we rode on but when we had gone a hundred and fifty yards or so we turned and perceived her still sitting on her horse at the same spot and looking out after us beneath her hand and that was the last we saw of her
about a mile farther on however we heard galloping behind us and looking round saw a mounted soldier coming towards us leading nylepthas matchless steeddaylight
the queen sends the white stallion as a farewell gift to her lord incubu and bids me tell my lord that he is the fleetest and most enduring horse in all the land said the soldier bending to his saddlebow before us
at first sir henry did not want to take the horse saying that he was too good for such rough work but i persuaded him to do so thinking that nyleptha would be hurt if he did not
little did i guess at the time what service that noble horse would render in our sorest need
it is curious to look back and realise upon what trivial and apparently coincidental circumstances great events frequently turn as easily and naturally as a door on its hinges
well we took the horse and a beauty he was it was a perfect pleasure to see him move and curtis having sent back his greetings and thanks we proceeded on our journey
by midday we overtook the rearguard of the great army of which sir henry then formally took over the command
it was a heavy responsibility and it oppressed him very much but the queens injunctions on the point were such as did not admit of being trifled with
he was beginning to find out that greatness has its responsibilities as well as its glories
then we marched on without meeting with any opposition almost indeed without seeing anybody for the populations of the towns and villages along our route had for the most part fled fearing lest they should be caught between the two rival armies and ground to powder like grain between the upper and the nether stones
on the evening of the fourth day for the progress of so great a multitude was necessarily slow we camped two miles this side of the neck or ridge i have spoken of and our outposts brought us word that sorais with all her power was rolling down upon us and had pitched her camp that night ten miles the farther side of the neck
accordingly before dawn we sent forward fifteen hundred cavalry to seize the position
scarcely had they occupied it however before they were attacked by about as many of sorais horsemen and a very smart little cavalry fight ensued with a loss to us of about thirty men killed
on the advance of our supports however sorais force drew off carrying their dead and wounded with them
the main body of the army reached the neck about dinnertime and i must say that nylepthas judgment had not failed her it was an admirable place to give battle in especially to a superior force
the road ran down a mile or more through ground too broken to admit of the handling of any considerable force till it reached the crest of a great green wave of land that rolled down a gentle slope to the banks of a little stream and then rolled away again up a still gentler slope to the plain beyond the distance from the crest of the landwave down to the stream being a little over half a mile and from the stream up to the plain beyond a trifle less
the length of this wave of land at its highest point which corresponded exactly with the width of the neck of the land between the wooded hills was about two miles and a quarter and it was protected on either side by dense rocky bushclad ground that afforded a most valuable cover to the flanks of the army and rendered it almost impossible for them to be turned
it was on the hither slope of this neck of land that curtis encamped his army in the same formation that he had after consultation with the various generals good and myself determined that they should occupy in the great pitched battle which now appeared to be imminent
our force of sixty thousand men was roughly speaking divided as follows
in the centre was a dense body of twenty thousand footsoldiers armed with spears swords and hippopotamushide shields breast and back plates
these formed the chest of the army and were supported by five thousand foot and three thousand horse in reserve
on either side of this chest were stationed seven thousand horse arranged in deep majestic squadrons and beyond and on either side but slightly in front of them again were two bodies each numbering about seven thousand five hundred spearmen forming the right and left wings of the army and each supported by a contingent of some fifteen hundred cavalry
this makes in all sixty thousand men
the zuvendi people do not use bowsa
q curtis commanded in chief i was in command of the seven thousand horse between the chest and right wing which was commanded by good and the other battalions and squadrons were entrusted to zuvendis generals
scarcely had we taken up our positions before sorais vast army began to swarm on the opposite slope about a mile in front of us till the whole place seemed alive with the multitude of her spearpoints and the ground shook with the tramp of her battalions
it was evident that the spies had not exaggerated we were outnumbered by at least a third
at first we expected that sorais was going to attack us at once as the clouds of cavalry which hung upon her flanks executed some threatening demonstrations but she thought better of it and there was no fight that day
as for the formation of her great forces i cannot now describe it with accuracy and it would only serve to bewilder if i did but i may say generally that in its leading features it resembled our own only her reserve was much greater
opposite our right wing and forming sorais left wing was a great army of dark wildlooking men armed with sword and shield only which i was informed was composed of nastas twentyfive thousand savage hillsmen
my word good said i when i saw them you will catch it tomorrow when those gentlemen charge whereat good not unnaturally looked rather anxious
all day we watched and waited but nothing happened and at last night fell and a thousand watchfires twinkled brightly on the slopes to wane and die one by one like the stars they resembled
as the hours wore on the silence gradually gathered more deeply over the opposing hosts
it was a very wearying night for in addition to the endless things that had to be attended to there was our gnawing suspense to reckon with
the fray which tomorrow would witness would be so vast and the slaughter so awful that stout indeed must the heart have been that was not overwhelmed at the prospect
and when i thought of all that hung upon it i own i felt ill and it made me very sad to reflect that these mighty forces were gathered for destruction simply to gratify the jealous anger of a woman
this was the hidden power which was to send those dense masses of cavalry flashing like human thunderbolts across the plain and to roll together the fierce battalions as clouds when hurricane meets hurricane
it was a dreadful thought and set one wondering about the responsibilities of the great ones of the earth
deep into the night we sat with pale faces and heavy hearts and took counsel whilst the sentries tramped up and down down and up and the armed and plumed generals came and went grim and shadowlike
and so the time wore away till everything was ready for the coming slaughter and i lay down and thought and tried to get a little rest but could not sleep for fear of the morrowfor who could say what the morrow would bring forth
misery and death this was certain beyond that we knew not and i confess i was very much afraid
but as i realised then it is useless to question that eternal sphinx the future
from day to day she reads aloud the riddles of the yesterday of which the puzzled wordlings of all ages have not answered one nor ever will guess they never so wildly or cry they never so loud
and so at length i gave up wondering being forced humbly to leave the issue in the balancing hands of providence and the morrow
and at last up came the red sun and the huge camps awoke with a clash and a roar and gathered themselves together for battle
it was a beautiful and aweinspiring scene and old umslopogaas leaning on his axe contemplated it with grim delight
never have i seen the like macumazahn never he said
the battles of my people are as the play of children to what this will be
thinkest thou that they will fight it out ay i answered sadly to the death
content thyself woodpecker for once shalt thou peck thy fill time went on and still there was no sign of an attack
a force of cavalry crossed the brook indeed and rode slowly along our front evidently taking stock of our position and numbers
with this we did not attempt to interfere as our decision was to stand strictly on the defensive and not to waste a single man
the men breakfasted and stood to their arms and the hours wore on
about midday when the men were eating their dinner for we thought they would fight better on full stomachs a shout of sorais sorais arose like thunder from the enemys extreme right and taking the glass i was able to clearly distinguish the lady of the night herself surrounded by a glittering staff and riding slowly down the lines of her battalions
and as she went that mighty thundering shout rolled along before her like the rolling of ten thousand chariots or the roaring of the ocean when the gale turns suddenly and carries the noise of it to the listeners ears till the earth shook and the air was full of the majesty of sound
guessing that this was a prelude to the beginning of the battle we remained still and made ready
we had not long to wait
suddenly like flame from a cannons mouth out shot two great tonguelike forces of cavalry and came charging down the slope towards the little stream slowly at first but gathering speed as they came
before they got to the stream orders reached me from sir henry who evidently feared that the shock of such a charge if allowed to fall unbroken upon our infantry would be too much for them to send five thousand sabres to meet the force opposite to me at the moment when it began to mount the stiffest of the rise about four hundred yards from our lines
this i did remaining behind myself with the rest of my men
off went the five thousand horsemen drawn up in a wedgelike form and i must say that the general in command handled them very ably
starting at a hand gallop for the first three hundred yards he rode straight at the tip of the tongueshaped mass of cavalry which numbering so far as i could judge about eight thousand sabres was advancing to charge us
then he suddenly swerved to the right and put on the pace and i saw the great wedge curl round and before the foe could check himself and turn to meet it strike him about halfway down his length with a crashing rending sound like that of the breakingup of vast sheets of ice
in sank the great wedge into his heart and as it cut its way hundreds of horsemen were thrown up on either side of it just as the earth is thrown up by a ploughshare or more like still as the foaming water curls over beneath the bows of a rushing ship
in yet in vainly does the tongue twist its ends round in agony like an injured snake and strive to protect its centre still farther in by heaven
right through and so amid cheer after cheer from our watching thousands back again upon the severed ends beating them down driving them as a gale drives spray till at last amidst the rushing of hundreds of riderless horses the flashing of swords and the victorious clamour of their pursuers the great force crumples up like an empty glove then turns and gallops pellmell for safety back to its own lines
i do not think it reached them more than twothirds as strong as it went out ten minutes before
the lines which were now advancing to the attack opened and swallowed them up and my force returned having only suffered a loss of about five hundred mennot much i thought considering the fierceness of the struggle
i could also see that the opposing bodies of cavalry on our left wing were drawing back but how the fight went with them i do not quite know
it is as much as i can do to describe what took place immediately around me
by this time the dense masses of the enemys left composed almost entirely of nastas swordsmen were across the little stream and with alternate yells of nasta and sorais with dancing banners and gleaming swords were swarming up towards us like ants
again i received orders to try and check this movement and also the main advance against the chest of our army by means of cavalry charges and this i did to the best of my ability by continually sending squadrons of about a thousand sabres out against them
these squadrons did the enemy much damage and it was a glorious sight to see them flash down the hillside and bury themselves like a living knife in the heart of the foe
but also we lost many men for after the experience of a couple of these charges which had drawn a sort of bloody st andrews cross of dead and dying through the centre of nastas host our foes no longer attempted to offer an unyielding front to their irresistible weight but opened out to let the rush go through throwing themselves on the ground and hamstringing hundreds of horses as they passed
and so notwithstanding all that we could do the enemy drew nearer till at last he hurled himself upon goods force of seven thousand five hundred regulars who were drawn up to receive them in three strong squares
about the same time too an awful and heartshaking roar told me that the main battle had closed in on the centre and extreme left
i raised myself in my stirrups and looked down to my left so far as the eye could see there was a long dazzling shimmer of steel as the sun glanced upon falling sword and thrusting spear
to and fro swung the contending lines in that dread struggle now giving way now gaining a little in the mad yet ordered confusion of attack and defence
but it was as much as i could do to keep count of what was happening to our own wing and as for the moment the cavalry had fallen back under cover of goods three squares i had a fair view of this
nastas wild swordsmen were now breaking in red waves against the sullen rocklike squares
time after time did they yell out their warcries and hurl themselves furiously against the long triple ridges of spear points only to be rolled back as billows are when they meet the cliff
and so for four long hours the battle raged almost without a pause and at the end of that time if we had gained nothing we had lost nothing
two attempts to turn our left flank by forcing a way through the wood by which it was protected had been defeated and as yet nastas swordsmen had notwithstanding their desperate efforts entirely failed to break goods three squares though they had thinned their numbers by quite a third
as for the chest of the army where sir henry was with his staff and umslopogaas it had suffered dreadfully but it had held its own with honour and the same may be said of our left battle
at last the attacks slackened and sorais army drew back having i began to think had enough of it
on this point however i was soon undeceived for splitting up her cavalry into comparatively small squadrons she charged us furiously with them all along the line and then once more sullenly rolled her tens of thousands of sword and spearmen down upon our weakened squares and squadrons sorais herself directing the movement as fearless as a lioness heading the main attack
on they came like an avalanchei saw her golden helm gleaming in the vanour counter charges of cavalry entirely failing to check their forward sweep
now they had struck us and our centre bent in like a bow beneath the weight of their rushit parted and had not the ten thousand men in reserve charged down to its support it must have been utterly destroyed
as for goods three squares they were swept backwards like boats upon an incoming tide and the foremost one was burst into and lost half its remaining men
but the effort was too fierce and terrible to last
suddenly the battle came as it were to a turningpoint and for a minute or two stood still
then it began to move towards sorais camp
just then too nastas fierce and almost invincible highlanders either because they were disheartened by their losses or by way of a ruse fell back and the remains of goods gallant squares leaving the positions they had held for so many hours cheered wildly and rashly followed them down the slope whereon the swarms of swordsmen turned to envelop them and once more flung themselves upon them with a yell
taken thus on every side what remained of the first square was quickly destroyed and i perceived that the second in which i could see good himself mounted on a large horse was on the point of annihilation
a few more minutes and it was broken its streaming colours sank and i lost sight of good in the confused and hideous slaughter that ensued
presently however a creamcoloured horse with a snowwhite mane and tail burst from the ruins of the square and came rushing past me riderless and with wide streaming reins and in it i recognized the charger that good had been riding
then i hesitated no longer but taking with me half my effective cavalry force which now amounted to between four and five thousand men i commended myself to god and without waiting for orders i charged straight down upon nastas swordsmen
seeing me coming and being warned by the thunder of my horses hoofs the majority of them faced round and gave us a right warm welcome
not an inch would they yield in vain did we hack and trample them down as we ploughed a broad red furrow through their thousands they seemed to rearise by hundreds driving their terrible sharp swords into our horses or severing their hamstrings and then hacking the troopers who came to the ground with them almost into pieces
my horse was speedily killed under me but luckily i had a fresh one my own favourite a coalblack mare nyleptha had given me being held in reserve behind and on this i afterwards mounted
meanwhile i had to get along as best i could for i was pretty well lost sight of by my men in the mad confusion of the moment
my voice of course could not be heard in the midst of the clanging of steel and the shrieks of rage and agony
presently i found myself mixed up with the remnants of the square which had formed round its leader good and was fighting desperately for existence
i stumbled against somebody and glancing down caught sight of goods eyeglass
he had been beaten to his knee
over him was a great fellow swinging a heavy sword
somehow i managed to run the man through with the sime i had taken from the masai whose hand i had cut off but as i did so he dealt me a frightful blow on the left side and breast with the sword and though my chain shirt saved my life i felt that i was badly hurt
for a minute i fell on to my hands and knees among the dead and dying and turned sick and faint
when i came to again i saw that nastas spearmen or rather those of them who remained were retreating back across the stream and that good was there by me smiling sweetly
near go that he shouted but alls well that ends well i assented but i could not help feeling that it had not ended well for me
i was sorely hurt
just then we saw the smaller bodies of cavalry stationed on our extreme right and left and which were now reinforced by the three thousand sabres which we had held in reserve flash out like arrows from their posts and fall upon the disordered flanks of sorais forces and that charge decided the issue of the battle
in another minute or two the enemy was in slow and sullen retreat across the little stream where they once more reformed
then came another lull during which i managed to get a second horse and received my orders to advance from sir henry and then with one fierce deepthroated roar with a waving of banners and a wide flashing of steel the remains of our army took the offensive and began to sweep down slowly indeed but irresistibly from the positions they had so gallantly held all day
at last it was our turn to attack
on we moved over the piledup masses of dead and dying and were approaching the stream when suddenly i perceived an extraordinary sight
galloping wildly towards us his arms tightly clasped around his horses neck against which his blanched cheek was tightly pressed was a man arrayed in the full costume of a zuvendi general but in whom as he came nearer i recognized none other than our lost alphonse
it was impossible even then to mistake those curling mustachios
in a minute he was tearing through our ranks and narrowly escaped being cut down till at last somebody caught his horses bridle and he was brought to me just as a momentary halt occurred in our advance to allow what remained of our shattered squares to form into line
ah monsieur he gasped out in a voice that was nearly inarticulate with fright grace to the sky it is you
ah what i have endured
but you win monsieur you win they fly the lches
but listen monsieuri forget it is no good the queen is to be murdered tomorrow at the first light in the palace of milosis her guards will leave their posts and the priests are going to kill her
ah yes
they little thought it but i was ensconced beneath a banner and i heard it all what i said horrorstruck what do you mean what i say monsieur that devil of a nasta he went last night to settle the affair with the archbishop agon
the guard will leave open the little gate leading from the great stair and go away and nasta and agons priests will come in and kill her
themselves they would not kill her come with me i said and shouting to the staffofficer next to me to take over the command i snatched his bridle and galloped as hard as i could for the spot between a quarter and half a mile off where i saw the royal pennon flying and where i knew that i should find curtis if he were still alive
on we tore our horses clearing heaps of dead and dying men and splashing through pools of blood on past the long broken lines of spearmen to where mounted on the white stallion nyleptha had sent to him as a parting gift i saw sir henrys form towering above the generals who surrounded him
just as we reached him the advance began again
a bloody cloth was bound around his head but i saw that his eye was as bright and keen as ever
beside him was old umslopogaas his axe red with blood but looking quite fresh and uninjured
whats wrong quatermain he shouted
everything
there is a plot to murder the queen tomorrow at dawn
alphonse here who has just escaped from sorais has overheard it all and i rapidly repeated to him what the frenchman had told me
curtis face turned deadly pale and his jaw dropped
at dawn he gasped and it is now sunset it dawns before four and we are nearly a hundred miles offnine hours at the outside
what is to be done an idea entered into my head
is that horse of yours fresh i said
yes i have only just got on to himwhen my last was killed and he has been fed so is mine
get off him and let umslopogaas mount he can ride well
we will be at milosis before dawn or if we are notwell we cannot help it
no no it is impossible for you to leave now
you would be seen and it would turn the fate of the battle
it is not half won yet
the soldiers would think you were making a bolt of it
quick now in a moment he was down and at my bidding umslopogaas sprang into the empty saddle
now farewell i said
send a thousand horsemen with remounts after us in an hour if possible
stay despatch a general to the left wing to take over the command and explain my absence you will do your best to save her quatermain he said in a broken voice
ay that i will
go on you are being left behind he cast one glance at us and accompanied by his staff galloped off to join the advance which by this time was fording the little brook that now ran red with the blood of the fallen
as for umslopogaas and myself we left that dreadful field as arrows leave a bow and in a few minutes had passed right out of the sight of slaughter the smell of blood and the turmoil and shouting which only came to our ears as a faint faroff roaring like the sound of distant breakers
away
away
at the top of the rise we halted for a second to breathe our horses and turning glanced at the battle beneath us which illumined as it was by the fierce rays of the sinking sun staining the whole scene red looked from where we were more like some wild titanic picture than an actual handtohand combat
the distinguishing scenic effect from that distance was the countless distinct flashes of light reflected from the swords and spears otherwise the panorama was not so grand as might have been expected
the great green lap of sward in which the struggle was being fought out the bold round outline of the hills behind and the wide sweep of the plain beyond seemed to dwarf it and what was tremendous enough when one was in it grew insignificant when viewed from the distance
but is it not thus with all the affairs and doings of our race about which we blow the loud trumpet and make such a fuss and worry
how utterly antlike and morally and physically insignificant must they seem to the calm eyes that watch them from the arching depths above
we win the day macumazahn said old umslopogaas taking in the whole situation with a glance of his practised eye
look the lady of the nights forces give on every side there is no stiffness left in them they bend like hot iron they are fighting with but half a heart
but alas
the battle will in a manner be drawn for the darkness gathers and the regiments will not be able to follow and slayand he shook his head sadly
but he added i do not think that they will fight again
we have fed them with too strong a meat
ah
it is well to have lived
at last i have seen a fight worth seeing by this time we were on our way again and as we went side by side i told him what our mission was and how that if it failed all the lives that had been lost that day would have been lost in vain
ah he said nigh on a hundred miles and no horses but these and to be there before the dawn
wellaway
away
man can but try macumazahn and mayhap we shall be there in time to split that old witchfinders agons skull for him
once he wanted to burn us the old rainmaker did he
and now he would set a snare for my mother nyleptha would he
good
so sure as my name is the name of the woodpecker so surely be my mother alive or dead will i split him to the beard
ay by tchakas head i swear it and he shook inkosikaas as he galloped
by now the darkness was closing in but fortunately there would be a moon later and the road was good
on we sped through the twilight the two splendid horses we bestrode had got their wind by this and were sweeping along with a wide steady stride that neither failed nor varied for mile upon mile
down the side of slopes we galloped across wide vales that stretched to the foot of faroff hills
nearer and nearer grew the blue hills now we were travelling up their steeps and now we were over and passing towards others that sprang up like visions in the far faint distance beyond
on never pausing or drawing rein through the perfect quiet of the night that was set like a song to the falling music of our horses hoofs on past deserted villages where only some forgotten starving dog howled a melancholy welcome on past lonely moated dwellings on through the white patchy moonlight that lay coldly upon the wide bosom of the earth as though there was no warmth in it on knee to knee for hour after hour
we spake not but bent us forward on the necks of those two glorious horses and listened to their deep longdrawn breaths as they filled their great lungs and to the regular unfaltering ring of their round hoofs
grim and black indeed did old umslopogaas look beside me mounted upon the great white horse like death in the revelation of st john as now and again lifting his fierce set face he gazed out along the road and pointed with his axe towards some distant rise or house
and so on still on without break or pause for hour after hour
at last i felt that even the splendid animal that i rode was beginning to give out
i looked at my watch it was nearly midnight and we were considerably more than half way
on the top of a rise was a little spring which i remembered because i had slept by it a few nights before and here i motioned to umslopogaas to pull up having determined to give the horses and ourselves ten minutes to breathe in
he did so and we dismountedthat is to say umslopogaas did and then helped me off for what with fatigue stiffness and the pain of my wound i could not do so for myself and then the gallant horses stood panting there resting first one leg and then another while the sweat fell drip drip from them and the steam rose and hung in pale clouds in the still night air
leaving umslopogaas to hold the horses i hobbled to the spring and drank deep of its sweet waters
i had had nothing but a single mouthful of wine since midday when the battle began and i was parched up though my fatigue was too great to allow me to feel hungry
then having laved my fevered head and hands i returned and the zulu went and drank
next we allowed the horses to take a couple of mouthfuls eachno more and oh what a struggle we had to get the poor beasts away from the water
there were yet two minutes and i employed it in hobbling up and down to try and relieve my stiffness and in inspecting the condition of the horses
my mare gallant animal though she was was evidently much distressed she hung her head and her eye looked sick and dull but daylight nylepthas glorious horsewho if he is served aright should like the steeds who saved great rameses in his need feed for the rest of his days out of a golden mangerwas still comparatively speaking fresh notwithstanding the fact that he had had by far the heavier weight to carry
he was tucked up indeed and his legs were weary but his eye was bright and clear and he held his shapely head up and gazed out into the darkness round him in a way that seemed to say that whoever failed he was good for those fiveandforty miles that yet lay between us and milosis
then umslopogaas helped me into the saddle andvigorous old savage that he wasvaulted into his own without touching a stirrup and we were off once more slowly at first till the horses got into their stride and then more swiftly
so we passed over another ten miles and then came a long weary rise of some six or seven miles and three times did my poor black mare nearly come to the ground with me
but on the top she seemed to gather herself together and rattled down the slope with long convulsive strides breathing in gasps
we did that three or four miles more swiftly than any since we had started on our wild ride but i felt it to be a last effort and i was right
suddenly my poor horse took the bit between her teeth and bolted furiously along a stretch of level ground for some three or four hundred yards and then with two or three jerky strides pulled herself up and fell with a crash right on to her head i rolling myself free as she did so
as i struggled to my feet the brave beast raised her head and looked at me with piteous bloodshot eyes and then her head dropped with a groan and she was dead
her heart was broken
umslopogaas pulled up beside the carcase and i looked at him in dismay
there were still more than twenty miles to do by dawn and how were we to do it with one horse
it seemed hopeless but i had forgotten the old zulus extraordinary running powers
without a single word he sprang from the saddle and began to hoist me into it
what wilt thou do i asked
run he answered seizing my stirrupleather
then off we went again almost as fast as before and oh the relief it was to me to get that change of horses
anybody who has ever ridden against time will know what it meant
daylight sped along at a long stretching handgallop giving the gaunt zulu a lift at every stride
it was a wonderful thing to see old umslopogaas run mile after mile his lips slightly parted and his nostrils agape like the horses
every five miles or so we stopped for a few minutes to let him get his breath and then flew on again
canst thou go farther i said at the third of these stoppages or shall i leave thee to follow me he pointed with his axe to a dim mass before us
it was the temple of the sun now not more than five miles away
i reach it or i die he gasped
oh that last five miles
the skin was rubbed from the inside of my legs and every movement of my horse gave me anguish
nor was that all
i was exhausted with toil want of food and sleep and also suffering very much from the blow i had received on my left side it seemed as though a piece of bone or something was slowly piercing into my lung
poor daylight too was pretty nearly finished and no wonder
but there was a smell of dawn in the air and we might not stay better that all three of us should die upon the road than that we should linger while there was life in us
the air was thick and heavy as it sometimes is before the dawn breaks andanother infallible sign in certain parts of zuvendis that sunrise is at handhundreds of little spiders pendant on the end of long tough webs were floating about in it
these earlyrising creatures or rather their webs caught upon the horses and our own forms by scores and as we had neither the time nor the energy to brush them off we rushed along covered with hundreds of long grey threads that streamed out a yard or more behind usand a very strange appearance they must have given us
and now before us are the huge brazen gates of the outer wall of the frowning city and a new and horrible doubt strikes me what if they will not let us in
open
open i shout imperiously at the same time giving the royal password
open
open a messenger a messenger with tidings of the war what news cried the guard
and who art thou that ridest so madly and who is that whose tongue lolls outand it actually didand who runs by thee like a dog by a chariot it is the lord macumazahn and with him is his dog his black dog
open
open i bring tidings the great gates ran back on their rollers and the drawbridge fell with a rattling crash and we dashed on through the one and over the other
what news my lord what news cried the guard
incubu rolls sorais back as the wind a cloud i answered and was gone
one more effort gallant horse and yet more gallant man
so fall not now daylight and hold thy life in thee for fifteen short minutes more old zulu wardog and ye shall both live for ever in the annals of the land
on clattering through the sleeping streets
we are passing the flower temple nowone mile more only one little milehold on keep your life in thee see the houses run past of themselves
up good horse up therebut fifty yards now
ah
you see your stables and stagger on gallantly
thank god the palace at last and see the first arrows of the dawn are striking on the temples golden dome
but shall i get in here or is the deed done and the way barred
of course the roof of the temple being so high caught the light some time before the breaking of the dawna
q
once more i give the password and shout open
open no answer and my heart grows very faint
again i call and this time a single voice replies and to my joy i recognize it as belonging to kara a fellowofficer of nylepthas guards a man i know to be as honest as the lightindeed the same whom nyleptha had sent to arrest sorais on the day she fled to the temple
is it thou kara i cry i am macumazahn
bid the guard let down the bridge and throw wide the gate
quick quick then followed a space that seemed to me endless but at length the bridge fell and one half of the gate opened and we got into the courtyard where at last poor daylight fell down beneath me as i thought dead
except kara there was nobody to be seen and his look was wild and his garments were all torn
he had opened the gate and let down the bridge alone and was now getting them up and shut again as owing to a very ingenious arrangement of cranks and levers one man could easily do and indeed generally did do
where are the guard i gasped fearing his answer as i never feared anything before
i know not he answered two hours ago as i slept was i seized and bound by the watch under me and but now this very moment have i freed myself with my teeth
i fear i greatly fear that we are betrayed his words gave me fresh energy
catching him by the arm i staggered followed by umslopogaas who reeled after us like a drunken man through the courtyards up the great hall which was silent as the grave towards the queens sleepingplace
we reached the first anteroomno guards the second still no guards
oh surely the thing was done
we were too late after all too late
the silence and solitude of those great chambers was dreadful and weighed me down like an evil dream
on right into nylepthas chamber we rushed and staggered sick at heart fearing the very worst we saw there was a light in it ay and a figure bearing the light
oh thank god it is the white queen herself the queen unharmed
there she stands in her night gear roused by the clatter of our coming from her bed the heaviness of sleep yet in her eyes and a red blush of fear and shame mantling her lovely breast and cheek
who is it she cries
what means this
oh macumazahn is it thou
why lookest thou so wildly
thou comest as one bearing evil tidingsand my lordoh tell me not my lord is deadnot dead she wailed wringing her white hands
i left incubu wounded but leading the advance against sorais last night at sundown therefore let thy heart have rest
sorais is beaten back all along her lines and thy arms prevail i knew it she cried in triumph
i knew that he would win and they called him outlander and shook their wise heads when i gave him the command
last night at sundown sayest thou and it is not yet dawn
surely throw a cloak around thee nyleptha i broke in and give us wine to drink ay and call thy maidens quick if thou wouldst save thyself alive
nay stay not thus adjured she ran and called through the curtains towards some room beyond and then hastily put on her sandals and a thick cloak by which time a dozen or so of halfdressed women were pouring into the room
follow us and be silent i said to them as they gazed with wondering eyes clinging one to another
so we went into the first anteroom
now i said give us wine to drink and food if ye have it for we are near to death the room was used as a messroom for the officers of the guards and from a cupboard some flagons of wine and some cold flesh were brought forth and umslopogaas and i drank and felt life flow back into our veins as the good red wine went down
hark to me nyleptha i said as i put down the empty tankard
hast thou here among these thy waitingladies any two of discretion ay she said surely then bid them go out by the side entrance to any citizens whom thou canst bethink thee of as men loyal to thee and pray them come armed with all honest folk that they can gather to rescue thee from death
nay question not do as i say and quickly
kara here will let out the maids she turned and selecting two of the crowd of damsels repeated the words i had uttered giving them besides a list of the names of the men to whom each should run
go swiftly and secretly go for your very lives i added
in another moment they had left with kara whom i told to rejoin us at the door leading from the great courtyard on to the stairway as soon as he had made fast behind the girls
thither too umslopogaas and i made our way followed by the queen and her women
as we went we tore off mouthfuls of food and between them i told her what i knew of the danger which encompassed her and how we found kara and how all the guards and menservants were gone and she was alone with her women in that great place and she told me too that a rumour had spread through the town that our army had been utterly destroyed and that sorais was marching in triumph on milosis and how in consequence thereof all men had fallen away from her
though all this takes some time to tell we had not been but six or seven minutes in the palace and notwithstanding that the golden roof of the temple being very lofty was ablaze with the rays of the rising sun it was not yet dawn nor would be for another ten minutes
we were in the courtyard now and here my wound pained me so that i had to take nylepthas arm while umslopogaas rolled along after us eating as he went
now we were across it and had reached the narrow doorway through the palace wall that opened on to the mighty stair
i looked through and stood aghast as well i might
the door was gone and so were the outer gates of bronzeentirely gone
they had been taken from their hinges and as we afterwards found hurled from the stairway to the ground two hundred feet beneath
there in front of us was the semicircular standingspace about twice the size of a large oval diningtable and the ten curved black marble steps leading on to the main stairand that was all
how umslopogaas held the stair we looked at one another
thou seest i said they have taken away the door
is there aught with which we may fill the place
speak quickly for they will be on us ere the daylight i spoke thus because i knew that we must hold this place or none as there were no inner doors in the palace the rooms being separated one from another by curtains
i also knew that if we could by any means defend this doorway the murderers could get in nowhere else for the palace is absolutely impregnable that is since the secret door by which sorais had entered on that memorable night of attempted murder had by nylepthas order been closed up with masonry
i have it said nyleptha who as usual with her rose to the emergency in a wonderful way
on the farther side of the courtyard are blocks of cut marblethe workmen brought them there for the bed of the new statue of incubu my lord let us block the door with them i jumped at the idea and having despatched one of the remaining maidens down the great stair to see if she could obtain assistance from the docks below where her father who was a great merchant employing many men had his dwellingplace and set another to watch through the doorway we made our way back across the courtyard to where the hewn marble lay and here we met kara returning from despatching the first two messengers
there were the marble blocks sure enough broad massive lumps some six inches thick and weighing about eighty pounds each and there too were a couple of implements like small stretchers that the workmen used to carry them on
without delay we got some of the blocks on to the stretchers and four of the girls carried them to the doorway
listen macumazahn said umslopogaas if those low fellows come it is i who will hold the stair against them till the door is built up
nay nay it will be a mans death gainsay me not old friend
it has been a good day let it now be good night
see i throw myself down to rest on the marble there when their footsteps are nigh wake thou me not before for i need my strength and without a word he went outside and flung himself down on the marble and was instantly asleep
at this time i too was overcome and was forced to sit down by the doorway and content myself with directing operations
the girls brought the block while kara and nyleptha built them up across the sixfootwide doorway a triple row of them for less would be useless
but the marble had to be brought forty yards and then there were forty yards to run back and though the girls laboured gloriously even staggering along alone each with a block in her arms it was slow work dreadfully slow
the light was growing now and presently in the silence we heard a commotion at the farbottom of the stair and the faint clinking of armed men
as yet the wall was only two feet high and we had been eight minutes at the building of it
so they had come
alphonse had heard aright
the clanking sound came nearer and in the ghostly grey of the dawning we could make out long files of men some fifty or so in all slowly creeping up the stair
they were now at the halfway standing place that rested on the great flying arch and here perceiving that something was going on above they to our great gain halted for three or four minutes and consulted then slowly and cautiously advanced again
we had been nearly a quarter of an hour at the work now and it was almost three feet high
then i woke umslopogaas
the great man rose stretched himself and swung inkosikaas round his head
it is well he said
i feel as a young man once more
my strength has come back to me ay even as a lamp flares up before it dies
fear not i shall fight a good fight the wine and the sleep have put a new heart into me
macumazahn i have dreamed a dream
i dreamed that thou and i stood together on a star and looked down on the world and thou wast as a spirit macumazahn for light flamed through thy flesh but i could not see what was the fashion of mine own face
the hour has come for us old hunter
so be it we have had our time but i would that in it i had seen some more such fights as yesterdays
let them bury me after the fashion of my people macumazahn and set my eyes towards zululand and he took my hand and shook it and then turned to face the advancing foe
just then to my astonishment the zuvendi officer kara clambered over our improvised wall in his quiet determined sort of way and took his stand by the zulu unsheathing his sword as he did so
what comest thou too laughed out the old warrior
welcomea welcome to thee brave heart
ow
for the man who can die like a man ow
for the death grip and the ringing of steel
ow
we are ready
we wet our beaks like eagles our spears flash in the sun we shake our assegais and are hungry to fight
who comes to give greeting to the chieftainess inkosikaas
who would taste her kiss whereof the fruit is death
i the woodpecker i the slaughterer i the swiftfooted
i umslopogaas of the tribe of the maquilisini of the people of amazulu a captain of the regiment of the nkomabakosi i umslopogaas the son of indabazimbi the son of arpi the son of mosilikaatze i of the royal blood of tchaka i of the kings house i the ringed man i the induna i call to them as a buck calls i challenge them i await them
ow
it is thou it is thou as he spake or rather chanted his wild warsong the armed men among whom in the growing light i recognized both nasta and agon came streaming up the stair with a rush and one big fellow armed with a heavy spear dashed up the ten semicircular steps ahead of his comrades and struck at the great zulu with the spear
umslopogaas moved his body but not his legs so that the blow missed him and next instant inkosikaas crashed through headpiece hair and skull and the mans corpse was rattling down the steps
as he dropped his round hippopotamushide shield fell from his hand on to the marble and the zulu stooped down and seized it still chanting as he did so
in another second the sturdy kara had also slain a man and then began a scene the like of which has not been known to me
up rushed the assailants one two three at a time and as fast as they came the axe crashed and the sword swung and down they rolled again dead or dying
and ever as the fight thickened the old zulus eye seemed to get quicker and his arm stronger
he shouted out his warcries and the names of chiefs whom he had slain and the blows of his awful axe rained straight and true shearing through everything they fell on
there was none of the scientific method he was so fond of about this last immortal fight of his he had no time for it but struck with his full strength and at every stroke a man sank in his tracks and went rattling down the marble steps
they hacked and hewed at him with swords and spears wounding him in a dozen places till he streamed red with blood but the shield protected his head and the chainshirt his vitals and for minute after minute aided by the gallant zuvendi he still held the stair
at last karas sword broke and he grappled with a foe and they rolled down together and he was cut to pieces dying like the brave man that he was
umslopogaas was alone now but he never blenched or turned
shouting out some wild zulu battlecry he beat down a foe ay and another and another till at last they drew back from the slippery bloodstained steps and stared at him with amazement thinking that he was no mortal man
the wall of marble block was four feet six high now and hope rose in my heart as i leaned there against it a miserable helpless log and ground my teeth and watched that glorious struggle
i could do no more for i had lost my revolver in the battle
and old umslopogaas he leaned too on his good axe and faint as he was with wounds he mocked them he called them womenthe grand old warrior standing there one against so many
and for a breathing space none would come against him notwithstanding nastas exhortations till at last old agon who to do him justice was a brave man mad with baffled rage and seeing that the wall would soon be built and his plans defeated shook the great spear he held and rushed up the dripping steps
ah ah shouted the zulu as he recognized the priests flowing white beard it is thou old witchfinder
come on
i await thee white medicine man come on
come on
i have sworn to slay thee and i ever keep my faith on he came taking him at his word and drave the big spear with such force at umslopogaas that it sunk right through the tough shield and pierced him in the neck
the zulu cast down the transfixed shield and that moment was agons last for before he could free his spear and strike again with a shout of theres for thee rainmaker umslopogaas gripped inkosikaas with both hands and whirled on high and drave her right on to his venerable head so that agon rolled down dead among the corpses of his fellowmurderers and there was an end to him and his plots altogether
and even as he fell a great cry rose from the foot of the stair and looking out through the portion of the doorway that was yet unclosed we saw armed men rushing up to the rescue and called an answer to their shouts
then the wouldbe murderers who yet remained on the stairway and amongst whom i saw several priests turned to fly but having nowhere to go were butchered as they fled
only one man stayed and he was the great lord nasta nylepthas suitor and the father of the plot
for a moment the blackbearded nasta stood with bowed face leaning on his long sword as though in despair and then with a dreadful shout he too rushed up at the zulu and swinging the glittering sword around his head dealt him such a mighty blow beneath his guard that the keen steel of the heavy blade bit right through the chain armour and deep into umslopogaas side for a moment paralysing him and causing him to drop his axe
raising the sword again nasta sprang forward to make an end of him but little he knew his foe
with a shake and a yell of fury the zulu gathered himself together and sprang straight at nastas throat as i have sometimes seen a wounded lion spring
he struck him full as his foot was on the topmost stair and his long arms closing round him like iron bands down they rolled together struggling furiously
nasta was a strong man and a desperate but he could not match the strongest man in zululand sore wounded though he was whose strength was as the strength of a bull
in a minute the end came
i saw old umslopogaas stagger to his feetay and saw him by a single gigantic effort swing up the struggling nasta and with a shout of triumph hurl him straight over the parapet of the bridge to be crushed to powder on the rocks two hundred feet below
the succour which had been summoned by the girl who had passed down the stair before the assassins passed up was at hand and the loud shouts which reached us from the outer gates told us that the town was also aroused and the men awakened by the women were calling to be admitted
some of nylepthas brave ladies who in their nightshifts and with their long hair streaming down their backs just as they had been aroused from rest went off to admit them at the side entrance whilst others assisted by the rescuing party outside pushed and pulled down the marble blocks they had placed there with so much labour
soon the wall was down again and through the doorway followed by a crowd of rescuers staggered old umslopogaas an awful and in a way a glorious figure
the man was a mass of wounds and a glance at his wild eye told me that he was dying
the keshla gumring upon his head was severed in two places by swordcuts one just over the curious hole in his skull and the blood poured down his face from the gashes
also on the right side of his neck was a stab from a spear inflicted by agon there was a deep cut on his left arm just below where the mail shirtsleeve stopped and on the right side of his body the armour was severed by a gash six inches long where nastas mighty sword had bitten through it and deep into its wearers vitals
on axe in hand he staggered that dreadfullooking splendid savage and the ladies forgot to turn faint at the scene of blood and cheered him as well they might but he never stayed or heeded
with outstretched arms and tottering gait he pursued his way followed by us all along the broad shellstrewn walk that ran through the courtyard past the spot where the blocks of marble lay through the round arched doorway and the thick curtains that hung within it down the short passage and into the great hall which was now filling with hastilyarmed men who poured through the side entrance
straight up the hall he went leaving behind him a track of blood on the marble pavement till at last he reached the sacred stone which stood in the centre of it and here his strength seemed to fail him for he stopped and leaned upon his axe
then suddenly he lifted up his voice and cried aloud i die i diebut it was a kingly fray
where are they who came up the great stair
i see them not
art thou there macumazahn or art thou gone before to wait for me in the dark whither i go
the blood blinds methe place turns roundi hear the voice of waters next as though a new thought had struck him he lifted the red axe and kissed the blade
farewell inkosikaas he cried
nay nay we will go together we cannot part thou and i
we have lived too long one with another thou and i
one more stroke only one
a good stroke
a straight stroke
a strong stroke and drawing himself to his full height with a wild heartshaking shout he with both hands began to whirl the axe round his head till it looked like a circle of flaming steel
then suddenly with awful force he brought it down straight on to the crown of the mass of sacred stone
a shower of sparks flew up and such was the almost superhuman strength of the blow that the massive marble split with a rending sound into a score of pieces whilst of inkosikaas there remained but some fragments of steel and a fibrous rope of shattered horn that had been the handle
down with a crash on to the pavement fell the fragments of the holy stone and down with a crash on to them still grasping the knob of inkosikaas fell the brave old zuludead
and thus the hero died
a gasp of wonder and astonishment rose from all those who witnessed the extraordinary sight and then somebody cried the prophecy
the prophecy he has shattered the sacred stone and at once a murmuring arose
ay said nyleptha with that quick wit which distinguishes her
ay my people he has shattered the stone and behold the prophecy is fulfilled for a stranger king rules in zuvendis
incubu my lord hath beat sorais back and i fear her no more and to him who hath saved the crown it shall surely be
and this man she said turning to me and laying her hand upon my shoulder wot ye that though wounded in the fight of yesterday he rode with that old warrior who lies there one hundred miles twixt sun set and rise to save me from the plots of cruel men
ay and he has saved me by a very little and therefore because of the deeds that they have donedeeds of glory such as our history cannot show the liketherefore i say that the name of macumazahn and the name of dead umslopogaas ay and the name of kara my servant who aided him to hold the stair shall be blazoned in letters of gold above my throne and shall be glorious for ever while the land endures
i the queen have said it this spirited speech was met with loud cheering and i said that after all we had only done our duty as it is the fashion of both englishmen and zulus to do and there was nothing to make an outcry about at which they cheered still more and then i was supported across the outer courtyard to my old quarters in order that i might be put to bed
as i went my eyes lit upon the brave horse daylight that lay there his white head outstretched on the pavement exactly as he had fallen on entering the yard and i bade those who supported me take me near him that i might look on the good beast once more before he was dragged away
and as i looked to my astonishment he opened his eyes and lifting his head a little whinnied faintly
i could have shouted for joy to find that he was not dead only unfortunately i had not a shout left in me but as it was grooms were sent for and he was lifted up and wine poured down his throat and in a fortnight he was as well and strong as ever and is the pride and joy of all the people of milosis who whenever they see him point him out to the little children as the horse which saved the white queens life
then i went on and got off to bed and was washed and had my mail shirt removed
they hurt me a great deal in getting it off and no wonder for on my left breast and side was a black bruise the size of a saucer
the next thing that i remember was the tramp of horsemen outside the palace wall some ten hours later
i raised myself and asked what was the news and they told me that a large body of cavalry sent by curtis to assist the queen had arrived from the scene of the battle which they had left two hours after sundown
when they left the wreck of sorais army was in full retreat upon marstuna followed by all our effective cavalry
sir henry was encamping the remains of his wornout forces on the site such is the fortune of war that sorais had occupied the night before and proposed marching to marstuna on the morrow
having heard this i felt that i could die with a light heart and then everything became a blank
when next i awoke the first thing i saw was the round disc of a sympathetic eyeglass behind which was good
how are you getting on old chap said a voice from the neighbourhood of the eyeglass
what are you doing here i asked faintly
you ought to be at marstunahave you run away or what marstuna he replied cheerfully
ah marstuna fell last weekyouve been unconscious for a fortnight you seewith all the honours of war you knowtrumpets blowing flags flying just as though they had had the best of it but for all that werent they glad to go
israel made for his tents i can tell younever saw such a sight in my life and sorais i asked
soraisoh sorais is a prisoner they gave her up the scoundrels he added with a change of tonesacrificed the queen to save their skins you see
she is being brought up here and i dont know what will happen to her poor soul and he sighed
where is curtis i asked
he is with nyleptha
she rode out to meet us today and there was a grand todo i can tell you
he is coming to see you tomorrow the doctors for there is a medical faculty in zuvendis as elsewhere thought that he had better not come today i said nothing but somehow i thought to myself that notwithstanding the doctors he might have given me a look but there when a man is newly married and has just gained a great victory he is apt to listen to the advice of doctors and quite right too
just then i heard a familiar voice informing me that monsieur must now couch himself and looking up perceived alphonses enormous black mustachios curling away in the distance
so you are here i said
mais oui monsieur the war is now finished my military instincts are satisfied and i return to nurse monsieur i laughed or rather tried to but whatever may have been alphonses failings as a warrior and i fear that he did not come up to the level of his heroic grandfather in this particular showing thereby how true is the saying that it is a bad thing to be overshadowed by some great ancestral name a better or kinder nurse never lived
poor alphonse
i hope he will always think of me as kindly as i think of him
on the morrow i saw curtis and nyleptha with him and he told me the whole history of what had happened since umslopogaas and i galloped wildly away from the battle to save the life of the queen
it seemed to me that he had managed the thing exceedingly well and showed great ability as a general
of course however our loss had been dreadfully heavyindeed i am afraid to say how many perished in the desperate battle i have described but i know that the slaughter has appreciably affected the male population of the country
he was very pleased to see me dear fellow that he is and thanked me with tears in his eyes for the little that i had been able to do
i saw him however start violently when his eyes fell upon my face
as for nyleptha she was positively radiant now that her dear lord had come back with no other injury than an ugly scar on his forehead
i do not believe that she allowed all the fearful slaughter that had taken place to weigh ever so little in the balance against this one fact or even to greatly diminish her joy and i cannot blame her for it seeing that it is the nature of loving woman to look at all things through the spectacles of her love and little does she reck of the misery of the many if the happiness of the one be assured
that is human nature which the positivists tell us is just perfection so no doubt it is all right
and what art thou going to do with sorais i asked her
instantly her bright brow darkened to a frown
sorais she said with a little stamp of the foot ah but sorais sir henry hastened to turn the subject
you will soon be about and all right again now old fellow he said
i shook my head and laughed
dont deceive yourselves i said
i may be about for a little but i shall never be all right again
i am a dying man curtis
i may die slow but die i must
do you know i have been spitting blood all the morning
i tell you there is something working away into my lung i can feel it
there dont look distressed i have had my day and am ready to go
give me the mirror will you
i want to look at myself he made some excuse but i saw through it and insisted and at last he handed me one of the discs of polished silver set in a wooden frame like a handscreen which serve as lookingglasses in zuvendis
i looked and put it down
ah i said quietly i thought so and you talk of my getting all right i did not like to let them see how shocked i really was at my own appearance
my grizzled stubby hair was turned snowwhite and my yellow face was shrunk like an aged womans and had two deep purple rings painted beneath the eyes
here nyleptha began to cry and sir henry again turned the subject telling me that the artists had taken a cast of the dead body of old umslopogaas and that a great statue in black marble was to be erected of him in the act of splitting the sacred stone which was to be matched by another statue in white marble of myself and the horse daylight as he appeared when at the termination of that wild ride he sank beneath me in the courtyard of the palace
i have since seen these statues which at the time of writing this six months after the battle are nearly finished and very beautiful they are especially that of umslopogaas which is exactly like him
as for that of myself it is good but they have idealized my ugly face a little which is perhaps as well seeing that thousands of people will probably look at it in the centuries to come and it is not pleasant to look at ugly things
then they told me that umslopogaas last wish had been carried out and that instead of being cremated as i shall be after the usual custom here he had been tied up zulu fashion with his knees beneath his chin and having been wrapped in a thin sheet of beaten gold entombed in a hole hollowed out of the masonry of the semicircular space at the top of the stair he defended so splendidly which faces as far as we can judge almost exactly towards zululand
there he sits and will sit for ever for they embalmed him with spices and put him in an airtight stone coffer keeping his grim watch beneath the spot he held alone against a multitude and the people say that at night his ghost rises and stands shaking the phantom of inkosikaas at phantom foes
certainly they fear during the dark hours to pass the place where the hero is buried
oddly enough too a new legend or prophecy has arisen in the land in that unaccountable way in which such things do arise among barbarous and semicivilized people blowing like the wind no man knows whence
according to this saying so long as the old zulu sits there looking down the stairway he defended when alive so long will the new house of the stairway springing from the union of the englishman and nyleptha endure and flourish but when he is taken from thence or when ages after his bones at last crumble into dust the house will fall and the stairway shall fall and the nation of the zuvendi shall cease to be a nation
i have spoken it was a week after nylepthas visit when i had begun to get about a little in the middle of the day that a message came to me from sir henry to say that sorais would be brought before them in the queens first antechamber at midday and requesting my attendance if possible
accordingly greatly drawn by curiosity to see this unhappy woman once more i made shift with the help of that kind little fellow alphonse who is a perfect treasure to me and that of another waitingman to reach the antechamber
i got there indeed before anybody else except a few of the great court officials who had been bidden to be present but i had scarcely seated myself before sorais was brought in by a party of guards looking as beautiful and defiant as ever but with a worn expression on her proud face
she was as usual dressed in her royal kaf emblazoned with the emblem of the sun and in her right hand she still held the toy spear of silver
a pang of admiration and pity went through me as i looked at her and struggling to my feet i bowed deeply at the same time expressing my sorrow that i was not able owing to my condition to remain standing before her
she coloured a little and then laughed bitterly
thou dost forget macumazahn she said i am no more a queen save in blood i am an outcast and a prisoner one whom all men should scorn and none show deference to at least i replied thou art still a lady and therefore one to whom deference is due
also thou art in an evil case and therefore it is doubly due ah she answered with a little laugh thou dost forget that i would have wrapped thee in a sheet of gold and hung thee to the angels trumpet at the topmost pinnacle of the temple no i answered i assure thee that i forgot it not indeed i often thought of it when it seemed to me that the battle of the pass was turning against us but the trumpet is there and i am still here though perchance not for long so why talk of it now ah she went on the battle
the battle
oh would that i were once more a queen if only for one little hour and i would take such a vengeance on those accursed jackals who deserted me in my need that it should only be spoken of in whispers those women those pigeonhearted halfbreeds who suffered themselves to be overcome and she choked in her wrath
ay and that little coward beside thee she went on pointing at alphonse with the silver spear whereat he looked very uncomfortable he escaped and betrayed my plans
i tried to make a general of him telling the soldiers it was bougwan and to scourge valour into him here alphonse shivered at some unhappy recollection but it was of no avail
he hid beneath a banner in my tent and thus overheard my plans
i would that i had slain him but alas
i held my hand
and thou macumazahn i have heard of what thou didst thou art brave and hast a loyal heart
and the black one too ah he was a man
i would fain have seen him hurl nasta from the stairway thou art a strange woman sorais i said i pray thee now plead with the queen nyleptha that perchance she may show mercy unto thee she laughed out loud
i plead for mercy she said and at that moment the queen entered accompanied by sir henry and good and took her seat with an impassive face
as for poor good he looked intensely ill at ease
greeting sorais said nyleptha after a short pause
thou hast rent the kingdom like a rag thou hast put thousands of my people to the sword thou hast twice basely plotted to destroy my life by murder thou hast sworn to slay my lord and his companions and to hurl me from the stairway
what hast thou to say why thou shouldst not die
speak o sorais methinks my sister the queen hath forgotten the chief count of the indictment answered sorais in her slow musical tones
it runs thus thou didst strive to win the love of my lord incubu it is for this crime that my sister will slay me not because i levied war
it is perchance happy for thee nyleptha that i fixed my mind upon his love too late
listen she went on raising her voice
i have nought to say save that i would i had won instead of lost
do thou with me even as thou wilt o queen and let my lord the king there pointing to sir henryfor now will he be kingcarry out the sentence as it is meet he should for as he is the beginning of the evil let him also be the end and she drew herself up and shot one angry glance at him from her deep fringed eyes and then began to toy with her spear
sir henry bent towards nyleptha and whispered something that i could not catch and then the queen spoke
sorais ever have i been a good sister to thee
when our father died and there was much talk in the land as to whether thou shouldst sit upon the throne with me i being the elder i gave my voice for thee and said nay let her sit
she is twin with me we were born at a birth wherefore should the one be preferred before the other and so has it ever been twixt thee and me my sister
but now thou knowest in what sort thou hast repaid me but i have prevailed and thy life is forfeit sorais
and yet art thou my sister born at a birth with me and we played together when we were little and loved each other much and at night we slept in the same cot with our arms each around the others neck and therefore even now does my heart go out to thee sorais
but not for that would i spare thy life for thy offence has been too heavy it doth drag down the wide wings of my mercy even to the ground
also while thou dost live the land will never be at peace
yet shalt thou not die sorais because my dear lord here hath begged thy life of me as a boon therefore as a boon and as a marriage gift give i it to him to do with even as he wills knowing that though thou dost love him he loves thee not sorais for all thy beauty
nay though thou art lovely as the night in all her stars o lady of the night yet it is me his wife whom he loves and not thee and therefore do i give thy life to him sorais flushed up to her eyes and said nothing and i do not think that i ever saw a man look more miserable than did sir henry at that moment
somehow nylepthas way of putting the thing though true and forcible enough was not altogether pleasant
i understood stammered curtis looking at good i understood that you were attachedehattached toto the queen sorais
i amehnot aware what thein short the state of your feelings may be just now but if they happened to be that way inclined it has struck me thatin short it might put a satisfactory end to an unpleasant business
the lady also has ample private estates where i am sure she would be at liberty to live unmolested as far as we are concerned eh nyleptha
of course i only suggest so far as i am concerned said good colouring up i am quite willing to forget the past and if the lady of the night thinks me worth the taking i will marry her tomorrow or when she likes and try to make her a good husband all eyes were now turned to sorais who stood with that same slow smile upon her beautiful face which i had noticed the first time that i ever saw her
she paused a little while and cleared her throat and then thrice she curtseyed low once to nyleptha once to curtis and once to good and began to speak in measured tones
i thank thee most gracious queen and royal sister for the lovingkindness thou hast shown me from my youth up and especially in that thou hast been pleased to give my person and my fate as a gift to the lord incubuthe king that is to be
may prosperity peace and plenty deck the lifepath of one so merciful and so tender even as flowers do
long mayst thou reign o great and glorious queen and hold thy husbands love in both thy hands and many be the sons and daughters of thy beauty
and i thank thee my lord incubuthe king that is to bei thank thee a thousand times in that thou hast been pleased to accept that gracious gift and to pass it on to thy comrade in arms and in adventure the lord bougwan
surely the act is worthy of thy greatness my lord incubu
and now lastly i thank thee also my lord bougwan who in thy turn hast deigned to accept me and my poor beauty
i thank thee a thousand times and i will add that thou art a good and honest man and i put my hand upon my heart and swear that i would that i could say thee yea
and now that i have rendered thanks to all in turnand again she smiledi will add one short word
little can you understand of me queen nyleptha and my lords if ye know not that for me there is no middle path that i scorn your pity and hate you for it that i cast off your forgiveness as though it were a serpents sting and that standing here betrayed deserted insulted and alone i yet triumph over you mock you and defy you one and all and thus i answer ye and then of a sudden before anybody guessed what she intended to do she drove the little silver spear she carried in her hand into her side with such a strong and steady aim that the keen point projected through her back and she fell prone upon the pavement
nyleptha shrieked and poor good almost fainted at the sight while the rest of us rushed towards her
but sorais of the night lifted herself upon her hand and for a moment fixed her glorious eyes intently on curtis face as though there were some message in the glance then dropped her head and sighed and with a sob her dark but splendid spirit passed
well they gave her a royal funeral and there was an end of her
it was a month after the last act of the sorais tragedy that a great ceremony was held in the flower temple and curtis was formally declared kingconsort of zuvendis
i was too ill to go myself and indeed i hate all that sort of thing with the crowds and the trumpetblowing and bannerwaving but good who was there in his fulldress uniform came back much impressed and told me that nyleptha had looked lovely and curtis had borne himself in a right royal fashion and had been received with acclamations that left no doubt as to his popularity
also he told me that when the horse daylight was led along in the procession the populace had shouted macumazahn macumazahn till they were hoarse and would only be appeased when he good rose in his chariot and told them that i was too ill to be present
afterwards too sir henry or rather the king came to see me looking very tired and vowing that he had never been so bored in his life but i dare say that that was a slight exaggeration
it is not in human nature that a man should be altogether bored on such an extraordinary occasion and indeed as i pointed out to him it was a marvellous thing that a man who but little more than one short year before had entered a great country as an unknown wanderer should today be married to its beautiful and beloved queen and lifted amidst public rejoicings to its throne
i even went the length to exhort him in the future not to be carried away by the pride and pomp of absolute power but always to strive to remember that he was first a christian gentleman and next a public servant called by providence to a great and almost unprecedented trust
these remarks which he might fairly have resented he was so good as to receive with patience and even to thank me for making them
it was immediately after this ceremony that i caused myself to be moved to the house where i am now writing
it is a very pleasant country seat situated about two miles from the frowning city on to which it looks
that was five months ago during the whole of which time i have being confined to a kind of couch employed my leisure in compiling this history of our wanderings from my journal and from our joint memories
it is probable that it will never be read but it does not much matter whether it is or not at any rate it has served to while away many hours of suffering for i have suffered a deal of pain lately
thank god however there will not be much more of it
it is a week since i wrote the above and now i take up my pen for the last time for i know that the end is at hand
my brain is still clear and i can manage to write though with difficulty
the pain in my lung which has been very bad during the last week has suddenly quite left me and been succeeded by a feeling of numbness of which i cannot mistake the meaning
and just as the pain has gone so with it all fear of that end has departed and i feel only as though i were going to sink into the arms of an unutterable rest
happily contentedly and with the same sense of security with which an infant lays itself to sleep in its mothers arms do i lay myself down in the arms of the angel death
all the tremors all the heartshaking fears which have haunted me through a life that seems long as i look back upon it have left me now the storms have passed and the star of our eternal hope shines clear and steady on the horizon that seems so far from man and yet is so very near to me tonight
and so this is the end of ita brief space of troubling a few restless fevered anguished years and then the arms of that great angel death
many times have i been near to them and now it is my turn at last and it is well
twentyfour hours more and the world will be gone from me and with it all its hopes and all its fears
the air will close in over the space that my form filled and my place know me no more for the dull breath of the worlds forgetfulness will first dim the brightness of my memory and then blot it out for ever and of a truth i shall be dead
so is it with us all
how many millions have lain as i lie and thought these thoughts and been forgottenthousands upon thousands of years ago they thought them those dying men of the dim past and thousands on thousands of years hence will their descendants think them and be in their turn forgotten
as the breath of the oxen in winter as the quick star that runs along the sky as a little shadow that loses itself at sunset as i once heard a zulu called ignosi put it such is the order of our life the order that passeth away
well it is not a good worldnobody can say that it is save those who wilfully blind themselves to facts
how can a world be good in which money is the moving power and selfinterest the guiding star
the wonder is not that it is so bad but that there should be any good left in it
still now that my life is over i am glad to have lived glad to have known the dear breath of womans love and that true friendship which can even surpass the love of woman glad to have heard the laughter of little children to have seen the sun and the moon and the stars to have felt the kiss of the salt sea on my face and watched the wild game trek down to the water in the moonlight
but i should not wish to live again
everything is changing to me
the darkness draws near and the light departs
and yet it seems to me that through that darkness i can already see the shining welcome of many a longlost face
harry is there and others one above all to my mind the sweetest and most perfect woman that ever gladdened this grey earth
but of her i have already written elsewhere and at length so why speak of her now
why speak of her after this long silence now that she is again so near to me now that i go where she has gone
the sinking sun is turning the golden roof of the great temple to a fiery flame and my fingers tire
so to all who have known me or known of me to all who can think one kindly thought of the old hunter i stretch out my hand from the faroff shore and bid a long farewell
and now into the hands of almighty god who sent it do i commit my spirit
i have spoken as the zulus say
by another hand a year has elapsed since our most dear friend allan quatermain wrote the words i have spoken at the end of his record of our adventures
nor should i have ventured to make any additions to the record had it not happened that by a most strange accident a chance has arisen of its being conveyed to england
the chance is but a faint one it is true but as it is not probable that another will arise in our lifetimes good and myself think that we may as well avail ourselves of it such as it is
during the last six months several frontier commissions have been at work on the various boundaries of zuvendis with a view of discovering whether there exists any possible means of ingress or egress from the country with the result that a channel of communication with the outer world hitherto overlooked has been discovered
this channel apparently the only one for i have discovered that it was by it that the native who ultimately reached mr mackenzies mission station and whose arrival in the country together with the fact of his expulsionfor he did arrive about three years before ourselveswas for reasons of their own kept a dead secret by the priests to whom he was brought is about to be effectually closed
but before this is done a messenger is to be despatched bearing with him this manuscript and also one or two letters from good to his friends and from myself to my brother george whom it deeply grieves me to think i shall never see again informing them as our next heirs that they are welcome to our effects in england if the court of probate will allow them to take them inasmuchas as we have made up our minds never to return to europe
indeed it would be impossible for us to leave zuvendis even if we wished to do so
of course the court of probate would allow nothing of the sorteditor
the messenger who is to goand i wish him joy of his journeyis alphonse
for a long while he has been wearied to death of zuvendis and its inhabitants
oh oui cest beau he says with an expressive shrug mais je mennuie ce nest pas chic again he complains dreadfully of the absence of cafes and theatres and moans continually for his lost annette of whom he says he dreams three times a week
but i fancy his secret cause of disgust at the country putting aside the homesickness to which every frenchman is subject is that the people here laugh at him so dreadfully about his conduct on the occasion of the great battle of the pass about eighteen months ago when he hid beneath a banner in soraiss tent in order to avoid being sent forth to fight which he says would have gone against his conscience
even the little boys call out at him in the streets thereby offending his pride and making his life unbearable
at any rate he has determined to brave the horrors of a journey of almost unprecedented difficulty and danger and also to run the risk of falling into the hands of the french police to answer for a certain little indiscretion of his own some years old though i do not consider that a very serious matter rather than remain in ce triste pays
poor alphonse
we shall be very sorry to part with him but i sincerely trust for his own sake and also for the sake of this history which is i think worth giving to the world that he may arrive in safety
if he does and can carry the treasure we have provided him with in the shape of bars of solid gold he will be comparatively speaking a rich man for life and well able to marry his annette if she is still in the land of the living and willing to marry her alphonse
anyhow on the chance i may as well add a word or two to dear old quatermains narrative
he died at dawn on the day following that on which he wrote the last words of the last chapter
nyleptha good and myself were present and a most touching and yet in its way beautiful scene it was
an hour before the daybreak it became apparent to us that he was sinking and our distress was very keen
indeed good melted into tears at the ideaa fact that called forth a last gentle flicker of humour from our dying friend for even at that hour he could be humorous
goods emotion had by loosening the muscles naturally caused his eyeglass to fall from its accustomed place and quatermain who always observed everything observed this also
at last he gasped with an attempt at a smile i have seen good without his eyeglass after that he said no more till the day broke when he asked to be lifted up to watch the rising of the sun for the last time
in a very few minutes he said after gazing earnestly at it i shall have passed through those golden gates ten minutes afterwards he raised himself and looked us fixedly in the face
i am going a stranger journey than any we have ever taken together
think of me sometimes he murmured
god bless you all
i shall wait for you and with a sigh he fell back dead
and so passed away a character that i consider went as near perfection as any it has ever been my lot to encounter
tender constant humorous and possessing of many of the qualities that go to make a poet he was yet almost unrivalled as a man of action and a citizen of the world
i never knew any one so competent to form an accurate judgment of men and their motives
i have studied human nature all my life he would say and i ought to know something about it and he certainly did
he had but two faultsone was his excessive modesty and the other a slight tendency which he had to be jealous of anybody on whom he concentrated his affections
as regards the first of these points anybody who reads what he has written will be able to form his own opinion but i will add one last instance of it
as the reader will doubtless remember it is a favourite trick of his to talk of himself as a timid man whereas really though very cautious he possessed a most intrepid spirit and what is more never lost his head
well in the great battle of the pass where he got the wound that finally killed him one would imagine from the account which he gives of the occurrence that it was a chance blow that fell on him in the scrimmage
as a matter of fact however he was wounded in a most gallant and successful attempt to save goods life at the risk and as it ultimately turned out at the cost of his own
good was down on the ground and one of nastas highlanders was about to dispatch him when quatermain threw himself on to his prostrate form and received the blow on his own body and then rising killed the soldier
as regards his jealousy a single instance which i give in justice to myself and nyleptha will suffice
the reader will perhaps recollect that in one or two places he speaks as though nyleptha monopolised me and he was left by both of us rather out in the cold
now nyleptha is not perfect any more than any other woman is and she may be a little exigeante at times but as regards quatermain the whole thing is pure imagination
thus when he complains about my not coming to see him when he is ill the fact was that in spite of my entreaties the doctors positively forbade it
those little remarks of his pained me very much when i read them for i loved quatermain as dearly as though he were my own father and should never have dreamed of allowing my marriage to interfere with that affection
but let it pass it is after all but one little weakness which makes no great show among so many and such lovable virtues
well he died and good read the burial service over him in the presence of nyleptha and myself and then his remains were in deference to the popular clamour accorded a great public funeral or rather cremation
i could not help thinking however as i marched in that long and splendid procession up to the temple how he would have hated the whole thing could he have been there to see it for he had a horror of ostentation
and so a few minutes before sunset on the third night after his death they laid him on the brazen flooring before the altar and waited for the last ray of the setting sun to fall upon his face
presently it came and struck him like a golden arrow crowning the pale brows with glory and then the trumpets blew and the flooring revolved and all that remained of our beloved friend fell into the furnace below
we shall never see his like again if we live a hundred years
he was the ablest man the truest gentleman the firmest friend the finest sportsman and i believe the best shot in all africa
and so ended the very remarkable and adventurous life of hunter quatermain
since then things have gone very well with us
good has been and still is busily employed in the construction of a navy on lake milosis and another of the large lakes by means of which we hope to be able to increase trade and commerce and also to overcome some very troublesome and warlike sections of the population who live upon their borders
poor fellow
he is beginning to get over the sad death of that misguided but most attractive woman sorais but it is a sad blow to him for he was really deeply attached to her
i hope however that he will in time make a suitable marriage and get that unhappy business out of his head
nyleptha has one or two young ladies in view especially a daughter of nastas who was a widower a very fine imperiallooking girl but with too much of her fathers intriguing and yet haughty spirit to suit my taste
as for myself i should scarcely know where to begin if i set to work to describe my doings so i had best leave them undescribed and content myself with saying that on the whole i am getting on very well in my curious position of kingconsortbetter indeed than i had any right to expect
but of course it is not all plain sailing and i find the responsibilities very heavy
still i hope to be able to do some good in my time and i intend to devote myself to two great endsnamely to the consolidation of the various clans which together make up the zuvendi people under one strong central government and to the sapping of the power of the priesthood
the first of these reforms will if it can be carried out put an end to the disastrous civil wars that have for centuries devastated this country and the second besides removing a source of political danger will pave the road for the introduction of true religion in the place of this senseless sun worship
i yet hope to see the shadow of the cross of christ lying on the golden dome of the flower temple or if i do not that my successors may
there is one more thing that i intend to devote myself to and that is the total exclusion of all foreigners from zuvendis
not indeed that any more are ever likely to get here but if they do i warn them fairly that they will be shown the shortest way out of the country
i do not say this from any sense of inhospitality but because i am convinced of the sacred duty that rests upon me of preserving to this on the whole upright and generoushearted people the blessings of comparative barbarism
where would all my brave army be if some enterprising rascal were to attack us with fieldguns and martinihenrys
i cannot see that gunpowder telegraphs steam daily newspapers universal suffrage etc etc have made mankind one whit the happier than they used to be and i am certain that they have brought many evils in their train
i have no fancy for handing over this beautiful country to be torn and fought for by speculators tourists politicians and teachers whose voice is as the voice of babel just as those horrible creatures in the valley of the underground river tore and fought for the body of the wild swan nor will i endow it with the greed drunkenness new diseases gunpowder and general demoralization which chiefly mark the progress of civilization amongst unsophisticated peoples
if in due course it pleases providence to throw zuvendis open to the world that is another matter but of myself i will not take the responsibility and i may add that good entirely approves of my decision
farewell
henry curtis
december
psi quite forgot to say that about nine months ago nyleptha who is very well and in my eyes at any rate more beautiful than ever presented me with a son and heir
he is a regular curlyhaired blueeyed young englishman in looks and though he is destined if he lives to inherit the throne of zuvendis i hope i may be able to bring him up to become what an english gentleman should be and generally iswhich is to my mind even a prouder and a finer thing than being born heir apparent to the great house of the stairway and indeed the highest rank that a man can reach upon this earth
h c note by george curtis esq
the ms of this history addressed to me in the handwriting of my dear brother henry curtis whom we had given up for dead and bearing the aden postmark reached me in safety on december or a little more than two years after it left his hands in the far centre of africa and i hasten to give the astonishing story it contains to the world
speaking for myself i have read it with very mixed feelings for though it is a great relief to know that he and good are alive and strangely prosperous i cannot but feel that for me and for all their friends they might as well be dead since we can never hope to see them more
they have cut themselves off from old england and from their homes and their relations for ever and perhaps under the circumstances they were right and wise to do so
how the ms came to be posted i have been quite unable to discover but i presume from the fact of its being posted at all that the little frenchman alphonse accomplished his hazardous journey in safety
i have however advertised for him and caused various inquiries to be made in marseilles and elsewhere with a view of discovering his whereabouts but so far without the slightest success
possibly he is dead and the packet was posted by another hand or possibly he is now happily wedded to his annette but still fears the vengeance of the law and prefers to remain incognito
i cannot say i have not yet abandoned my hopes of finding him but i am bound to say that they grow fainter day by day and one great obstacle to my search is that nowhere in the whole history does mr quatermain mention his surname
he is always spoken of as alphonse and there are so many alphonses
the letters which my brother henry says he is sending with the packet of manuscript have never arrived so i presume that they are lost or destroyed
george curtis authorities a novelist is not usually asked like a historian for his quellen
as i have however judging from certain experiences in the past some reason to anticipate such a demand i wish to acknowledge my indebtedness to mr thomsons admirable history of travel through masai land for much information as to the habits and customs of the tribes inhabiting that portion of the east coast and the country where they live also to my brother john g haggard rn hbms consul at madagascar and formerly consul at lamu for many details furnished by him of the mode of life and war of those engaging people the masai also to my sisterinlaw mrs john haggard who kindly put the lines of p into rhyme for me also to an extract in a review from some book of travel of which i cannot recollect the name to which i owe the idea of the great crabs in the valley of the subterranean river
but if i remember right the crabs in the book when irritated projected their eyes quite out of their heads
i regret that i was not able to plagiarize this effect but i felt that although crabs may and doubtless do behave thus in real life in romance they will not do so it is suggested to me that this book is the cruise of the falcon with which work i am personally unacquainted
there is an underground river in peter wilkins but at the time of writing the foregoing pages i had not read that quaint but entertaining work
it has been pointed out to me that there exists a similarity between the scene of umslopogaas frightening alphonse with his axe and a scene in far from the madding crowd
i regret this coincidence and believe that the talented author of that work will not be inclined to accuse me of literary immorality on its account
finally i may say that mr quatermains little frenchman appears to belong to the same class of beings as those english ladies whose long yellow teeth and feet of enormous size excite our hearty amusement in the pages of the illustrated gallic press

dedication this faithful but unpretending record of a remarkable adventure is hereby respectfully dedicated by the narrator allan quatermain to all the big and little boys who read it
authors note the author ventures to take this opportunity to thank his readers for the kind reception they have accorded to the successive editions of this tale during the last twelve years
he hopes that in its present form it will fall into the hands of an even wider public and that in years to come it may continue to afford amusement to those who are still young enough at heart to love a story of treasure war and wild adventure
ditchingham march
post scriptum now in on the occasion of the issue of this edition i can only add how glad i am that my romance should continue to please so many readers
imagination has been verified by fact the king solomons mines i dreamed of have been discovered and are putting out their gold once more and according to the latest reports their diamonds also the kukuanas or rather the matabele have been tamed by the white mans bullets but still there seem to be many who find pleasure in these simple pages
that they may continue so to do even to the third and fourth generation or perhaps longer still would i am sure be the hope of our old and departed friend allan quatermain

introduction now that this book is printed and about to be given to the world a sense of its shortcomings both in style and contents weighs very heavily upon me
as regards the latter i can only say that it does not pretend to be a full account of everything we did and saw
there are many things connected with our journey into kukuanaland that i should have liked to dwell upon at length which as it is have been scarcely alluded to
amongst these are the curious legends which i collected about the chain armour that saved us from destruction in the great battle of loo and also about the silent ones or colossi at the mouth of the stalactite cave
again if i had given way to my own impulses i should have wished to go into the differences some of which are to my mind very suggestive between the zulu and kukuana dialects
also a few pages might have been given up profitably to the consideration of the indigenous flora and fauna of kukuanaland
then there remains the most interesting subjectthat as it is has only been touched on incidentallyof the magnificent system of military organisation in force in that country which in my opinion is much superior to that inaugurated by chaka in zululand inasmuch as it permits of even more rapid mobilisation and does not necessitate the employment of the pernicious system of enforced celibacy
lastly i have scarcely spoken of the domestic and family customs of the kukuanas many of which are exceedingly quaint or of their proficiency in the art of smelting and welding metals
this science they carry to considerable perfection of which a good example is to be seen in their tollas or heavy throwing knives the backs of these weapons being made of hammered iron and the edges of beautiful steel welded with great skill on to the iron frames
the fact of the matter is i thought with sir henry curtis and captain good that the best plan would be to tell my story in a plain straightforward manner and to leave these matters to be dealt with subsequently in whatever way ultimately may appear to be desirable
in the meanwhile i shall of course be delighted to give all information in my power to anybody interested in such things
and now it only remains for me to offer apologies for my blunt way of writing
i can but say in excuse of it that i am more accustomed to handle a rifle than a pen and cannot make any pretence to the grand literary flights and flourishes which i see in novelsfor sometimes i like to read a novel
i suppose theythe flights and flourishesare desirable and i regret not being able to supply them but at the same time i cannot help thinking that simple things are always the most impressive and that books are easier to understand when they are written in plain language though perhaps i have no right to set up an opinion on such a matter
a sharp spear runs the kukuana saying needs no polish and on the same principle i venture to hope that a true story however strange it may be does not require to be decked out in fine words
allan quatermain
i discovered eight varieties of antelope with which i was previously totally unacquainted and many new species of plants for the most part of the bulbous tribeaq
king solomons mines i meet sir henry curtis it is a curious thing that at my agefiftyfive last birthdayi should find myself taking up a pen to try to write a history
i wonder what sort of a history it will be when i have finished it if ever i come to the end of the trip
i have done a good many things in my life which seems a long one to me owing to my having begun work so young perhaps
at an age when other boys are at school i was earning my living as a trader in the old colony
i have been trading hunting fighting or mining ever since
and yet it is only eight months ago that i made my pile
it is a big pile now that i have got iti dont yet know how bigbut i do not think i would go through the last fifteen or sixteen months again for it no not if i knew that i should come out safe at the end pile and all
but then i am a timid man and dislike violence moreover i am almost sick of adventure
i wonder why i am going to write this book it is not in my line
i am not a literary man though very devoted to the old testament and also to the ingoldsby legends let me try to set down my reasons just to see if i have any
first reason because sir henry curtis and captain john good asked me
second reason because i am laid up here at durban with the pain in my left leg
ever since that confounded lion got hold of me i have been liable to this trouble and being rather bad just now it makes me limp more than ever
there must be some poison in a lions teeth otherwise how is it that when your wounds are healed they break out again generally mark you at the same time of year that you got your mauling
it is a hard thing when one has shot sixtyfive lions or more as i have in the course of my life that the sixtysixth should chew your leg like a quid of tobacco
it breaks the routine of the thing and putting other considerations aside i am an orderly man and dont like that
this is by the way
third reason because i want my boy harry who is over there at the hospital in london studying to become a doctor to have something to amuse him and keep him out of mischief for a week or so
hospital work must sometimes pall and grow rather dull for even of cutting up dead bodies there may come satiety and as this history will not be dull whatever else it may be it will put a little life into things for a day or two while harry is reading of our adventures
fourth reason and last because i am going to tell the strangest story that i remember
it may seem a queer thing to say especially considering that there is no woman in itexcept foulata
stop though
there is gagaoola if she was a woman and not a fiend
but she was a hundred at least and therefore not marriageable so i dont count her
at any rate i can safely say that there is not a petticoat in the whole history
well i had better come to the yoke
it is a stiff place and i feel as though i were bogged up to the axle
but sutjes sutjes as the boers sayi am sure i dont know how they spell itsoftly does it
a strong team will come through at last that is if they are not too poor
you can never do anything with poor oxen
now to make a start
i allan quatermain of durban natal gentleman make oath and saythats how i headed my deposition before the magistrate about poor khivas and ventvgels sad deaths but somehow it doesnt seem quite the right way to begin a book
and besides am i a gentleman
what is a gentleman
i dont quite know and yet i have had to do with niggersno i will scratch out that word niggers for i do not like it
ive known natives who are and so you will say harry my boy before you have done with this tale and i have known mean whites with lots of money and fresh out from home too who are not
at any rate i was born a gentleman though i have been nothing but a poor travelling trader and hunter all my life
whether i have remained so i know not you must judge of that
heaven knows ive tried
i have killed many men in my time yet i have never slain wantonly or stained my hand in innocent blood but only in selfdefence
the almighty gave us our lives and i suppose he meant us to defend them at least i have always acted on that and i hope it will not be brought up against me when my clock strikes
there there it is a cruel and a wicked world and for a timid man i have been mixed up in a great deal of fighting
i cannot tell the rights of it but at any rate i have never stolen though once i cheated a kafir out of a herd of cattle
but then he had done me a dirty turn and it has troubled me ever since into the bargain
well it is eighteen months or so ago since first i met sir henry curtis and captain good
it was in this way
i had been up elephant hunting beyond bamangwato and had met with bad luck
everything went wrong that trip and to top up with i got the fever badly
so soon as i was well enough i trekked down to the diamond fields sold such ivory as i had together with my wagon and oxen discharged my hunters and took the postcart to the cape
after spending a week in cape town finding that they overcharged me at the hotel and having seen everything there was to see including the botanical gardens which seem to me likely to confer a great benefit on the country and the new houses of parliament which i expect will do nothing of the sort i determined to go back to natal by the dunkeld then lying at the docks waiting for the edinburgh castle due in from england
i took my berth and went aboard and that afternoon the natal passengers from the edinburgh castle transhipped and we weighed and put to sea
among these passengers who came on board were two who excited my curiosity
one a gentleman of about thirty was perhaps the biggestchested and longestarmed man i ever saw
he had yellow hair a thick yellow beard clearcut features and large grey eyes set deep in his head
i never saw a finerlooking man and somehow he reminded me of an ancient dane
not that i know much of ancient danes though i knew a modern dane who did me out of ten pounds but i remember once seeing a picture of some of those gentry who i take it were a kind of white zulus
they were drinking out of big horns and their long hair hung down their backs
as i looked at my friend standing there by the companionladder i thought that if he only let his grow a little put one of those chain shirts on to his great shoulders and took hold of a battleaxe and a horn mug he might have sat as a model for that picture
and by the way it is a curious thing and just shows how the blood will out i discovered afterwards that sir henry curtis for that was the big mans name is of danish blood
he also reminded me strongly of somebody else but at the time i could not remember who it was
mr quatermains ideas about ancient danes seem to be rather confused we have always understood that they were darkhaired people
probably he was thinking of saxonseditor
the other man who stood talking to sir henry was stout and dark and of quite a different cut
i suspected at once that he was a naval officer i dont know why but it is difficult to mistake a navy man
i have gone shooting trips with several of them in the course of my life and they have always proved themselves the best and bravest and nicest fellows i ever met though sadly given some of them to the use of profane language
i asked a page or two back what is a gentleman
ill answer the question now a royal naval officer is in a general sort of way though of course there may be a black sheep among them here and there
i fancy it is just the wide seas and the breath of gods winds that wash their hearts and blow the bitterness out of their minds and make them what men ought to be
well to return i proved right again i ascertained that the dark man was a naval officer a lieutenant of thirtyone who after seventeen years service had been turned out of her majestys employ with the barren honour of a commanders rank because it was impossible that he should be promoted
this is what people who serve the queen have to expect to be shot out into the cold world to find a living just when they are beginning really to understand their work and to reach the prime of life
i suppose they dont mind it but for my own part i had rather earn my bread as a hunter
ones halfpence are as scarce perhaps but you do not get so many kicks
the officers name i found outby referring to the passengers listswas goodcaptain john good
he was broad of medium height dark stout and rather a curious man to look at
he was so very neat and so very cleanshaved and he always wore an eyeglass in his right eye
it seemed to grow there for it had no string and he never took it out except to wipe it
at first i thought he used to sleep in it but afterwards i found that this was a mistake
he put it in his trousers pocket when he went to bed together with his false teeth of which he had two beautiful sets that my own being none of the best have often caused me to break the tenth commandment
but i am anticipating
soon after we had got under way evening closed in and brought with it very dirty weather
a keen breeze sprung up off land and a kind of aggravated scotch mist soon drove everybody from the deck
as for the dunkeld she is a flatbottomed punt and going up light as she was she rolled very heavily
it almost seemed as though she would go right over but she never did
it was quite impossible to walk about so i stood near the engines where it was warm and amused myself with watching the pendulum which was fixed opposite to me swinging slowly backwards and forwards as the vessel rolled and marking the angle she touched at each lurch
that pendulums wrong it is not properly weighted suddenly said a somewhat testy voice at my shoulder
looking round i saw the naval officer whom i had noticed when the passengers came aboard
indeed now what makes you think so i asked
think so
i dont think at all
why thereas she righted herself after a rollif the ship had really rolled to the degree that thing pointed to then she would never have rolled again thats all
but it is just like these merchant skippers they are always so confoundedly careless just then the dinnerbell rang and i was not sorry for it is a dreadful thing to have to listen to an officer of the royal navy when he gets on to that subject
i only know one worse thing and that is to hear a merchant skipper express his candid opinion of officers of the royal navy
captain good and i went down to dinner together and there we found sir henry curtis already seated
he and captain good were placed together and i sat opposite to them
the captain and i soon fell into talk about shooting and what not he asking me many questions for he is very inquisitive about all sorts of things and i answering them as well as i could
presently he got on to elephants
ah sir called out somebody who was sitting near me youve reached the right man for that hunter quatermain should be able to tell you about elephants if anybody can sir henry who had been sitting quite quiet listening to our talk started visibly
excuse me sir he said leaning forward across the table and speaking in a low deep voice a very suitable voice it seemed to me to come out of those great lungs
excuse me sir but is your name allan quatermain i said that it was
the big man made no further remark but i heard him mutter fortunate into his beard
presently dinner came to an end and as we were leaving the saloon sir henry strolled up and asked me if i would come into his cabin to smoke a pipe
i accepted and he led the way to the dunkeld deck cabin and a very good cabin it is
it had been two cabins but when sir garnet wolseley or one of those big swells went down the coast in the dunkeld they knocked away the partition and have never put it up again
there was a sofa in the cabin and a little table in front of it
sir henry sent the steward for a bottle of whisky and the three of us sat down and lit our pipes
mr
quatermain said sir henry curtis when the man had brought the whisky and lit the lamp the year before last about this time you were i believe at a place called bamangwato to the north of the transvaal i was i answered rather surprised that this gentleman should be so well acquainted with my movements which were not so far as i was aware considered of general interest
you were trading there were you not put in captain good in his quick way
i was
i took up a wagonload of goods made a camp outside the settlement and stopped till i had sold them sir henry was sitting opposite to me in a madeira chair his arms leaning on the table
he now looked up fixing his large grey eyes full upon my face
there was a curious anxiety in them i thought
did you happen to meet a man called neville there oh yes he outspanned alongside of me for a fortnight to rest his oxen before going on to the interior
i had a letter from a lawyer a few months back asking me if i knew what had become of him which i answered to the best of my ability at the time yes said sir henry your letter was forwarded to me
you said in it that the gentleman called neville left bamangwato at the beginning of may in a wagon with a driver a voorlooper and a kafir hunter called jim announcing his intention of trekking if possible as far as inyati the extreme trading post in the matabele country where he would sell his wagon and proceed on foot
you also said that he did sell his wagon for six months afterwards you saw the wagon in the possession of a portuguese trader who told you that he had bought it at inyati from a white man whose name he had forgotten and that he believed the white man with the native servant had started off for the interior on a shooting trip yes then came a pause
mr
quatermain said sir henry suddenly i suppose you know or can guess nothing more of the reasons of myof mr nevilles journey to the northward or as to what point that journey was directed i heard something i answered and stopped
the subject was one which i did not care to discuss
sir henry and captain good looked at each other and captain good nodded
mr
quatermain went on the former i am going to tell you a story and ask your advice and perhaps your assistance
the agent who forwarded me your letter told me that i might rely on it implicitly as you were he said well known and universally respected in natal and especially noted for your discretion i bowed and drank some whisky and water to hide my confusion for i am a modest manand sir henry went on
mr
neville was my brother oh i said starting for now i knew of whom sir henry had reminded me when first i saw him
his brother was a much smaller man and had a dark beard but now that i thought of it he possessed eyes of the same shade of grey and with the same keen look in them the features too were not unlike
he was went on sir henry my only and younger brother and till five years ago i do not suppose that we were ever a month away from each other
but just about five years ago a misfortune befell us as sometimes does happen in families
we quarrelled bitterly and i behaved unjustly to my brother in my anger here captain good nodded his head vigorously to himself
the ship gave a big roll just then so that the lookingglass which was fixed opposite us to starboard was for a moment nearly over our heads and as i was sitting with my hands in my pockets and staring upwards i could see him nodding like anything
as i daresay you know went on sir henry if a man dies intestate and has no property but land real property it is called in england it all descends to his eldest son
it so happened that just at the time when we quarrelled our father died intestate
he had put off making his will until it was too late
the result was that my brother who had not been brought up to any profession was left without a penny
of course it would have been my duty to provide for him but at the time the quarrel between us was so bitter that i did notto my shame i say it and he sighed deeplyoffer to do anything
it was not that i grudged him justice but i waited for him to make advances and he made none
i am sorry to trouble you with all this mr quatermain but i must to make things clear eh good quite so quite so said the captain
mr
quatermain will i am sure keep this history to himself of course said i for i rather pride myself on my discretion for which as sir henry had heard i have some repute
well went on sir henry my brother had a few hundred pounds to his account at the time
without saying anything to me he drew out this paltry sum and having adopted the name of neville started off for south africa in the wild hope of making a fortune
this i learned afterwards
some three years passed and i heard nothing of my brother though i wrote several times
doubtless the letters never reached him
but as time went on i grew more and more troubled about him
i found out mr quatermain that blood is thicker than water thats true said i thinking of my boy harry
i found out mr quatermain that i would have given half my fortune to know that my brother george the only relation i possess was safe and well and that i should see him again but you never did curtis jerked out captain good glancing at the big mans face
well mr quatermain as time went on i became more and more anxious to find out if my brother was alive or dead and if alive to get him home again
i set enquiries on foot and your letter was one of the results
so far as it went it was satisfactory for it showed that till lately george was alive but it did not go far enough
so to cut a long story short i made up my mind to come out and look for him myself and captain good was so kind as to come with me yes said the captain nothing else to do you see
turned out by my lords of the admiralty to starve on half pay
and now perhaps sir you will tell us what you know or have heard of the gentleman called neville the legend of solomons mines what was it that you heard about my brothers journey at bamangwato asked sir henry as i paused to fill my pipe before replying to captain good
i heard this i answered and i have never mentioned it to a soul till today
i heard that he was starting for solomons mines solomons mines ejaculated both my hearers at once
where are they i dont know i said i know where they are said to be
once i saw the peaks of the mountains that border them but there were a hundred and thirty miles of desert between me and them and i am not aware that any white man ever got across it save one
but perhaps the best thing i can do is to tell you the legend of solomons mines as i know it you passing your word not to reveal anything i tell you without my permission
do you agree to that
i have my reasons for asking sir henry nodded and captain good replied certainly certainly well i began as you may guess generally speaking elephant hunters are a rough set of men who do not trouble themselves with much beyond the facts of life and the ways of kafirs
but here and there you meet a man who takes the trouble to collect traditions from the natives and tries to make out a little piece of the history of this dark land
it was such a man as this who first told me the legend of solomons mines now a matter of nearly thirty years ago
that was when i was on my first elephant hunt in the matabele country
his name was evans and he was killed the following year poor fellow by a wounded buffalo and lies buried near the zambesi falls
i was telling evans one night i remember of some wonderful workings i had found whilst hunting koodoo and eland in what is now the lydenburg district of the transvaal
i see they have come across these workings again lately in prospecting for gold but i knew of them years ago
there is a great wide wagon road cut out of the solid rock and leading to the mouth of the working or gallery
inside the mouth of this gallery are stacks of gold quartz piled up ready for roasting which shows that the workers whoever they were must have left in a hurry
also about twenty paces in the gallery is built across and a beautiful bit of masonry it is ay said evans but i will spin you a queerer yarn than that and he went on to tell me how he had found in the far interior a ruined city which he believed to be the ophir of the bible and by the way other more learned men have said the same long since poor evanss time
i was i remember listening openeared to all these wonders for i was young at the time and this story of an ancient civilisation and of the treasures which those old jewish or phoenician adventurers used to extract from a country long since lapsed into the darkest barbarism took a great hold upon my imagination when suddenly he said to me lad did you ever hear of the suliman mountains up to the northwest of the mushakulumbwe country i told him i never had
ah well he said that is where solomon really had his mines his diamond mines i mean how do you know that i asked
know it
why what is suliman but a corruption of solomon
besides an old isanusi or witch doctoress up in the manica country told me all about it
she said that the people who lived across those mountains were a branch of the zulus speaking a dialect of zulu but finer and bigger men even that there lived among them great wizards who had learnt their art from white men when all the world was dark and who had the secret of a wonderful mine of bright stones suliman is the arabic form of solomoneditor
well i laughed at this story at the time though it interested me for the diamond fields were not discovered then but poor evans went off and was killed and for twenty years i never thought any more of the matter
however just twenty years afterwardsand that is a long time gentlemen an elephant hunter does not often live for twenty years at his businessi heard something more definite about sulimans mountains and the country which lies beyond them
i was up beyond the manica country at a place called sitandas kraal and a miserable place it was for a man could get nothing to eat and there was but little game about
i had an attack of fever and was in a bad way generally when one day a portugee arrived with a single companiona halfbreed
now i know your lowclass delagoa portugee well
there is no greater devil unhung in a general way battening as he does upon human agony and flesh in the shape of slaves
but this was quite a different type of man to the mean fellows whom i had been accustomed to meet indeed in appearance he reminded me more of the polite doms i have read about for he was tall and thin with large dark eyes and curling grey mustachios
we talked together for a while for he could speak broken english and i understood a little portugee and he told me that his name was jos silvestre and that he had a place near delagoa bay
when he went on next day with his halfbreed companion he said goodbye taking off his hat quite in the old style
goodbye seor he said if ever we meet again i shall be the richest man in the world and i will remember you i laughed a littlei was too weak to laugh muchand watched him strike out for the great desert to the west wondering if he was mad or what he thought he was going to find there
a week passed and i got the better of my fever
one evening i was sitting on the ground in front of the little tent i had with me chewing the last leg of a miserable fowl i had bought from a native for a bit of cloth worth twenty fowls and staring at the hot red sun sinking down over the desert when suddenly i saw a figure apparently that of a european for it wore a coat on the slope of the rising ground opposite to me about three hundred yards away
the figure crept along on its hands and knees then it got up and staggered forward a few yards on its legs only to fall and crawl again
seeing that it must be somebody in distress i sent one of my hunters to help him and presently he arrived and who do you suppose it turned out to be jos silvestre of course said captain good
yes jos silvestre or rather his skeleton and a little skin
his face was a bright yellow with bilious fever and his large dark eyes stood nearly out of his head for all the flesh had gone
there was nothing but yellow parchmentlike skin white hair and the gaunt bones sticking up beneath
water
for the sake of christ water he moaned and i saw that his lips were cracked and his tongue which protruded between them was swollen and blackish
i gave him water with a little milk in it and he drank it in great gulps two quarts or so without stopping
i would not let him have any more
then the fever took him again and he fell down and began to rave about sulimans mountains and the diamonds and the desert
i carried him into the tent and did what i could for him which was little enough but i saw how it must end
about eleven oclock he grew quieter and i lay down for a little rest and went to sleep
at dawn i woke again and in the half light saw silvestre sitting up a strange gaunt form and gazing out towards the desert
presently the first ray of the sun shot right across the wide plain before us till it reached the faraway crest of one of the tallest of the suliman mountains more than a hundred miles away
there it is cried the dying man in portuguese and pointing with his long thin arm but i shall never reach it never
no one will ever reach it suddenly he paused and seemed to take a resolution
friend he said turning towards me are you there
my eyes grow dark yes i said yes lie down now and rest ay he answered i shall rest soon i have time to restall eternity
listen i am dying
you have been good to me
i will give you the writing
perhaps you will get there if you can live to pass the desert which has killed my poor servant and me then he groped in his shirt and brought out what i thought was a boer tobacco pouch made of the skin of the swartvetpens or sable antelope
it was fastened with a little strip of hide what we call a rimpi and this he tried to loose but could not
he handed it to me
untie it he said
i did so and extracted a bit of torn yellow linen on which something was written in rusty letters
inside this rag was a paper
then he went on feebly for he was growing weak the paper has all that is on the linen
it took me years to read
listen my ancestor a political refugee from lisbon and one of the first portuguese who landed on these shores wrote that when he was dying on those mountains which no white foot ever pressed before or since
his name was jos da silvestra and he lived three hundred years ago
his slave who waited for him on this side of the mountains found him dead and brought the writing home to delagoa
it has been in the family ever since but none have cared to read it till at last i did
and i have lost my life over it but another may succeed and become the richest man in the worldthe richest man in the world
only give it to no one seor go yourself then he began to wander again and in an hour it was all over
god rest him
he died very quietly and i buried him deep with big boulders on his breast so i do not think that the jackals can have dug him up
and then i came away ay but the document said sir henry in a tone of deep interest
yes the document what was in it added the captain
well gentlemen if you like i will tell you
i have never showed it to anybody yet except to a drunken old portuguese trader who translated it for me and had forgotten all about it by the next morning
the original rag is at my home in durban together with poor dom joss translation but i have the english rendering in my pocketbook and a facsimile of the map if it can be called a map
here it is i jos da silvestra who am now dying of hunger in the little cave where no snow is on the north side of the nipple of the southernmost of the two mountains i have named shebas breasts write this in the year with a cleft bone upon a remnant of my raiment my blood being the ink
if my slave should find it when he comes and should bring it to delagoa let my friend name illegible bring the matter to the knowledge of the king that he may send an army which if they live through the desert and the mountains and can overcome the brave kukuanes and their devilish arts to which end many priests should be brought will make him the richest king since solomon
with my own eyes i have seen the countless diamonds stored in solomons treasure chamber behind the white death but through the treachery of gagool the witchfinder i might bring nought away scarcely my life
let him who comes follow the map and climb the snow of shebas left breast till he reaches the nipple on the north side of which is the great road solomon made from whence three days journey to the kings palace
let him kill gagool
pray for my soul
farewell

illustration messen sketch map of the route to king solomons mines when i had finished reading the above and shown the copy of the map drawn by the dying hand of the old dom with his blood for ink there followed a silence of astonishment
well said captain good i have been round the world twice and put in at most ports but may i be hung for a mutineer if ever i heard a yarn like this out of a story book or in it either for the matter of that its a queer tale mr quatermain said sir henry
i suppose you are not hoaxing us
it is i know sometimes thought allowable to take in a greenhorn if you think that sir henry i said much put out and pocketing my paperfor i do not like to be thought one of those silly fellows who consider it witty to tell lies and who are for ever boasting to newcomers of extraordinary hunting adventures which never happenedif you think that why there is an end to the matter and i rose to go
sir henry laid his large hand upon my shoulder
sit down mr quatermain he said i beg your pardon i see very well you do not wish to deceive us but the story sounded so strange that i could hardly believe it you shall see the original map and writing when we reach durban i answered somewhat mollified for really when i came to consider the question it was scarcely wonderful that he should doubt my good faith
but i went on i have not told you about your brother
i knew the man jim who was with him
he was a bechuana by birth a good hunter and for a native a very clever man
that morning on which mr neville was starting i saw jim standing by my wagon and cutting up tobacco on the disselboom
jim said i where are you off to this trip
it is elephants no baas he answered we are after something worth much more than ivory and what might that be i said for i was curious
is it gold no baas something worth more than gold and he grinned
i asked no more questions for i did not like to lower my dignity by seeming inquisitive but i was puzzled
presently jim finished cutting his tobacco
baas said he
i took no notice
baas said he again
eh boy what is it i asked
baas we are going after diamonds diamonds
why then you are steering in the wrong direction you should head for the fields baas have you ever heard of sulimans bergthat is solomons mountains sir henry
ay have you ever heard of the diamonds there i have heard a foolish story jim it is no story baas
once i knew a woman who came from there and reached natal with her child she told meshe is dead now your master will feed the aasvgelsthat is vulturesjim if he tries to reach sulimans country and so will you if they can get any pickings off your worthless old carcass said i
he grinned
mayhap baas
man must die id rather like to try a new country myself the elephants are getting worked out about here ah
my boy i said you wait till the pale old man gets a grip of your yellow throat and then we shall hear what sort of a tune you sing half an hour after that i saw nevilles wagon move off
presently jim came back running
goodbye baas he said
i didnt like to start without bidding you goodbye for i daresay you are right and that we shall never trek south again is your master really going to sulimans berg jim or are you lying no he answered he is going
he told me he was bound to make his fortune somehow or try to so he might as well have a fling for the diamonds oh i said wait a bit jim will you take a note to your master jim and promise not to give it to him till you reach inyati which was some hundred miles off
yes baas so i took a scrap of paper and wrote on it let him who comes
climb the snow of shebas left breast till he reaches the nipple on the north side of which is solomons great road now jim i said when you give this to your master tell him he had better follow the advice on it implicitly
you are not to give it to him now because i dont want him back asking me questions which i wont answer
now be off you idle fellow the wagon is nearly out of sight jim took the note and went and that is all i know about your brother sir henry but i am much afraid mr
quatermain said sir henry i am going to look for my brother i am going to trace him to sulimans mountains and over them if necessary till i find him or until i know that he is dead
will you come with me i am as i think i have said a cautious man indeed a timid one and this suggestion frightened me
it seemed to me that to undertake such a journey would be to go to certain death and putting other considerations aside as i had a son to support i could not afford to die just then
no thank you sir henry i think i had rather not i answered
i am too old for wildgoose chases of that sort and we should only end up like my poor friend silvestre
i have a son dependent on me so i cannot afford to risk my life foolishly both sir henry and captain good looked very disappointed
mr
quatermain said the former i am well off and i am bent upon this business
you may put the remuneration for your services at whatever figure you like in reason and it shall be paid over to you before we start
moreover i will arrange in the event of anything untoward happening to us or to you that your son shall be suitably provided for
you will see from this offer how necessary i think your presence
also if by chance we should reach this place and find diamonds they shall belong to you and good equally
i do not want them
but of course that promise is worth nothing at all though the same thing would apply to any ivory we might get
you may pretty well make your own terms with me mr quatermain and of course i shall pay all expenses sir henry said i this is the most liberal proposal i ever had and one not to be sneezed at by a poor hunter and trader
but the job is the biggest i have come across and i must take time to think it over
i will give you my answer before we get to durban very good answered sir henry
then i said goodnight and turned in and dreamt about poor longdead silvestre and the diamonds
umbopa enters our service it takes from four to five days according to the speed of the vessel and the state of the weather to run up from the cape to durban
sometimes if the landing is bad at east london where they have not yet made that wonderful harbour they talk so much of and sink such a mint of money in a ship is delayed for twentyfour hours before the cargo boats can get out to take off the goods
but on this occasion we had not to wait at all for there were no breakers on the bar to speak of and the tugs came out at once with the long strings of ugly flatbottomed boats behind them into which the packages were bundled with a crash
it did not matter what they might be over they went slapbang whether they contained china or woollen goods they met with the same treatment
i saw one case holding four dozen of champagne smashed all to bits and there was the champagne fizzing and boiling about in the bottom of the dirty cargo boat
it was a wicked waste and evidently so the kafirs in the boat thought for they found a couple of unbroken bottles and knocking off the necks drank the contents
but they had not allowed for the expansion caused by the fizz in the wine and feeling themselves swelling rolled about in the bottom of the boat calling out that the good liquor was tagatithat is bewitched
i spoke to them from the vessel and told them it was the white mans strongest medicine and that they were as good as dead men
those kafirs went to the shore in a very great fright and i do not think that they will touch champagne again
well all the time that we were steaming up to natal i was thinking over sir henry curtiss offer
we did not speak any more on the subject for a day or two though i told them many hunting yarns all true ones
there is no need to tell lies about hunting for so many curious things happen within the knowledge of a man whose business it is to hunt but this is by the way
at last one beautiful evening in january which is our hottest month we steamed past the coast of natal expecting to make durban point by sunset
it is a lovely coast all along from east london with its red sandhills and wide sweeps of vivid green dotted here and there with kafir kraals and bordered by a ribbon of white surf which spouts up in pillars of foam where it hits the rocks
but just before you come to durban there is a peculiar richness about the landscape
there are the sheer kloofs cut in the hills by the rushing rains of centuries down which the rivers sparkle there is the deepest green of the bush growing as god planted it and the other greens of the mealie gardens and the sugar patches while now and again a white house smiling out at the placid sea puts a finish and gives an air of homeliness to the scene
for to my mind however beautiful a view may be it requires the presence of man to make it complete but perhaps that is because i have lived so much in the wilderness and therefore know the value of civilisation though to be sure it drives away the game
the garden of eden no doubt looked fair before man was but i always think that it must have been fairer when eve adorned it
to return we had miscalculated a little and the sun was well down before we dropped anchor off the point and heard the gun which told the good folks of durban that the english mail was in
it was too late to think of getting over the bar that night so we went comfortably to dinner after seeing the mails carried off in the lifeboat
when we came up again the moon was out and shining so brightly over sea and shore that she almost paled the quick large flashes from the lighthouse
from the shore floated sweet spicy odours that always remind me of hymns and missionaries and in the windows of the houses on the berea sparkled a hundred lights
from a large brig lying near also came the music of the sailors as they worked at getting the anchor up in order to be ready for the wind
altogether it was a perfect night such a night as you sometimes get in southern africa and it threw a garment of peace over everybody as the moon threw a garment of silver over everything
even the great bulldog belonging to a sporting passenger seemed to yield to its gentle influences and forgetting his yearning to come to close quarters with the baboon in a cage on the focsle snored happily at the door of the cabin dreaming no doubt that he had finished him and happy in his dream
we threethat is sir henry curtis captain good and myselfwent and sat by the wheel and were quiet for a while
well mr quatermain said sir henry presently have you been thinking about my proposals ay echoed captain good what do you think of them mr quatermain
i hope that you are going to give us the pleasure of your company so far as solomons mines or wherever the gentleman you knew as neville may have got to i rose and knocked out my pipe before i answered
i had not made up my mind and wanted an additional moment to decide
before the burning tobacco had fallen into the sea i had decided just that little extra second did the trick
it is often the way when you have been bothering a long time over a thing
yes gentlemen i said sitting down again i will go and by your leave i will tell you why and on what conditions
first for the terms which i ask

you are to pay all expenses and any ivory or other valuables we may get is to be divided between captain good and myself

that you give me for my services on the trip before we start i undertaking to serve you faithfully till you choose to abandon the enterprise or till we succeed or disaster overtakes us

that before we trek you execute a deed agreeing in the event of my death or disablement to pay my boy harry who is studying medicine over there in london at guys hospital a sum of a year for five years by which time he ought to be able to earn a living for himself if he is worth his salt
that is all i think and i daresay you will say quite enough too no answered sir henry i accept them gladly
i am bent upon this project and would pay more than that for your help considering the peculiar and exclusive knowledge which you possess pity i did not ask it then but i wont go back on my word
and now that i have got my terms i will tell you my reasons for making up my mind to go
first of all gentlemen i have been observing you both for the last few days and if you will not think me impertinent i may say that i like you and believe that we shall come up well to the yoke together
that is something let me tell you when one has a long journey like this before one
and now as to the journey itself i tell you flatly sir henry and captain good that i do not think it probable we can come out of it alive that is if we attempt to cross the suliman mountains
what was the fate of the old dom da silvestra three hundred years ago
what was the fate of his descendant twenty years ago
what has been your brothers fate
i tell you frankly gentlemen that as their fates were so i believe ours will be i paused to watch the effect of my words
captain good looked a little uncomfortable but sir henrys face did not change
we must take our chance he said
you may perhaps wonder i went on why if i think this i who am as i told you a timid man should undertake such a journey
it is for two reasons
first i am a fatalist and believe that my time is appointed to come quite without reference to my own movements and will and that if i am to go to sulimans mountains to be killed i shall go there and shall be killed
god almighty no doubt knows his mind about me so i need not trouble on that point
secondly i am a poor man
for nearly forty years i have hunted and traded but i have never made more than a living
well gentlemen i dont know if you are aware that the average life of an elephant hunter from the time he takes to the trade is between four and five years
so you see i have lived through about seven generations of my class and i should think that my time cannot be far off anyway
now if anything were to happen to me in the ordinary course of business by the time my debts are paid there would be nothing left to support my son harry whilst he was getting in the way of earning a living whereas now he will be set up for five years
there is the whole affair in a nutshell mr
quatermain said sir henry who had been giving me his most serious attention your motives for undertaking an enterprise which you believe can only end in disaster reflect a great deal of credit on you
whether or not you are right of course time and the event alone can show
but whether you are right or wrong i may as well tell you at once that i am going through with it to the end sweet or bitter
if we are to be knocked on the head all i have to say is that i hope we get a little shooting first eh good yes yes put in the captain
we have all three of us been accustomed to face danger and to hold our lives in our hands in various ways so it is no good turning back now
and now i vote we go down to the saloon and take an observation just for luck you know and we didthrough the bottom of a tumbler
next day we went ashore and i put up sir henry and captain good at the little shanty i have built on the berea and which i call my home
there are only three rooms and a kitchen in it and it is constructed of green brick with a galvanised iron roof but there is a good garden with the best loquot trees in it that i know and some nice young mangoes of which i hope great things
the curator of the botanical gardens gave them to me
it is looked after by an old hunter of mine named jack whose thigh was so badly broken by a buffalo cow in sikukunis country that he will never hunt again
but he can potter about and garden being a griqua by birth
you will never persuade a zulu to take much interest in gardening
it is a peaceful art and peaceful arts are not in his line
sir henry and good slept in a tent pitched in my little grove of orange trees at the end of the garden for there was no room for them in the house and what with the smell of the bloom and the sight of the green and golden fruitin durban you will see all three on the tree togetheri daresay it is a pleasant place enough for we have few mosquitos here on the berea unless there happens to come an unusually heavy rain
well to get onfor if i do not harry you will be tired of my story before ever we fetch up at sulimans mountainshaving once made up my mind to go i set about making the necessary preparations
first i secured the deed from sir henry providing for you my boy in case of accidents
there was some difficulty about its legal execution as sir henry was a stranger here and the property to be charged is over the water but it was ultimately got over with the help of a lawyer who charged for the joba price that i thought outrageous
then i pocketed my cheque for
having paid this tribute to my bump of caution i purchased a wagon and a span of oxen on sir henrys behalf and beauties they were
it was a twentytwofoot wagon with iron axles very strong very light and built throughout of stink wood not quite a new one having been to the diamond fields and back but in my opinion all the better for that for i could see that the wood was well seasoned
if anything is going to give in a wagon or if there is green wood in it it will show out on the first trip
this particular vehicle was what we call a halftented wagon that is to say only covered in over the after twelve feet leaving all the front part free for the necessaries we had to carry with us
in this after part were a hide cartle or bed on which two people could sleep also racks for rifles and many other little conveniences
i gave for it and think that it was cheap at the price
then i bought a beautiful team of twenty zulu oxen which i had kept my eye on for a year or two
sixteen oxen is the usual number for a team but i took four extra to allow for casualties
these zulu cattle are small and light not more than half the size of the africander oxen which are generally used for transport purposes but they will live where the africanders would starve and with a moderate load can make five miles a day better going being quicker and not so liable to become footsore
what is more this lot were thoroughly salted that is they had worked all over south africa and so had become proof comparatively speaking against red water which so frequently destroys whole teams of oxen when they get on to strange veldt or grass country
as for lung sick which is a dreadful form of pneumonia very prevalent in this country they had all been inoculated against it
this is done by cutting a slit in the tail of an ox and binding in a piece of the diseased lung of an animal which has died of the sickness
the result is that the ox sickens takes the disease in a mild form which causes its tail to drop off as a rule about a foot from the root and becomes proof against future attacks
it seems cruel to rob the animal of his tail especially in a country where there are so many flies but it is better to sacrifice the tail and keep the ox than to lose both tail and ox for a tail without an ox is not much good except to dust with
still it does look odd to trek along behind twenty stumps where there ought to be tails
it seems as though nature made a trifling mistake and stuck the stern ornaments of a lot of prize bulldogs on to the rumps of the oxen
next came the question of provisioning and medicines one which required the most careful consideration for what we had to do was to avoid lumbering the wagon and yet to take everything absolutely necessary
fortunately it turned out that good is a bit of a doctor having at some point in his previous career managed to pass through a course of medical and surgical instruction which he has more or less kept up
he is not of course qualified but he knows more about it than many a man who can write md
after his name as we found out afterwards and he had a splendid travelling medicine chest and a set of instruments
whilst we were at durban he cut off a kafirs big toe in a way which it was a pleasure to see
but he was quite nonplussed when the kafir who had sat stolidly watching the operation asked him to put on another saying that a white one would do at a pinch
there remained when these questions were satisfactorily settled two further important points for consideration namely that of arms and that of servants
as to the arms i cannot do better than put down a list of those which we finally decided on from among the ample store that sir henry had brought with him from england and those which i owned
i copy it from my pocketbook where i made the entry at the time
three heavy breechloading doubleeight elephant guns weighing about fifteen pounds each to carry a charge of eleven drachms of black powder two of these were by a wellknown london firm most excellent makers but i do not know by whom mine which is not so highly finished was made
i have used it on several trips and shot a good many elephants with it and it has always proved a most superior weapon thoroughly to be relied on
three double expresses constructed to stand a charge of six drachms sweet weapons and admirable for mediumsized game such as eland or sable antelope or for men especially in an open country and with the semihollow bullet
one double no
centralfire keepers shotgun full choke both barrels this gun proved of the greatest service to us afterwards in shooting game for the pot
three winchester repeating rifles not carbines spare guns
three singleaction colts revolvers with the heavier or american pattern of cartridge this was our total armament and doubtless the reader will observe that the weapons of each class were of the same make and calibre so that the cartridges were interchangeable a very important point
i make no apology for detailing it at length as every experienced hunter will know how vital a proper supply of guns and ammunition is to the success of an expedition
now as to the men who were to go with us
after much consultation we decided that their number should be limited to five namely a driver a leader and three servants
the driver and leader i found without much difficulty two zulus named respectively goza and tom but to get the servants proved a more difficult matter
it was necessary that they should be thoroughly trustworthy and brave men as in a business of this sort our lives might depend upon their conduct
at last i secured two one a hottentot named ventvgel or windbird and one a little zulu named khiva who had the merit of speaking english perfectly
ventvgel i had known before he was one of the most perfect spoorers that is game trackers i ever had to do with and tough as whipcord
he never seemed to tire
but he had one failing so common with his race drink
put him within reach of a bottle of gin and you could not trust him
however as we were going beyond the region of grogshops this little weakness of his did not so much matter
having secured these two men i looked in vain for a third to suit my purpose so we determined to start without one trusting to luck to find a suitable man on our way up country
but as it happened on the evening before the day we had fixed for our departure the zulu khiva informed me that a kafir was waiting to see me
accordingly when we had done dinner for we were at table at the time i told khiva to bring him in
presently a tall handsomelooking man somewhere about thirty years of age and very lightcoloured for a zulu entered and lifting his knobstick by way of salute squatted himself down in the corner on his haunches and sat silent
i did not take any notice of him for a while for it is a great mistake to do so
if you rush into conversation at once a zulu is apt to think you a person of little dignity or consequence
i observed however that he was a keshla or ringed man that is he wore on his head the black ring made of a species of gum polished with fat and worked up in the hair which is usually assumed by zulus on attaining a certain age or dignity
also it struck me that his face was familiar to me
well i said at last what is your name umbopa answered the man in a slow deep voice
i have seen your face before yes the inkoosi the chief my father saw my face at the place of the little handthat is isandhlwanaon the day before the battle then i remembered
i was one of lord chelmsfords guides in that unlucky zulu war and had the good fortune to leave the camp in charge of some wagons on the day before the battle
while i was waiting for the cattle to be inspanned i fell into conversation with this man who held some small command among the native auxiliaries and he had expressed to me his doubts as to the safety of the camp
at the time i told him to hold his tongue and leave such matters to wiser heads but afterwards i thought of his words
i remember i said what is it you want it is this macumazahn that is my kafir name and means the man who gets up in the middle of the night or in vulgar english he who keeps his eyes open
i hear that you go on a great expedition far into the north with the white chiefs from over the water
is it a true word it is i hear that you go even to the lukanga river a moons journey beyond the manica country
is this so also macumazahn why do you ask whither we go
what is it to you i answered suspiciously for the objects of our journey had been kept a dead secret
it is this o white men that if indeed you travel so far i would travel with you there was a certain assumption of dignity in the mans mode of speech and especially in his use of the words o white men instead of o inkosis or chiefs which struck me
you forget yourself a little i said
your words run out unawares
that is not the way to speak
what is your name and where is your kraal
tell us that we may know with whom we have to deal my name is umbopa
i am of the zulu people yet not of them
the house of my tribe is in the far north it was left behind when the zulus came down here a thousand years ago long before chaka reigned in zululand
i have no kraal
i have wandered for many years
i came from the north as a child to zululand
i was cetewayos man in the nkomabakosi regiment serving there under the great captain umslopogaasi of the axe who taught my hands to fight
afterwards i ran away from zululand and came to natal because i wanted to see the white mans ways
next i fought against cetewayo in the war
since then i have been working in natal
now i am tired and would go north again
here is not my place
i want no money but i am a brave man and am worth my place and meat
i have spoken for the history of umslopogaasi and his axe the reader is referred to the books called allan quatermain and nada the lilyeditor
i was rather puzzled by this man and his way of speech
it was evident to me from his manner that in the main he was telling the truth but somehow he seemed different from the ordinary run of zulus and i rather mistrusted his offer to come without pay
being in a difficulty i translated his words to sir henry and good and asked them their opinion
sir henry told me to ask him to stand up
umbopa did so at the same time slipping off the long military great coat which he wore and revealing himself naked except for the moocha round his centre and a necklace of lions claws
certainly he was a magnificentlooking man i never saw a finer native
standing about six foot three high he was broad in proportion and very shapely
in that light too his skin looked scarcely more than dark except here and there where deep black scars marked old assegai wounds
sir henry walked up to him and looked into his proud handsome face
they make a good pair dont they said good one as big as the other i like your looks mr umbopa and i will take you as my servant said sir henry in english
umbopa evidently understood him for he answered in zulu it is well and then added with a glance at the white mans great stature and breadth we are men thou and i an elephant hunt now i do not propose to narrate at full length all the incidents of our long travel up to sitandas kraal near the junction of the lukanga and kalukwe rivers
it was a journey of more than a thousand miles from durban the last three hundred or so of which we had to make on foot owing to the frequent presence of the dreadful tsetse fly whose bite is fatal to all animals except donkeys and men
we left durban at the end of january and it was in the second week of may that we camped near sitandas kraal
our adventures on the way were many and various but as they are of the sort which befall every african hunterwith one exception to be presently detailedi shall not set them down here lest i should render this history too wearisome
at inyati the outlying trading station in the matabele country of which lobengula a great and cruel scoundrel is king with many regrets we parted from our comfortable wagon
only twelve oxen remained to us out of the beautiful span of twenty which i had bought at durban
one we lost from the bite of a cobra three had perished from poverty and the want of water one strayed and the other three died from eating the poisonous herb called tulip five more sickened from this cause but we managed to cure them with doses of an infusion made by boiling down the tulip leaves
if administered in time this is a very effective antidote
the wagon and the oxen we left in the immediate charge of goza and tom our driver and leader both trustworthy boys requesting a worthy scotch missionary who lived in this distant place to keep an eye on them
then accompanied by umbopa khiva ventvgel and half a dozen bearers whom we hired on the spot we started off on foot upon our wild quest
i remember we were all a little silent on the occasion of this departure and i think that each of us was wondering if we should ever see our wagon again for my part i never expected to do so
for a while we tramped on in silence till umbopa who was marching in front broke into a zulu chant about how some brave men tired of life and the tameness of things started off into a vast wilderness to find new things or die and how lo and behold
when they had travelled far into the wilderness they found that it was not a wilderness at all but a beautiful place full of young wives and fat cattle of game to hunt and enemies to kill
then we all laughed and took it for a good omen
umbopa was a cheerful savage in a dignified sort of way when he was not suffering from one of his fits of brooding and he had a wonderful knack of keeping up our spirits
we all grew very fond of him
and now for the one adventure to which i am going to treat myself for i do dearly love a hunting yarn
about a fortnights march from inyati we came across a peculiarly beautiful bit of wellwatered woodland country
the kloofs in the hills were covered with dense bush idoro bush as the natives call it and in some places with the wachteenbeche or waitalittle thorn and there were great quantities of the lovely machabell tree laden with refreshing yellow fruit having enormous stones
this tree is the elephants favourite food and there were not wanting signs that the great brutes had been about for not only was their spoor frequent but in many places the trees were broken down and even uprooted
the elephant is a destructive feeder
one evening after a long days march we came to a spot of great loveliness
at the foot of a bushclad hill lay a dry riverbed in which however were to be found pools of crystal water all trodden round with the hoofprints of game
facing this hill was a parklike plain where grew clumps of flattopped mimosa varied with occasional glossyleaved machabells and all round stretched the sea of pathless silent bush
as we emerged into this riverbed path suddenly we started a troop of tall giraffes who galloped or rather sailed off in their strange gait their tails screwed up over their backs and their hoofs rattling like castanets
they were about three hundred yards from us and therefore practically out of shot but good who was walking ahead and who had an express loaded with solid ball in his hand could not resist temptation
lifting his gun he let drive at the last a young cow
by some extraordinary chance the ball struck it full on the back of the neck shattering the spinal column and that giraffe went rolling head over heels just like a rabbit
i never saw a more curious thing
curse it said goodfor i am sorry to say he had a habit of using strong language when excitedcontracted no doubt in the course of his nautical career curse it
ive killed him ou bougwan ejaculated the kafirs ou
ou they called good bougwan or glass eye because of his eyeglass
oh bougwan reechoed sir henry and i and from that day goods reputation as a marvellous shot was established at any rate among the kafirs
really he was a bad one but whenever he missed we overlooked it for the sake of that giraffe
having set some of the boys to cut off the best of the giraffes meat we went to work to build a scherm near one of the pools and about a hundred yards to its right
this is done by cutting a quantity of thorn bushes and piling them in the shape of a circular hedge
then the space enclosed is smoothed and dry tambouki grass if obtainable is made into a bed in the centre and a fire or fires lighted
by the time the scherm was finished the moon peeped up and our dinners of giraffe steaks and roasted marrowbones were ready
how we enjoyed those marrowbones though it was rather a job to crack them
i know of no greater luxury than giraffe marrow unless it is elephants heart and we had that on the morrow
we ate our simple meal by the light of the moon pausing at times to thank good for his wonderful shot then we began to smoke and yarn and a curious picture we must have made squatting there round the fire
i with my short grizzled hair sticking up straight and sir henry with his yellow locks which were getting rather long were rather a contrast especially as i am thin and short and dark weighing only nine stone and a half and sir henry is tall and broad and fair and weighs fifteen
but perhaps the most curiouslooking of the three taking all the circumstances of the case into consideration was captain john good rn
there he sat upon a leather bag looking just as though he had come in from a comfortable days shooting in a civilised country absolutely clean tidy and well dressed
he wore a shooting suit of brown tweed with a hat to match and neat gaiters
as usual he was beautifully shaved his eyeglass and his false teeth appeared to be in perfect order and altogether he looked the neatest man i ever had to do with in the wilderness
he even sported a collar of which he had a supply made of white guttapercha
you see they weigh so little he said to me innocently when i expressed my astonishment at the fact and i always like to turn out like a gentleman ah
if he could have foreseen the future and the raiment prepared for him
well there we three sat yarning away in the beautiful moonlight and watching the kafirs a few yards off sucking their intoxicating daccha from a pipe of which the mouthpiece was made of the horn of an eland till one by one they rolled themselves up in their blankets and went to sleep by the fire that is all except umbopa who was a little apart his chin resting on his hand and thinking deeply
i noticed that he never mixed much with the other kafirs
presently from the depths of the bush behind us came a loud woof woof thats a lion said i and we all started up to listen
hardly had we done so when from the pool about a hundred yards off we heard the strident trumpeting of an elephant
unkungunklovo
indlovu elephant
elephant whispered the kafirs and a few minutes afterwards we saw a succession of vast shadowy forms moving slowly from the direction of the water towards the bush
up jumped good burning for slaughter and thinking perhaps that it was as easy to kill elephant as he had found it to shoot giraffe but i caught him by the arm and pulled him down
its no good i whispered let them go it seems that we are in a paradise of game
i vote we stop here a day or two and have a go at them said sir henry presently
i was rather surprised for hitherto sir henry had always been for pushing forward as fast as possible more especially since we ascertained at inyati that about two years ago an englishman of the name of neville had sold his wagon there and gone on up country
but i suppose his hunter instincts got the better of him for a while
good jumped at the idea for he was longing to have a shot at those elephants and so to speak the truth did i for it went against my conscience to let such a herd as that escape without a pull at them
all right my hearties said i
i think we want a little recreation
and now lets turn in for we ought to be off by dawn and then perhaps we may catch them feeding before they move on the others agreed and we proceeded to make our preparations
good took off his clothes shook them put his eyeglass and his false teeth into his trousers pocket and folding each article neatly placed it out of the dew under a corner of his mackintosh sheet
sir henry and i contented ourselves with rougher arrangements and soon were curled up in our blankets and dropping off into the dreamless sleep that rewards the traveller
going going gowhat was that
suddenly from the direction of the water came sounds of violent scuffling and next instant there broke upon our ears a succession of the most awful roars
there was no mistaking their origin only a lion could make such a noise as that
we all jumped up and looked towards the water in the direction of which we saw a confused mass yellow and black in colour staggering and struggling towards us
we seized our rifles and slipping on our veldtschoons that is shoes made of untanned hide ran out of the scherm
by this time the mass had fallen and was rolling over and over on the ground and when we reached the spot it struggled no longer but lay quite still
now we saw what it was
on the grass there lay a sable antelope bullthe most beautiful of all the african antelopesquite dead and transfixed by its great curved horns was a magnificent blackmaned lion also dead
evidently what had happened was this the sable antelope had come down to drink at the pool where the lionno doubt the same which we had heardwas lying in wait
while the antelope drank the lion had sprung upon him only to be received upon the sharp curved horns and transfixed
once before i saw a similar thing happen
then the lion unable to free himself had torn and bitten at the back and neck of the bull which maddened with fear and pain had rushed on until it dropped dead
as soon as we had examined the beasts sufficiently we called the kafirs and between us managed to drag their carcases up to the scherm
after that we went in and lay down to wake no more till dawn
with the first light we were up and making ready for the fray
we took with us the three eightbore rifles a good supply of ammunition and our large waterbottles filled with weak cold tea which i have always found the best stuff to shoot on
after swallowing a little breakfast we started umbopa khiva and ventvgel accompanying us
the other kafirs we left with instructions to skin the lion and the sable antelope and to cut up the latter
we had no difficulty in finding the broad elephant trail which ventvgel after examination pronounced to have been made by between twenty and thirty elephants most of them fullgrown bulls
but the herd had moved on some way during the night and it was nine oclock and already very hot before by the broken trees bruised leaves and bark and smoking droppings we knew that we could not be far from them
presently we caught sight of the herd which numbered as ventvgel had said between twenty and thirty standing in a hollow having finished their morning meal and flapping their great ears
it was a splendid sight for they were only about two hundred yards from us
taking a handful of dry grass i threw it into the air to see how the wind was for if once they winded us i knew they would be off before we could get a shot
finding that if anything it blew from the elephants to us we crept on stealthily and thanks to the cover managed to get within forty yards or so of the great brutes
just in front of us and broadside on stood three splendid bulls one of them with enormous tusks
i whispered to the others that i would take the middle one sir henry covering the elephant to the left and good the bull with the big tusks
now i whispered
boom
boom
boom
went the three heavy rifles and down came sir henrys elephant dead as a hammer shot right through the heart
mine fell on to its knees and i thought that he was going to die but in another moment he was up and off tearing along straight past me
as he went i gave him the second barrel in the ribs and this brought him down in good earnest
hastily slipping in two fresh cartridges i ran close up to him and a ball through the brain put an end to the poor brutes struggles
then i turned to see how good had fared with the big bull which i had heard screaming with rage and pain as i gave mine its quietus
on reaching the captain i found him in a great state of excitement
it appeared that on receiving the bullet the bull had turned and come straight for his assailant who had barely time to get out of his way and then charged on blindly past him in the direction of our encampment
meanwhile the herd had crashed off in wild alarm in the other direction
for awhile we debated whether to go after the wounded bull or to follow the herd and finally deciding for the latter alternative departed thinking that we had seen the last of those big tusks
i have often wished since that we had
it was easy work to follow the elephants for they had left a trail like a carriage road behind them crushing down the thick bush in their furious flight as though it were tambouki grass
but to come up with them was another matter and we had struggled on under the broiling sun for over two hours before we found them
with the exception of one bull they were standing together and i could see from their unquiet way and the manner in which they kept lifting their trunks to test the air that they were on the lookout for mischief
the solitary bull stood fifty yards or so to this side of the herd over which he was evidently keeping sentry and about sixty yards from us
thinking that he would see or wind us and that it would probably start them off again if we tried to get nearer especially as the ground was rather open we all aimed at this bull and at my whispered word we fired
the three shots took effect and down he went dead
again the herd started but unfortunately for them about a hundred yards further on was a nullah or driedout water track with steep banks a place very much resembling the one where the prince imperial was killed in zululand
into this the elephants plunged and when we reached the edge we found them struggling in wild confusion to get up the other bank filling the air with their screams and trumpeting as they pushed one another aside in their selfish panic just like so many human beings
now was our opportunity and firing away as quickly as we could load we killed five of the poor beasts and no doubt should have bagged the whole herd had they not suddenly given up their attempts to climb the bank and rushed headlong down the nullah
we were too tired to follow them and perhaps also a little sick of slaughter eight elephants being a pretty good bag for one day
so after we were rested a little and the kafirs had cut out the hearts of two of the dead elephants for supper we started homewards very well pleased with our days work having made up our minds to send the bearers on the morrow to chop away the tusks
shortly after we repassed the spot where good had wounded the patriarchal bull we came across a herd of eland but did not shoot at them as we had plenty of meat
they trotted past us and then stopped behind a little patch of bush about a hundred yards away wheeling round to look at us
as good was anxious to get a near view of them never having seen an eland close he handed his rifle to umbopa and followed by khiva strolled up to the patch of bush
we sat down and waited for him not sorry of the excuse for a little rest
the sun was just going down in its reddest glory and sir henry and i were admiring the lovely scene when suddenly we heard an elephant scream and saw its huge and rushing form with uplifted trunk and tail silhouetted against the great fiery globe of the sun
next second we saw something else and that was good and khiva tearing back towards us with the wounded bullfor it was hecharging after them
for a moment we did not dare to firethough at that distance it would have been of little use if we had done sofor fear of hitting one of them and the next a dreadful thing happenedgood fell a victim to his passion for civilised dress
had he consented to discard his trousers and gaiters like the rest of us and to hunt in a flannel shirt and a pair of veldtschoons it would have been all right
but as it was his trousers cumbered him in that desperate race and presently when he was about sixty yards from us his boot polished by the dry grass slipped and down he went on his face right in front of the elephant
we gave a gasp for we knew that he must die and ran as hard as we could towards him
in three seconds it had ended but not as we thought
khiva the zulu boy saw his master fall and brave lad as he was turned and flung his assegai straight into the elephants face
it stuck in his trunk
with a scream of pain the brute seized the poor zulu hurled him to the earth and placing one huge foot on to his body about the middle twined its trunk round his upper part and tore him in two
we rushed up mad with horror and fired again and again till presently the elephant fell upon the fragments of the zulu
as for good he rose and wrung his hands over the brave man who had given his life to save him and though i am an old hand i felt a lump grow in my throat
umbopa stood contemplating the huge dead elephant and the mangled remains of poor khiva
ah well he said presently he is dead but he died like a man our march into the desert we had killed nine elephants and it took us two days to cut out the tusks and having brought them into camp to bury them carefully in the sand under a large tree which made a conspicuous mark for miles round
it was a wonderfully fine lot of ivory
i never saw a better averaging as it did between forty and fifty pounds a tusk
the tusks of the great bull that killed poor khiva scaled one hundred and seventy pounds the pair so nearly as we could judge
as for khiva himself we buried what remained of him in an antbear hole together with an assegai to protect himself with on his journey to a better world
on the third day we marched again hoping that we might live to return to dig up our buried ivory and in due course after a long and wearisome tramp and many adventures which i have not space to detail we reached sitandas kraal near the lukanga river the real startingpoint of our expedition
very well do i recollect our arrival at that place
to the right was a scattered native settlement with a few stone cattle kraals and some cultivated lands down by the water where these savages grew their scanty supply of grain and beyond it stretched great tracts of waving veld covered with tall grass over which herds of the smaller game were wandering
to the left lay the vast desert
this spot appears to be the outpost of the fertile country and it would be difficult to say to what natural causes such an abrupt change in the character of the soil is due
but so it is
just below our encampment flowed a little stream on the farther side of which is a stony slope the same down which twenty years before i had seen poor silvestre creeping back after his attempt to reach solomons mines and beyond that slope begins the waterless desert covered with a species of karoo shrub
it was evening when we pitched our camp and the great ball of the sun was sinking into the desert sending glorious rays of manycoloured light flying all over its vast expanse
leaving good to superintend the arrangement of our little camp i took sir henry with me and walking to the top of the slope opposite we gazed across the desert
the air was very clear and far far away i could distinguish the faint blue outlines here and there capped with white of the suliman berg
there i said there is the wall round solomons mines but god knows if we shall ever climb it my brother should be there and if he is i shall reach him somehow said sir henry in that tone of quiet confidence which marked the man
i hope so i answered and turned to go back to the camp when i saw that we were not alone
behind us also gazing earnestly towards the faroff mountains stood the great kafir umbopa
the zulu spoke when he saw that i had observed him addressing sir henry to whom he had attached himself
is it to that land that thou wouldst journey incubu a native word meaning i believe an elephant and the name given to sir henry by the kafirs he said pointing towards the mountain with his broad assegai
i asked him sharply what he meant by addressing his master in that familiar way
it is very well for natives to have a name for one among themselves but it is not decent that they should call a white man by their heathenish appellations to his face
the zulu laughed a quiet little laugh which angered me
how dost thou know that i am not the equal of the inkosi whom i serve he said
he is of a royal house no doubt one can see it in his size and by his mien so mayhap am i
at least i am as great a man
be my mouth o macumazahn and say my words to the inkoos incubu my master for i would speak to him and to thee i was angry with the man for i am not accustomed to be talked to in that way by kafirs but somehow he impressed me and besides i was curious to know what he had to say
so i translated expressing my opinion at the same time that he was an impudent fellow and that his swagger was outrageous
yes umbopa answered sir henry i would journey there the desert is wide and there is no water in it the mountains are high and covered with snow and man cannot say what lies beyond them behind the place where the sun sets how shalt thou come thither incubu and wherefore dost thou go i translated again
tell him answered sir henry that i go because i believe that a man of my blood my brother has gone there before me and i journey to seek him that is so incubu a hottentot i met on the road told me that a white man went out into the desert two years ago towards those mountains with one servant a hunter
they never came back how do you know it was my brother asked sir henry
nay i know not
but the hottentot when i asked what the white man was like said that he had thine eyes and a black beard
he said too that the name of the hunter with him was jim that he was a bechuana hunter and wore clothes there is no doubt about it said i i knew jim well sir henry nodded
i was sure of it he said
if george set his mind upon a thing he generally did it
it was always so from his boyhood
if he meant to cross the suliman berg he has crossed it unless some accident overtook him and we must look for him on the other side umbopa understood english though he rarely spoke it
it is a far journey incubu he put in and i translated his remark
yes answered sir henry it is far
but there is no journey upon this earth that a man may not make if he sets his heart to it
there is nothing umbopa that he cannot do there are no mountains he may not climb there are no deserts he cannot cross save a mountain and a desert of which you are spared the knowledge if love leads him and he holds his life in his hands counting it as nothing ready to keep it or lose it as heaven above may order i translated
great words my father answered the zului always called him a zulu though he was not really onegreat swelling words fit to fill the mouth of a man
thou art right my father incubu
listen
what is life
it is a feather it is the seed of the grass blown hither and thither sometimes multiplying itself and dying in the act sometimes carried away into the heavens
but if that seed be good and heavy it may perchance travel a little way on the road it wills
it is well to try and journey ones road and to fight with the air
man must die
at the worst he can but die a little sooner
i will go with thee across the desert and over the mountains unless perchance i fall to the ground on the way my father he paused awhile and then went on with one of those strange bursts of rhetorical eloquence that zulus sometimes indulge in which to my mind full though they are of vain repetitions show that the race is by no means devoid of poetic instinct and of intellectual power
what is life
tell me o white men who are wise who know the secrets of the world and of the world of stars and the world that lies above and around the stars who flash your words from afar without a voice tell me white men the secret of our lifewhither it goes and whence it comes
you cannot answer me you know not
listen i will answer
out of the dark we came into the dark we go
like a stormdriven bird at night we fly out of the nowhere for a moment our wings are seen in the light of the fire and lo
we are gone again into the nowhere
life is nothing
life is all
it is the hand with which we hold off death
it is the glowworm that shines in the nighttime and is black in the morning it is the white breath of the oxen in winter it is the little shadow that runs across the grass and loses itself at sunset you are a strange man said sir henry when he had ceased
umbopa laughed
it seems to me that we are much alike incubu
perhaps i seek a brother over the mountains i looked at him suspiciously
what dost thou mean i asked what dost thou know of those mountains a little a very little
there is a strange land yonder a land of witchcraft and beautiful things a land of brave people and of trees and streams and snowy peaks and of a great white road
i have heard of it
but what is the good of talking
it grows dark
those who live to see will see again i looked at him doubtfully
the man knew too much
you need not fear me macumazahn he said interpreting my look
i dig no holes for you to fall in
i make no plots
if ever we cross those mountains behind the sun i will tell what i know
but death sits upon them
be wise and turn back
go and hunt elephants my masters
i have spoken and without another word he lifted his spear in salutation and returned towards the camp where shortly afterwards we found him cleaning a gun like any other kafir
that is an odd man said sir henry
yes answered i too odd by half
i dont like his little ways
he knows something and will not speak out
but i suppose it is no use quarrelling with him
we are in for a curious trip and a mysterious zulu wont make much difference one way or another next day we made our arrangements for starting
of course it was impossible to drag our heavy elephant rifles and other kit with us across the desert so dismissing our bearers we made an arrangement with an old native who had a kraal close by to take care of them till we returned
it went to my heart to leave such things as those sweet tools to the tender mercies of an old thief of a savage whose greedy eyes i could see gloating over them
but i took some precautions
first of all i loaded all the rifles placing them at full cock and informed him that if he touched them they would go off
he tried the experiment instantly with my eightbore and it did go off and blew a hole right through one of his oxen which were just then being driven up to the kraal to say nothing of knocking him head over heels with the recoil
he got up considerably startled and not at all pleased at the loss of the ox which he had the impudence to ask me to pay for and nothing would induce him to touch the guns again
put the live devils out of the way up there in the thatch he said or they will murder us all then i told him that when we came back if one of those things was missing i would kill him and his people by witchcraft and if we died and he tried to steal the rifles i would come and haunt him and turn his cattle mad and his milk sour till life was a weariness and would make the devils in the guns come out and talk to him in a way he did not like and generally gave him a good idea of judgment to come
after that he promised to look after them as though they were his fathers spirit
he was a very superstitious old kafir and a great villain
having thus disposed of our superfluous gear we arranged the kit we fivesir henry good myself umbopa and the hottentot ventvgelwere to take with us on our journey
it was small enough but do what we would we could not get its weight down under about forty pounds a man
this is what it consisted of the three express rifles and two hundred rounds of ammunition
the two winchester repeating rifles for umbopa and ventvgel with two hundred rounds of cartridge
five cochranes waterbottles each holding four pints
five blankets
twentyfive pounds weight of biltongie
sundried game flesh
ten pounds weight of best mixed beads for gifts
a selection of medicine including an ounce of quinine and one or two small surgical instruments
our knives a few sundries such as a compass matches a pocket filter tobacco a trowel a bottle of brandy and the clothes we stood in
this was our total equipment a small one indeed for such a venture but we dared not attempt to carry more
indeed that load was a heavy one per man with which to travel across the burning desert for in such places every additional ounce tells
but we could not see our way to reducing the weight
there was nothing taken but what was absolutely necessary
with great difficulty and by the promise of a present of a good huntingknife each i succeeded in persuading three wretched natives from the village to come with us for the first stage twenty miles and to carry a large gourd holding a gallon of water apiece
my object was to enable us to refill our waterbottles after the first nights march for we determined to start in the cool of the evening
i gave out to these natives that we were going to shoot ostriches with which the desert abounded
they jabbered and shrugged their shoulders saying that we were mad and should perish of thirst which i must say seemed probable but being desirous of obtaining the knives which were almost unknown treasures up there they consented to come having probably reflected that after all our subsequent extinction would be no affair of theirs
all next day we rested and slept and at sunset ate a hearty meal of fresh beef washed down with tea the last as good remarked sadly we were likely to drink for many a long day
then having made our final preparations we lay down and waited for the moon to rise
at last about nine oclock up she came in all her glory flooding the wild country with light and throwing a silver sheen on the expanse of rolling desert before us which looked as solemn and quiet and as alien to man as the starstudded firmament above
we rose up and in a few minutes were ready and yet we hesitated a little as human nature is prone to hesitate on the threshold of an irrevocable step
we three white men stood by ourselves
umbopa assegai in hand and a rifle across his shoulders looked out fixedly across the desert a few paces ahead of us while the hired natives with the gourds of water and ventvgel were gathered in a little knot behind
gentlemen said sir henry presently in his deep voice we are going on about as strange a journey as men can make in this world
it is very doubtful if we can succeed in it
but we are three men who will stand together for good or for evil to the last
now before we start let us for a moment pray to the power who shapes the destinies of men and who ages since has marked out our paths that it may please him to direct our steps in accordance with his will taking off his hat for the space of a minute or so he covered his face with his hands and good and i did likewise
i do not say that i am a firstrate praying man few hunters are and as for sir henry i never heard him speak like that before and only once since though deep down in his heart i believe that he is very religious
good too is pious though apt to swear
anyhow i do not remember excepting on one single occasion ever putting up a better prayer in my life than i did during that minute and somehow i felt the happier for it
our future was so completely unknown and i think that the unknown and the awful always bring a man nearer to his maker
and now said sir henry trek so we started
we had nothing to guide ourselves by except the distant mountains and old jos da silvestras chart which considering that it was drawn by a dying and halfdistraught man on a fragment of linen three centuries ago was not a very satisfactory sort of thing to work with
still our sole hope of success depended upon it such as it was
if we failed in finding that pool of bad water which the old dom marked as being situated in the middle of the desert about sixty miles from our startingpoint and as far from the mountains in all probability we must perish miserably of thirst
but to my mind the chances of our finding it in that great sea of sand and karoo scrub seemed almost infinitesimal
even supposing that da silvestra had marked the pool correctly what was there to prevent its having been dried up by the sun generations ago or trampled in by game or filled with the drifting sand
on we tramped silently as shades through the night and in the heavy sand
the karoo bushes caught our feet and retarded us and the sand worked into our veldtschoons and goods shootingboots so that every few miles we had to stop and empty them but still the night kept fairly cool though the atmosphere was thick and heavy giving a sort of creamy feel to the air and we made fair progress
it was very silent and lonely there in the desert oppressively so indeed
good felt this and once began to whistle the girl i left behind me but the notes sounded lugubrious in that vast place and he gave it up
shortly afterwards a little incident occurred which though it startled us at the time gave rise to a laugh
good was leading as the holder of the compass which being a sailor of course he understood thoroughly and we were toiling along in single file behind him when suddenly we heard the sound of an exclamation and he vanished
next second there arose all around us a most extraordinary hubbub snorts groans and wild sounds of rushing feet
in the faint light too we could descry dim galloping forms half hidden by wreaths of sand
the natives threw down their loads and prepared to bolt but remembering that there was nowhere to run to they cast themselves upon the ground and howled out that it was ghosts
as for sir henry and myself we stood amazed nor was our amazement lessened when we perceived the form of good careering off in the direction of the mountains apparently mounted on the back of a horse and halloaing wildly
in another second he threw up his arms and we heard him come to the earth with a thud
then i saw what had happened we had stumbled upon a herd of sleeping quagga on to the back of one of which good actually had fallen and the brute naturally enough got up and made off with him
calling out to the others that it was all right i ran towards good much afraid lest he should be hurt but to my great relief i found him sitting in the sand his eyeglass still fixed firmly in his eye rather shaken and very much frightened but not in any way injured
after this we travelled on without any further misadventure till about one oclock when we called a halt and having drunk a little water not much for water was precious and rested for half an hour we started again
on on we went till at last the east began to blush like the cheek of a girl
then there came faint rays of primrose light that changed presently to golden bars through which the dawn glided out across the desert
the stars grew pale and paler still till at last they vanished the golden moon waxed wan and her mountain ridges stood out against her sickly face like the bones on the cheek of a dying man
then came spear upon spear of light flashing far away across the boundless wilderness piercing and firing the veils of mist till the desert was draped in a tremulous golden glow and it was day
still we did not halt though by this time we should have been glad enough to do so for we knew that when once the sun was fully up it would be almost impossible for us to travel
at length about an hour later we spied a little pile of boulders rising out of the plain and to this we dragged ourselves
as luck would have it here we found an overhanging slab of rock carpeted beneath with smooth sand which afforded a most grateful shelter from the heat
underneath this we crept and each of us having drunk some water and eaten a bit of biltong we lay down and soon were sound asleep
it was three oclock in the afternoon before we woke to find our bearers preparing to return
they had seen enough of the desert already and no number of knives would have tempted them to come a step farther
so we took a hearty drink and having emptied our waterbottles filled them up again from the gourds that they had brought with them and then watched them depart on their twenty miles tramp home
at halfpast four we also started
it was lonely and desolate work for with the exception of a few ostriches there was not a single living creature to be seen on all the vast expanse of sandy plain
evidently it was too dry for game and with the exception of a deadlylooking cobra or two we saw no reptiles
one insect however we found abundant and that was the common or house fly
there they came not as single spies but in battalions as i think the old testament says somewhere
he is an extraordinary insect is the house fly
go where you will you find him and so it must have been always
i have seen him enclosed in amber which is i was told quite half a million years old looking exactly like his descendant of today and i have little doubt but that when the last man lies dying on the earth he will be buzzing roundif this event happens to occur in summerwatching for an opportunity to settle on his nose
readers must beware of accepting mr quatermains references as accurate as it has been found some are prone to do
although his reading evidently was limited the impression produced by it upon his mind was mixed
thus to him the old testament and shakespeare were interchangeable authoritieseditor
at sunset we halted waiting for the moon to rise
at last she came up beautiful and serene as ever and with one halt about two oclock in the morning we trudged on wearily through the night till at last the welcome sun put a period to our labours
we drank a little and flung ourselves down on the sand thoroughly tired out and soon were all asleep
there was no need to set a watch for we had nothing to fear from anybody or anything in that vast untenanted plain
our only enemies were heat thirst and flies but far rather would i have faced any danger from man or beast than that awful trinity
this time we were not so lucky as to find a sheltering rock to guard us from the glare of the sun with the result that about seven oclock we woke up experiencing the exact sensations one would attribute to a beefsteak on a gridiron
we were literally being baked through and through
the burning sun seemed to be sucking our very blood out of us
we sat up and gasped
phew said i grabbing at the halo of flies which buzzed cheerfully round my head
the heat did not affect them
my word said sir henry
it is hot echoed good
it was hot indeed and there was not a bit of shelter to be found
look where we would there was no rock or tree nothing but an unending glare rendered dazzling by the heated air that danced over the surface of the desert as it dances over a redhot stove
what is to be done asked sir henry we cant stand this for long we looked at each other blankly
i have it said good we must dig a hole get in it and cover ourselves with the karoo bushes it did not seem a very promising suggestion but at least it was better than nothing so we set to work and with the trowel we had brought with us and the help of our hands in about an hour we succeeded in delving out a patch of ground some ten feet long by twelve wide to the depth of two feet
then we cut a quantity of low scrub with our huntingknives and creeping into the hole pulled it over us all with the exception of ventvgel on whom being a hottentot the heat had no particular effect
this gave us some slight shelter from the burning rays of the sun but the atmosphere in that amateur grave can be better imagined than described
the black hole of calcutta must have been a fool to it indeed to this moment i do not know how we lived through the day
there we lay panting and every now and again moistening our lips from our scanty supply of water
had we followed our inclinations we should have finished all we possessed in the first two hours but we were forced to exercise the most rigid care for if our water failed us we knew that very soon we must perish miserably
but everything has an end if only you live long enough to see it and somehow that miserable day wore on towards evening
about three oclock in the afternoon we determined that we could bear it no longer
it would be better to die walking than to be killed slowly by heat and thirst in this dreadful hole
so taking each of us a little drink from our fast diminishing supply of water now warmed to about the same temperature as a mans blood we staggered forward
we had then covered some fifty miles of wilderness
if the reader will refer to the rough copy and translation of old da silvestras map he will see that the desert is marked as measuring forty leagues across and the pan bad water is set down as being about in the middle of it
now forty leagues is one hundred and twenty miles consequently we ought at the most to be within twelve or fifteen miles of the water if any should really exist
through the afternoon we crept slowly and painfully along scarcely doing more than a mile and a half in an hour
at sunset we rested again waiting for the moon and after drinking a little managed to get some sleep
before we lay down umbopa pointed out to us a slight and indistinct hillock on the flat surface of the plain about eight miles away
at the distance it looked like an anthill and as i was dropping off to sleep i fell to wondering what it could be
with the moon we marched again feeling dreadfully exhausted and suffering tortures from thirst and prickly heat
nobody who has not felt it can know what we went through
we walked no longer we staggered now and again falling from exhaustion and being obliged to call a halt every hour or so
we had scarcely energy left in us to speak
up to this good had chatted and joked for he is a merry fellow but now he had not a joke in him
at last about two oclock utterly worn out in body and mind we came to the foot of the queer hill or sand koppie which at first sight resembled a gigantic antheap about a hundred feet high and covering at the base nearly two acres of ground
here we halted and driven to it by our desperate thirst sucked down our last drops of water
we had but half a pint a head and each of us could have drunk a gallon
then we lay down
just as i was dropping off to sleep i heard umbopa remark to himself in zulu if we cannot find water we shall all be dead before the moon rises tomorrow i shuddered hot as it was
the near prospect of such an awful death is not pleasant but even the thought of it could not keep me from sleeping
water
water
two hours later that is about four oclock i woke up for so soon as the first heavy demand of bodily fatigue had been satisfied the torturing thirst from which i was suffering asserted itself
i could sleep no more
i had been dreaming that i was bathing in a running stream with green banks and trees upon them and i awoke to find myself in this arid wilderness and to remember as umbopa had said that if we did not find water this day we must perish miserably
no human creature could live long without water in that heat
i sat up and rubbed my grimy face with my dry and horny hands as my lips and eyelids were stuck together and it was only after some friction and with an effort that i was able to open them
it was not far from dawn but there was none of the bright feel of dawn in the air which was thick with a hot murkiness that i cannot describe
the others were still sleeping
presently it began to grow light enough to read so i drew out a little pocket copy of the ingoldsby legends which i had brought with me and read the jackdaw of rheims when i got to where a nice little boy held a golden ewer embossed and filled with water as pure as any that flows between rheims and namur literally i smacked my cracking lips or rather tried to smack them
the mere thought of that pure water made me mad
if the cardinal had been there with his bell book and candle i would have whipped in and drunk his water up yes even if he had filled it already with the suds of soap worthy of washing the hands of the pope and i knew that the whole consecrated curse of the catholic church should fall upon me for so doing
i almost think that i must have been a little lightheaded with thirst weariness and the want of food for i fell to thinking how astonished the cardinal and his nice little boy and the jackdaw would have looked to see a burnt up browneyed grizzlyhaired little elephant hunter suddenly bound between them put his dirty face into the basin and swallow every drop of the precious water
the idea amused me so much that i laughed or rather cackled aloud which woke the others and they began to rub their dirty faces and drag their gummedup lips and eyelids apart
as soon as we were all well awake we began to discuss the situation which was serious enough
not a drop of water was left
we turned the bottles upside down and licked their tops but it was a failure they were dry as a bone
good who had charge of the flask of brandy got it out and looked at it longingly but sir henry promptly took it away from him for to drink raw spirit would only have been to precipitate the end
if we do not find water we shall die he said
if we can trust to the old doms map there should be some about i said but nobody seemed to derive much satisfaction from this remark
it was so evident that no great faith could be put in the map
now it was gradually growing light and as we sat staring blankly at each other i observed the hottentot ventvgel rise and begin to walk about with his eyes on the ground
presently he stopped short and uttering a guttural exclamation pointed to the earth
what is it we exclaimed and rising simultaneously we went to where he was standing staring at the sand
well i said it is fresh springbok spoor what of it springbucks do not go far from water he answered in dutch
no i answered i forgot and thank god for it this little discovery put new life into us for it is wonderful when a man is in a desperate position how he catches at the slightest hope and feels almost happy
on a dark night a single star is better than nothing
meanwhile ventvgel was lifting his snub nose and sniffing the hot air for all the world like an old impala ram who scents danger
presently he spoke again
i smell water he said
then we felt quite jubilant for we knew what a wonderful instinct these wildbred men possess
just at that moment the sun came up gloriously and revealed so grand a sight to our astonished eyes that for a moment or two we even forgot our thirst
there not more than forty or fifty miles from us glittering like silver in the early rays of the morning sun soared shebas breasts and stretching away for hundreds of miles on either side of them ran the great suliman berg
now that sitting here i attempt to describe the extraordinary grandeur and beauty of that sight language seems to fail me
i am impotent even before its memory
straight before us rose two enormous mountains the like of which are not i believe to be seen in africa if indeed there are any other such in the world measuring each of them at least fifteen thousand feet in height standing not more than a dozen miles apart linked together by a precipitous cliff of rock and towering in awful white solemnity straight into the sky
these mountains placed thus like the pillars of a gigantic gateway are shaped after the fashion of a womans breasts and at times the mists and shadows beneath them take the form of a recumbent woman veiled mysteriously in sleep
their bases swell gently from the plain looking at that distance perfectly round and smooth and upon the top of each is a vast hillock covered with snow exactly corresponding to the nipple on the female breast
the stretch of cliff that connects them appears to be some thousands of feet in height and perfectly precipitous and on each flank of them so far as the eye can reach extend similar lines of cliff broken only here and there by flat tabletopped mountains something like the worldfamed one at cape town a formation by the way that is very common in africa
to describe the comprehensive grandeur of that view is beyond my powers
there was something so inexpressibly solemn and overpowering about those huge volcanoesfor doubtless they are extinct volcanoesthat it quite awed us
for a while the morning lights played upon the snow and the brown and swelling masses beneath and then as though to veil the majestic sight from our curious eyes strange vapours and clouds gathered and increased around the mountains till presently we could only trace their pure and gigantic outlines showing ghostlike through the fleecy envelope
indeed as we afterwards discovered usually they were wrapped in this gauzelike mist which doubtless accounted for our not having seen them more clearly before
shebas breasts had scarcely vanished into cloudclad privacy before our thirstliterally a burning questionreasserted itself
it was all very well for ventvgel to say that he smelt water but we could see no signs of it look which way we would
so far as the eye might reach there was nothing but arid sweltering sand and karoo scrub
we walked round the hillock and gazed about anxiously on the other side but it was the same story not a drop of water could be found there was no indication of a pan a pool or a spring
you are a fool i said angrily to ventvgel there is no water but still he lifted his ugly snub nose and sniffed
i smell it baas he answered it is somewhere in the air yes i said no doubt it is in the clouds and about two months hence it will fall and wash our bones sir henry stroked his yellow beard thoughtfully
perhaps it is on the top of the hill he suggested
rot said good whoever heard of water being found at the top of a hill let us go and look i put in and hopelessly enough we scrambled up the sandy sides of the hillock umbopa leading
presently he stopped as though he was petrified
nanzia manzie that is here is water he cried with a loud voice
we rushed up to him and there sure enough in a deep cut or indentation on the very top of the sand koppie was an undoubted pool of water
how it came to be in such a strange place we did not stop to inquire nor did we hesitate at its black and unpleasant appearance
it was water or a good imitation of it and that was enough for us
we gave a bound and a rush and in another second we were all down on our stomachs sucking up the uninviting fluid as though it were nectar fit for the gods
heavens how we did drink
then when we had done drinking we tore off our clothes and sat down in the pool absorbing the moisture through our parched skins
you harry my boy who have only to turn on a couple of taps to summon hot and cold from an unseen vasty cistern can have little idea of the luxury of that muddy wallow in brackish tepid water
after a while we rose from it refreshed indeed and fell to on our biltong of which we had scarcely been able to touch a mouthful for twentyfour hours and ate our fill
then we smoked a pipe and lay down by the side of that blessed pool under the overhanging shadow of its bank and slept till noon
all that day we rested there by the water thanking our stars that we had been lucky enough to find it bad as it was and not forgetting to render a due share of gratitude to the shade of the longdeparted da silvestra who had set its position down so accurately on the tail of his shirt
the wonderful thing to us was that the pan should have lasted so long and the only way in which i can account for this is on the supposition that it is fed by some spring deep down in the sand
having filled both ourselves and our waterbottles as full as possible in far better spirits we started off again with the moon
that night we covered nearly fiveandtwenty miles but needless to say found no more water though we were lucky enough the following day to get a little shade behind some antheaps
when the sun rose and for awhile cleared away the mysterious mists sulimans berg with the two majestic breasts now only about twenty miles off seemed to be towering right above us and looked grander than ever
at the approach of evening we marched again and to cut a long story short by daylight next morning found ourselves upon the lowest slopes of shebas left breast for which we had been steadily steering
by this time our water was exhausted once more and we were suffering severely from thirst nor indeed could we see any chance of relieving it till we reached the snow line far far above us
after resting an hour or two driven to it by our torturing thirst we went on toiling painfully in the burning heat up the lava slopes for we found that the huge base of the mountain was composed entirely of lava beds belched from the bowels of the earth in some far past age
by eleven oclock we were utterly exhausted and generally speaking in a very bad state indeed
the lava clinker over which we must drag ourselves though smooth compared with some clinker i have heard of such as that on the island of ascension for instance was yet rough enough to make our feet very sore and this together with our other miseries had pretty well finished us
a few hundred yards above us were some large lumps of lava and towards these we steered with the intention of lying down beneath their shade
we reached them and to our surprise so far as we had a capacity for surprise left in us on a little plateau or ridge close by we saw that the clinker was covered with a dense green growth
evidently soil formed of decomposed lava had rested there and in due course had become the receptacle of seeds deposited by birds
but we did not take much further interest in the green growth for one cannot live on grass like nebuchadnezzar
that requires a special dispensation of providence and peculiar digestive organs
so we sat down under the rocks and groaned and for one i wished heartily that we had never started on this fools errand
as we were sitting there i saw umbopa get up and hobble towards the patch of green and a few minutes afterwards to my great astonishment i perceived that usually very dignified individual dancing and shouting like a maniac and waving something green
off we all scrambled towards him as fast as our wearied limbs would carry us hoping that he had found water
what is it umbopa son of a fool i shouted in zulu
it is food and water macumazahn and again he waved the green thing
then i saw what he had found
it was a melon
we had hit upon a patch of wild melons thousands of them and dead ripe
melons i yelled to good who was next me and in another minute his false teeth were fixed in one of them
i think we ate about six each before we had done and poor fruit as they were i doubt if i ever thought anything nicer
but melons are not very nutritious and when we had satisfied our thirst with their pulpy substance and put a stock to cool by the simple process of cutting them in two and setting them end on in the hot sun to grow cold by evaporation we began to feel exceedingly hungry
we had still some biltong left but our stomachs turned from biltong and besides we were obliged to be very sparing of it for we could not say when we should find more food
just at this moment a lucky thing chanced
looking across the desert i saw a flock of about ten large birds flying straight towards us
skit baas skit shoot master shoot whispered the hottentot throwing himself on his face an example which we all followed
then i saw that the birds were a flock of pauw or bustards and that they would pass within fifty yards of my head
taking one of the repeating winchesters i waited till they were nearly over us and then jumped to my feet
on seeing me the pauw bunched up together as i expected that they would and i fired two shots straight into the thick of them and as luck would have it brought one down a fine fellow that weighed about twenty pounds
in half an hour we had a fire made of dry melon stalks and he was toasting over it and we made such a feed as we had not tasted for a week
we ate that pauw nothing was left of him but his legbones and his beak and we felt not a little the better afterwards
that night we went on again with the moon carrying as many melons as we could with us
as we ascended we found the air grew cooler and cooler which was a great relief to us and at dawn so far as we could judge we were not more than about a dozen miles from the snow line
here we discovered more melons and so had no longer any anxiety about water for we knew that we should soon get plenty of snow
but the ascent had now become very precipitous and we made but slow progress not more than a mile an hour
also that night we ate our last morsel of biltong
as yet with the exception of the pauw we had seen no living thing on the mountain nor had we come across a single spring or stream of water which struck us as very odd considering the expanse of snow above us which must we thought melt sometimes
but as we afterwards discovered owing to a cause which it is quite beyond my power to explain all the streams flowed down upon the north side of the mountains
now we began to grow very anxious about food
we had escaped death by thirst but it seemed probable that it was only to die of hunger
the events of the next three miserable days are best described by copying the entries made at the time in my notebook
st maystarted am finding the atmosphere quite cold enough to travel by day and carrying some watermelons with us
struggled on all day but found no more melons having evidently passed out of their district
saw no game of any sort
halted for the night at sundown having had no food for many hours
suffered much during the night from cold
ndstarted at sunrise again feeling very faint and weak
only made about five miles all day found some patches of snow of which we ate but nothing else
camped at night under the edge of a great plateau
cold bitter
drank a little brandy each and huddled ourselves together each wrapped up in his blanket to keep ourselves alive
are now suffering frightfully from starvation and weariness
thought that ventvgel would have died during the night
rdstruggled forward once more as soon as the sun was well up and had thawed our limbs a little
we are now in a dreadful plight and i fear that unless we get food this will be our last days journey
but little brandy left
good sir henry and umbopa bear up wonderfully but ventvgel is in a very bad way
like most hottentots he cannot stand cold
pangs of hunger not so bad but have a sort of numb feeling about the stomach
others say the same
we are now on a level with the precipitous chain or wall of lava linking the two breasts and the view is glorious
behind us the glowing desert rolls away to the horizon and before us lie mile upon mile of smooth hard snow almost level but swelling gently upwards out of the centre of which the nipple of the mountain that appears to be some miles in circumference rises about four thousand feet into the sky
not a living thing is to be seen
god help us i fear that our time has come and now i will drop the journal partly because it is not very interesting reading also what follows requires telling rather more fully
all that daythe rd maywe struggled slowly up the incline of snow lying down from time to time to rest
a strange gaunt crew we must have looked while laden as we were we dragged our weary feet over the dazzling plain glaring round us with hungry eyes
not that there was much use in glaring for we could see nothing to eat
we did not accomplish more than seven miles that day
just before sunset we found ourselves exactly under the nipple of shebas left breast which towered thousands of feet into the air a vast smooth hillock of frozen snow
weak as we were we could not but appreciate the wonderful scene made even more splendid by the flying rays of light from the setting sun which here and there stained the snow bloodred and crowned the great dome above us with a diadem of glory
i say gasped good presently we ought to be somewhere near that cave the old gentleman wrote about yes said i if there is a cave come quatermain groaned sir henry dont talk like that i have every faith in the dom remember the water
we shall find the place soon if we dont find it before dark we are dead men that is all about it was my consolatory reply
for the next ten minutes we trudged in silence when suddenly umbopa who was marching along beside me wrapped in his blanket and with a leather belt strapped so tightly round his stomach to make his hunger small as he said that his waist looked like a girls caught me by the arm
look he said pointing towards the springing slope of the nipple
i followed his glance and some two hundred yards from us perceived what appeared to be a hole in the snow
it is the cave said umbopa
we made the best of our way to the spot and found sure enough that the hole was the mouth of a cavern no doubt the same as that of which da silvestra wrote
we were not too soon for just as we reached shelter the sun went down with startling rapidity leaving the world nearly dark for in these latitudes there is but little twilight
so we crept into the cave which did not appear to be very big and huddling ourselves together for warmth swallowed what remained of our brandybarely a mouthful eachand tried to forget our miseries in sleep
but the cold was too intense to allow us to do so for i am convinced that at this great altitude the thermometer cannot have marked less than fourteen or fifteen degrees below freezing point
what such a temperature meant to us enervated as we were by hardship want of food and the great heat of the desert the reader may imagine better than i can describe
suffice it to say that it was something as near death from exposure as i have ever felt
there we sat hour after hour through the still and bitter night feeling the frost wander round and nip us now in the finger now in the foot now in the face
in vain did we huddle up closer and closer there was no warmth in our miserable starved carcases
sometimes one of us would drop into an uneasy slumber for a few minutes but we could not sleep much and perhaps this was fortunate for if we had i doubt if we should have ever woke again
indeed i believe that it was only by force of will that we kept ourselves alive at all
not very long before dawn i heard the hottentot ventvgel whose teeth had been chattering all night like castanets give a deep sigh
then his teeth stopped chattering
i did not think anything of it at the time concluding that he had gone to sleep
his back was resting against mine and it seemed to grow colder and colder till at last it felt like ice
at length the air began to grow grey with light then golden arrows sped across the snow and at last the glorious sun peeped above the lava wall and looked in upon our halffrozen forms
also it looked upon ventvgel sitting there amongst us stone dead
no wonder his back felt cold poor fellow
he had died when i heard him sigh and was now frozen almost stiff
shocked beyond measure we dragged ourselves from the corpsehow strange is that horror we mortals have of the companionship of a dead bodyand left it sitting there its arms clasped about its knees
by this time the sunlight was pouring its cold rays for here they were cold straight into the mouth of the cave
suddenly i heard an exclamation of fear from someone and turned my head
and this is what i saw sitting at the end of the cavernit was not more than twenty feet longwas another form of which the head rested on its chest and the long arms hung down
i stared at it and saw that this too was a dead man and what was more a white man
the others saw also and the sight proved too much for our shattered nerves
one and all we scrambled out of the cave as fast as our halffrozen limbs would carry us
solomons road outside the cavern we halted feeling rather foolish
i am going back said sir henry
why asked good
because it has struck me thatwhat we sawmay be my brother this was a new idea and we reentered the place to put it to the proof
after the bright light outside our eyes weak as they were with staring at the snow could not pierce the gloom of the cave for a while
presently however they grew accustomed to the semidarkness and we advanced towards the dead man
sir henry knelt down and peered into his face
thank god he said with a sigh of relief it is not my brother then i drew near and looked
the body was that of a tall man in middle life with aquiline features grizzled hair and a long black moustache
the skin was perfectly yellow and stretched tightly over the bones
its clothing with the exception of what seemed to be the remains of a woollen pair of hose had been removed leaving the skeletonlike frame naked
round the neck of the corpse which was frozen perfectly stiff hung a yellow ivory crucifix
who on earth can it be said i
cant you guess asked good
i shook my head
why the old dom jos da silvestra of coursewho else impossible i gasped he died three hundred years ago and what is there to prevent him from lasting for three thousand years in this atmosphere i should like to know asked good
if only the temperature is sufficiently low flesh and blood will keep fresh as new zealand mutton for ever and heaven knows it is cold enough here
the sun never gets in here no animal comes here to tear or destroy
no doubt his slave of whom he speaks on the writing took off his clothes and left him
he could not have buried him alone
look he went on stooping down to pick up a queerlyshaped bone scraped at the end into a sharp point here is the cleft bone that silvestra used to draw the map with we gazed for a moment astonished forgetting our own miseries in this extraordinary and as it seemed to us semimiraculous sight
ay said sir henry and this is where he got his ink from and he pointed to a small wound on the doms left arm
did ever man see such a thing before there was no longer any doubt about the matter which for my own part i confess perfectly appalled me
there he sat the dead man whose directions written some ten generations ago had led us to this spot
here in my own hand was the rude pen with which he had written them and about his neck hung the crucifix that his dying lips had kissed
gazing at him my imagination could reconstruct the last scene of the drama the traveller dying of cold and starvation yet striving to convey to the world the great secret which he had discoveredthe awful loneliness of his death of which the evidence sat before us
it even seemed to me that i could trace in his stronglymarked features a likeness to those of my poor friend silvestre his descendant who had died twenty years before in my arms but perhaps that was fancy
at any rate there he sat a sad memento of the fate that so often overtakes those who would penetrate into the unknown and there doubtless he will still sit crowned with the dread majesty of death for centuries yet unborn to startle the eyes of wanderers like ourselves if ever any such should come again to invade his loneliness
the thing overpowered us already almost perished as we were with cold and hunger
let us go said sir henry in a low voice stay we will give him a companion and lifting up the dead body of the hottentot ventvgel he placed it near to that of the old dom
then he stooped and with a jerk broke the rotten string of the crucifix which hung round da silvestras neck for his fingers were too cold to attempt to unfasten it
i believe that he has it still
i took the bone pen and it is before me as i writesometimes i use it to sign my name
then leaving these two the proud white man of a past age and the poor hottentot to keep their eternal vigil in the midst of the eternal snows we crept out of the cave into the welcome sunshine and resumed our path wondering in our hearts how many hours it would be before we were even as they are
when we had walked about half a mile we came to the edge of the plateau for the nipple of the mountain does not rise out of its exact centre though from the desert side it had seemed to do so
what lay below us we could not see for the landscape was wreathed in billows of morning fog
presently however the higher layers of mist cleared a little and revealed at the end of a long slope of snow a patch of green grass some five hundred yards beneath us through which a stream was running
nor was this all
by the stream basking in the bright sun stood and lay a group of from ten to fifteen large antelopesat that distance we could not see of what species
the sight filled us with an unreasoning joy
if only we could get it there was food in plenty
but the question was how to do so
the beasts were fully six hundred yards off a very long shot and one not to be depended on when our lives hung on the results
rapidly we discussed the advisability of trying to stalk the game but in the end dismissed it reluctantly
to begin with the wind was not favourable and further we must certainly be perceived however careful we were against the blinding background of snow which we should be obliged to traverse
well we must have a try from where we are said sir henry
which shall it be quatermain the repeating rifles or the expresses here again was a question
the winchester repeatersof which we had two umbopa carrying poor ventvgels as well as his ownwere sighted up to a thousand yards whereas the expresses were only sighted to three hundred and fifty beyond which distance shooting with them was more or less guesswork
on the other hand if they did hit the express bullets being expanding were much more likely to bring the game down
it was a knotty point but i made up my mind that we must risk it and use the expresses
let each of us take the buck opposite to him
aim well at the point of the shoulder and high up said i and umbopa do you give the word so that we may all fire together then came a pause each of us aiming his level best as indeed a man is likely to do when he knows that life itself depends upon the shot
fire said umbopa in zulu and at almost the same instant the three rifles rang out loudly three clouds of smoke hung for a moment before us and a hundred echoes went flying over the silent snow
presently the smoke cleared and revealedoh joya great buck lying on its back and kicking furiously in its death agony
we gave a yell of triumphwe were savedwe should not starve
weak as we were we rushed down the intervening slope of snow and in ten minutes from the time of shooting that animals heart and liver were lying before us
but now a new difficulty arose we had no fuel and therefore could make no fire to cook them
we gazed at each other in dismay
starving men should not be fanciful said good we must eat raw meat there was no other way out of the dilemma and our gnawing hunger made the proposition less distasteful than it would otherwise have been
so we took the heart and liver and buried them for a few minutes in a patch of snow to cool them
then we washed them in the icecold water of the stream and lastly ate them greedily
it sounds horrible enough but honestly i never tasted anything so good as that raw meat
in a quarter of an hour we were changed men
our life and vigour came back to us our feeble pulses grew strong again and the blood went coursing through our veins
but mindful of the results of overfeeding on starved stomachs we were careful not to eat too much stopping whilst we were still hungry
thank heaven said sir henry that brute has saved our lives
what is it quatermain i rose and went to look at the antelope for i was not certain
it was about the size of a donkey with large curved horns
i had never seen one like it before the species was new to me
it was brown in colour with faint red stripes and grew a thick coat
i afterwards discovered that the natives of that wonderful country call these bucks inco they are very rare and only found at a great altitude where no other game will live
this animal was fairly hit high up in the shoulder though whose bullet brought it down we could not of course discover
i believe that good mindful of his marvellous shot at the giraffe secretly set it down to his own prowess and we did not contradict him
we had been so busy satisfying our hunger that hitherto we had not found time to look about us
but now having set umbopa to cut off as much of the best meat as we were likely to be able to carry we began to inspect our surroundings
the mist had cleared away for it was eight oclock and the sun had sucked it up so we were able to take in all the country before us at a glance
i know not how to describe the glorious panorama which unfolded itself to our gaze
i have never seen anything like it before nor shall i suppose again
behind and over us towered shebas snowy breasts and below some five thousand feet beneath where we stood lay league on league of the most lovely champaign country
here were dense patches of lofty forest there a great river wound its silvery way
to the left stretched a vast expanse of rich undulating veld or grass land whereon we could just make out countless herds of game or cattle at that distance we could not tell which
this expanse appeared to be ringed in by a wall of distant mountains
to the right the country was more or less mountainous that is solitary hills stood up from its level with stretches of cultivated land between amongst which we could see groups of domeshaped huts
the landscape lay before us as a map wherein rivers flashed like silver snakes and alplike peaks crowned with wildly twisted snow wreaths rose in grandeur whilst over all was the glad sunlight and the breath of natures happy life
two curious things struck us as we gazed
first that the country before us must lie at least three thousand feet higher than the desert we had crossed and secondly that all the rivers flowed from south to north
as we had painful reason to know there was no water upon the southern side of the vast range on which we stood but on the northern face were many streams most of which appeared to unite with the great river we could see winding away farther than our eyes could follow
we sat down for a while and gazed in silence at this wonderful view
presently sir henry spoke
isnt there something on the map about solomons great road he said
i nodded for i was still gazing out over the far country
well look there it is and he pointed a little to our right
good and i looked accordingly and there winding away towards the plain was what appeared to be a wide turnpike road
we had not seen it at first because on reaching the plain it turned behind some broken country
we did not say anything at least not much we were beginning to lose the sense of wonder
somehow it did not seem particularly unnatural that we should find a sort of roman road in this strange land
we accepted the fact that was all
well said good it must be quite near us if we cut off to the right
hadnt we better be making a start this was sound advice and so soon as we had washed our faces and hands in the stream we acted on it
for a mile or more we made our way over boulders and across patches of snow till suddenly on reaching the top of the little rise we found the road at our feet
it was a splendid road cut out of the solid rock at least fifty feet wide and apparently well kept though the odd thing was that it seemed to begin there
we walked down and stood on it but one single hundred paces behind us in the direction of shebas breasts it vanished the entire surface of the mountain being strewn with boulders interspersed with patches of snow
what do you make of this quatermain asked sir henry
i shook my head i could make nothing of the thing
i have it said good the road no doubt ran right over the range and across the desert on the other side but the sand there has covered it up and above us it has been obliterated by some volcanic eruption of molten lava this seemed a good suggestion at any rate we accepted it and proceeded down the mountain
it proved a very different business travelling along down hill on that magnificent pathway with full stomachs from what it was travelling uphill over the snow quite starved and almost frozen
indeed had it not been for melancholy recollections of poor ventvgels sad fate and of that grim cave where he kept company with the old dom we should have felt positively cheerful notwithstanding the sense of unknown dangers before us
every mile we walked the atmosphere grew softer and balmier and the country before us shone with a yet more luminous beauty
as for the road itself i never saw such an engineering work though sir henry said that the great road over the st gothard in switzerland is very similar
no difficulty had been too great for the old world engineer who laid it out
at one place we came to a ravine three hundred feet broad and at least a hundred feet deep
this vast gulf was actually filled in with huge blocks of dressed stone having arches pierced through them at the bottom for a waterway over which the road went on sublimely
at another place it was cut in zigzags out of the side of a precipice five hundred feet deep and in a third it tunnelled through the base of an intervening ridge a space of thirty yards or more
here we noticed that the sides of the tunnel were covered with quaint sculptures mostly of mailed figures driving in chariots
one which was exceedingly beautiful represented a whole battle scene with a convoy of captives being marched off in the distance
well said sir henry after inspecting this ancient work of art it is very well to call this solomons road but my humble opinion is that the egyptians had been here before solomons people ever set a foot on it
if this isnt egyptian or phoenician handiwork i must say that it is very like it by midday we had advanced sufficiently down the mountain to search the region where wood was to be met with
first we came to scattered bushes which grew more and more frequent till at last we found the road winding through a vast grove of silver trees similar to those which are to be seen on the slopes of table mountain at cape town
i had never before met with them in all my wanderings except at the cape and their appearance here astonished me greatly
ah said good surveying these shiningleaved trees with evident enthusiasm here is lots of wood let us stop and cook some dinner i have about digested that raw heart nobody objected to this so leaving the road we made our way to a stream which was babbling away not far off and soon had a goodly fire of dry boughs blazing
cutting off some substantial hunks from the flesh of the inco which we had brought with us we proceeded to toast them on the end of sharp sticks as one sees the kafirs do and ate them with relish
after filling ourselves we lit our pipes and gave ourselves up to enjoyment that compared with the hardships we had recently undergone seemed almost heavenly
the brook of which the banks were clothed with dense masses of a gigantic species of maidenhair fern interspersed with feathery tufts of wild asparagus sung merrily at our side the soft air murmured through the leaves of the silver trees doves cooed around and brightwinged birds flashed like living gems from bough to bough
it was a paradise
the magic of the place combined with an overwhelming sense of dangers left behind and of the promised land reached at last seemed to charm us into silence
sir henry and umbopa sat conversing in a mixture of broken english and kitchen zulu in a low voice but earnestly enough and i lay with my eyes half shut upon that fragrant bed of fern and watched them
presently i missed good and i looked to see what had become of him
soon i observed him sitting by the bank of the stream in which he had been bathing
he had nothing on but his flannel shirt and his natural habits of extreme neatness having reasserted themselves he was actively employed in making a most elaborate toilet
he had washed his guttapercha collar had thoroughly shaken out his trousers coat and waistcoat and was now folding them up neatly till he was ready to put them on shaking his head sadly as he scanned the numerous rents and tears in them which naturally had resulted from our frightful journey
then he took his boots scrubbed them with a handful of fern and finally rubbed them over with a piece of fat which he had carefully saved from the inco meat till they looked comparatively speaking respectable
having inspected them judiciously through his eyeglass he put the boots on and began a fresh operation
from a little bag that he carried he produced a pocketcomb in which was fixed a tiny lookingglass and in this he surveyed himself
apparently he was not satisfied for he proceeded to do his hair with great care
then came a pause whilst he again contemplated the effect still it was not satisfactory
he felt his chin on which the accumulated scrub of a ten days beard was flourishing
surely thought i he is not going to try to shave but so it was
taking the piece of fat with which he had greased his boots good washed it thoroughly in the stream
then diving again into the bag he brought out a little pocket razor with a guard to it such as are bought by people who are afraid of cutting themselves or by those about to undertake a sea voyage
then he rubbed his face and chin vigorously with the fat and began
evidently it proved a painful process for he groaned very much over it and i was convulsed with inward laughter as i watched him struggling with that stubbly beard
it seemed so very odd that a man should take the trouble to shave himself with a piece of fat in such a place and in our circumstances
at last he succeeded in getting the hair off the right side of his face and chin when suddenly i who was watching became conscious of a flash of light that passed just by his head
good sprang up with a profane exclamation if it had not been a safety razor he would certainly have cut his throat and so did i without the exclamation and this was what i saw
standing not more than twenty paces from where i was and ten from good were a group of men
they were very tall and coppercoloured and some of them wore great plumes of black feathers and short cloaks of leopard skins this was all i noticed at the moment
in front of them stood a youth of about seventeen his hand still raised and his body bent forward in the attitude of a grecian statue of a spearthrower
evidently the flash of light had been caused by a weapon which he had hurled
as i looked an old soldierlike man stepped forward out of the group and catching the youth by the arm said something to him
then they advanced upon us
sir henry good and umbopa by this time had seized their rifles and lifted them threateningly
the party of natives still came on
it struck me that they could not know what rifles were or they would not have treated them with such contempt
put down your guns i halloed to the others seeing that our only chance of safety lay in conciliation
they obeyed and walking to the front i addressed the elderly man who had checked the youth
greeting i said in zulu not knowing what language to use
to my surprise i was understood
greeting answered the old man not indeed in the same tongue but in a dialect so closely allied to it that neither umbopa nor myself had any difficulty in understanding him
indeed as we afterwards found out the language spoken by this people is an oldfashioned form of the zulu tongue bearing about the same relationship to it that the english of chaucer does to the english of the nineteenth century
whence come you he went on who are you
and why are the faces of three of you white and the face of the fourth as the face of our mothers sons and he pointed to umbopa
i looked at umbopa as he said it and it flashed across me that he was right
the face of umbopa was like the faces of the men before me and so was his great form like their forms
but i had not time to reflect on this coincidence
we are strangers and come in peace i answered speaking very slowly so that he might understand me and this man is our servant you lie he answered no strangers can cross the mountains where all things perish
but what do your lies matterif ye are strangers then ye must die for no strangers may live in the land of the kukuanas
it is the kings law
prepare then to die o strangers i was slightly staggered at this more especially as i saw the hands of some of the men steal down to their sides where hung on each what looked to me like a large and heavy knife
what does that beggar say asked good
he says we are going to be killed i answered grimly
oh lord groaned good and as was his way when perplexed he put his hand to his false teeth dragging the top set down and allowing them to fly back to his jaw with a snap
it was a most fortunate move for next second the dignified crowd of kukuanas uttered a simultaneous yell of horror and bolted back some yards
whats up said i
its his teeth whispered sir henry excitedly
he moved them
take them out good take them out he obeyed slipping the set into the sleeve of his flannel shirt
in another second curiosity had overcome fear and the men advanced slowly
apparently they had now forgotten their amiable intention of killing us
how is it o strangers asked the old man solemnly that this fat man pointing to good who was clad in nothing but boots and a flannel shirt and had only half finished his shaving whose body is clothed and whose legs are bare who grows hair on one side of his sickly face and not on the other and who wears one shining and transparent eyehow is it i ask that he has teeth which move of themselves coming away from the jaws and returning of their own will open your mouth i said to good who promptly curled up his lips and grinned at the old gentleman like an angry dog revealing to his astonished gaze two thin red lines of gum as utterly innocent of ivories as a newborn elephant
the audience gasped
where are his teeth they shouted with our eyes we saw them turning his head slowly and with a gesture of ineffable contempt good swept his hand across his mouth
then he grinned again and lo there were two rows of lovely teeth
now the young man who had flung the knife threw himself down on the grass and gave vent to a prolonged howl of terror and as for the old gentleman his knees knocked together with fear
i see that ye are spirits he said falteringly did ever man born of woman have hair on one side of his face and not on the other or a round and transparent eye or teeth which moved and melted away and grew again
pardon us o my lords here was luck indeed and needless to say i jumped at the chance
it is granted i said with an imperial smile
nay ye shall know the truth
we come from another world though we are men such as ye we come i went on from the biggest star that shines at night oh
oh groaned the chorus of astonished aborigines
yes i went on we do indeed and again i smiled benignly as i uttered that amazing lie
we come to stay with you a little while and to bless you by our sojourn
ye will see o friends that i have prepared myself for this visit by the learning of your language it is so it is so said the chorus
only my lord put in the old gentleman thou hast learnt it very badly i cast an indignant glance at him and he quailed
now friends i continued ye might think that after so long a journey we should find it in our hearts to avenge such a reception mayhap to strike cold in death the imperious hand thatthat in shortthrew a knife at the head of him whose teeth come and go spare him my lords said the old man in supplication he is the kings son and i am his uncle
if anything befalls him his blood will be required at my hands yes that is certainly so put in the young man with great emphasis
ye may perhaps doubt our power to avenge i went on heedless of this byplay
stay i will show you
here thou dog and slave addressing umbopa in a savage tone give me the magic tube that speaks and i tipped a wink towards my express rifle
umbopa rose to the occasion and with something as nearly resembling a grin as i have ever seen on his dignified face he handed me the gun
it is here o lord of lords he said with a deep obeisance
now just before i had asked for the rifle i had perceived a little klipspringer antelope standing on a mass of rock about seventy yards away and determined to risk the shot
ye see that buck i said pointing the animal out to the party before me
tell me is it possible for man born of woman to kill it from here with a noise it is not possible my lord answered the old man
yet shall i kill it i said quietly
the old man smiled
that my lord cannot do he answered
i raised the rifle and covered the buck
it was a small animal and one which a man might well be excused for missing but i knew that it would not do to miss
i drew a deep breath and slowly pressed on the trigger
the buck stood still as a stone
bang
thud the antelope sprang into the air and fell on the rock dead as a door nail
a groan of simultaneous terror burst from the group before us
if you want meat i remarked coolly go fetch that buck the old man made a sign and one of his followers departed and presently returned bearing the klipspringer
i noticed with satisfaction that i had hit it fairly behind the shoulder
they gathered round the poor creatures body gazing at the bullethole in consternation
ye see i said i do not speak empty words there was no answer
if ye yet doubt our power i went on let one of you go stand upon that rock that i may make him as this buck none of them seemed at all inclined to take the hint till at last the kings son spoke
it is well said
do thou my uncle go stand upon the rock
it is but a buck that the magic has killed
surely it cannot kill a man the old gentleman did not take the suggestion in good part
indeed he seemed hurt
no
no he ejaculated hastily my old eyes have seen enough
these are wizards indeed
let us bring them to the king
yet if any should wish a further proof let him stand upon the rock that the magic tube may speak with him there was a most general and hasty expression of dissent
let not good magic be wasted on our poor bodies said one we are satisfied
all the witchcraft of our people cannot show the like of this it is so remarked the old gentleman in a tone of intense relief without any doubt it is so
listen children of the stars children of the shining eye and the movable teeth who roar out in thunder and slay from afar
i am infadoos son of kafa once king of the kukuana people
this youth is scragga he nearly scragged me murmured good
scragga son of twala the great kingtwala husband of a thousand wives chief and lord paramount of the kukuanas keeper of the great road terror of his enemies student of the black arts leader of a hundred thousand warriors twala the oneeyed the black the terrible so said i superciliously lead us then to twala
we do not talk with low people and underlings it is well my lords we will lead you but the way is long
we are hunting three days journey from the place of the king
but let my lords have patience and we will lead them so be it i said carelessly all time is before us for we do not die
we are ready lead on
but infadoos and thou scragga beware
play us no monkey tricks set for us no foxes snares for before your brains of mud have thought of them we shall know and avenge
the light of the transparent eye of him with the bare legs and the halfhaired face shall destroy you and go through your land his vanishing teeth shall affix themselves fast in you and eat you up you and your wives and children the magic tubes shall argue with you loudly and make you as sieves
beware this magnificent address did not fail of its effect indeed it might almost have been spared so deeply were our friends already impressed with our powers
the old man made a deep obeisance and murmured the words koom koom which i afterwards discovered was their royal salute corresponding to the bayte of the zulus and turning addressed his followers
these at once proceeded to lay hold of all our goods and chattels in order to bear them for us excepting only the guns which they would on no account touch
they even seized goods clothes that as the reader may remember were neatly folded up beside him
he saw and made a dive for them and a loud altercation ensued
let not my lord of the transparent eye and the melting teeth touch them said the old man
surely his slave shall carry the things but i want to put em on roared good in nervous english
umbopa translated
nay my lord answered infadoos would my lord cover up his beautiful white legs although he is so dark good has a singularly white skin from the eyes of his servants
have we offended my lord that he should do such a thing here i nearly exploded with laughing and meanwhile one of the men started on with the garments
damn it roared good that black villain has got my trousers look here good said sir henry you have appeared in this country in a certain character and you must live up to it
it will never do for you to put on trousers again
henceforth you must exist in a flannel shirt a pair of boots and an eyeglass yes i said and with whiskers on one side of your face and not on the other
if you change any of these things the people will think that we are impostors
i am very sorry for you but seriously you must
if once they begin to suspect us our lives will not be worth a brass farthing do you really think so said good gloomily
i do indeed
your beautiful white legs and your eyeglass are now the features of our party and as sir henry says you must live up to them
be thankful that you have got your boots on and that the air is warm good sighed and said no more but it took him a fortnight to become accustomed to his new and scant attire
we enter kukuanaland all that afternoon we travelled along the magnificent roadway which trended steadily in a northwesterly direction
infadoos and scragga walked with us but their followers marched about one hundred paces ahead
infadoos i said at length who made this road it was made my lord of old time none know how or when not even the wise woman gagool who has lived for generations
we are not old enough to remember its making
none can fashion such roads now but the king suffers no grass to grow upon it and whose are the writings on the wall of the caves through which we have passed on the road i asked referring to the egyptianlike sculptures that we had seen
my lord the hands that made the road wrote the wonderful writings
we know not who wrote them when did the kukuana people come into this country my lord the race came down here like the breath of a storm ten thousand thousand moons ago from the great lands which lie there beyond and he pointed to the north
they could travel no further because of the high mountains which ring in the land so say the old voices of our fathers that have descended to us the children and so says gagool the wise woman the smeller out of witches and again he pointed to the snowclad peaks
the country too was good so they settled here and grew strong and powerful and now our numbers are like the sea sand and when twala the king calls up his regiments their plumes cover the plain so far as the eye of man can reach and if the land is walled in with mountains who is there for the regiments to fight with nay my lord the country is open there towards the north and now and again warriors sweep down upon us in clouds from a land we know not and we slay them
it is the third part of the life of a man since there was a war
many thousands died in it but we destroyed those who came to eat us up
so since then there has been no war your warriors must grow weary of resting on their spears infadoos my lord there was one war just after we destroyed the people that came down upon us but it was a civil war dog ate dog how was that my lord the king my halfbrother had a brother born at the same birth and of the same woman
it is not our custom my lord to suffer twins to live the weaker must always die
but the mother of the king hid away the feebler child which was born the last for her heart yearned over it and that child is twala the king
i am his younger brother born of another wife well my lord kafa our father died when we came to manhood and my brother imotu was made king in his place and for a space reigned and had a son by his favourite wife
when the babe was three years old just after the great war during which no man could sow or reap a famine came upon the land and the people murmured because of the famine and looked round like a starved lion for something to rend
then it was that gagool the wise and terrible woman who does not die made a proclamation to the people saying the king imotu is no king and at the time imotu was sick with a wound and lay in his kraal not able to move
then gagool went into a hut and led out twala my halfbrother and twin brother to the king whom she had hidden among the caves and rocks since he was born and stripping the moocha waistcloth off his loins showed the people of the kukuanas the mark of the sacred snake coiled round his middle wherewith the eldest son of the king is marked at birth and cried out loud behold your king whom i have saved for you even to this day now the people being mad with hunger and altogether bereft of reason and the knowledge of truth cried outthe king
the king but i knew that it was not so for imotu my brother was the elder of the twins and our lawful king
then just as the tumult was at its height imotu the king though he was very sick crawled from his hut holding his wife by the hand and followed by his little son ignosithat is by interpretation the lightning
what is this noise he asked
why cry ye the king
the king then twala his twin brother born of the same woman and in the same hour ran to him and taking him by the hair stabbed him through the heart with his knife
and the people being fickle and ever ready to worship the rising sun clapped their hands and cried twala is king now we know that twala is king and what became of imotus wife and her son ignosi
did twala kill them too nay my lord
when she saw that her lord was dead the queen seized the child with a cry and ran away
two days afterward she came to a kraal very hungry and none would give her milk or food now that her lord the king was dead for all men hate the unfortunate
but at nightfall a little child a girl crept out and brought her corn to eat and she blessed the child and went on towards the mountains with her boy before the sun rose again and there she must have perished for none have seen her since nor the child ignosi then if this child ignosi had lived he would be the true king of the kukuana people that is so my lord the sacred snake is round his middle
if he lives he is king but alas
he is long dead see my lord and infadoos pointed to a vast collection of huts surrounded by a fence which was in its turn encircled by a great ditch that lay on the plain beneath us
that is the kraal where the wife of imotu was last seen with the child ignosi
it is there that we shall sleep tonight if indeed he added doubtfully my lords sleep at all upon this earth when we are among the kukuanas my good friend infadoos we do as the kukuanas do i said majestically and turned round quickly to address good who was tramping along sullenly behind his mind fully occupied with unsatisfactory attempts to prevent his flannel shirt from flapping in the evening breeze
to my astonishment i butted into umbopa who was walking along immediately behind me and very evidently had been listening with the greatest interest to my conversation with infadoos
the expression on his face was most curious and gave me the idea of a man who was struggling with partial success to bring something long ago forgotten back into his mind
all this while we had been pressing on at a good rate towards the undulating plain beneath us
the mountains we had crossed now loomed high above our heads and shebas breasts were veiled modestly in diaphanous wreaths of mist
as we went the country grew more and more lovely
the vegetation was luxuriant without being tropical the sun was bright and warm but not burning and a gracious breeze blew softly along the odorous slopes of the mountains
indeed this new land was little less than an earthly paradise in beauty in natural wealth and in climate i have never seen its like
the transvaal is a fine country but it is nothing to kukuanaland
so soon as we started infadoos had despatched a runner to warn the people of the kraal which by the way was in his military command of our arrival
this man had departed at an extraordinary speed which infadoos informed me he would keep up all the way as running was an exercise much practised among his people
the result of this message now became apparent
when we arrived within two miles of the kraal we could see that company after company of men were issuing from its gates and marching towards us
sir henry laid his hand upon my arm and remarked that it looked as though we were going to meet with a warm reception
something in his tone attracted infadoos attention
let not my lords be afraid he said hastily for in my breast there dwells no guile
this regiment is one under my command and comes out by my orders to greet you i nodded easily though i was not quite easy in my mind
about half a mile from the gates of this kraal is a long stretch of rising ground sloping gently upwards from the road and here the companies formed
it was a splendid sight to see them each company about three hundred strong charging swiftly up the rise with flashing spears and waving plumes to take their appointed place
by the time we reached the slope twelve such companies or in all three thousand six hundred men had passed out and taken up their positions along the road
presently we came to the first company and were able to gaze in astonishment on the most magnificent set of warriors that i have ever seen
they were all men of mature age mostly veterans of about forty and not one of them was under six feet in height whilst many stood six feet three or four
they wore upon their heads heavy black plumes of sakaboola feathers like those which adorned our guides
about their waists and beneath the right knees were bound circlets of white ox tails while in their left hands they carried round shields measuring about twenty inches across
these shields are very curious
the framework is made of an iron plate beaten out thin over which is stretched milkwhite oxhide
the weapons that each man bore were simple but most effective consisting of a short and very heavy twoedged spear with a wooden shaft the blade being about six inches across at the widest part
these spears are not used for throwing but like the zulu bangwan or stabbing assegai are for close quarters only when the wound inflicted by them is terrible
in addition to his bangwan every man carried three large and heavy knives each knife weighing about two pounds
one knife was fixed in the oxtail girdle and the other two at the back of the round shield
these knives which are called tollas by the kukuanas take the place of the throwing assegai of the zulus
the kukuana warriors can cast them with great accuracy to a distance of fifty yards and it is their custom on charging to hurl a volley of them at the enemy as they come to close quarters
each company remained still as a collection of bronze statues till we were opposite to it when at a signal given by its commanding officer who distinguished by a leopard skin cloak stood some paces in front every spear was raised into the air and from three hundred throats sprang forth with a sudden roar the royal salute of koom then so soon as we had passed the company formed up behind us and followed us towards the kraal till at last the whole regiment of the greysso called from their white shieldsthe crack corps of the kukuana people was marching in our rear with a tread that shook the ground
at length branching off from solomons great road we came to the wide fosse surrounding the kraal which is at least a mile round and fenced with a strong palisade of piles formed of the trunks of trees
at the gateway this fosse is spanned by a primitive drawbridge which was let down by the guard to allow us to pass in
the kraal is exceedingly well laid out
through the centre runs a wide pathway intersected at right angles by other pathways so arranged as to cut the huts into square blocks each block being the quarters of a company
the huts are domeshaped and built like those of the zulus of a framework of wattle beautifully thatched with grass but unlike the zulu huts they have doorways through which men could walk
also they are much larger and surrounded by a verandah about six feet wide beautifully paved with powdered lime trodden hard
all along each side of this wide pathway that pierces the kraal were ranged hundreds of women brought out by curiosity to look at us
these women for a native race are exceedingly handsome
they are tall and graceful and their figures are wonderfully fine
the hair though short is rather curly than woolly the features are frequently aquiline and the lips are not unpleasantly thick as is the case among most african races
but what struck us most was their exceedingly quiet and dignified air
they were as wellbred in their way as the habitues of a fashionable drawingroom and in this respect they differ from zulu women and their cousins the masai who inhabit the district beyond zanzibar
their curiosity had brought them out to see us but they allowed no rude expressions of astonishment or savage criticism to pass their lips as we trudged wearily in front of them
not even when old infadoos with a surreptitious motion of the hand pointed out the crowning wonder of poor goods beautiful white legs did they suffer the feeling of intense admiration which evidently mastered their minds to find expression
they fixed their dark eyes upon this new and snowy loveliness for as i think i have said goods skin is exceedingly white and that was all
but it was quite enough for good who is modest by nature
when we reached the centre of the kraal infadoos halted at the door of a large hut which was surrounded at a distance by a circle of smaller ones
enter sons of the stars he said in a magniloquent voice and deign to rest awhile in our humble habitations
a little food shall be brought to you so that ye may have no need to draw your belts tight from hunger some honey and some milk and an ox or two and a few sheep not much my lords but still a little food it is good said i
infadoos we are weary with travelling through realms of air now let us rest accordingly we entered the hut which we found amply prepared for our comfort
couches of tanned skins were spread for us to lie on and water was placed for us to wash in
presently we heard a shouting outside and stepping to the door saw a line of damsels bearing milk and roasted mealies and honey in a pot
behind these were some youths driving a fat young ox
we received the gifts and then one of the young men drew the knife from his girdle and dexterously cut the oxs throat
in ten minutes it was dead skinned and jointed
the best of the meat was then cut off for us and the rest in the name of our party i presented to the warriors round us who took it and distributed the white lords gift umbopa set to work with the assistance of an extremely prepossessing young woman to boil our portion in a large earthenware pot over a fire which was built outside the hut and when it was nearly ready we sent a message to infadoos and asked him and scragga the kings son to join us
presently they came and sitting down upon little stools of which there were several about the hut for the kukuanas do not in general squat upon their haunches like the zulus they helped us to get through our dinner
the old gentleman was most affable and polite but it struck me that the young one regarded us with doubt
together with the rest of the party he had been overawed by our white appearance and by our magic properties but it seemed to me that on discovering that we ate drank and slept like other mortals his awe was beginning to wear off and to be replaced by a sullen suspicionwhich made me feel rather uncomfortable
in the course of our meal sir henry suggested to me that it might be well to try to discover if our hosts knew anything of his brothers fate or if they had ever seen or heard of him but on the whole i thought that it would be wiser to say nothing of the matter at this time
it was difficult to explain a relative lost from the stars after supper we produced our pipes and lit them a proceeding which filled infadoos and scragga with astonishment
the kukuanas were evidently unacquainted with the divine delights of tobaccosmoke
the herb is grown among them extensively but like the zulus they use it for snuff only and quite failed to identify it in its new form
presently i asked infadoos when we were to proceed on our journey and was delighted to learn that preparations had been made for us to leave on the following morning messengers having already departed to inform twala the king of our coming
it appeared that twala was at his principal place known as loo making ready for the great annual feast which was to be held in the first week of june
at this gathering all the regiments with the exception of certain detachments left behind for garrison purposes are brought up and paraded before the king and the great annual witchhunt of which more byandby is held
we were to start at dawn and infadoos who was to accompany us expected that we should reach loo on the night of the second day unless we were detained by accident or by swollen rivers
when they had given us this information our visitors bade us goodnight and having arranged to watch turn and turn about three of us flung ourselves down and slept the sweet sleep of the weary whilst the fourth sat up on the lookout for possible treachery
twala the king it will not be necessary for me to detail at length the incidents of our journey to loo
it took two full days travelling along solomons great road which pursued its even course right into the heart of kukuanaland
suffice it to say that as we went the country seemed to grow richer and richer and the kraals with their wide surrounding belts of cultivation more and more numerous
they were all built upon the same principles as the first camp which we had reached and were guarded by ample garrisons of troops
indeed in kukuanaland as among the germans the zulus and the masai every ablebodied man is a soldier so that the whole force of the nation is available for its wars offensive or defensive
as we travelled we were overtaken by thousands of warriors hurrying up to loo to be present at the great annual review and festival and more splendid troops i never saw
at sunset on the second day we stopped to rest awhile upon the summit of some heights over which the road ran and there on a beautiful and fertile plain before us lay loo itself
for a native town it is an enormous place quite five miles round i should say with outlying kraals projecting from it that serve on grand occasions as cantonments for the regiments and a curious horseshoeshaped hill with which we were destined to become better acquainted about two miles to the north
it is beautifully situated and through the centre of the kraal dividing it into two portions runs a river which appeared to be bridged in several places the same indeed that we had seen from the slopes of shebas breasts
sixty or seventy miles away three great snowcapped mountains placed at the points of a triangle started out of the level plain
the conformation of these mountains is unlike that of shebas breasts being sheer and precipitous instead of smooth and rounded
infadoos saw us looking at them and volunteered a remark
the road ends there he said pointing to the mountains known among the kukuanas as the three witches why does it end i asked
who knows he answered with a shrug the mountains are full of caves and there is a great pit between them
it is there that the wise men of old time used to go to get whatever it was they came for to this country and it is there now that our kings are buried in the place of death what was it they came for i asked eagerly
nay i know not
my lords who have dropped from the stars should know he answered with a quick look
evidently he knew more than he chose to say
yes i went on you are right in the stars we learn many things
i have heard for instance that the wise men of old came to these mountains to find bright stones pretty playthings and yellow iron my lord is wise he answered coldly i am but a child and cannot talk with my lord on such matters
my lord must speak with gagool the old at the kings place who is wise even as my lord and he went away
so soon as he was gone i turned to the others and pointed out the mountains
there are solomons diamond mines i said
umbopa was standing with them apparently plunged in one of the fits of abstraction which were common to him and caught my words
yes macumazahn he put in in zulu the diamonds are surely there and you shall have them since you white men are so fond of toys and money how dost thou know that umbopa i asked sharply for i did not like his mysterious ways
he laughed
i dreamed it in the night white men then he too turned on his heel and went
now what said sir henry is our black friend driving at
he knows more than he chooses to say that is clear
by the way quatermain has he heard anything ofof my brother nothing he has asked everyone he has become friendly with but they all declare that no white man has ever been seen in the country before do you suppose that he got here at all suggested good we have only reached the place by a miracle is it likely he could have reached it without the map i dont know said sir henry gloomily but somehow i think that i shall find him slowly the sun sank then suddenly darkness rushed down on the land like a tangible thing
there was no breathingspace between the day and night no soft transformation scene for in these latitudes twilight does not exist
the change from day to night is as quick and as absolute as the change from life to death
the sun sank and the world was wreathed in shadows
but not for long for see in the west there is a glow then come rays of silver light and at last the full and glorious moon lights up the plain and shoots its gleaming arrows far and wide filling the earth with a faint refulgence
we stood and watched the lovely sight whilst the stars grew pale before this chastened majesty and felt our hearts lifted up in the presence of a beauty that i cannot describe
mine has been a rough life but there are a few things i am thankful to have lived for and one of them is to have seen that moon shine over kukuanaland
presently our meditations were broken in upon by our polite friend infadoos
if my lords are rested we will journey on to loo where a hut is made ready for my lords tonight
the moon is now bright so that we shall not fall by the way we assented and in an hours time were at the outskirts of the town of which the extent mapped out as it was by thousands of camp fires appeared absolutely endless
indeed good who is always fond of a bad joke christened it unlimited loo soon we came to a moat with a drawbridge where we were met by the rattling of arms and the hoarse challenge of a sentry
infadoos gave some password that i could not catch which was met with a salute and we passed on through the central street of the great grass city
after nearly half an hours tramp past endless lines of huts infadoos halted at last by the gate of a little group of huts which surrounded a small courtyard of powdered limestone and informed us that these were to be our poor quarters
we entered and found that a hut had been assigned to each of us
these huts were superior to any that we had yet seen and in each was a most comfortable bed made of tanned skins spread upon mattresses of aromatic grass
food too was ready for us and so soon as we had washed ourselves with water which stood ready in earthenware jars some young women of handsome appearance brought us roasted meats and mealie cobs daintily served on wooden platters and presented them to us with deep obeisances
we ate and drank and then the beds having been all moved into one hut by our request a precaution at which the amiable young ladies smiled we flung ourselves down to sleep thoroughly wearied with our long journey
when we woke it was to find the sun high in the heavens and the female attendants who did not seem to be troubled by any false shame already standing inside the hut having been ordered to attend and help us to make ready make ready indeed growled good when one has only a flannel shirt and a pair of boots that does not take long
i wish you would ask them for my trousers quatermain i asked accordingly but was informed that these sacred relics had already been taken to the king who would see us in the forenoon
somewhat to their astonishment and disappointment having requested the young ladies to step outside we proceeded to make the best toilet of which the circumstances admitted
good even went the length of again shaving the right side of his face the left on which now appeared a very fair crop of whiskers we impressed upon him he must on no account touch
as for ourselves we were contented with a good wash and combing our hair
sir henrys yellow locks were now almost upon his shoulders and he looked more like an ancient dane than ever while my grizzled scrub was fully an inch long instead of half an inch which in a general way i considered my maximum length
by the time that we had eaten our breakfast and smoked a pipe a message was brought to us by no less a personage than infadoos himself that twala the king was ready to see us if we would be pleased to come
we remarked in reply that we should prefer to wait till the sun was a little higher we were yet weary with our journey c c it is always well when dealing with uncivilised people not to be in too great a hurry
they are apt to mistake politeness for awe or servility
so although we were quite as anxious to see twala as twala could be to see us we sat down and waited for an hour employing the interval in preparing such presents as our slender stock of goods permittednamely the winchester rifle which had been used by poor ventvgel and some beads
the rifle and ammunition we determined to present to his royal highness and the beads were for his wives and courtiers
we had already given a few to infadoos and scragga and found that they were delighted with them never having seen such things before
at length we declared that we were ready and guided by infadoos started off to the audience umbopa carrying the rifle and beads
after walking a few hundred yards we came to an enclosure something like that surrounding the huts which had been allotted to us only fifty times as big for it could not have covered less than six or seven acres of ground
all round the outside fence stood a row of huts which were the habitations of the kings wives
exactly opposite the gateway on the further side of the open space was a very large hut built by itself in which his majesty resided
all the rest was open ground that is to say it would have been open had it not been filled by company after company of warriors who were mustered there to the number of seven or eight thousand
these men stood still as statues as we advanced through them and it would be impossible to give an adequate idea of the grandeur of the spectacle which they presented with their waving plumes their glancing spears and ironbacked oxhide shields
the space in front of the large hut was empty but before it were placed several stools
on three of these at a sign from infadoos we seated ourselves umbopa standing behind us
as for infadoos he took up a position by the door of the hut
so we waited for ten minutes or more in the midst of a dead silence but conscious that we were the object of the concentrated gaze of some eight thousand pairs of eyes
it was a somewhat trying ordeal but we carried it off as best we could
at length the door of the hut opened and a gigantic figure with a splendid tigerskin karross flung over its shoulders stepped out followed by the boy scragga and what appeared to us to be a witheredup monkey wrapped in a fur cloak
the figure seated itself upon a stool scragga took his stand behind it and the witheredup monkey crept on all fours into the shade of the hut and squatted down
still there was silence
then the gigantic figure slipped off the karross and stood up before us a truly alarming spectacle
it was that of an enormous man with the most entirely repulsive countenance we had ever beheld
this mans lips were as thick as a negros the nose was flat he had but one gleaming black eye for the other was represented by a hollow in the face and his whole expression was cruel and sensual to a degree
from the large head rose a magnificent plume of white ostrich feathers his body was clad in a shirt of shining chain armour whilst round the waist and right knee were the usual garnishes of white oxtail
in his right hand was a huge spear about the neck a thick torque of gold and bound on the forehead shone dully a single and enormous uncut diamond
still there was silence but not for long
presently the man whom we rightly guessed to be the king raised the great javelin in his hand
instantly eight thousand spears were lifted in answer and from eight thousand throats rang out the royal salute of koom three times this was repeated and each time the earth shook with the noise that can only be compared to the deepest notes of thunder
be humble o people piped out a thin voice which seemed to come from the monkey in the shade it is the king it is the king boomed out the eight thousand throats in answer
be humble o people it is the king then there was silence againdead silence
presently however it was broken
a soldier on our left dropped his shield which fell with a clatter on to the limestone flooring
twala turned his one cold eye in the direction of the noise
come hither thou he said in a cold voice
a fine young man stepped out of the ranks and stood before him
it was thy shield that fell thou awkward dog
wilt thou make me a reproach in the eyes of these strangers from the stars
what hast thou to say for thyself we saw the poor fellow turn pale under his dusky skin
it was by chance o calf of the black cow he murmured
then it is a chance for which thou must pay
thou hast made me foolish prepare for death i am the kings ox was the low answer
scragga roared the king let me see how thou canst use thy spear
kill me this blundering fool scragga stepped forward with an illfavoured grin and lifted his spear
the poor victim covered his eyes with his hand and stood still
as for us we were petrified with horror
once twice he waved the spear and then struck ah
right homethe spear stood out a foot behind the soldiers back
he flung up his hands and dropped dead
from the multitude about us rose something like a murmur it rolled round and round and died away
the tragedy was finished there lay the corpse and we had not yet realised that it had been enacted
sir henry sprang up and swore a great oath then overpowered by the sense of silence sat down again
the thrust was a good one said the king take him away four men stepped out of the ranks and lifting the body of the murdered man carried it thence
cover up the bloodstains cover them up piped out the thin voice that proceeded from the monkeylike figure the kings word is spoken the kings doom is done thereupon a girl came forward from behind the hut bearing a jar filled with powdered lime which she scattered over the red mark blotting it from sight
sir henry meanwhile was boiling with rage at what had happened indeed it was with difficulty that we could keep him still
sit down for heavens sake i whispered our lives depend on it he yielded and remained quiet
twala sat silent until the traces of the tragedy had been removed then he addressed us
white people he said who come hither whence i know not and why i know not greeting greeting twala king of the kukuanas i answered
white people whence come ye and what seek ye we come from the stars ask us not how
we come to see this land ye journey from far to see a little thing
and that man with you pointing to umbopa does he also come from the stars even so there are people of thy colour in the heavens above but ask not of matters too high for thee twala the king ye speak with a loud voice people of the stars twala answered in a tone which i scarcely liked
remember that the stars are far off and ye are here
how if i make you as him whom they bore away i laughed out loud though there was little laughter in my heart
o king i said be careful walk warily over hot stones lest thou shouldst burn thy feet hold the spear by the handle lest thou should cut thy hands
touch but one hair of our heads and destruction shall come upon thee
what have not thesepointing to infadoos and scragga who young villain that he was was employed in cleaning the blood of the soldier off his speartold thee what manner of men we are
hast thou seen the like of us and i pointed to good feeling quite sure that he had never seen anybody before who looked in the least like him as he then appeared
it is true i have not said the king surveying good with interest
have they not told thee how we strike with death from afar i went on
they have told me but i believe them not
let me see you kill
kill me a man among those who stand yonderand he pointed to the opposite side of the kraaland i will believe nay i answered we shed no blood of men except in just punishment but if thou wilt see bid thy servants drive in an ox through the kraal gates and before he has run twenty paces i will strike him dead nay laughed the king kill me a man and i will believe good o king so be it i answered coolly do thou walk across the open space and before thy feet reach the gate thou shalt be dead or if thou wilt not send thy son scragga whom at that moment it would have given me much pleasure to shoot
on hearing this suggestion scragga uttered a sort of howl and bolted into the hut
twala frowned majestically the suggestion did not please him
let a young ox be driven in he said
two men at once departed running swiftly
now sir henry said i do you shoot
i want to show this ruffian that i am not the only magician of the party sir henry accordingly took his express and made ready
i hope i shall make a good shot he groaned
you must i answered
if you miss with the first barrel let him have the second
sight for yards and wait till the beast turns broadside on then came a pause until presently we caught sight of an ox running straight for the kraal gate
it came on through the gate then catching sight of the vast concourse of people stopped stupidly turned round and bellowed
nows your time i whispered
up went the rifle
bang
thud
and the ox was kicking on his back shot in the ribs
the semihollow bullet had done its work well and a sigh of astonishment went up from the assembled thousands
i turned round coolly have i lied o king nay white man it is the truth was the somewhat awed answer
listen twala i went on
thou hast seen
now know we come in peace not in war
see and i held up the winchester repeater here is a hollow staff that shall enable thee to kill even as we kill only i lay this charm upon it thou shalt kill no man with it
if thou liftest it against a man it shall kill thee
stay i will show thee
bid a soldier step forty paces and place the shaft of a spear in the ground so that the flat blade looks towards us in a few seconds it was done
now see i will break yonder spear taking a careful sight i fired
the bullet struck the flat of the spear and shattered the blade into fragments
again the sigh of astonishment went up
now twala we give this magic tube to thee and byandby i will show thee how to use it but beware how thou turnest the magic of the stars against a man of earth and i handed him the rifle
the king took it very gingerly and laid it down at his feet
as he did so i observed the wizened monkeylike figure creeping from the shadow of the hut
it crept on all fours but when it reached the place where the king sat it rose upon its feet and throwing the furry covering from its face revealed a most extraordinary and weird countenance
apparently it was that of a woman of great age so shrunken that in size it seemed no larger than the face of a yearold child although made up of a number of deep and yellow wrinkles
set in these wrinkles was a sunken slit that represented the mouth beneath which the chin curved outwards to a point
there was no nose to speak of indeed the visage might have been taken for that of a sundried corpse had it not been for a pair of large black eyes still full of fire and intelligence which gleamed and played under the snowwhite eyebrows and the projecting parchmentcoloured skull like jewels in a charnelhouse
as for the head itself it was perfectly bare and yellow in hue while its wrinkled scalp moved and contracted like the hood of a cobra
the figure to which this fearful countenance belonged a countenance so fearful indeed that it caused a shiver of fear to pass through us as we gazed on it stood still for a moment
then suddenly it projected a skinny claw armed with nails nearly an inch long and laying it on the shoulder of twala the king began to speak in a thin and piercing voice listen o king
listen o warriors
listen o mountains and plains and rivers home of the kukuana race
listen o skies and sun o rain and storm and mist
listen o men and women o youths and maidens and o ye babes unborn
listen all things that live and must die
listen all dead things that shall live againagain to die
listen the spirit of life is in me and i prophesy
i prophesy
i prophesy the words died away in a faint wail and dread seemed to seize upon the hearts of all who heard them including our own
this old woman was very terrible
blood
blood
blood rivers of blood blood everywhere
i see it i smell it i taste itit is salt
it runs red upon the ground it rains down from the skies
footsteps
footsteps
footsteps the tread of the white man coming from afar
it shakes the earth the earth trembles before her master
blood is good the red blood is bright there is no smell like the smell of newshed blood
the lions shall lap it and roar the vultures shall wash their wings in it and shriek with joy
i am old
i am old
i have seen much blood ha ha but i shall see more ere i die and be merry
how old am i think ye
your fathers knew me and their fathers knew me and their fathers fathers fathers
i have seen the white man and know his desires
i am old but the mountains are older than i
who made the great road tell me
who wrote the pictures on the rocks tell me
who reared up the three silent ones yonder that gaze across the pit tell me and she pointed towards the three precipitous mountains which we had noticed on the previous night
ye know not but i know
it was a white people who were before ye are who shall be when ye are not who shall eat you up and destroy you
yea
yea
yea and what came they for the white ones the terrible ones the skilled in magic and all learning the strong the unswerving
what is that bright stone upon thy forehead o king
whose hands made the iron garments upon thy breast o king
ye know not but i know
i the old one i the wise one i the isanusi the witch doctress then she turned her bald vulturehead towards us
what seek ye white men of the starsah yes of the stars
do ye seek a lost one
ye shall not find him here
he is not here
never for ages upon ages has a white foot pressed this land never except once and i remember that he left it but to die
ye come for bright stones i know iti know it ye shall find them when the blood is dry but shall ye return whence ye came or shall ye stop with me
ha
ha
ha and thou thou with the dark skin and the proud bearing and she pointed her skinny finger at umbopa who art thou and what seekest thou
not stones that shine not yellow metal that gleams these thou leavest to white men from the stars methinks i know thee methinks i can smell the smell of the blood in thy heart
strip off the girdle here the features of this extraordinary creature became convulsed and she fell to the ground foaming in an epileptic fit and was carried into the hut
the king rose up trembling and waved his hand
instantly the regiments began to file off and in ten minutes save for ourselves the king and a few attendants the great space was left empty
white people he said it passes in my mind to kill you
gagool has spoken strange words
what say ye i laughed
be careful o king we are not easy to slay
thou hast seen the fate of the ox wouldst thou be as the ox is the king frowned
it is not well to threaten a king we threaten not we speak what is true
try to kill us o king and learn the great savage put his hand to his forehead and thought
go in peace he said at length
tonight is the great dance
ye shall see it
fear not that i shall set a snare for you
tomorrow i will think it is well o king i answered unconcernedly and then accompanied by infadoos we rose and went back to our kraal
the witchhunt on reaching our hut i motioned to infadoos to enter with us
now infadoos i said we would speak with thee let my lords say on it seems to us infadoos that twala the king is a cruel man it is so my lords
alas
the land cries out because of his cruelties
tonight ye shall see
it is the great witchhunt and many will be smelt out as wizards and slain
no mans life is safe
if the king covets a mans cattle or a mans wife or if he fears a man that he should excite a rebellion against him then gagool whom ye saw or some of the witchfinding women whom she has taught will smell that man out as a wizard and he will be killed
many must die before the moon grows pale tonight
it is ever so
perhaps i too shall be killed
as yet i have been spared because i am skilled in war and am beloved by the soldiers but i know not how long i have to live
the land groans at the cruelties of twala the king it is wearied of him and his red ways then why is it infadoos that the people do not cast him down nay my lords he is the king and if he were killed scragga would reign in his place and the heart of scragga is blacker than the heart of twala his father
if scragga were king his yoke upon our neck would be heavier than the yoke of twala
if imotu had never been slain or if ignosi his son had lived it might have been otherwise but they are both dead how knowest thou that ignosi is dead said a voice behind us
we looked round astonished to see who spoke
it was umbopa
what meanest thou boy asked infadoos who told thee to speak listen infadoos was the answer and i will tell thee a story
years ago the king imotu was killed in this country and his wife fled with the boy ignosi
is it not so it is so it was said that the woman and her son died upon the mountains
is it not so it is even so well it came to pass that the mother and the boy ignosi did not die
they crossed the mountains and were led by a tribe of wandering desert men across the sands beyond till at last they came to water and grass and trees again how knowest thou this listen
they travelled on and on many months journey till they reached a land where a people called the amazulu who also are of the kukuana stock live by war and with them they tarried many years till at length the mother died
then the son ignosi became a wanderer again and journeyed into a land of wonders where white people live and for many more years he learned the wisdom of the white people it is a pretty story said infadoos incredulously
for years he lived there working as a servant and a soldier but holding in his heart all that his mother had told him of his own place and casting about in his mind to find how he might journey thither to see his people and his fathers house before he died
for long years he lived and waited and at last the time came as it ever comes to him who can wait for it and he met some white men who would seek this unknown land and joined himself to them
the white men started and travelled on and on seeking for one who is lost
they crossed the burning desert they crossed the snowclad mountains and at last reached the land of the kukuanas and there they found thee o infadoos surely thou art mad to talk thus said the astonished old soldier
thou thinkest so see i will show thee o my uncle
i am ignosi rightful king of the kukuanas then with a single movement umbopa slipped off his moocha or girdle and stood naked before us
look he said what is this and he pointed to the picture of a great snake tattooed in blue round his middle its tail disappearing into its open mouth just above where the thighs are set into the body
infadoos looked his eyes starting nearly out of his head
then he fell upon his knees
koom
koom he ejaculated it is my brothers son it is the king did i not tell thee so my uncle
rise i am not yet the king but with thy help and with the help of these brave white men who are my friends i shall be
yet the old witch gagool was right the land shall run with blood first and hers shall run with it if she has any and can die for she killed my father with her words and drove my mother forth
and now infadoos choose thou
wilt thou put thy hands between my hands and be my man
wilt thou share the dangers that lie before me and help me to overthrow this tyrant and murderer or wilt thou not
choose thou the old man put his hand to his head and thought
then he rose and advancing to where umbopa or rather ignosi stood he knelt before him and took his hand
ignosi rightful king of the kukuanas i put my hand between thy hands and am thy man till death
when thou wast a babe i dandled thee upon my knees now shall my old arm strike for thee and freedom it is well infadoos if i conquer thou shalt be the greatest man in the kingdom after its king
if i fail thou canst only die and death is not far off from thee
rise my uncle and ye white men will ye help me
what have i to offer you
the white stones
if i conquer and can find them ye shall have as many as ye can carry hence
will that suffice you i translated this remark
tell him answered sir henry that he mistakes an englishman
wealth is good and if it comes in our way we will take it but a gentleman does not sell himself for wealth
still speaking for myself i say this
i have always liked umbopa and so far as lies in me i will stand by him in this business
it will be very pleasant to me to try to square matters with that cruel devil twala
what do you say good and you quatermain well said good to adopt the language of hyperbole in which all these people seem to indulge you can tell him that a row is surely good and warms the cockles of the heart and that so far as i am concerned im his boy
my only stipulation is that he allows me to wear trousers i translated the substance of these answers
it is well my friends said ignosi late umbopa and what sayest thou macumazahn art thou also with me old hunter cleverer than a wounded buffalo i thought awhile and scratched my head
umbopa or ignosi i said i dont like revolutions
i am a man of peace and a bit of a cowardhere umbopa smiledbut on the other hand i stick up for my friends ignosi
you have stuck to us and played the part of a man and i will stick by you
but mind you i am a trader and have to make my living so i accept your offer about those diamonds in case we should ever be in a position to avail ourselves of it
another thing we came as you know to look for incubus sir henrys lost brother
you must help us to find him that i will do answered ignosi
stay infadoos by the sign of the snake about my middle tell me the truth
has any white man to thy knowledge set his foot within the land none o ignosi if any white man had been seen or heard of wouldst thou have known i should certainly have known thou hearest incubu said ignosi to sir henry he has not been here well well said sir henry with a sigh there it is i suppose that he never got so far
poor fellow poor fellow
so it has all been for nothing
gods will be done now for business i put in anxious to escape from a painful subject
it is very well to be a king by right divine ignosi but how dost thou propose to become a king indeed nay i know not
infadoos hast thou a plan ignosi son of the lightning answered his uncle tonight is the great dance and witchhunt
many shall be smelt out and perish and in the hearts of many others there will be grief and anguish and fury against the king twala
when the dance is over then i will speak to some of the great chiefs who in turn if i can win them over will speak to their regiments
i shall speak to the chiefs softly at first and bring them to see that thou art indeed the king and i think that by tomorrows light thou shalt have twenty thousand spears at thy command
and now i must go and think and hear and make ready
after the dance is done if i am yet alive and we are all alive i will meet thee here and we can talk
at the best there must be war at this moment our conference was interrupted by the cry that messengers had come from the king
advancing to the door of the hut we ordered that they should be admitted and presently three men entered each bearing a shining shirt of chain armour and a magnificent battleaxe
the gifts of my lord the king to the white men from the stars said a herald who came with them
we thank the king i answered withdraw the men went and we examined the armour with great interest
it was the most wonderful chain work that either of us had ever seen
a whole coat fell together so closely that it formed a mass of links scarcely too big to be covered with both hands
do you make these things in this country infadoos i asked they are very beautiful nay my lord they came down to us from our forefathers
we know not who made them and there are but few left
none but those of royal blood may be clad in them
they are magic coats through which no spear can pass and those who wear them are wellnigh safe in the battle
the king is well pleased or much afraid or he would not have sent these garments of steel
clothe yourselves in them tonight my lords in the soudan swords and coats of mail are still worn by arabs whose ancestors must have stripped them from the bodies of crusaderseditor
the remainder of that day we spent quietly resting and talking over the situation which was sufficiently exciting
at last the sun went down the thousand watch fires glowed out and through the darkness we heard the tramp of many feet and the clashing of hundreds of spears as the regiments passed to their appointed places to be ready for the great dance
then the full moon shone out in splendour and as we stood watching her rays infadoos arrived clad in his war dress and accompanied by a guard of twenty men to escort us to the dance
as he recommended we had already donned the shirts of chain armour which the king had sent us putting them on under our ordinary clothing and finding to our surprise that they were neither very heavy nor uncomfortable
these steel shirts which evidently had been made for men of a very large stature hung somewhat loosely upon good and myself but sir henrys fitted his magnificent frame like a glove
then strapping our revolvers round our waists and taking in our hands the battleaxes which the king had sent with the armour we started
on arriving at the great kraal where we had that morning been received by the king we found that it was closely packed with some twenty thousand men arranged round it in regiments
these regiments were in turn divided into companies and between each company ran a little path to allow space for the witchfinders to pass up and down
anything more imposing than the sight that was presented by this vast and orderly concourse of armed men it is impossible to conceive
there they stood perfectly silent and the moon poured her light upon the forest of their raised spears upon their majestic forms waving plumes and the harmonious shading of their variouscoloured shields
wherever we looked were line upon line of dim faces surmounted by range upon range of shimmering spears
surely i said to infadoos the whole army is here nay macumazahn he answered but a third of it
one third is present at this dance each year another third is mustered outside in case there should be trouble when the killing begins ten thousand more garrison the outposts round loo and the rest watch at the kraals in the country
thou seest it is a great people they are very silent said good and indeed the intense stillness among such a vast concourse of living men was almost overpowering
what says bougwan asked infadoos
i translated
those over whom the shadow of death is hovering are silent he answered grimly
will many be killed very many it seems i said to the others that we are going to assist at a gladiatorial show arranged regardless of expense sir henry shivered and good said he wished that we could get out of it
tell me i asked infadoos are we in danger i know not my lords i trust not but do not seem afraid
if ye live through the night all may go well with you
the soldiers murmur against the king all this while we had been advancing steadily towards the centre of the open space in the midst of which were placed some stools
as we proceeded we perceived another small party coming from the direction of the royal hut
it is the king twala scragga his son and gagool the old and see with them are those who slay said infadoos pointing to a little group of about a dozen gigantic and savagelooking men armed with spears in one hand and heavy kerries in the other
the king seated himself upon the centre stool gagool crouched at his feet and the others stood behind him
greeting white lords twala cried as we came up be seated waste not precious timethe night is all too short for the deeds that must be done
ye come in a good hour and shall see a glorious show
look round white lords look round and he rolled his one wicked eye from regiment to regiment
can the stars show you such a sight as this
see how they shake in their wickedness all those who have evil in their hearts and fear the judgment of heaven above begin
begin piped gagool in her thin piercing voice the hynas are hungry they howl for food
begin
begin then for a moment there was intense stillness made horrible by a presage of what was to come
the king lifted his spear and suddenly twenty thousand feet were raised as though they belonged to one man and brought down with a stamp upon the earth
this was repeated three times causing the solid ground to shake and tremble
then from a far point of the circle a solitary voice began a wailing song of which the refrain ran something as follows what is the lot of man born of woman back came the answer rolling out from every throat in that vast company death gradually however the song was taken up by company after company till the whole armed multitude were singing it and i could no longer follow the words except in so far as they appeared to represent various phases of human passions fears and joys
now it seemed to be a love song now a majestic swelling war chant and last of all a death dirge ending suddenly in one heartbreaking wail that went echoing and rolling away in a volume of bloodcurdling sound
again silence fell upon the place and again it was broken by the king lifting his hand
instantly we heard a pattering of feet and from out of the masses of warriors strange and awful figures appeared running towards us
as they drew near we saw that these were women most of them aged for their white hair ornamented with small bladders taken from fish streamed out behind them
their faces were painted in stripes of white and yellow down their backs hung snakeskins and round their waists rattled circlets of human bones while each held a small forked wand in her shrivelled hand
in all there were ten of them
when they arrived in front of us they halted and one of them pointing with her wand towards the crouching figure of gagool cried out mother old mother we are here good
good
good answered that aged iniquity
are your eyes keen isanusis witch doctresses ye seers in dark places mother they are keen good
good
good are your ears open isanusis ye who hear words that come not from the tongue mother they are open good
good
good are your senses awake isanusiscan ye smell blood can ye purge the land of the wicked ones who compass evil against the king and against their neighbours
are ye ready to do the justice of heaven above ye whom i have taught who have eaten of the bread of my wisdom and drunk of the water of my magic mother we can then go
tarry not ye vultures see the slayerspointing to the ominous group of executioners behindmake sharp their spears the white men from afar are hungry to see
go with a wild yell gagools horrid ministers broke away in every direction like fragments from a shell the dry bones round their waists rattling as they ran and headed for various points of the dense human circle
we could not watch them all so we fixed our eyes upon the isanusi nearest to us
when she came to within a few paces of the warriors she halted and began to dance wildly turning round and round with an almost incredible rapidity and shrieking out sentences such as i smell him the evildoer he is near he who poisoned his mother i hear the thoughts of him who thought evil of the king quicker and quicker she danced till she lashed herself into such a frenzy of excitement that the foam flew in specks from her gnashing jaws till her eyes seemed to start from her head and her flesh to quiver visibly
suddenly she stopped dead and stiffened all over like a pointer dog when he scents game and then with outstretched wand she began to creep stealthily towards the soldiers before her
it seemed to us that as she came their stoicism gave way and that they shrank from her
as for ourselves we followed her movements with a horrible fascination
presently still creeping and crouching like a dog the isanusi was before them
then she halted and pointed and again crept on a pace or two
suddenly the end came
with a shriek she sprang in and touched a tall warrior with her forked wand
instantly two of his comrades those standing immediately next to him seized the doomed man each by one arm and advanced with him towards the king
he did not resist but we saw that he dragged his limbs as though they were paralysed and that his fingers from which the spear had fallen were limp like those of a man newly dead
as he came two of the villainous executioners stepped forward to meet him
presently they met and the executioners turned round looking towards the king as though for orders
kill said the king
kill squeaked gagool
kill reechoed scragga with a hollow chuckle
almost before the words were uttered the horrible deed was done
one man had driven his spear into the victims heart and to make assurance double sure the other had dashed out his brains with a great club
one counted twala the king just like a black madame defarge as good said and the body was dragged a few paces away and stretched out
hardly was the thing done before another poor wretch was brought up like an ox to the slaughter
this time we could see from the leopardskin cloak which he wore that the man was a person of rank
again the awful syllables were spoken and the victim fell dead
two counted the king
and so the deadly game went on till about a hundred bodies were stretched in rows behind us
i have heard of the gladiatorial shows of the csars and of the spanish bullfights but i take the liberty of doubting if either of them could be half so horrible as this kukuana witchhunt
gladiatorial shows and spanish bullfights at any rate contributed to the public amusement which certainly was not the case here
the most confirmed sensationmonger would fight shy of sensation if he knew that it was well on the cards that he would in his own proper person be the subject of the next event once we rose and tried to remonstrate but were sternly repressed by twala
let the law take its course white men
these dogs are magicians and evildoers it is well that they should die was the only answer vouchsafed to us
about halfpast ten there was a pause
the witchfinders gathered themselves together apparently exhausted with their bloody work and we thought that the performance was done with
but it was not so for presently to our surprise the ancient woman gagool rose from her crouching position and supporting herself with a stick staggered off into the open space
it was an extraordinary sight to see this frightful vultureheaded old creature bent nearly double with extreme age gather strength by degrees until at last she rushed about almost as actively as her illomened pupils
to and fro she ran chanting to herself till suddenly she made a dash at a tall man standing in front of one of the regiments and touched him
as she did this a sort of groan went up from the regiment which evidently he commanded
but two of its officers seized him all the same and brought him up for execution
we learned afterwards that he was a man of great wealth and importance being indeed a cousin of the king
he was slain and twala counted one hundred and three
then gagool again sprang to and fro gradually drawing nearer and nearer to ourselves
hang me if i dont believe she is going to try her games on us ejaculated good in horror
nonsense said sir henry
as for myself when i saw that old fiend dancing nearer and nearer my heart positively sank into my boots
i glanced behind us at the long rows of corpses and shivered
nearer and nearer waltzed gagool looking for all the world like an animated crooked stick or comma her horrid eyes gleaming and glowing with a most unholy lustre
nearer she came and yet nearer every creature in that vast assemblage watching her movements with intense anxiety
at last she stood still and pointed
which is it to be asked sir henry to himself
in a moment all doubts were at rest for the old hag had rushed in and touched umbopa alias ignosi on the shoulder
i smell him out she shrieked
kill him kill him he is full of evil kill him the stranger before blood flows from him
slay him o king there was a pause of which i instantly took advantage
o king i called out rising from my seat this man is the servant of thy guests he is their dog whosoever sheds the blood of our dog sheds our blood
by the sacred law of hospitality i claim protection for him gagool mother of the witchfinders has smelt him out he must die white men was the sullen answer
nay he shall not die i replied he who tries to touch him shall die indeed seize him roared twala to the executioners who stood round red to the eyes with the blood of their victims
they advanced towards us and then hesitated
as for ignosi he clutched his spear and raised it as though determined to sell his life dearly
stand back ye dogs i shouted if ye would see tomorrows light
touch one hair of his head and your king dies and i covered twala with my revolver
sir henry and good also drew their pistols sir henry pointing his at the leading executioner who was advancing to carry out the sentence and good taking a deliberate aim at gagool
twala winced perceptibly as my barrel came in a line with his broad chest
well i said what is it to be twala then he spoke
put away your magic tubes he said ye have adjured me in the name of hospitality and for that reason but not from fear of what ye can do i spare him
go in peace it is well i answered unconcernedly we are weary of slaughter and would sleep
is the dance ended it is ended twala answered sulkily
let these dead dogs pointing to the long rows of corpses be flung out to the hynas and the vultures and he lifted his spear
instantly the regiments began to defile through the kraal gateway in perfect silence a fatigue party only remaining behind to drag away the corpses of those who had been sacrificed
then we rose also and making our salaam to his majesty which he hardly deigned to acknowledge we departed to our huts
well said sir henry as we sat down having first lit a lamp of the sort used by the kukuanas of which the wick is made from the fibre of a species of palm leaf and the oil from clarified hippopotamus fat well i feel uncommonly inclined to be sick if i had any doubts about helping umbopa to rebel against that infernal blackguard put in good they are gone now
it was as much as i could do to sit still while that slaughter was going on
i tried to keep my eyes shut but they would open just at the wrong time
i wonder where infadoos is
umbopa my friend you ought to be grateful to us your skin came near to having an airhole made in it i am grateful bougwan was umbopas answer when i had translated and i shall not forget
as for infadoos he will be here byandby
we must wait so we lit our pipes and waited
we give a sign for a long whiletwo hours i should thinkwe sat there in silence being too much overwhelmed by the recollection of the horrors we had seen to talk
at last just as we were thinking of turning infor the night drew nigh to dawnwe heard a sound of steps
then came the challenge of a sentry posted at the kraal gate which apparently was answered though not in an audible tone for the steps still advanced and in another second infadoos had entered the hut followed by some halfdozen statelylooking chiefs
my lords he said i have come according to my word
my lords and ignosi rightful king of the kukuanas i have brought with me these men pointing to the row of chiefs who are great men among us having each one of them the command of three thousand soldiers that live but to do their bidding under the kings
i have told them of what i have seen and what my ears have heard
now let them also behold the sacred snake around thee and hear thy story ignosi that they may say whether or no they will make cause with thee against twala the king by way of answer ignosi again stripped off his girdle and exhibited the snake tattooed about him
each chief in turn drew near and examined the sign by the dim light of the lamp and without saying a word passed on to the other side
then ignosi resumed his moocha and addressing them repeated the history he had detailed in the morning
now ye have heard chiefs said infadoos when he had done what say ye will ye stand by this man and help him to his fathers throne or will ye not
the land cries out against twala and the blood of the people flows like the waters in spring
ye have seen tonight
two other chiefs there were with whom i had it in my mind to speak and where are they now
the hynas howl over their corpses
soon shall ye be as they are if ye strike not
choose then my brothers the eldest of the six men a short thickset warrior with white hair stepped forward a pace and answered thy words are true infadoos the land cries out
my own brother is among those who died tonight but this is a great matter and the thing is hard to believe
how know we that if we lift our spears it may not be for a thief and a liar
it is a great matter i say of which none can see the end
for of this be sure blood will flow in rivers before the deed is done many will still cleave to the king for men worship the sun that still shines bright in the heavens rather than that which has not risen
these white men from the stars their magic is great and ignosi is under the cover of their wing
if he be indeed the rightful king let them give us a sign and let the people have a sign that all may see
so shall men cleave to us knowing of a truth that the white mans magic is with them ye have the sign of the snake i answered
my lord it is not enough
the snake may have been placed there since the mans childhood
show us a sign and it will suffice
but we will not move without a sign the others gave a decided assent and i turned in perplexity to sir henry and good and explained the situation
i think that i have it said good exultingly ask them to give us a moment to think i did so and the chiefs withdrew
so soon as they had gone good went to the little box where he kept his medicines unlocked it and took out a notebook in the flyleaves of which was an almanack
now look here you fellows isnt tomorrow the th of june he said
we had kept a careful note of the days so were able to answer that it was
very good then here we have it june total eclipse of the moon commences at greenwich time visible in teneriffesouth africa c theres a sign for you
tell them we will darken the moon tomorrow night the idea was a splendid one indeed the only weak spot about it was a fear lest goods almanack might be incorrect
if we made a false prophecy on such a subject our prestige would be gone for ever and so would ignosis chance of the throne of the kukuanas
suppose that the almanack is wrong suggested sir henry to good who was busily employed in working out something on a blank page of the book
i see no reason to suppose anything of the sort was his answer
eclipses always come up to time at least that is my experience of them and it especially states that this one will be visible in south africa
i have worked out the reckonings as well as i can without knowing our exact position and i make out that the eclipse should begin here about ten oclock tomorrow night and last till halfpast twelve
for an hour and a half or so there should be almost total darkness well said sir henry i suppose we had better risk it i acquiesced though doubtfully for eclipses are queer cattle to deal withit might be a cloudy night for instance or our dates might be wrongand sent umbopa to summon the chiefs back
presently they came and i addressed them thus great men of the kukuanas and thou infadoos listen
we love not to show our powers for to do so is to interfere with the course of nature and to plunge the world into fear and confusion
but since this matter is a great one and as we are angered against the king because of the slaughter we have seen and because of the act of the isanusi gagool who would have put our friend ignosi to death we have determined to break a rule and to give such a sign as all men may see
come hither and i led them to the door of the hut and pointed to the red ball of the moon
what see ye there we see the sinking moon answered the spokesman of the party
it is so
now tell me can any mortal man put out that moon before her hour of setting and bring the curtain of black night down upon the land the chief laughed a little at the question
no my lord that no man can do
the moon is stronger than man who looks on her nor can she vary in her courses ye say so
yet i tell you that tomorrow night about two hours before midnight we will cause the moon to be eaten up for a space of an hour and half an hour
yes deep darkness shall cover the earth and it shall be for a sign that ignosi is indeed king of the kukuanas
if we do this thing will ye be satisfied yea my lords answered the old chief with a smile which was reflected on the faces of his companions if ye do this thing we will be satisfied indeed it shall be done we three incubu bougwan and macumazahn have said it and it shall be done
dost thou hear infadoos i hear my lord but it is a wonderful thing that ye promise to put out the moon the mother of the world when she is at her full yet shall we do it infadoos it is well my lords
today two hours after sunset twala will send for my lords to witness the girls dance and one hour after the dance begins the girl whom twala thinks the fairest shall be killed by scragga the kings son as a sacrifice to the silent ones who sit and keep watch by the mountains yonder and he pointed towards the three strangelooking peaks where solomons road was supposed to end
then let my lords darken the moon and save the maidens life and the people will believe indeed ay said the old chief still smiling a little the people will believe indeed two miles from loo went on infadoos there is a hill curved like a new moon a stronghold where my regiment and three other regiments which these chiefs command are stationed
this morning we will make a plan whereby two or three other regiments may be moved there also
then if in truth my lords can darken the moon in the darkness i will take my lords by the hand and lead them out of loo to this place where they shall be safe and thence we can make war upon twala the king it is good said i
now leave us to sleep awhile and to make ready our magic infadoos rose and having saluted us departed with the chiefs
my friends said ignosi so soon as they were gone can ye do this wonderful thing or were ye speaking empty words to the captains we believe that we can do it umbopaignosi i mean it is strange he answered and had ye not been englishmen i would not have believed it but i have learned that english gentlemen tell no lies
if we live through the matter be sure that i will repay you ignosi said sir henry promise me one thing i will promise incubu my friend even before i hear it answered the big man with a smile
what is it this that if ever you come to be king of this people you will do away with the smelling out of wizards such as we saw last night and that the killing of men without trial shall no longer take place in the land ignosi thought for a moment after i had translated this request and then answered the ways of black people are not as the ways of white men incubu nor do we value life so highly
yet i will promise
if it be in my power to hold them back the witchfinders shall hunt no more nor shall any man die the death without trial or judgment thats a bargain then said sir henry and now let us get a little rest thoroughly wearied out we were soon sound asleep and slept till ignosi woke us about eleven oclock
then we rose washed and ate a hearty breakfast
after that we went outside the hut and walked about amusing ourselves with examining the structure of the kukuana huts and observing the customs of the women
i hope that eclipse will come off said sir henry presently
if it does not it will soon be all up with us i answered mournfully for so sure as we are living men some of those chiefs will tell the whole story to the king and then there will be another sort of eclipse and one that we shall certainly not like returning to the hut we ate some dinner and passed the rest of the day in receiving visits of ceremony and curiosity
at length the sun set and we enjoyed a couple of hours of such quiet as our melancholy forebodings would allow to us
finally about halfpast eight a messenger came from twala to bid us to the great annual dance of girls which was about to be celebrated
hastily we put on the chain shirts that the king had sent us and taking our rifles and ammunition with us so as to have them handy in case we had to fly as suggested by infadoos we started boldly enough though with inward fear and trembling
the great space in front of the kings kraal bore a very different appearance from that which it had presented on the previous evening
in place of the grim ranks of serried warriors were company after company of kukuana girls not overdressed so far as clothing went but each crowned with a wreath of flowers and holding a palm leaf in one hand and a white arum lily in the other
in the centre of the open moonlit space sat twala the king with old gagool at his feet attended by infadoos the boy scragga and twelve guards
there were also present about a score of chiefs amongst whom i recognised most of our friends of the night before
twala greeted us with much apparent cordiality though i saw him fix his one eye viciously on umbopa
welcome white men from the stars he said this is another sight from that which your eyes gazed on by the light of last nights moon but it is not so good a sight
girls are pleasant and were it not for such as these and he pointed round him we should none of us be here this day but men are better
kisses and the tender words of women are sweet but the sound of the clashing of the spears of warriors and the smell of mens blood are sweeter far
would ye have wives from among our people white men
if so choose the fairest here and ye shall have them as many as ye will and he paused for an answer
as the prospect did not seem to be without attractions for good who like most sailors is of a susceptible naturebeing elderly and wise foreseeing the endless complications that anything of the sort would involve for women bring trouble so surely as the night follows the day i put in a hasty answer thanks to thee o king but we white men wed only with white women like ourselves
your maidens are fair but they are not for us the king laughed
it is well
in our land there is a proverb which runs womens eyes are always bright whatever the colour and another that says love her who is present for be sure she who is absent is false to thee but perhaps these things are not so in the stars
in a land where men are white all things are possible
so be it white men the girls will not go begging
welcome again and welcome too thou black one if gagool here had won her way thou wouldst have been stiff and cold by now
it is lucky for thee that thou too camest from the stars ha
ha i can kill thee before thou killest me o king was ignosis calm answer and thou shalt be stiff before my limbs cease to bend twala started
thou speakest boldly boy he replied angrily presume not too far he may well be bold in whose lips are truth
the truth is a sharp spear which flies home and misses not
it is a message from the stars o king twala scowled and his one eye gleamed fiercely but he said nothing more
let the dance begin he cried and then the flowercrowned girls sprang forward in companies singing a sweet song and waving the delicate palms and white lilies
on they danced looking faint and spiritual in the soft sad light of the risen moon now whirling round and round now meeting in mimic warfare swaying eddying here and there coming forward falling back in an ordered confusion delightful to witness
at last they paused and a beautiful young woman sprang out of the ranks and began to pirouette in front of us with a grace and vigour which would have put most ballet girls to shame
at length she retired exhausted and another took her place then another and another but none of them either in grace skill or personal attractions came up to the first
when the chosen girls had all danced the king lifted his hand
which deem ye the fairest white men he asked
the first said i unthinkingly
next second i regretted it for i remembered that infadoos had told us that the fairest woman must be offered up as a sacrifice
then is my mind as your minds and my eyes as your eyes
she is the fairest
and a sorry thing it is for her for she must die ay must die piped out gagool casting a glance of her quick eyes in the direction of the poor girl who as yet ignorant of the awful fate in store for her was standing some ten yards off in front of a company of maidens engaged in nervously picking a flower from her wreath to pieces petal by petal
why o king said i restraining my indignation with difficulty the girl has danced well and pleased us she is fair too it would be hard to reward her with death twala laughed as he answered it is our custom and the figures who sit in stone yonder and he pointed towards the three distant peaks must have their due
did i fail to put the fairest girl to death today misfortune would fall upon me and my house
thus runs the prophecy of my people if the king offer not a sacrifice of a fair girl on the day of the dance of maidens to the old ones who sit and watch on the mountains then shall he fall and his house look ye white men my brother who reigned before me offered not the sacrifice because of the tears of the woman and he fell and his house and i reign in his stead
it is finished she must die then turning to the guardsbring her hither scragga make sharp thy spear two of the men stepped forward and as they advanced the girl for the first time realising her impending fate screamed aloud and turned to fly
but the strong hands caught her fast and brought her struggling and weeping before us
what is thy name girl piped gagool
what
wilt thou not answer
shall the kings son do his work at once at this hint scragga looking more evil than ever advanced a step and lifted his great spear and at that moment i saw goods hand creep to his revolver
the poor girl caught the faint glint of steel through her tears and it sobered her anguish
she ceased struggling and clasping her hands convulsively stood shuddering from head to foot
see cried scragga in high glee she shrinks from the sight of my little plaything even before she has tasted it and he tapped the broad blade of his spear
if ever i get the chance you shall pay for that you young hound i heard good mutter beneath his breath
now that thou art quiet give us thy name my dear
come speak out and fear not said gagool in mockery
oh mother answered the girl in trembling accents my name is foulata of the house of suko
oh mother why must i die
i have done no wrong be comforted went on the old woman in her hateful tone of mockery
thou must die indeed as a sacrifice to the old ones who sit yonder and she pointed to the peaks but it is better to sleep in the night than to toil in the daytime it is better to die than to live and thou shalt die by the royal hand of the kings own son the girl foulata wrung her hands in anguish and cried out aloud oh cruel
and i so young
what have i done that i should never again see the sun rise out of the night or the stars come following on his track in the evening that i may no more gather the flowers when the dew is heavy or listen to the laughing of the waters
woe is me that i shall never see my fathers hut again nor feel my mothers kiss nor tend the lamb that is sick
woe is me that no lover shall put his arm around me and look into my eyes nor shall men children be born of me
oh cruel cruel and again she wrung her hands and turned her tearstained flowercrowned face to heaven looking so lovely in her despairfor she was indeed a beautiful womanthat assuredly the sight of her would have melted the hearts of any less cruel than were the three fiends before us
prince arthurs appeal to the ruffians who came to blind him was not more touching than that of this savage girl
but it did not move gagool or gagools master though i saw signs of pity among the guards behind and on the faces of the chiefs and as for good he gave a fierce snort of indignation and made a motion as though to go to her assistance
with all a womans quickness the doomed girl interpreted what was passing in his mind and by a sudden movement flung herself before him and clasped his beautiful white legs with her hands
oh white father from the stars she cried throw over me the mantle of thy protection let me creep into the shadow of thy strength that i may be saved
oh keep me from these cruel men and from the mercies of gagool all right my hearty ill look after you sang out good in nervous saxon
come get up theres a good girl and he stooped and caught her hand
twala turned and motioned to his son who advanced with his spear lifted
nows your time whispered sir henry to me what are you waiting for i am waiting for that eclipse i answered i have had my eye on the moon for the last halfhour and i never saw it look healthier well you must risk it now or the girl will be killed
twala is losing patience recognising the force of the argument and having cast one more despairing look at the bright face of the moon for never did the most ardent astronomer with a theory to prove await a celestial event with such anxiety i stepped with all the dignity that i could command between the prostrate girl and the advancing spear of scragga
king i said it shall not be we will not endure this thing let the girl go in safety twala rose from his seat in wrath and astonishment and from the chiefs and serried ranks of maidens who had closed in slowly upon us in anticipation of the tragedy came a murmur of amazement
shall not be thou white dog that yappest at the lion in his cave shall not be art thou mad
be careful lest this chickens fate overtake thee and those with thee
how canst thou save her or thyself
who art thou that thou settest thyself between me and my will
back i say
scragga kill her
ho guards
seize these men at his cry armed men ran swiftly from behind the hut where they had evidently been placed beforehand
sir henry good and umbopa ranged themselves alongside of me and lifted their rifles
stop i shouted boldly though at the moment my heart was in my boots
stop
we the white men from the stars say that it shall not be
come but one pace nearer and we will put out the moon like a windblown lamp as we who dwell in her house can do and plunge the land in darkness
dare to disobey and ye shall taste of our magic my threat produced an effect the men halted and scragga stood still before us his spear lifted
hear him
hear him piped gagool hear the liar who says that he will put out the moon like a lamp
let him do it and the girl shall be spared
yes let him do it or die by the girl he and those with him i glanced up at the moon despairingly and now to my intense joy and relief saw that weor rather the almanackhad made no mistake
on the edge of the great orb lay a faint rim of shadow while a smoky hue grew and gathered upon its bright surface
never shall i forget that supreme that superb moment of relief
then i lifted my hand solemnly towards the sky an example which sir henry and good followed and quoted a line or two from the ingoldsby legends at it in the most impressive tones that i could command
sir henry followed suit with a verse out of the old testament and something about balbus building a wall in latin whilst good addressed the queen of night in a volume of the most classical bad language which he could think of
slowly the penumbra the shadow of a shadow crept on over the bright surface and as it crept i heard deep gasps of fear rising from the multitude around
look o king i cried look gagool
look chiefs and people and women and see if the white men from the stars keep their word or if they be but empty liars
the moon grows black before your eyes soon there will be darknessay darkness in the hour of the full moon
ye have asked for a sign it is given to you
grow dark o moon
withdraw thy light thou pure and holy one bring the proud heart of usurping murderers to the dust and eat up the world with shadows a groan of terror burst from the onlookers
some stood petrified with dread others threw themselves upon their knees and cried aloud
as for the king he sat still and turned pale beneath his dusky skin
only gagool kept her courage
it will pass she cried i have often seen the like before no man can put out the moon lose not heart sit stillthe shadow will pass wait and ye shall see i replied hopping with excitement
o moon
moon
moon
wherefore art thou so cold and fickle this appropriate quotation was from the pages of a popular romance that i chanced to have read recently though now i come to think of it it was ungrateful of me to abuse the lady of the heavens who was showing herself to be the truest of friends to us however she may have behaved to the impassioned lover in the novel
then i added keep it up good i cant remember any more poetry
curse away theres a good fellow good responded nobly to this tax upon his inventive faculties
never before had i the faintest conception of the breadth and depth and height of a naval officers objurgatory powers
for ten minutes he went on in several languages without stopping and he scarcely ever repeated himself
meanwhile the dark ring crept on while all that great assembly fixed their eyes upon the sky and stared and stared in fascinated silence
strange and unholy shadows encroached upon the moonlight an ominous quiet filled the place
everything grew still as death
slowly and in the midst of this most solemn silence the minutes sped away and while they sped the full moon passed deeper and deeper into the shadow of the earth as the inky segment of its circle slid in awful majesty across the lunar craters
the great pale orb seemed to draw near and to grow in size
she turned a coppery hue then that portion of her surface which was unobscured as yet grew grey and ashen and at length as totality approached her mountains and her plains were to be seen glowing luridly through a crimson gloom
on yet on crept the ring of darkness it was now more than half across the bloodred orb
the air grew thick and still more deeply tinged with dusky crimson
on yet on till we could scarcely see the fierce faces of the group before us
no sound rose now from the spectators and at last good stopped swearing
the moon is dyingthe white wizards have killed the moon yelled the prince scragga at last
we shall all perish in the dark and animated by fear or fury or by both he lifted his spear and drove it with all his force at sir henrys breast
but he forgot the mail shirts that the king had given us and which we wore beneath our clothing
the steel rebounded harmless and before he could repeat the blow curtis had snatched the spear from his hand and sent it straight through him
scragga dropped dead
at the sight and driven mad with fear of the gathering darkness and of the unholy shadow which as they believed was swallowing the moon the companies of girls broke up in wild confusion and ran screeching for the gateways
nor did the panic stop there
the king himself followed by his guards some of the chiefs and gagool who hobbled away after them with marvellous alacrity fled for the huts so that in another minute we ourselves the wouldbe victim foulata infadoos and most of the chiefs who had interviewed us on the previous night were left alone upon the scene together with the dead body of scragga twalas son
chiefs i said we have given you the sign
if ye are satisfied let us fly swiftly to the place of which ye spoke
the charm cannot now be stopped
it will work for an hour and the half of an hour
let us cover ourselves in the darkness come said infadoos turning to go an example which was followed by the awed captains ourselves and the girl foulata whom good took by the arm
before we reached the gate of the kraal the moon went out utterly and from every quarter of the firmament the stars rushed forth into the inky sky
holding each other by the hand we stumbled on through the darkness
before the battle luckily for us infadoos and the chiefs knew all the paths of the great town perfectly so that we passed by sideways unmolested and notwithstanding the gloom we made fair progress
for an hour or more we journeyed on till at length the eclipse began to pass and that edge of the moon which had disappeared the first became again visible
suddenly as we watched there burst from it a silver streak of light accompanied by a wondrous ruddy glow which hung upon the blackness of the sky like a celestial lamp and a wild and lovely sight it was
in another five minutes the stars began to fade and there was sufficient light to see our whereabouts
we then discovered that we were clear of the town of loo and approaching a large flattopped hill measuring some two miles in circumference
this hill which is of a formation common in south africa is not very high indeed its greatest elevation is scarcely more than feet but it is shaped like a horseshoe and its sides are rather precipitous and strewn with boulders
on the grass tableland at its summit is ample campingground which had been utilised as a military cantonment of no mean strength
its ordinary garrison was one regiment of three thousand men but as we toiled up the steep side of the mountain in the returning moonlight we perceived that there were several of such regiments encamped there
reaching the tableland at last we found crowds of men roused from their sleep shivering with fear and huddled up together in the utmost consternation at the natural phenomenon which they were witnessing
passing through these without a word we gained a hut in the centre of the ground where we were astonished to find two men waiting laden with our few goods and chattels which of course we had been obliged to leave behind in our hasty flight
i sent for them explained infadoos and also for these and he lifted up goods longlost trousers
with an exclamation of rapturous delight good sprang at them and instantly proceeded to put them on
surely my lord will not hide his beautiful white legs exclaimed infadoos regretfully
but good persisted and once only did the kukuana people get the chance of seeing his beautiful legs again
good is a very modest man
henceforward they had to satisfy their sthetic longings with his one whisker his transparent eye and his movable teeth
still gazing with fond remembrance at goods trousers infadoos next informed us that he had commanded the regiments to muster so soon as the day broke in order to explain to them fully the origin and circumstances of the rebellion which was decided on by the chiefs and to introduce to them the rightful heir to the throne ignosi
accordingly when the sun was up the troopsin all some twenty thousand men and the flower of the kukuana armywere mustered on a large open space to which we went
the men were drawn up in three sides of a dense square and presented a magnificent spectacle
we took our station on the open side of the square and were speedily surrounded by all the principal chiefs and officers
these after silence had been proclaimed infadoos proceeded to address
he narrated to them in vigorous and graceful languagefor like most kukuanas of high rank he was a born oratorthe history of ignosis father and of how he had been basely murdered by twala the king and his wife and child driven out to starve
then he pointed out that the people suffered and groaned under twalas cruel rule instancing the proceedings of the previous night when under pretence of their being evildoers many of the noblest in the land had been dragged forth and wickedly done to death
next he went on to say that the white lords from the stars looking down upon their country had perceived its trouble and determined at great personal inconvenience to alleviate its lot that they had accordingly taken the real king of the kukuanas ignosi who was languishing in exile by the hand and led him over the mountains that they had seen the wickedness of twalas doings and for a sign to the wavering and to save the life of the girl foulata actually by the exercise of their high magic had put out the moon and slain the young fiend scragga and that they were prepared to stand by them and assist them to overthrow twala and set up the rightful king ignosi in his place
he finished his discourse amidst a murmur of approbation
then ignosi stepped forward and began to speak
having reiterated all that infadoos his uncle had said he concluded a powerful speech in these words o chiefs captains soldiers and people ye have heard my words
now must ye make choice between me and him who sits upon my throne the uncle who killed his brother and hunted his brothers child forth to die in the cold and the night
that i am indeed the king thesepointing to the chiefscan tell you for they have seen the snake about my middle
if i were not the king would these white men be on my side with all their magic
tremble chiefs captains soldiers and people
is not the darkness they have brought upon the land to confound twala and cover our flight darkness even in the hour of the full moon yet before your eyes it is answered the soldiers
i am the king i say to you i am the king went on ignosi drawing up his great stature to its full and lifting his broadbladed battleaxe above his head
if there be any man among you who says that it is not so let him stand forth and i will fight him now and his blood shall be a red token that i tell you true
let him stand forth i say and he shook the great axe till it flashed in the sunlight
as nobody seemed inclined to respond to this heroic version of dilly dilly come and be killed our late henchman proceeded with his address
i am indeed the king and should ye stand by my side in the battle if i win the day ye shall go with me to victory and honour
i will give you oxen and wives and ye shall take place of all the regiments and if ye fall i will fall with you
and behold i give you this promise that when i sit upon the seat of my fathers bloodshed shall cease in the land
no longer shall ye cry for justice to find slaughter no longer shall the witchfinder hunt you out so that ye may be slain without a cause
no man shall die save he who offends against the laws
the eating up of your kraals shall cease each one of you shall sleep secure in his own hut and fear naught and justice shall walk blindfold throughout the land
have ye chosen chiefs captains soldiers and people we have chosen o king came back the answer
it is well
turn your heads and see how twalas messengers go forth from the great town east and west and north and south to gather a mighty army to slay me and you and these my friends and protectors
tomorrow or perchance the next day he will come against us with all who are faithful to him
then i shall see the man who is indeed my man the man who fears not to die for his cause and i tell you that he shall not be forgotten in the time of spoil
i have spoken o chiefs captains soldiers and people
now go to your huts and make you ready for war there was a pause till presently one of the chiefs lifted his hand and out rolled the royal salute koom it was a sign that the soldiers accepted ignosi as their king
then they marched off in battalions
half an hour afterwards we held a council of war at which all the commanders of regiments were present
it was evident to us that before very long we should be attacked in overwhelming force
indeed from our point of vantage on the hill we could see troops mustering and runners going forth from loo in every direction doubtless to summon soldiers to the kings assistance
we had on our side about twenty thousand men composed of seven of the best regiments in the country
twala so infadoos and the chiefs calculated had at least thirty to thirtyfive thousand on whom he could rely at present assembled in loo and they thought that by midday on the morrow he would be able to gather another five thousand or more to his aid
it was of course possible that some of his troops would desert and come over to us but it was not a contingency which could be reckoned on
meanwhile it was clear that active preparations were being made by twala to subdue us
already strong bodies of armed men were patrolling round and round the foot of the hill and there were other signs also of coming assault
infadoos and the chiefs however were of opinion that no attack would take place that day which would be devoted to preparation and to the removal of every available means of the moral effect produced upon the minds of the soldiery by the supposed magical darkening of the moon
the onslaught would be on the morrow they said and they proved to be right
meanwhile we set to work to strengthen the position in all ways possible
almost every man was turned out and in the course of the day which seemed far too short much was done
the paths up the hillthat was rather a sanatorium than a fortress being used generally as the camping place of regiments suffering from recent service in unhealthy portions of the countrywere carefully blocked with masses of stones and every other approach was made as impregnable as time would allow
piles of boulders were collected at various spots to be rolled down upon an advancing enemy stations were appointed to the different regiments and all preparation was made which our joint ingenuity could suggest
just before sundown as we rested after our toil we perceived a small company of men advancing towards us from the direction of loo one of whom bore a palm leaf in his hand for a sign that he came as a herald
as he drew near ignosi infadoos one or two chiefs and ourselves went down to the foot of the mountain to meet him
he was a gallantlooking fellow wearing the regulation leopardskin cloak
greeting he cried as he came the kings greeting to those who make unholy war against the king the lions greeting to the jackals that snarl around his heels speak i said
these are the kings words
surrender to the kings mercy ere a worse thing befall you
already the shoulder has been torn from the black bull and the king drives him bleeding about the camp this cruel custom is not confined to the kukuanas but is by no means uncommon amongst african tribes on the occasion of the outbreak of war or any other important public eventaq
what are twalas terms i asked from curiosity
his terms are merciful worthy of a great king
these are the words of twala the oneeyed the mighty the husband of a thousand wives lord of the kukuanas keeper of the great road solomons road beloved of the strange ones who sit in silence at the mountains yonder the three witches calf of the black cow elephant whose tread shakes the earth terror of the evildoer ostrich whose feet devour the desert huge one black one wise one king from generation to generation
these are the words of twala i will have mercy and be satisfied with a little blood
one in every ten shall die the rest shall go free but the white man incubu who slew scragga my son and the black man his servant who pretends to my throne and infadoos my brother who brews rebellion against me these shall die by torture as an offering to the silent ones such are the merciful words of twala after consulting with the others a little i answered him in a loud voice so that the soldiers might hear thus go back thou dog to twala who sent thee and say that we ignosi veritable king of the kukuanas incubu bougwan and macumazahn the wise ones from the stars who make dark the moon infadoos of the royal house and the chiefs captains and people here gathered make answer and say that we will not surrender that before the sun has gone down twice twalas corpse shall stiffen at twalas gate and ignosi whose father twala slew shall reign in his stead now go ere we whip thee away and beware how thou dost lift a hand against such as we are the herald laughed loudly
ye frighten not men with such swelling words he cried out
show yourselves as bold tomorrow o ye who darken the moon
be bold fight and be merry before the crows pick your bones till they are whiter than your faces
farewell perhaps we may meet in the fight fly not to the stars but wait for me i pray white men with this shaft of sarcasm he retired and almost immediately the sun sank
that night was a busy one for weary as we were so far as was possible by the moonlight all preparations for the morrows fight were continued and messengers were constantly coming and going from the place where we sat in council
at last about an hour after midnight everything that could be done was done and the camp save for the occasional challenge of a sentry sank into silence
sir henry and i accompanied by ignosi and one of the chiefs descended the hill and made a round of the pickets
as we went suddenly from all sorts of unexpected places spears gleamed out in the moonlight only to vanish again when we uttered the password
it was clear to us that none were sleeping at their posts
then we returned picking our way warily through thousands of sleeping warriors many of whom were taking their last earthly rest
the moonlight flickering along their spears played upon their features and made them ghastly the chilly night wind tossed their tall and hearselike plumes
there they lay in wild confusion with arms outstretched and twisted limbs their stern stalwart forms looking weird and unhuman in the moonlight
how many of these do you suppose will be alive at this time tomorrow asked sir henry
i shook my head and looked again at the sleeping men and to my tired and yet excited imagination it seemed as though death had already touched them
my minds eye singled out those who were sealed to slaughter and there rushed in upon my heart a great sense of the mystery of human life and an overwhelming sorrow at its futility and sadness
tonight these thousands slept their healthy sleep tomorrow they and many others with them ourselves perhaps among them would be stiffening in the cold their wives would be widows their children fatherless and their place know them no more for ever
only the old moon would shine on serenely the night wind would stir the grasses and the wide earth would take its rest even as it did ons before we were and will do ons after we have been forgotten
yet man dies not whilst the world at once his mother and his monument remains
his name is lost indeed but the breath he breathed still stirs the pinetops on the mountains the sound of the words he spoke yet echoes on through space the thoughts his brain gave birth to we have inherited today his passions are our cause of life the joys and sorrows that he knew are our familiar friendsthe end from which he fled aghast will surely overtake us also
truly the universe is full of ghosts not sheeted churchyard spectres but the inextinguishable elements of individual life which having once been can never die though they blend and change and change again for ever
all sorts of reflections of this nature passed through my mindfor as i grow older i regret to say that a detestable habit of thinking seems to be getting a hold of mewhile i stood and stared at those grim yet fantastic lines of warriors sleeping as their saying goes upon their spears curtis i said i am in a condition of pitiable fear sir henry stroked his yellow beard and laughed as he answered i have heard you make that sort of remark before quatermain well i mean it now
do you know i very much doubt if one of us will be alive tomorrow night
we shall be attacked in overwhelming force and it is quite a chance if we can hold this place well give a good account of some of them at any rate
look here quatermain this business is nasty and one with which properly speaking we ought not to be mixed up but we are in for it so we must make the best of our job
speaking personally i had rather be killed fighting than any other way and now that there seems little chance of our finding my poor brother it makes the idea easier to me
but fortune favours the brave and we may succeed
anyway the battle will be awful and having a reputation to keep up we shall need to be in the thick of the thing he made this last remark in a mournful voice but there was a gleam in his eye which belied its melancholy
i have an idea sir henry curtis actually likes fighting
after this we went to sleep for a couple of hours or so
just about dawn we were awakened by infadoos who came to say that great activity was to be observed in loo and that parties of the kings skirmishers were driving in our outposts
we rose and dressed ourselves for the fray each putting on his chain armour shirt for which garments at the present juncture we felt exceedingly thankful
sir henry went the whole length about the matter and dressed himself like a native warrior
when you are in kukuanaland do as the kukuanas do he remarked as he drew the shining steel over his broad breast which it fitted like a glove
nor did he stop there
at his request infadoos had provided him with a complete set of native war uniform
round his throat he fastened the leopardskin cloak of a commanding officer on his brows he bound the plume of black ostrich feathers worn only by generals of high rank and about his middle a magnificent moocha of white oxtails
a pair of sandals a leglet of goats hair a heavy battleaxe with a rhinoceroshorn handle a round iron shield covered with white oxhide and the regulation number of tollas or throwingknives made up his equipment to which however he added his revolver
the dress was no doubt a savage one but i am bound to say that i seldom saw a finer sight than sir henry curtis presented in this guise
it showed off his magnificent physique to the greatest advantage and when ignosi arrived presently arrayed in a similar costume i thought to myself that i had never before seen two such splendid men
as for good and myself the armour did not suit us nearly so well
to begin with good insisted upon keeping on his newfound trousers and a stout short gentleman with an eyeglass and one half of his face shaved arrayed in a mail shirt carefully tucked into a very seedy pair of corduroys looks more remarkable than imposing
in my case the chain shirt being too big for me i put it on over all my clothes which caused it to bulge in a somewhat ungainly fashion
i discarded my trousers however retaining only my veldtschoons having determined to go into battle with bare legs in order to be the lighter for running in case it became necessary to retire quickly
the mail coat a spear a shield that i did not know how to use a couple of tollas a revolver and a huge plume which i pinned into the top of my shooting hat in order to give a bloodthirsty finish to my appearance completed my modest equipment
in addition to all these articles of course we had our rifles but as ammunition was scarce and as they would be useless in case of a charge we arranged that they should be carried behind us by bearers
when at length we had equipped ourselves we swallowed some food hastily and then started out to see how things were going on
at one point in the tableland of the mountain there was a little koppie of brown stone which served the double purpose of headquarters and of a conning tower
here we found infadoos surrounded by his own regiment the greys which was undoubtedly the finest in the kukuana army and the same that we had first seen at the outlying kraal
this regiment now three thousand five hundred strong was being held in reserve and the men were lying down on the grass in companies and watching the kings forces creep out of loo in long antlike columns
there seemed to be no end to the length of these columnsthree in all and each of them numbering as we judged at least eleven or twelve thousand men
as soon as they were clear of the town the regiments formed up
then one body marched off to the right one to the left and the third came on slowly towards us
ah said infadoos they are going to attack us on three sides at once this seemed rather serious news for our position on the top of the mountain which measured a mile and a half in circumference being an extended one it was important to us to concentrate our comparatively small defending force as much as possible
but since it was impossible for us to dictate in what way we should be assailed we had to make the best of it and accordingly sent orders to the various regiments to prepare to receive the separate onslaughts
the attack slowly and without the slightest appearance of haste or excitement the three columns crept on
when within about five hundred yards of us the main or centre column halted at the root of a tongue of open plain which ran up into the hill to give time to the other divisions to circumvent our position which was shaped more or less in the form of a horseshoe with its two points facing towards the town of loo
the object of this manoeuvre was that the threefold assault should be delivered simultaneously
oh for a gatling groaned good as he contemplated the serried phalanxes beneath us
i would clear that plain in twenty minutes we have not got one so it is no use yearning for it but suppose you try a shot quatermain said sir henry
see how near you can go to that tall fellow who appears to be in command
two to one you miss him and an even sovereign to be honestly paid if ever we get out of this that you dont drop the bullet within five yards this piqued me so loading the express with solid ball i waited till my friend walked some ten yards out from his force in order to get a better view of our position accompanied only by an orderly then lying down and resting the express on a rock i covered him
the rifle like all expresses was only sighted to three hundred and fifty yards so to allow for the drop in trajectory i took him halfway down the neck which ought i calculated to find him in the chest
he stood quite still and gave me every opportunity but whether it was the excitement or the wind or the fact of the man being a long shot i dont know but this was what happened
getting dead on as i thought a fine sight i pressed and when the puff of smoke had cleared away to my disgust i saw my man standing there unharmed whilst his orderly who was at least three paces to the left was stretched upon the ground apparently dead
turning swiftly the officer i had aimed at began to run towards his men in evident alarm
bravo quatermain sang out good youve frightened him this made me very angry for if possible to avoid it i hate to miss in public
when a man is master of only one art he likes to keep up his reputation in that art
moved quite out of myself at my failure i did a rash thing
rapidly covering the general as he ran i let drive with the second barrel
instantly the poor man threw up his arms and fell forward on to his face
this time i had made no mistake andi say it as a proof of how little we think of others when our own safety pride or reputation is in questioni was brute enough to feel delighted at the sight
the regiments who had seen the feat cheered wildly at this exhibition of the white mans magic which they took as an omen of success while the force the general had belonged towhich indeed as we ascertained afterwards he had commandedfell back in confusion
sir henry and good now took up their rifles and began to fire the latter industriously browning the dense mass before him with another winchester repeater and i also had another shot or two with the result so far as we could judge that we put some six or eight men hors de combat before they were out of range
just as we stopped firing there came an ominous roar from our far right then a similar roar rose on our left
the two other divisions were engaging us
at the sound the mass of men before us opened out a little and advanced towards the hill and up the spit of bare grass land at a slow trot singing a deepthroated song as they ran
we kept up a steady fire from our rifles as they came ignosi joining in occasionally and accounted for several men but of course we produced no more effect upon that mighty rush of armed humanity than he who throws pebbles does on the breaking wave
on they came with a shout and the clashing of spears now they were driving in the pickets we had placed among the rocks at the foot of the hill
after that the advance was a little slower for though as yet we had offered no serious opposition the attacking forces must climb up hill and they came slowly to save their breath
our first line of defence was about halfway down the side of the slope our second fifty yards further back while our third occupied the edge of the plateau
on they stormed shouting their warcry twala
twala
chiele
chiele twala
twala
smite
smite
ignosi
ignosi
chiele
chiele answered our people
they were quite close now and the tollas or throwingknives began to flash backwards and forwards and now with an awful yell the battle closed in
to and fro swayed the mass of struggling warriors men falling fast as leaves in an autumn wind but before long the superior weight of the attacking force began to tell and our first line of defence was slowly pressed back till it merged into the second
here the struggle was very fierce but again our people were driven back and up till at length within twenty minutes of the commencement of the fight our third line came into action
but by this time the assailants were much exhausted and besides had lost many men killed and wounded and to break through that third impenetrable hedge of spears proved beyond their powers
for a while the seething lines of savages swung backwards and forwards in the fierce ebb and flow of battle and the issue was doubtful
sir henry watched the desperate struggle with a kindling eye and then without a word he rushed off followed by good and flung himself into the hottest of the fray
as for myself i stopped where i was
the soldiers caught sight of his tall form as he plunged into battle and there rose a cry of nanzia incubu
nanzia unkungunklovo here is the elephant
chiele
chiele from that moment the end was no longer in doubt
inch by inch fighting with splendid gallantry the attacking force was pressed back down the hillside till at last it retreated upon its reserves in something like confusion
at that instant too a messenger arrived to say that the left attack had been repulsed and i was just beginning to congratulate myself believing that the affair was over for the present when to our horror we perceived our men who had been engaged in the right defence being driven towards us across the plain followed by swarms of the enemy who had evidently succeeded at this point
ignosi who was standing by me took in the situation at a glance and issued a rapid order
instantly the reserve regiment around us the greys extended itself
again ignosi gave a word of command which was taken up and repeated by the captains and in another second to my intense disgust i found myself involved in a furious onslaught upon the advancing foe
getting as much as i could behind ignosis huge frame i made the best of a bad job and toddled along to be killed as though i liked it
in a minute or twowe were plunging through the flying groups of our men who at once began to reform behind us and then i am sure i do not know what happened
all i can remember is a dreadful rolling noise of the meeting of shields and the sudden apparition of a huge ruffian whose eyes seemed literally to be starting out of his head making straight at me with a bloody spear
buti say it with pridei roseor rather sankto the occasion
it was one before which most people would have collapsed once and for all
seeing that if i stood where i was i must be killed as the horrid apparition came i flung myself down in front of him so cleverly that being unable to stop himself he took a header right over my prostrate form
before he could rise again i had risen and settled the matter from behind with my revolver
shortly after this somebody knocked me down and i remember no more of that charge
when i came to i found myself back at the koppie with good bending over me holding some water in a gourd
how do you feel old fellow he asked anxiously
i got up and shook myself before replying
pretty well thank you i answered
thank heaven
when i saw them carry you in i felt quite sick i thought you were done for not this time my boy
i fancy i only got a rap on the head which knocked me stupid
how has it ended they are repulsed at every point for a while
the loss is dreadfully heavy we have quite two thousand killed and wounded and they must have lost three
look theres a sight and he pointed to long lines of men advancing by fours
in the centre of every group of four and being borne by it was a kind of hide tray of which a kukuana force always carries a quantity with a loop for a handle at each corner
on these traysand their number seemed endlesslay wounded men who as they arrived were hastily examined by the medicine men of whom ten were attached to a regiment
if the wound was not of a fatal character the sufferer was taken away and attended to as carefully as circumstances would allow
but if on the other hand the injured mans condition proved hopeless what followed was very dreadful though doubtless it may have been the truest mercy
one of the doctors under pretence of carrying out an examination swiftly opened an artery with a sharp knife and in a minute or two the sufferer expired painlessly
there were many cases that day in which this was done
in fact it was done in the majority of cases when the wound was in the body for the gash made by the entry of the enormously broad spears used by the kukuanas generally rendered recovery impossible
in most instances the poor sufferers were already unconscious and in others the fatal nick of the artery was inflicted so swiftly and painlessly that they did not seem to notice it
still it was a ghastly sight and one from which we were glad to escape indeed i never remember anything of the kind that affected me more than seeing those gallant soldiers thus put out of pain by the redhanded medicine men except indeed on one occasion when after an attack i saw a force of swazis burying their hopelessly wounded alive
hurrying from this dreadful scene to the further side of the koppie we found sir henry who still held a battleaxe in his hand ignosi infadoos and one or two of the chiefs in deep consultation
thank heaven here you are quatermain
i cant quite make out what ignosi wants to do
it seems that though we have beaten off the attack twala is now receiving large reinforcements and is showing a disposition to invest us with the view of starving us out thats awkward yes especially as infadoos says that the water supply has given out my lord that is so said infadoos the spring cannot supply the wants of so great a multitude and it is failing rapidly
before night we shall all be thirsty
listen macumazahn
thou art wise and hast doubtless seen many wars in the lands from whence thou camestthat is if indeed they make wars in the stars
now tell us what shall we do
twala has brought up many fresh men to take the place of those who have fallen
yet twala has learnt his lesson the hawk did not think to find the heron ready but our beak has pierced his breast he fears to strike at us again
we too are wounded and he will wait for us to die he will wind himself round us like a snake round a buck and fight the fight of sit down i hear thee i said
so macumazahn thou seest we have no water here and but a little food and we must choose between these three thingsto languish like a starving lion in his den or to strive to break away towards the north orand here he rose and pointed towards the dense mass of our foesto launch ourselves straight at twalas throat
incubu the great warriorfor today he fought like a buffalo in a net and twalas soldiers went down before his axe like young corn before the hail with these eyes i saw itincubu says charge but the elephant is ever prone to charge
now what says macumazahn the wily old fox who has seen much and loves to bite his enemy from behind
the last word is in ignosi the king for it is a kings right to speak of war but let us hear thy voice o macumazahn who watchest by night and the voice too of him of the transparent eye what sayest thou ignosi i asked
nay my father answered our quondam servant who now clad as he was in the full panoply of savage war looked every inch a warrior king do thou speak and let me who am but a child in wisdom beside thee hearken to thy words thus adjured after taking hasty counsel with good and sir henry i delivered my opinion briefly to the effect that being trapped our best chance especially in view of the failure of our water supply was to initiate an attack upon twalas forces
then i recommended that the attack should be delivered at once before our wounds grew stiff and also before the sight of twalas overpowering force caused the hearts of our soldiers to wax small like fat before a fire otherwise i pointed out some of the captains might change their minds and making peace with twala desert to him or even betray us into his hands
this expression of opinion seemed on the whole to be favourably received indeed among the kukuanas my utterances met with a respect which has never been accorded to them before or since
but the real decision as to our plans lay with ignosi who since he had been recognised as rightful king could exercise the almost unbounded rights of sovereignty including of course the final decision on matters of generalship and it was to him that all eyes were now turned
at length after a pause during which he appeared to be thinking deeply he spoke
incubu macumazahn and bougwan brave white men and my friends infadoos my uncle and chiefs my heart is fixed
i will strike at twala this day and set my fortunes on the blow ay and my lifemy life and your lives also
listen thus will i strike
ye see how the hill curves round like the halfmoon and how the plain runs like a green tongue towards us within the curve we see i answered
good it is now midday and the men eat and rest after the toil of battle
when the sun has turned and travelled a little way towards the darkness let thy regiment my uncle advance with one other down to the green tongue and it shall be that when twala sees it he will hurl his force at it to crush it
but the spot is narrow and the regiments can come against thee one at a time only so may they be destroyed one by one and the eyes of all twalas army shall be fixed upon a struggle the like of which has not been seen by living man
and with thee my uncle shall go incubu my friend that when twala sees his battleaxe flashing in the first rank of the greys his heart may grow faint
and i will come with the second regiment that which follows thee so that if ye are destroyed as it might happen there may yet be a king left to fight for and with me shall come macumazahn the wise it is well o king said infadoos apparently contemplating the certainty of the complete annihilation of his regiment with perfect calmness
truly these kukuanas are a wonderful people
death has no terrors for them when it is incurred in the course of duty
and whilst the eyes of the multitude of twalas soldiers are thus fixed upon the fight went on ignosi behold onethird of the men who are left alive to us ie
about shall creep along the right horn of the hill and fall upon the left flank of twalas force and onethird shall creep along the left horn and fall upon twalas right flank
and when i see that the horns are ready to toss twala then will i with the men who remain to me charge home in twalas face and if fortune goes with us the day will be ours and before night drives her black oxen from the mountains to the mountains we shall sit in peace at loo
and now let us eat and make ready and infadoos do thou prepare that the plan be carried out without fail and stay let my white father bougwan go with the right horn that his shining eye may give courage to the captains the arrangements for attack thus briefly indicated were set in motion with a rapidity that spoke well for the perfection of the kukuana military system
within little more than an hour rations had been served out and devoured the divisions were formed the scheme of onslaught was explained to the leaders and the whole force numbering about men was ready to move with the exception of a guard left in charge of the wounded
presently good came up to sir henry and myself
goodbye you fellows he said i am off with the right wing according to orders and so i have come to shake hands in case we should not meet again you know he added significantly
we shook hands in silence and not without the exhibition of as much emotion as anglosaxons are wont to show
it is a queer business said sir henry his deep voice shaking a little and i confess i never expect to see tomorrows sun
so far as i can make out the greys with whom i am to go are to fight until they are wiped out in order to enable the wings to slip round unawares and outflank twala
well so be it at any rate it will be a mans death
goodbye old fellow
god bless you
i hope you will pull through and live to collar the diamonds but if you do take my advice and dont have anything more to do with pretenders in another second good had wrung us both by the hand and gone and then infadoos came up and led off sir henry to his place in the forefront of the greys whilst with many misgivings i departed with ignosi to my station in the second attacking regiment
the last stand of the greys in a few more minutes the regiments destined to carry out the flanking movements had tramped off in silence keeping carefully to the lee of the rising ground in order to conceal their advance from the keen eyes of twalas scouts
half an hour or more was allowed to elapse between the setting out of the horns or wings of the army before any stir was made by the greys and their supporting regiment known as the buffaloes which formed its chest and were destined to bear the brunt of the battle
both of these regiments were almost perfectly fresh and of full strength the greys having been in reserve in the morning and having lost but a small number of men in sweeping back that part of the attack which had proved successful in breaking the line of defence on the occasion when i charged with them and was stunned for my pains
as for the buffaloes they had formed the third line of defence on the left and since the attacking force at that point had not succeeded in breaking through the second they had scarcely come into action at all
infadoos who was a wary old general and knew the absolute importance of keeping up the spirits of his men on the eve of such a desperate encounter employed the pause in addressing his own regiment the greys in poetical language explaining to them the honour that they were receiving in being put thus in the forefront of the battle and in having the great white warrior from the stars to fight with them in their ranks and promising large rewards of cattle and promotion to all who survived in the event of ignosis arms being successful
i looked down the long lines of waving black plumes and stern faces beneath them and sighed to think that within one short hour most if not all of those magnificent veteran warriors not a man of whom was under forty years of age would be laid dead or dying in the dust
it could not be otherwise they were being condemned with that wise recklessness of human life which marks the great general and often saves his forces and attains his ends to certain slaughter in order to give their cause and the remainder of the army a chance of success
they were foredoomed to die and they knew the truth
it was to be their task to engage regiment after regiment of twalas army on the narrow strip of green beneath us till they were exterminated or till the wings found a favourable opportunity for their onslaught
and yet they never hesitated nor could i detect a sign of fear upon the face of a single warrior
there they weregoing to certain death about to quit the blessed light of day for ever and yet able to contemplate their doom without a tremor
even at that moment i could not help contrasting their state of mind with my own which was far from comfortable and breathing a sigh of envy and admiration
never before had i seen such an absolute devotion to the idea of duty and such a complete indifference to its bitter fruits
behold your king ended old infadoos pointing to ignosi go fight and fall for him as is the duty of brave men and cursed and shameful for ever be the name of him who shrinks from death for his king or who turns his back to the foe
behold your king chiefs captains and soldiers
now do your homage to the sacred snake and then follow on that incubu and i may show you a road to the heart of twalas host there was a moments pause then suddenly a murmur arose from the serried phalanxes before us a sound like the distant whisper of the sea caused by the gentle tapping of the handles of six thousand spears against their holders shields
slowly it swelled till its growing volume deepened and widened into a roar of rolling noise that echoed like thunder against the mountains and filled the air with heavy waves of sound
then it decreased and by faint degrees died away into nothing and suddenly out crashed the royal salute
ignosi i thought to myself might well be a proud man that day for no roman emperor ever had such a salutation from gladiators about to die ignosi acknowledged this magnificent act of homage by lifting his battleaxe and then the greys filed off in a tripleline formation each line containing about one thousand fighting men exclusive of officers
when the last companies had advanced some five hundred yards ignosi put himself at the head of the buffaloes which regiment was drawn up in a similar threefold formation and gave the word to march and off we went i needless to say uttering the most heartfelt prayers that i might emerge from that entertainment with a whole skin
many a queer position have i found myself in but never before in one quite so unpleasant as the present or one in which my chance of coming off safe was smaller
by the time that we reached the edge of the plateau the greys were already halfway down the slope ending in the tongue of grass land that ran up into the bend of the mountain something as the frog of a horses foot runs up into the shoe
the excitement in twalas camp on the plain beyond was very great and regiment after regiment was starting forward at a long swinging trot in order to reach the root of the tongue of land before the attacking force could emerge into the plain of loo
this tongue which was some four hundred yards in depth even at its root or widest part was not more than six hundred and fifty paces across while at its tip it scarcely measured ninety
the greys who in passing down the side of the hill and on to the tip of the tongue had formed into a column on reaching the spot where it broadened out again reassumed their tripleline formation and halted dead
then wethat is the buffaloesmoved down the tip of the tongue and took our stand in reserve about one hundred yards behind the last line of the greys and on slightly higher ground
meanwhile we had leisure to observe twalas entire force which evidently had been reinforced since the morning attack and could not now notwithstanding their losses number less than forty thousand moving swiftly up towards us
but as they drew near the root of the tongue they hesitated having discovered that only one regiment could advance into the gorge at a time and that there some seventy yards from the mouth of it unassailable except in front on account of the high walls of boulderstrewn ground on each side stood the famous regiment of greys the pride and glory of the kukuana army ready to hold the way against their power as the three romans once held the bridge against thousands
they hesitated and finally stopped their advance there was no eagerness to cross spears with these three grim ranks of warriors who stood so firm and ready
presently however a tall general wearing the customary headdress of nodding ostrich plumes appeared attended by a group of chiefs and orderlies being i thought none other than twala himself
he gave an order and the first regiment raising a shout charged up towards the greys who remained perfectly still and silent till the attacking troops were within forty yards and a volley of tollas or throwingknives came rattling among their ranks
then suddenly with a bound and a roar they sprang forward with uplifted spears and the regiment met in deadly strife
next second the roll of the meeting shields came to our ears like the sound of thunder and the plain seemed to be alive with flashes of light reflected from the shimmering spears
to and fro swung the surging mass of struggling stabbing humanity but not for long
suddenly the attacking lines began to grow thinner and then with a slow long heave the greys passed over them just as a great wave heaves up its bulk and passes over a sunken ridge
it was done that regiment was completely destroyed but the greys had but two lines left now a third of their number were dead
closing up shoulder to shoulder once more they halted in silence and awaited attack and i was rejoiced to catch sight of sir henrys yellow beard as he moved to and fro arranging the ranks
so he was yet alive
meanwhile we moved on to the ground of the encounter which was cumbered by about four thousand prostrate human beings dead dying and wounded and literally stained red with blood
ignosi issued an order which was rapidly passed down the ranks to the effect that none of the enemys wounded were to be killed and so far as we could see this command was scrupulously carried out
it would have been a shocking sight if we had found time to think of such things
but now a second regiment distinguished by white plumes kilts and shields was moving to the attack of the two thousand remaining greys who stood waiting in the same ominous silence as before till the foe was within forty yards or so when they hurled themselves with irresistible force upon them
again there came the awful roll of the meeting shields and as we watched the tragedy repeated itself
but this time the issue was left longer in doubt indeed it seemed for awhile almost impossible that the greys should again prevail
the attacking regiment which was formed of young men fought with the utmost fury and at first seemed by sheer weight to be driving the veterans back
the slaughter was truly awful hundreds falling every minute and from among the shouts of the warriors and the groans of the dying set to the music of clashing spears came a continuous hissing undertone of sgee sgee the note of triumph of each victor as he passed his assegai through and through the body of his fallen foe
but perfect discipline and steady and unchanging valour can do wonders and one veteran soldier is worth two young ones as soon became apparent in the present case
for just when we thought that it was all over with the greys and were preparing to take their place so soon as they made room by being destroyed i heard sir henrys deep voice ringing out through the din and caught a glimpse of his circling battleaxe as he waved it high above his plumes
then came a change the greys ceased to give they stood still as a rock against which the furious waves of spearmen broke again and again only to recoil
presently they began to move once moreforward this time as they had no firearms there was no smoke so we could see it all
another minute and the onslaught grew fainter
ah these are men indeed they will conquer again called out ignosi who was grinding his teeth with excitement at my side
see it is done suddenly like puffs of smoke from the mouth of a cannon the attacking regiment broke away in flying groups their white headdresses streaming behind them in the wind and left their opponents victors indeed but alas
no more a regiment
of the gallant triple line which forty minutes before had gone into action three thousand strong there remained at most some six hundred bloodspattered men the rest were under foot
and yet they cheered and waved their spears in triumph and then instead of falling back upon us as we expected they ran forward for a hundred yards or so after the flying groups of foemen took possession of a rising knoll of ground and resuming their triple formation formed a threefold ring around its base
and there thanks be to heaven standing on the top of the mound for a minute i saw sir henry apparently unharmed and with him our old friend infadoos
then twalas regiments rolled down upon the doomed band and once more the battle closed in
as those who read this history will probably long ago have gathered i am to be honest a bit of a coward and certainly in no way given to fighting though somehow it has often been my lot to get into unpleasant positions and to be obliged to shed mans blood
but i have always hated it and kept my own blood as undiminished in quantity as possible sometimes by a judicious use of my heels
at this moment however for the first time in my life i felt my bosom burn with martial ardour
warlike fragments from the ingoldsby legends together with numbers of sanguinary verses in the old testament sprang up in my brain like mushrooms in the dark my blood which hitherto had been halffrozen with horror went beating through my veins and there came upon me a savage desire to kill and spare not
i glanced round at the serried ranks of warriors behind us and somehow all in an instant i began to wonder if my face looked like theirs
there they stood the hands twitching the lips apart the fierce features instinct with the hungry lust of battle and in the eyes a look like the glare of a bloodhound when after long pursuit he sights his quarry
only ignosis heart to judge from his comparative selfpossession seemed to all appearances to beat as calmly as ever beneath his leopardskin cloak though even he still ground his teeth
i could bear it no longer
are we to stand here till we put out roots umbopaignosi i meanwhile twala swallows our brothers yonder i asked
nay macumazahn was the answer see now is the ripe moment let us pluck it as he spoke a fresh regiment rushed past the ring upon the little mound and wheeling round attacked it from the hither side
then lifting his battleaxe ignosi gave the signal to advance and screaming the wild kukuana warcry the buffaloes charged home with a rush like the rush of the sea
what followed immediately on this it is out of my power to tell
all i can remember is an irregular yet ordered advance that seemed to shake the ground a sudden change of front and forming up on the part of the regiment against which the charge was directed then an awful shock a dull roar of voices and a continuous flashing of spears seen through a red mist of blood
when my mind cleared i found myself standing inside the remnant of the greys near the top of the mound and just behind no less a person than sir henry himself
how i got there i had at the moment no idea but sir henry afterwards told me that i was borne up by the first furious charge of the buffaloes almost to his feet and then left as they in turn were pressed back
thereon he dashed out of the circle and dragged me into shelter
as for the fight that followed who can describe it
again and again the multitudes surged against our momentarily lessening circle and again and again we beat them back
the stubborn spearmen still made good the dark impenetrable wood each stepping where his comrade stood the instant that he fell as someone or other beautifully says
it was a splendid thing to see those brave battalions come on time after time over the barriers of their dead sometimes lifting corpses before them to receive our spearthrusts only to leave their own corpses to swell the rising piles
it was a gallant sight to see that old warrior infadoos as cool as though he were on parade shouting out orders taunts and even jests to keep up the spirit of his few remaining men and then as each charge rolled on stepping forward to wherever the fighting was thickest to bear his share in its repulse
and yet more gallant was the vision of sir henry whose ostrich plumes had been shorn off by a spear thrust so that his long yellow hair streamed out in the breeze behind him
there he stood the great dane for he was nothing else his hands his axe and his armour all red with blood and none could live before his stroke
time after time i saw it sweeping down as some great warrior ventured to give him battle and as he struck he shouted ohoy
ohoy like his berserkir forefathers and the blow went crashing through shield and spear through headdress hair and skull till at last none would of their own will come near the great white umtagati the wizard who killed and failed not
but suddenly there rose a cry of twala y twala and out of the press sprang forward none other than the gigantic oneeyed king himself also armed with battleaxe and shield and clad in chain armour
where art thou incubu thou white man who slewest scragga my sonsee if thou canst slay me he shouted and at the same time hurled a tolla straight at sir henry who fortunately saw it coming and caught it on his shield which it transfixed remaining wedged in the iron plate behind the hide
then with a cry twala sprang forward straight at him and with his battleaxe struck him such a blow upon the shield that the mere force and shock of it brought sir henry strong man as he is down upon his knees
but at this time the matter went no further for that instant there rose from the regiments pressing round us something like a shout of dismay and on looking up i saw the cause
to the right and to the left the plain was alive with the plumes of charging warriors
the outflanking squadrons had come to our relief
the time could not have been better chosen
all twalas army as ignosi predicted would be the case had fixed their attention on the bloody struggle which was raging round the remnant of the greys and that of the buffaloes who were now carrying on a battle of their own at a little distance which two regiments had formed the chest of our army
it was not until our horns were about to close upon them that they had dreamed of their approach for they believed these forces to be hidden in reserve upon the crest of the moonshaped hill
and now before they could even assume a proper formation for defence the outflanking impis had leapt like greyhounds on their flanks
in five minutes the fate of the battle was decided
taken on both flanks and dismayed at the awful slaughter inflicted upon them by the greys and buffaloes twalas regiments broke into flight and soon the whole plain between us and loo was scattered with groups of running soldiers making good their retreat
as for the hosts that had so recently surrounded us and the buffaloes they melted away as though by magic and presently we were left standing there like a rock from which the sea has retreated
but what a sight it was
around us the dead and dying lay in heapedup masses and of the gallant greys there remained but ninetyfive men upon their feet
more than three thousand four hundred had fallen in this one regiment most of them never to rise again
men said infadoos calmly as between the intervals of binding a wound on his arm he surveyed what remained to him of his corps ye have kept up the reputation of your regiment and this days fighting will be well spoken of by your childrens children then he turned round and shook sir henry curtis by the hand
thou art a great captain incubu he said simply i have lived a long life among warriors and have known many a brave one yet have i never seen a man like unto thee at this moment the buffaloes began to march past our position on the road to loo and as they went a message was brought to us from ignosi requesting infadoos sir henry and myself to join them
accordingly orders having been issued to the remaining ninety men of the greys to employ themselves in collecting the wounded we joined ignosi who informed us that he was pressing on to loo to complete the victory by capturing twala if that should be possible
before we had gone far suddenly we discovered the figure of good sitting on an antheap about one hundred paces from us
close beside him was the body of a kukuana
he must be wounded said sir henry anxiously
as he made the remark an untoward thing happened
the dead body of the kukuana soldier or rather what had appeared to be his dead body suddenly sprang up knocked good head over heels off the antheap and began to spear him
we rushed forward in terror and as we drew near we saw the brawny warrior making dig after dig at the prostrate good who at each prod jerked all his limbs into the air
seeing us coming the kukuana gave one final and most vicious dig and with a shout of take that wizard bolted away
good did not move and we concluded that our poor comrade was done for
sadly we came towards him and were astonished to find him pale and faint indeed but with a serene smile upon his face and his eyeglass still fixed in his eye
capital armour this he murmured on catching sight of our faces bending over him
how sold that beggar must have been and then he fainted
on examination we discovered that he had been seriously wounded in the leg by a tolla in the course of the pursuit but that the chain armour had prevented his last assailants spear from doing anything more than bruise him badly
it was a merciful escape
as nothing could be done for him at the moment he was placed on one of the wicker shields used for the wounded and carried along with us
on arriving before the nearest gate of loo we found one of our regiments watching it in obedience to orders received from ignosi
the other regiments were in the same way guarding the different exits to the town
the officer in command of this regiment saluted ignosi as king and informed him that twalas army had taken refuge in the town whither twala himself had also escaped but he thought that they were thoroughly demoralised and would surrender
thereupon ignosi after taking counsel with us sent forward heralds to each gate ordering the defenders to open and promising on his royal word life and forgiveness to every soldier who laid down his arms but saying that if they did not do so before nightfall he would certainly burn the town and all within its gates
this message was not without its effect
half an hour later amid the shouts and cheers of the buffaloes the bridge was dropped across the fosse and the gates upon the further side were flung open
taking due precautions against treachery we marched on into the town
all along the roadways stood thousands of dejected warriors their heads drooping and their shields and spears at their feet who headed by their officers saluted ignosi as king as he passed
on we marched straight to twalas kraal
when we reached the great space where a day or two previously we had seen the review and the witch hunt we found it deserted
no not quite deserted for there on the further side in front of his hut sat twala himself with but one attendantgagool
it was a melancholy sight to see him seated his battleaxe and shield by his side his chin upon his mailed breast with but one old crone for companion and notwithstanding his crimes and misdeeds a pang of compassion shot through me as i looked upon twala thus fallen from his high estate not a soldier of all his armies not a courtier out of the hundreds who had cringed round him not even a solitary wife remained to share his fate or halve the bitterness of his fall
poor savage
he was learning the lesson which fate teaches to most of us who live long enough that the eyes of mankind are blind to the discredited and that he who is defenceless and fallen finds few friends and little mercy
nor indeed in this case did he deserve any
filing through the kraal gate we marched across the open space to where the exking sat
when within about fifty yards of him the regiment was halted and accompanied only by a small guard we advanced towards him gagool reviling us bitterly as we came
as we drew near twala for the first time lifted his plumed head and fixed his one eye which seemed to flash with suppressed fury almost as brightly as the great diamond bound round his forehead upon his successful rivalignosi
hail o king he said with bitter mockery thou who hast eaten of my bread and now by the aid of the white mans magic hast seduced my regiments and defeated mine army hail
what fate hast thou in store for me o king the fate thou gavest to my father whose throne thou hast sat on these many years was the stern answer
it is good
i will show thee how to die that thou mayest remember it against thine own time
see the sun sinks in blood and he pointed with his battleaxe towards the setting orb it is well that my sun should go down in its company
and now o king
i am ready to die but i crave the boon of the kukuana royal house to die fighting
thou canst not refuse it or even those cowards who fled today will hold thee shamed it is a law amongst the kukuanas that no man of the direct royal blood can be put to death unless by his own consent which is however never refused
he is allowed to choose a succession of antagonists to be approved by the king with whom he fights till one of them kills himaq
it is granted
choosewith whom wilt thou fight
myself i cannot fight with thee for the king fights not except in war twalas sombre eye ran up and down our ranks and i felt as for a moment it rested on myself that the position had developed a new horror
what if he chose to begin by fighting me
what chance should i have against a desperate savage six feet five high and broad in proportion
i might as well commit suicide at once
hastily i made up my mind to decline the combat even if i were hooted out of kukuanaland as a consequence
it is i think better to be hooted than to be quartered with a battleaxe
presently twala spoke
incubu what sayest thou shall we end what we began today or shall i call thee coward whiteeven to the liver nay interposed ignosi hastily thou shalt not fight with incubu not if he is afraid said twala
unfortunately sir henry understood this remark and the blood flamed up into his cheeks
i will fight him he said he shall see if i am afraid for heavens sake i entreated dont risk your life against that of a desperate man
anybody who saw you today will know that you are brave enough i will fight him was the sullen answer
no living man shall call me a coward
i am ready now and he stepped forward and lifted his axe
i wrung my hands over this absurd piece of quixotism but if he was determined on this deed of course i could not stop him
fight not my white brother said ignosi laying his hand affectionately on sir henrys arm thou hast fought enough and if aught befell thee at his hands it would cut my heart in twain i will fight ignosi was sir henrys answer
it is well incubu thou art a brave man
it will be a good fray
behold twala the elephant is ready for thee the exking laughed savagely and stepping forward faced curtis
for a moment they stood thus and the light of the sinking sun caught their stalwart frames and clothed them both in fire
they were a wellmatched pair
then they began to circle round each other their battleaxes raised
suddenly sir henry sprang forward and struck a fearful blow at twala who stepped to one side
so heavy was the stroke that the striker half overbalanced himself a circumstance of which his antagonist took a prompt advantage
circling his massive battleaxe round his head he brought it down with tremendous force
my heart jumped into my mouth i thought that the affair was already finished
but no with a quick upward movement of the left arm sir henry interposed his shield between himself and the axe with the result that its outer edge was shorn away the axe falling on his left shoulder but not heavily enough to do any serious damage
in another moment sir henry got in a second blow which was also received by twala upon his shield
then followed blow upon blow that were in turn either received upon the shields or avoided
the excitement grew intense the regiment which was watching the encounter forgot its discipline and drawing near shouted and groaned at every stroke
just at this time too good who had been laid upon the ground by me recovered from his faint and sitting up perceived what was going on
in an instant he was up and catching hold of my arm hopped about from place to place on one leg dragging me after him and yelling encouragements to sir henry go it old fellow he hallooed
that was a good one
give it him amidships and so on
presently sir henry having caught a fresh stroke upon his shield hit out with all his force
the blow cut through twalas shield and through the tough chain armour behind it gashing him in the shoulder
with a yell of pain and fury twala returned the blow with interest and such was his strength shore right through the rhinoceros horn handle of his antagonists battleaxe strengthened as it was with bands of steel wounding curtis in the face
a cry of dismay rose from the buffaloes as our heros broad axehead fell to the ground and twala again raising his weapon flew at him with a shout
i shut my eyes
when i opened them again it was to see sir henrys shield lying on the ground and sir henry himself with his great arms twined round twalas middle
to and fro they swung hugging each other like bears straining with all their mighty muscles for dear life and dearer honour
with a supreme effort twala swung the englishman clean off his feet and down they came together rolling over and over on the lime paving twala striking out at curtis head with the battleaxe and sir henry trying to drive the tolla he had drawn from his belt through twalas armour
it was a mighty struggle and an awful thing to see
get his axe yelled good and perhaps our champion heard him
at any rate dropping the tolla he snatched at the axe which was fastened to twalas wrist by a strip of buffalo hide and still rolling over and over they fought for it like wild cats drawing their breath in heavy gasps
suddenly the hide string burst and then with a great effort sir henry freed himself the weapon remaining in his hand
another second and he was upon his feet the red blood streaming from the wound in his face and so was twala
drawing the heavy tolla from his belt he reeled straight at curtis and struck him in the breast
the stab came home true and strong but whoever it was who made that chain armour he understood his art for it withstood the steel
again twala struck out with a savage yell and again the sharp knife rebounded and sir henry went staggering back
once more twala came on and as he came our great englishman gathered himself together and swinging the big axe round his head with both hands hit at him with all his force
there was a shriek of excitement from a thousand throats and behold
twalas head seemed to spring from his shoulders then it fell and came rolling and bounding along the ground towards ignosi stopping just at his feet
for a second the corpse stood upright then with a dull crash it came to the earth and the gold torque from its neck rolled away across the pavement
as it did so sir henry overpowered by faintness and loss of blood fell heavily across the body of the dead king
in a second he was lifted up and eager hands were pouring water on his face
another minute and the grey eyes opened wide
he was not dead
then i just as the sun sank stepping to where twalas head lay in the dust unloosed the diamond from the dead brows and handed it to ignosi
take it i said lawful king of the kukuanasking by birth and victory ignosi bound the diadem upon his brows
then advancing he placed his foot upon the broad chest of his headless foe and broke out into a chant or rather a pan of triumph so beautiful and yet so utterly savage that i despair of being able to give an adequate version of his words
once i heard a scholar with a fine voice read aloud from the greek poet homer and i remember that the sound of the rolling lines seemed to make my blood stand still
ignosis chant uttered as it was in a language as beautiful and sonorous as the old greek produced exactly the same effect on me although i was exhausted with toil and many emotions
now he began now our rebellion is swallowed up in victory and our evildoing is justified by strength
in the morning the oppressors arose and stretched themselves they bound on their harness and made them ready to war
they rose up and tossed their spears the soldiers called to the captains come lead usand the captains cried to the king direct thou the battle they laughed in their pride twenty thousand men and yet a twenty thousand
their plumes covered the valleys as the plumes of a bird cover her nest they shook their shields and shouted yea they shook their shields in the sunlight they lusted for battle and were glad
they came up against me their strong ones ran swiftly to slay me they cried ha
ha
he is as one already dead then breathed i on them and my breath was as the breath of a wind and lo
they were not
my lightnings pierced them i licked up their strength with the lightning of my spears i shook them to the ground with the thunder of my shoutings
they brokethey scatteredthey were gone as the mists of the morning
they are food for the kites and the foxes and the place of battle is fat with their blood
where are the mighty ones who rose up in the morning
where are the proud ones who tossed their spears and cried he is as a man already dead
they bow their heads but not in sleep they are stretched out but not in sleep
they are forgotten they have gone into the blackness they dwell in the dead moons yea others shall lead away their wives and their children shall remember them no more
and i
the kinglike an eagle i have found my eyrie
behold
far have i flown in the night season yet have i returned to my young at the daybreak
shelter ye under the shadow of my wings o people and i will comfort you and ye shall not be dismayed
now is the good time the time of spoil
mine are the cattle on the mountains mine are the virgins in the kraals
the winter is overpast with storms the summer is come with flowers
now evil shall cover up her face now mercy and gladness shall dwell in the land
rejoice rejoice my people
let all the stars rejoice in that this tyranny is trodden down in that i am the king ignosi ceased his song and out of the gathering gloom came back the deep reply thou art the king thus was my prophecy to the herald fulfilled and within the fortyeight hours twalas headless corpse was stiffening at twalas gate
good falls sick after the fight was ended sir henry and good were carried into twalas hut where i joined them
they were both utterly exhausted by exertion and loss of blood and indeed my own condition was little better
i am very wiry and can stand more fatigue than most men probably on account of my light weight and long training but that night i was quite done up and as is always the case with me when exhausted that old wound which the lion gave me began to pain
also my head was aching violently from the blow i had received in the morning when i was knocked senseless
altogether a more miserable trio than we were that evening it would have been difficult to discover and our only comfort lay in the reflection that we were exceedingly fortunate to be there to feel miserable instead of being stretched dead upon the plain as so many thousands of brave men were that night who had risen well and strong in the morning
somehow with the assistance of the beautiful foulata who since we had been the means of saving her life had constituted herself our handmaiden and especially goods we managed to get off the chain shirts which had certainly saved the lives of two of us that day
as i expected we found that the flesh underneath was terribly contused for though the steel links had kept the weapons from entering they had not prevented them from bruising
both sir henry and good were a mass of contusions and i was by no means free
as a remedy foulata brought us some pounded green leaves with an aromatic odour which when applied as a plaster gave us considerable relief
but though the bruises were painful they did not give us such anxiety as sir henrys and goods wounds
good had a hole right through the fleshy part of his beautiful white leg from which he had lost a great deal of blood and sir henry with other hurts had a deep cut over the jaw inflicted by twalas battleaxe
luckily good is a very decent surgeon and so soon as his small box of medicines was forthcoming having thoroughly cleansed the wounds he managed to stitch up first sir henrys and then his own pretty satisfactorily considering the imperfect light given by the primitive kukuana lamp in the hut
afterwards he plentifully smeared the injured places with some antiseptic ointment of which there was a pot in the little box and we covered them with the remains of a pockethandkerchief which we possessed
meanwhile foulata had prepared us some strong broth for we were too weary to eat
this we swallowed and then threw ourselves down on the piles of magnificent karrosses or fur rugs which were scattered about the dead kings great hut
by a very strange instance of the irony of fate it was on twalas own couch and wrapped in twalas own particular karross that sir henry the man who had slain him slept that night
i say slept but after that days work sleep was indeed difficult
to begin with in very truth the air was full of farewells to the dying and mournings for the dead from every direction came the sound of the wailing of women whose husbands sons and brothers had perished in the battle
no wonder that they wailed for over twelve thousand men or nearly a fifth of the kukuana army had been destroyed in that awful struggle
it was heartrending to lie and listen to their cries for those who never would return and it made me understand the full horror of the work done that day to further mans ambition
towards midnight however the ceaseless crying of the women grew less frequent till at length the silence was only broken at intervals of a few minutes by a long piercing howl that came from a hut in our immediate rear which as i afterwards discovered proceeded from gagool keening over the dead king twala
after that i got a little fitful sleep only to wake from time to time with a start thinking that i was once more an actor in the terrible events of the last twentyfour hours
now i seemed to see that warrior whom my hand had sent to his last account charging at me on the mountaintop now i was once more in that glorious ring of greys which made its immortal stand against all twalas regiments upon the little mound and now again i saw twalas plumed and gory head roll past my feet with gnashing teeth and glaring eye
at last somehow or other the night passed away but when dawn broke i found that my companions had slept no better than myself
good indeed was in a high fever and very soon afterwards began to grow lightheaded and also to my alarm to spit blood the result no doubt of some internal injury inflicted during the desperate efforts made by the kukuana warrior on the previous day to force his big spear through the chain armour
sir henry however seemed pretty fresh notwithstanding his wound on the face which made eating difficult and laughter an impossibility though he was so sore and stiff that he could scarcely stir
about eight oclock we had a visit from infadoos who appeared but little the worsetough old warrior that he wasfor his exertions in the battle although he informed us that he had been up all night
he was delighted to see us but much grieved at goods condition and shook our hands cordially
i noticed however that he addressed sir henry with a kind of reverence as though he were something more than man and indeed as we afterwards found out the great englishman was looked on throughout kukuanaland as a supernatural being
no man the soldiers said could have fought as he fought or at the end of a day of such toil and bloodshed could have slain twala who in addition to being the king was supposed to be the strongest warrior in the country in single combat shearing through his bullneck at a stroke
indeed that stroke became proverbial in kukuanaland and any extraordinary blow or feat of strength was henceforth known as incubus blow infadoos told us also that all twalas regiments had submitted to ignosi and that like submissions were beginning to arrive from chiefs in the outlying country
twalas death at the hands of sir henry had put an end to all further chance of disturbance for scragga had been his only legitimate son so there was no rival claimant to the throne left alive
i remarked that ignosi had swum to power through blood
the old chief shrugged his shoulders
yes he answered but the kukuana people can only be kept cool by letting their blood flow sometimes
many are killed indeed but the women are left and others must soon grow up to take the places of the fallen
after this the land would be quiet for a while afterwards in the course of the morning we had a short visit from ignosi on whose brows the royal diadem was now bound
as i contemplated him advancing with kingly dignity an obsequious guard following his steps i could not help recalling to my mind the tall zulu who had presented himself to us at durban some few months back asking to be taken into our service and reflecting on the strange revolutions of the wheel of fortune
hail o king i said rising
yes macumazahn
king at last by the might of your three right hands was the ready answer
all was he said going well and he hoped to arrange a great feast in two weeks time in order to show himself to the people
i asked him what he had settled to do with gagool
she is the evil genius of the land he answered and i shall kill her and all the witch doctors with her
she has lived so long that none can remember when she was not very old and she it is who has always trained the witchhunters and made the land wicked in the sight of the heavens above yet she knows much i replied it is easier to destroy knowledge ignosi than to gather it that is so he said thoughtfully
she and she only knows the secret of the three witches yonder whither the great road runs where the kings are buried and the silent ones sit yes and the diamonds are
forget not thy promise ignosi thou must lead us to the mines even if thou hast to spare gagool alive to show the way i will not forget macumazahn and i will think on what thou sayest after ignosis visit i went to see good and found him quite delirious
the fever set up by his wound seemed to have taken a firm hold of his system and to be complicated with an internal injury
for four or five days his condition was most critical indeed i believe firmly that had it not been for foulatas indefatigable nursing he must have died
women are women all the world over whatever their colour
yet somehow it seemed curious to watch this dusky beauty bending night and day over the fevered mans couch and performing all the merciful errands of a sickroom swiftly gently and with as fine an instinct as that of a trained hospital nurse
for the first night or two i tried to help her and so did sir henry as soon as his stiffness allowed him to move but foulata bore our interference with impatience and finally insisted upon our leaving him to her saying that our movements made him restless which i think was true
day and night she watched him and tended him giving him his only medicine a native cooling drink made of milk in which was infused juice from the bulb of a species of tulip and keeping the flies from settling on him
i can see the whole picture now as it appeared night after night by the light of our primitive lamp good tossing to and fro his features emaciated his eyes shining large and luminous and jabbering nonsense by the yard and seated on the ground by his side her back resting against the wall of the hut the softeyed shapely kukuana beauty her face weary as it was with her long vigil animated by a look of infinite compassionor was it something more than compassion
for two days we thought that he must die and crept about with heavy hearts
only foulata would not believe it
he will live she said
for three hundred yards or more around twalas chief hut where the sufferer lay there was silence for by the kings order all who lived in the habitations behind it except sir henry and myself had been removed lest any noise should come to the sick mans ears
one night it was the fifth of goods illness as was my habit i went across to see how he was doing before turning in for a few hours
i entered the hut carefully
the lamp placed upon the floor showed the figure of good tossing no more but lying quite still
so it had come at last
in the bitterness of my heart i gave something like a sob
hushhh came from the patch of dark shadow behind goods head
then creeping closer i saw that he was not dead but sleeping soundly with foulatas taper fingers clasped tightly in his poor white hand
the crisis had passed and he would live
he slept like that for eighteen hours and i scarcely like to say it for fear i should not be believed but during the entire period did this devoted girl sit by him fearing that if she moved and drew away her hand it would wake him
what she must have suffered from cramp and weariness to say nothing of want of food nobody will ever know but it is the fact that when at last he woke she had to be carried awayher limbs were so stiff that she could not move them
after the turn had once been taken goods recovery was rapid and complete
it was not till he was nearly well that sir henry told him of all he owed to foulata and when he came to the story of how she sat by his side for eighteen hours fearing lest by moving she should wake him the honest sailors eyes filled with tears
he turned and went straight to the hut where foulata was preparing the midday meal for we were back in our old quarters now taking me with him to interpret in case he could not make his meaning clear to her though i am bound to say that she understood him marvellously as a rule considering how extremely limited was his foreign vocabulary
tell her said good that i owe her my life and that i will never forget her kindness to my dying day i interpreted and under her dark skin she actually seemed to blush
turning to him with one of those swift and graceful motions that in her always reminded me of the flight of a wild bird foulata answered softly glancing at him with her large brown eyes nay my lord my lord forgets
did he not save my life and am i not my lords handmaiden it will be observed that the young lady appeared entirely to have forgotten the share which sir henry and myself had taken in her preservation from twalas clutches
but that is the way of women
i remember my dear wife was just the same
well i retired from that little interview sad at heart
i did not like miss foulatas soft glances for i knew the fatal amorous propensities of sailors in general and of good in particular
there are two things in the world as i have found out which cannot be prevented you cannot keep a zulu from fighting or a sailor from falling in love upon the slightest provocation
it was a few days after this last occurrence that ignosi held his great indaba or council and was formally recognised as king by the indunas or head men of kukuanaland
the spectacle was a most imposing one including as it did a grand review of troops
on this day the remaining fragments of the greys were formally paraded and in the face of the army thanked for their splendid conduct in the battle
to each man the king made a large present of cattle promoting them one and all to the rank of officers in the new corps of greys which was in process of formation
an order was also promulgated throughout the length and breadth of kukuanaland that whilst we honoured the country by our presence we three were to be greeted with the royal salute and to be treated with the same ceremony and respect that was by custom accorded to the king
also the power of life and death was publicly conferred upon us
ignosi too in the presence of his people reaffirmed the promises which he had made to the effect that no mans blood should be shed without trial and that witchhunting should cease in the land
when the ceremony was over we waited upon ignosi and informed him that we were now anxious to investigate the mystery of the mines to which solomons road ran asking him if he had discovered anything about them
my friends he answered i have discovered this
it is there that the three great figures sit who here are called the silent ones and to whom twala would have offered the girl foulata as a sacrifice
it is there too in a great cave deep in the mountain that the kings of the land are buried there ye shall find twalas body sitting with those who went before him
there also is a deep pit which at some time longdead men dug out mayhap for the stones ye speak of such as i have heard men in natal tell of at kimberley
there too in the place of death is a secret chamber known to none but the king and gagool
but twala who knew it is dead and i know it not nor know i what is in it
yet there is a legend in the land that once many generations gone a white man crossed the mountains and was led by a woman to the secret chamber and shown the wealth hidden in it
but before he could take it she betrayed him and he was driven by the king of that day back to the mountains and since then no man has entered the place the story is surely true ignosi for on the mountains we found the white man i said
yes we found him
and now i have promised you that if ye can come to that chamber and the stones are there the gem upon thy forehead proves that they are there i put in pointing to the great diamond i had taken from twalas dead brows
mayhap if they are there he said ye shall have as many as ye can take henceif indeed ye would leave me my brothers first we must find the chamber said i
there is but one who can show it to theegagool and if she will not then she must die said ignosi sternly
i have saved her alive but for this
stay she shall choose and calling to a messenger he ordered gagool to be brought before him
in a few minutes she came hurried along by two guards whom she was cursing as she walked
leave her said the king to the guards
so soon as their support was withdrawn the withered old bundlefor she looked more like a bundle than anything else out of which her two bright and wicked eyes gleamed like those of a snakesank in a heap on to the floor
what will ye with me ignosi she piped
ye dare not touch me
if ye touch me i will slay you as ye sit
beware of my magic thy magic could not save twala old shewolf and it cannot hurt me was the answer
listen i will this of thee that thou reveal to us the chamber where are the shining stones ha
ha she piped none know its secret but i and i will never tell thee
the white devils shall go hence emptyhanded thou shalt tell me
i will make thee tell me how o king
thou art great but can thy power wring the truth from a woman it is difficult yet will i do so how o king nay thus if thou tellest not thou shalt slowly die die she shrieked in terror and fury ye dare not touch meman ye know not who i am
how old think ye am i
i knew your fathers and your fathers fathers fathers
when the country was young i was here when the country grows old i shall still be here
i cannot die unless i be killed by chance for none dare slay me yet will i slay thee
see gagool mother of evil thou art so old that thou canst no longer love thy life
what can life be to such a hag as thou who hast no shape nor form nor hair nor teethhast naught save wickedness and evil eyes
it will be mercy to make an end of thee gagool thou fool shrieked the old fiend thou accursed fool deemest thou that life is sweet only to the young
it is not so and naught thou knowest of the heart of man to think it
to the young indeed death is sometimes welcome for the young can feel
they love and suffer and it wrings them to see their beloved pass to the land of shadows
but the old feel not they love not and ha
ha they laugh to see another go out into the dark ha
ha they laugh to see the evil that is done under the stars
all they love is life the warm warm sun and the sweet sweet air
they are afraid of the cold afraid of the cold and the dark ha
ha
ha and the old hag writhed in ghastly merriment on the ground
cease thine evil talk and answer me said ignosi angrily
wilt thou show the place where the stones are or wilt thou not
if thou wilt not thou diest even now and he seized a spear and held it over her
i will not show it thou darest not kill me darest not
he who slays me will be accursed for ever slowly ignosi brought down the spear till it pricked the prostrate heap of rags
with a wild yell gagool sprang to her feet then fell again and rolled upon the floor
nay i will show thee
only let me live let me sit in the sun and have a bit of meat to suck and i will show thee it is well
i thought that i should find a way to reason with thee
tomorrow shalt thou go with infadoos and my white brothers to the place and beware how thou failest for if thou showest it not then thou shalt slowly die
i have spoken i will not fail ignosi
i always keep my wordha
ha
ha once before a woman showed the chamber to a white man and behold
evil befell him and here her wicked eyes glinted
her name was gagool also
perchance i was that woman thou liest i said that was ten generations gone mayhap mayhap when one lives long one forgets
perhaps it was my mothers mother who told me surely her name was gagool also
but mark ye will find in the place where the bright things are a bag of hide full of stones
the man filled that bag but he never took it away
evil befell him i say evil befell him
perhaps it was my mothers mother who told me
it will be a merry journeywe can see the bodies of those who died in the battle as we go
their eyes will be gone by now and their ribs will be hollow
ha
ha
ha the place of death it was already dark on the third day after the scene described in the previous chapter when we camped in some huts at the foot of the three witches as the triangle of mountains is called to which solomons great road runs
our party consisted of our three selves and foulata who waited on usespecially on goodinfadoos gagool who was borne along in a litter inside which she could be heard muttering and cursing all day long and a party of guards and attendants
the mountains or rather the three peaks of the mountain for the mass was evidently the result of a solitary upheaval were as i have said in the form of a triangle of which the base was towards us one peak being on our right one on our left and one straight in front of us
never shall i forget the sight afforded by those three towering peaks in the early sunlight of the following morning
high high above us up into the blue air soared their twisted snowwreaths
beneath the snowline the peaks were purple with heaths and so were the wild moors that ran up the slopes towards them
straight before us the white ribbon of solomons great road stretched away uphill to the foot of the centre peak about five miles from us and there stopped
it was its terminus
i had better leave the feelings of intense excitement with which we set out on our march that morning to the imagination of those who read this history
at last we were drawing near to the wonderful mines that had been the cause of the miserable death of the old portuguese dom three centuries ago of my poor friend his illstarred descendant and also as we feared of george curtis sir henrys brother
were we destined after all that we had gone through to fare any better
evil befell them as that old fiend gagool said would it also befall us
somehow as we were marching up that last stretch of beautiful road i could not help feeling a little superstitious about the matter and so i think did good and sir henry
for an hour and a half or more we tramped on up the heatherfringed way going so fast in our excitement that the bearers of gagools hammock could scarcely keep pace with us and its occupant piped out to us to stop
walk more slowly white men she said projecting her hideous shrivelled countenance between the grass curtains and fixing her gleaming eyes upon us why will ye run to meet the evil that shall befall you ye seekers after treasure and she laughed that horrible laugh which always sent a cold shiver down my back and for a while quite took the enthusiasm out of us
however on we went till we saw before us and between ourselves and the peak a vast circular hole with sloping sides three hundred feet or more in depth and quite half a mile round
cant you guess what this is i said to sir henry and good who were staring in astonishment at the awful pit before us
they shook their heads
then it is clear that you have never seen the diamond diggings at kimberley
you may depend on it that this is solomons diamond mine
look there i said pointing to the strata of stiff blue clay which were yet to be seen among the grass and bushes that clothed the sides of the pit the formation is the same
ill be bound that if we went down there we should find pipes of soapy brecciated rock
look too and i pointed to a series of worn flat slabs of stone that were placed on a gentle slope below the level of a watercourse which in some past age had been cut out of the solid rock if those are not tables once used to wash the stuff im a dutchman at the edge of this vast hole which was none other than the pit marked on the old doms map the great road branched into two and circumvented it
in many places by the way this surrounding road was built entirely out of blocks of stone apparently with the object of supporting the edges of the pit and preventing falls of reef
along this path we pressed driven by curiosity to see what were the three towering objects which we could discern from the hither side of the great gulf
as we drew near we perceived that they were colossi of some sort or another and rightly conjectured that before us sat the three silent ones that are held in such awe by the kukuana people
but it was not until we were quite close to them that we recognised the full majesty of these silent ones there upon huge pedestals of dark rock sculptured with rude emblems of the phallic worship separated from each other by a distance of forty paces and looking down the road which crossed some sixty miles of plain to loo were three colossal seated formstwo male and one femaleeach measuring about thirty feet from the crown of its head to the pedestal
the female form which was nude was of great though severe beauty but unfortunately the features had been injured by centuries of exposure to the weather
rising from either side of her head were the points of a crescent
the two male colossi on the contrary were draped and presented a terrifying cast of features especially the one to our right which had the face of a devil
that to our left was serene in countenance but the calm upon it seemed dreadful
it was the calm of that inhuman cruelty sir henry remarked which the ancients attributed to beings potent for good who could yet watch the sufferings of humanity if not without rejoicing at least without sorrow
these three statues form a most aweinspiring trinity as they sit there in their solitude and gaze out across the plain for ever
contemplating these silent ones as the kukuanas call them an intense curiosity again seized us to know whose were the hands which had shaped them who it was that had dug the pit and made the road
whilst i was gazing and wondering suddenly it occurred to mebeing familiar with the old testamentthat solomon went astray after strange gods the names of three of whom i rememberedashtoreth the goddess of the zidonians chemosh the god of the moabites and milcom the god of the children of ammonand i suggested to my companions that the figures before us might represent these false and exploded divinities
hum said sir henry who is a scholar having taken a high degree in classics at college there may be something in that ashtoreth of the hebrews was the astarte of the phoenicians who were the great traders of solomons time
astarte who afterwards became the aphrodite of the greeks was represented with horns like the halfmoon and there on the brow of the female figure are distinct horns
perhaps these colossi were designed by some phoenician official who managed the mines
who can say compare milton paradise lost book i with these in troop came ashtoreth whom the phoenicians called astart queen of heaven with crescent horns to whose bright image nightly by the moon sidonian virgins paid their vows and songs before we had finished examining these extraordinary relics of remote antiquity infadoos came up and having saluted the silent ones by lifting his spear asked us if we intended entering the place of death at once or if we would wait till after we had taken food at midday
if we were ready to go at once gagool had announced her willingness to guide us
as it was not later than eleven oclockdriven to it by a burning curiositywe announced our intention of proceeding instantly and i suggested that in case we should be detained in the cave we should take some food with us
accordingly gagools litter was brought up and that lady herself assisted out of it
meanwhile foulata at my request stored some biltong or dried gameflesh together with a couple of gourds of water in a reed basket with a hinged cover
straight in front of us at a distance of some fifty paces from the backs of the colossi rose a sheer wall of rock eighty feet or more in height that gradually sloped upwards till it formed the base of the lofty snowwreathed peak which soared into the air three thousand feet above us
as soon as she was clear of her hammock gagool cast one evil grin upon us and then leaning on a stick hobbled off towards the face of this wall
we followed her till we came to a narrow portal solidly arched that looked like the opening of a gallery of a mine
here gagool was waiting for us still with that evil grin upon her horrid face
now white men from the stars she piped great warriors incubu bougwan and macumazahn the wise are ye ready
behold i am here to do the bidding of my lord the king and to show you the store of bright stones
ha
ha
ha we are ready i said
good good
make strong your hearts to bear what ye shall see
comest thou too infadoos thou who didst betray thy master infadoos frowned as he answered nay i come not it is not for me to enter there
but thou gagool curb thy tongue and beware how thou dealest with my lords
at thy hands will i require them and if a hair of them be hurt gagool best thou fifty times a witch thou shalt die
hearest thou i hear infadoos i know thee thou didst ever love big words when thou wast a babe i remember thou didst threaten thine own mother
that was but the other day
but fear not fear not i live only to do the bidding of the king
i have done the bidding of many kings infadoos till in the end they did mine
ha
ha i go to look upon their faces once more and twalas also
come on come on here is the lamp and she drew a large gourd full of oil and fitted with a rush wick from under her fur cloak
art thou coming foulata asked good in his villainous kitchen kukuana in which he had been improving himself under that young ladys tuition
i fear my lord the girl answered timidly
then give me the basket nay my lord whither thou goest there i go also the deuce you will thought i to myself that may be rather awkward if we ever get out of this without further ado gagool plunged into the passage which was wide enough to admit of two walking abreast and quite dark
we followed the sound of her voice as she piped to us to come on in some fear and trembling which was not allayed by the flutter of a sudden rush of wings
hullo
whats that halloed good somebody hit me in the face bats said i on you go when so far as we could judge we had gone some fifty paces we perceived that the passage was growing faintly light
another minute and we were in perhaps the most wonderful place that the eyes of living man have beheld
let the reader picture to himself the hall of the vastest cathedral he ever stood in windowless indeed but dimly lighted from above presumably by shafts connected with the outer air and driven in the roof which arched away a hundred feet above our heads and he will get some idea of the size of the enormous cave in which we found ourselves with the difference that this cathedral designed by nature was loftier and wider than any built by man
but its stupendous size was the least of the wonders of the place for running in rows adown its length were gigantic pillars of what looked like ice but were in reality huge stalactites
it is impossible for me to convey any idea of the overpowering beauty and grandeur of these pillars of white spar some of which were not less than twenty feet in diameter at the base and sprang up in lofty and yet delicate beauty sheer to the distant roof
others again were in process of formation
on the rock floor there was in these cases what looked sir henry said exactly like a broken column in an old grecian temple whilst high above depending from the roof the point of a huge icicle could be dimly seen
even as we gazed we could hear the process going on for presently with a tiny splash a drop of water would fall from the faroff icicle on to the column below
on some columns the drops only fell once in two or three minutes and in these cases it would be an interesting calculation to discover how long at that rate of dripping it would take to form a pillar say eighty feet by ten in diameter
that the process in at least one instance was incalculably slow the following example will suffice to show
cut on one of these pillars we discovered the crude likeness of a mummy by the head of which sat what appeared to be the figure of an egyptian god doubtless the handiwork of some oldworld labourer in the mine
this work of art was executed at the natural height at which an idle fellow be he phoenician workman or british cad is in the habit of trying to immortalise himself at the expense of natures masterpieces namely about five feet from the ground
yet at the time that we saw it which must have been nearly three thousand years after the date of the execution of the carving the column was only eight feet high and was still in process of formation which gives a rate of growth of a foot to a thousand years or an inch and a fraction to a century
this we knew because as we were standing by it we heard a drop of water fall
sometimes the stalagmites took strange forms presumably where the dropping of the water had not always been on the same spot
thus one huge mass which must have weighed a hundred tons or so was in the shape of a pulpit beautifully fretted over outside with a design that looked like lace
others resembled strange beasts and on the sides of the cave were fanlike ivory tracings such as the frost leaves upon a pane
out of the vast main aisle there opened here and there smaller caves exactly sir henry said as chapels open out of great cathedrals
some were large but one or twoand this is a wonderful instance of how nature carries out her handiwork by the same unvarying laws utterly irrespective of sizewere tiny
one little nook for instance was no larger than an unusually big dolls house and yet it might have been a model for the whole place for the water dropped tiny icicles hung and spar columns were forming in just the same way
we had not however enough time to examine this beautiful cavern so thoroughly as we should have liked to do since unfortunately gagool seemed to be indifferent as to stalactites and only anxious to get her business over
this annoyed me the more as i was particularly anxious to discover if possible by what system the light was admitted into the cave and whether it was by the hand of man or by that of nature that this was done also if the place had been used in any way in ancient times as seemed probable
however we consoled ourselves with the idea that we would investigate it thoroughly on our way back and followed on at the heels of our uncanny guide
on she led us straight to the top of the vast and silent cave where we found another doorway not arched as the first was but square at the top something like the doorways of egyptian temples
are ye prepared to enter the place of death white men asked gagool evidently with a view to making us feel uncomfortable
lead on macduff said good solemnly trying to look as though he was not at all alarmed as indeed we all did except foulata who caught good by the arm for protection
this is getting rather ghastly said sir henry peeping into the dark passageway
come on quatermainseniores priores
we mustnt keep the old lady waiting and he politely made way for me to lead the van for which inwardly i did not bless him
tap tap went old gagools stick down the passage as she trotted along chuckling hideously and still overcome by some unaccountable presentiment of evil i hung back
come get on old fellow said good or we shall lose our fair guide thus adjured i started down the passage and after about twenty paces found myself in a gloomy apartment some forty feet long by thirty broad and thirty high which in some past age evidently had been hollowed by handlabour out of the mountain
this apartment was not nearly so well lighted as the vast stalactite antecave and at the first glance all i could discern was a massive stone table running down its length with a colossal white figure at its head and lifesized white figures all round it
next i discovered a brown thing seated on the table in the centre and in another moment my eyes grew accustomed to the light and i saw what all these things were and was tailing out of the place as hard as my legs could carry me
i am not a nervous man in a general way and very little troubled with superstitions of which i have lived to see the folly but i am free to own that this sight quite upset me and had it not been that sir henry caught me by the collar and held me i do honestly believe that in another five minutes i should have been outside the stalactite cave and that a promise of all the diamonds in kimberley would not have induced me to enter it again
but he held me tight so i stopped because i could not help myself
next second however his eyes became accustomed to the light and he let go of me and began to mop the perspiration off his forehead
as for good he swore feebly while foulata threw her arms round his neck and shrieked
only gagool chuckled loud and long
it was a ghastly sight
there at the end of the long stone table holding in his skeleton fingers a great white spear sat death himself shaped in the form of a colossal human skeleton fifteen feet or more in height
high above his head he held the spear as though in the act to strike one bony hand rested on the stone table before him in the position a man assumes on rising from his seat whilst his frame was bent forward so that the vertebr of the neck and the grinning gleaming skull projected towards us and fixed its hollow eyeplaces upon us the jaws a little open as though it were about to speak
great heavens said i faintly at last what can it be and what are those things asked good pointing to the white company round the table
and what on earth is that thing said sir henry pointing to the brown creature seated on the table
hee
hee
hee laughed gagool
to those who enter the hall of the dead evil comes
hee
hee
hee
ha
ha come incubu brave in battle come and see him thou slewest and the old creature caught curtis coat in her skinny fingers and led him away towards the table
we followed
presently she stopped and pointed at the brown object seated on the table
sir henry looked and started back with an exclamation and no wonder for there quite naked the head which curtis battleaxe had shorn from the body resting on its knees was the gaunt corpse of twala the last king of the kukuanas
yes there the head perched upon the knees it sat in all its ugliness the vertebr projecting a full inch above the level of the shrunken flesh of the neck for all the world like a black double of hamilton tighe
over the surface of the corpse there was gathered a thin glassy film that made its appearance yet more appalling for which we were at the moment quite unable to account till presently we observed that from the roof of the chamber the water fell steadily drip
drop
drip on to the neck of the corpse whence it ran down over the entire surface and finally escaped into the rock through a tiny hole in the table
then i guessed what the film wastwalas body was being transformed into a stalactite now haste ye my handmaidens haste and see how he sits there and glowers with his head on his knee a look at the white forms seated on the stone bench which ran round that ghastly board confirmed this view
they were human bodies indeed or rather they had been human now they were stalactites
this was the way in which the kukuana people had from time immemorial preserved their royal dead
they petrified them
what the exact system might be if there was any beyond the placing of them for a long period of years under the drip i never discovered but there they sat iced over and preserved for ever by the siliceous fluid
anything more aweinspiring than the spectacle of this long line of departed royalties there were twentyseven of them the last being ignosis father wrapped each of them in a shroud of icelike spar through which the features could be dimly discovered and seated round that inhospitable board with death himself for a host it is impossible to imagine
that the practice of thus preserving their kings must have been an ancient one is evident from the number which allowing for an average reign of fifteen years supposing that every king who reigned was placed herean improbable thing as some are sure to have perished in battle far from homewould fix the date of its commencement at four and a quarter centuries back
but the colossal death who sits at the head of the board is far older than that and unless i am much mistaken owes his origin to the same artist who designed the three colossi
he is hewn out of a single stalactite and looked at as a work of art is most admirably conceived and executed
good who understands such things declared that so far as he could see the anatomical design of the skeleton is perfect down to the smallest bones
my own idea is that this terrific object was a freak of fancy on the part of some oldworld sculptor and that its presence had suggested to the kukuanas the idea of placing their royal dead under its awful presidency
or perhaps it was set there to frighten away any marauders who might have designs upon the treasure chamber beyond
i cannot say
all i can do is to describe it as it is and the reader must form his own conclusion
such at any rate was the white death and such were the white dead
solomons treasure chamber while we were engaged in recovering from our fright and in examining the grisly wonders of the place of death gagool had been differently occupied
somehow or otherfor she was marvellously active when she choseshe had scrambled on to the great table and made her way to where our departed friend twala was placed under the drip to see suggested good how he was pickling or for some dark purpose of her own
then after bending down to kiss his icy lips as though in affectionate greeting she hobbled back stopping now and again to address the remark the tenor of which i could not catch to one or other of the shrouded forms just as you or i might welcome an old acquaintance
having gone through this mysterious and horrible ceremony she squatted herself down on the table immediately under the white death and began so far as i could make out to offer up prayers
the spectacle of this wicked creature pouring out supplications evil ones no doubt to the arch enemy of mankind was so uncanny that it caused us to hasten our inspection
now gagool said i in a low voicesomehow one did not dare to speak above a whisper in that placelead us to the chamber the old witch promptly scrambled down from the table
my lords are not afraid she said leering up into my face
lead on good my lords and she hobbled round to the back of the great death
here is the chamber let my lords light the lamp and enter and she placed the gourd full of oil upon the floor and leaned herself against the side of the cave
i took out a match of which we had still a few in a box and lit a rush wick and then looked for the doorway but there was nothing before us except the solid rock
gagool grinned
the way is there my lords
ha
ha
ha do not jest with us i said sternly
i jest not my lords
see and she pointed at the rock
as she did so on holding up the lamp we perceived that a mass of stone was rising slowly from the floor and vanishing into the rock above where doubtless there is a cavity prepared to receive it
the mass was of the width of a goodsized door about ten feet high and not less than five feet thick
it must have weighed at least twenty or thirty tons and was clearly moved upon some simple balance principle of counterweights probably the same as that by which the opening and shutting of an ordinary modern window is arranged
how the principle was set in motion of course none of us saw gagool was careful to avoid this but i have little doubt that there was some very simple lever which was moved ever so little by pressure at a secret spot thereby throwing additional weight on to the hidden counterbalances and causing the monolith to be lifted from the ground
very slowly and gently the great stone raised itself till at last it had vanished altogether and a dark hole presented itself to us in the place which the door had filled
our excitement was so intense as we saw the way to solomons treasure chamber thrown open at last that i for one began to tremble and shake
would it prove a hoax after all i wondered or was old da silvestra right
were there vast hoards of wealth hidden in that dark place hoards which would make us the richest men in the whole world
we should know in a minute or two
enter white men from the stars said gagool advancing into the doorway but first hear your servant gagool the old
the bright stones that ye will see were dug out of the pit over which the silent ones are set and stored here i know not by whom for that was done longer ago than even i remember
but once has this place been entered since the time that those who hid the stones departed in haste leaving them behind
the report of the treasure went down indeed among the people who lived in the country from age to age but none knew where the chamber was nor the secret of the door
but it happened that a white man reached this country from over the mountainsperchance he too came from the starsand was well received by the king of that day
he it is who sits yonder and she pointed to the fifth king at the table of the dead
and it came to pass that he and a woman of the country who was with him journeyed to this place and that by chance the woman learnt the secret of the doora thousand years might ye search but ye should never find that secret
then the white man entered with the woman and found the stones and filled with stones the skin of a small goat which the woman had with her to hold food
and as he was going from the chamber he took up one more stone a large one and held it in his hand here she paused
well i asked breathless with interest as we all were what happened to da silvestra the old hag started at the mention of the name
how knowest thou the dead mans name she asked sharply and then without waiting for an answer went on none can tell what happened but it came about that the white man was frightened for he flung down the goatskin with the stones and fled out with only the one stone in his hand and that the king took and it is the stone which thou macumazahn didst take from twalas brow have none entered here since i asked peering again down the dark passage
none my lords
only the secret of the door has been kept and every king has opened it though he has not entered
there is a saying that those who enter there will die within a moon even as the white man died in the cave upon the mountain where ye found him macumazahn and therefore the kings do not enter
ha
ha mine are true words our eyes met as she said it and i turned sick and cold
how did the old hag know all these things
enter my lords
if i speak truth the goatskin with the stones will lie upon the floor and if there is truth as to whether it is death to enter here that ye will learn afterwards
ha
ha
ha and she hobbled through the doorway bearing the light with her but i confess that once more i hesitated about following
oh confound it all said good here goes
i am not going to be frightened by that old devil and followed by foulata who however evidently did not at all like the business for she was shivering with fear he plunged into the passage after gagoolan example which we quickly followed
a few yards down the passage in the narrow way hewn out of the living rock gagool had paused and was waiting for us
see my lords she said holding the light before her those who stored the treasure here fled in haste and bethought them to guard against any who should find the secret of the door but had not the time and she pointed to large square blocks of stone which to the height of two courses about two feet three had been placed across the passage with a view to walling it up
along the side of the passage were similar blocks ready for use and most curious of all a heap of mortar and a couple of trowels which tools so far as we had time to examine them appeared to be of a similar shape and make to those used by workmen to this day
here foulata who had been in a state of great fear and agitation throughout said that she felt faint and could go no farther but would wait there
accordingly we set her down on the unfinished wall placing the basket of provisions by her side and left her to recover
following the passage for about fifteen paces farther we came suddenly to an elaborately painted wooden door
it was standing wide open
whoever was last there had either not found the time to shut it or had forgotten to do so
across the threshold of this door lay a skin bag formed of a goatskin that appeared to be full of pebbles hee
hee white men sniggered gagool as the light from the lamp fell upon it
what did i tell you that the white man who came here fled in haste and dropped the womans bagbehold it
look within also and ye will find a watergourd amongst the stones good stooped down and lifted it
it was heavy and jingled
by jove
i believe its full of diamonds he said in an awed whisper and indeed the idea of a small goatskin full of diamonds is enough to awe anybody
go on said sir henry impatiently
here old lady give me the lamp and taking it from gagools hand he stepped through the doorway and held it high above his head
we pressed in after him forgetful for the moment of the bag of diamonds and found ourselves in king solomons treasure chamber
at first all that the somewhat faint light given by the lamp revealed was a room hewn out of the living rock and apparently not more than ten feet square
next there came into sight stored one on the other to the arch of the roof a splendid collection of elephanttusks
how many of them there were we did not know for of course we could not see to what depth they went back but there could not have been less than the ends of four or five hundred tusks of the first quality visible to our eyes
there alone was enough ivory to make a man wealthy for life
perhaps i thought it was from this very store that solomon drew the raw material for his great throne of ivory of which there was not the like made in any kingdom on the opposite side of the chamber were about a score of wooden boxes something like martinihenry ammunition boxes only rather larger and painted red
there are the diamonds cried i bring the light sir henry did so holding it close to the top box of which the lid rendered rotten by time even in that dry place appeared to have been smashed in probably by da silvestra himself
pushing my hand through the hole in the lid i drew it out full not of diamonds but of gold pieces of a shape that none of us had seen before and with what looked like hebrew characters stamped upon them
ah i said replacing the coin we shant go back emptyhanded anyhow
there must be a couple of thousand pieces in each box and there are eighteen boxes
i suppose this was the money to pay the workmen and merchants well put in good i think that is the lot i dont see any diamonds unless the old portuguese put them all into his bag let my lords look yonder where it is darkest if they would find the stones said gagool interpreting our looks
there my lords will find a nook and three stone chests in the nook two sealed and one open before translating this to sir henry who carried the light i could not resist asking how she knew these things if no one had entered the place since the white man generations ago
ah macumazahn the watcher by night was the mocking answer ye who dwell in the stars do ye not know that some live long and that some have eyes which can see through rock
ha
ha
ha look in that corner curtis i said indicating the spot gagool had pointed out
hullo you fellows he cried heres a recess
great heavens
see here we hurried up to where he was standing in a nook shaped something like a small bow window
against the wall of this recess were placed three stone chests each about two feet square
two were fitted with stone lids the lid of the third rested against the side of the chest which was open
see he repeated hoarsely holding the lamp over the open chest
we looked and for a moment could make nothing out on account of a silvery sheen which dazzled us
when our eyes grew used to it we saw that the chest was threeparts full of uncut diamonds most of them of considerable size
stooping i picked some up
yes there was no doubt of it there was the unmistakable soapy feel about them
i fairly gasped as i dropped them
we are the richest men in the whole world i said
monte christo was a fool to us we shall flood the market with diamonds said good
got to get them there first suggested sir henry
we stood still with pale faces and stared at each other the lantern in the middle and the glimmering gems below as though we were conspirators about to commit a crime instead of being as we thought the most fortunate men on earth
hee
hee
hee cackled old gagool behind us as she flitted about like a vampire bat
there are the bright stones ye love white men as many as ye will take them run them through your fingers eat of them hee
hee
drink of them ha
ha at that moment there was something so ridiculous to my mind at the idea of eating and drinking diamonds that i began to laugh outrageously an example which the others followed without knowing why
there we stood and shrieked with laughter over the gems that were ours which had been found for us thousands of years ago by the patient delvers in the great hole yonder and stored for us by solomons longdead overseer whose name perchance was written in the characters stamped on the faded wax that yet adhered to the lids of the chest
solomon never got them nor david or da silvestra nor anybody else
we had got them there before us were millions of pounds worth of diamonds and thousands of pounds worth of gold and ivory only waiting to be taken away
suddenly the fit passed off and we stopped laughing
open the other chests white men croaked gagool there are surely more therein
take your fill white lords
ha
ha take your fill thus adjured we set to work to pull up the stone lids on the other two firstnot without a feeling of sacrilegebreaking the seals that fastened them
hoorah
they were full too full to the brim at least the second one was no wretched burglarious da silvestra had been filling goatskins out of that
as for the third chest it was only about a fourth full but the stones were all picked ones none less than twenty carats and some of them as large as pigeoneggs
a good many of these bigger ones however we could see by holding them up to the light were a little yellow off coloured as they call it at kimberley
what we did not see however was the look of fearful malevolence that old gagool favoured us with as she crept crept like a snake out of the treasure chamber and down the passage towards the door of solid rock
hark
cry upon cry comes ringing up the vaulted path
it is foulatas voice
oh bougwan
help
help
the stone falls leave go girl
then help
help
she has stabbed me by now we are running down the passage and this is what the light from the lamp shows us
the door of the rock is closing down slowly it is not three feet from the floor
near it struggle foulata and gagool
the red blood of the former runs to her knee but still the brave girl holds the old witch who fights like a wild cat
ah
she is free
foulata falls and gagool throws herself on the ground to twist like a snake through the crack of the closing stone
she is underah
god
too late
too late
the stone nips her and she yells in agony
down down it comes all the thirty tons of it slowly pressing her old body against the rock below
shriek upon shriek such as we have never heard then a long sickening crunch and the door was shut just as rushing down the passage we hurled ourselves against it
it was all done in four seconds
then we turned to foulata
the poor girl was stabbed in the body and i saw that she could not live long
ah
bougwan i die gasped the beautiful creature
she crept outgagool i did not see her i was faintand the door began to fall then she came back and was looking up the pathi saw her come in through the slowly falling door and caught her and held her and she stabbed me and i die bougwan poor girl
poor girl good cried in his distress and then as he could do nothing else he fell to kissing her
bougwan she said after a pause is macumazahn there
it grows so dark i cannot see here i am foulata macumazahn be my tongue for a moment i pray thee for bougwan cannot understand me and before i go into the darkness i would speak to him a word say on foulata i will render it say to my lord bougwan thati love him and that i am glad to die because i know that he cannot cumber his life with such as i am for the sun may not mate with the darkness nor the white with the black
say that since i saw him at times i have felt as though there were a bird in my bosom which would one day fly hence and sing elsewhere
even now though i cannot lift my hand and my brain grows cold i do not feel as though my heart were dying it is so full of love that it could live ten thousand years and yet be young
say that if i live again mayhap i shall see him in the stars and thati will search them all though perchance there i should still be black and he wouldstill be white
saynay macumazahn say no more save that i loveoh hold me closer bougwan i cannot feel thine armsoh
oh she is deadshe is dead muttered good rising in grief the tears running down his honest face
you need not let that trouble you old fellow said sir henry
eh exclaimed good what do you mean i mean that you will soon be in a position to join her
man dont you see that we are buried alive until sir henry uttered these words i do not think that the full horror of what had happened had come home to us preoccupied as we were with the sight of poor foulatas end
but now we understood
the ponderous mass of rock had closed probably for ever for the only brain which knew its secret was crushed to powder beneath its weight
this was a door that none could hope to force with anything short of dynamite in large quantities
and we were on the wrong side
for a few minutes we stood horrified there over the corpse of foulata
all the manhood seemed to have gone out of us
the first shock of this idea of the slow and miserable end that awaited us was overpowering
we saw it all now that fiend gagool had planned this snare for us from the first
it would have been just the jest that her evil mind would have rejoiced in the idea of the three white men whom for some reason of her own she had always hated slowly perishing of thirst and hunger in the company of the treasure they had coveted
now i saw the point of that sneer of hers about eating and drinking the diamonds
probably somebody had tried to serve the poor old dom in the same way when he abandoned the skin full of jewels
this will never do said sir henry hoarsely the lamp will soon go out
let us see if we cant find the spring that works the rock we sprang forward with desperate energy and standing in a bloody ooze began to feel up and down the door and the sides of the passage
but no knob or spring could we discover
depend on it i said it does not work from the inside if it did gagool would not have risked trying to crawl underneath the stone
it was the knowledge of this that made her try to escape at all hazards curse her at all events said sir henry with a hard little laugh retribution was swift hers was almost as awful an end as ours is likely to be
we can do nothing with the door let us go back to the treasure room we turned and went and as we passed it i perceived by the unfinished wall across the passage the basket of food which poor foulata had carried
i took it up and brought it with me to the accursed treasure chamber that was to be our grave
then we returned and reverently bore in foulatas corpse laying it on the floor by the boxes of coin
next we seated ourselves leaning our backs against the three stone chests which contained the priceless treasure
let us divide the food said sir henry so as to make it last as long as possible accordingly we did so
it would we reckoned make four infinitesimally small meals for each of us enough say to support life for a couple of days
besides the biltong or dried gameflesh there were two gourds of water each of which held not more than a quart
now said sir henry grimly let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die we each ate a small portion of the biltong and drank a sip of water
needless to say we had but little appetite though we were sadly in need of food and felt better after swallowing it
then we got up and made a systematic examination of the walls of our prisonhouse in the faint hope of finding some means of exit sounding them and the floor carefully
there was none
it was not probable that there would be any to a treasure chamber
the lamp began to burn dim
the fat was nearly exhausted
quatermain said sir henry what is the timeyour watch goes i drew it out and looked at it
it was six oclock we had entered the cave at eleven
infadoos will miss us i suggested
if we do not return tonight he will search for us in the morning curtis he may search in vain
he does not know the secret of the door nor even where it is
no living person knew it yesterday except gagool
today no one knows it
even if he found the door he could not break it down
all the kukuana army could not break through five feet of living rock
my friends i see nothing for it but to bow ourselves to the will of the almighty
the search for treasure has brought many to a bad end we shall go to swell their number the lamp grew dimmer yet
presently it flared up and showed the whole scene in strong relief the great mass of white tusks the boxes of gold the corpse of the poor foulata stretched before them the goatskin full of treasure the dim glimmer of the diamonds and the wild wan faces of us three white men seated there awaiting death by starvation
then the flame sank and expired
we abandon hope i can give no adequate description of the horrors of the night which followed
mercifully they were to some extent mitigated by sleep for even in such a position as ours wearied nature will sometimes assert itself
but i at any rate found it impossible to sleep much
putting aside the terrifying thought of our impending doomfor the bravest man on earth might well quail from such a fate as awaited us and i never made any pretensions to be bravethe silence itself was too great to allow of it
reader you may have lain awake at night and thought the quiet oppressive but i say with confidence that you can have no idea what a vivid tangible thing is perfect stillness
on the surface of the earth there is always some sound or motion and though it may in itself be imperceptible yet it deadens the sharp edge of absolute silence
but here there was none
we were buried in the bowels of a huge snowclad peak
thousands of feet above us the fresh air rushed over the white snow but no sound of it reached us
we were separated by a long tunnel and five feet of rock even from the awful chamber of the dead and the dead make no noise
did we not know it who lay by poor foulatas side
the crashing of all the artillery of earth and heaven could not have come to our ears in our living tomb
we were cut off from every echo of the worldwe were as men already in the grave
then the irony of the situation forced itself upon me
there around us lay treasures enough to pay off a moderate national debt or to build a fleet of ironclads and yet we would have bartered them all gladly for the faintest chance of escape
soon doubtless we should be rejoiced to exchange them for a bit of food or a cup of water and after that even for the privilege of a speedy close to our sufferings
truly wealth which men spend their lives in acquiring is a valueless thing at the last
and so the night wore on
good said sir henrys voice at last and it sounded awful in the intense stillness how many matches have you in the box eight curtis strike one and let us see the time he did so and in contrast to the dense darkness the flame nearly blinded us
it was five oclock by my watch
the beautiful dawn was now blushing on the snowwreaths far over our heads and the breeze would be stirring the night mists in the hollows
we had better eat something and keep up our strength i suggested
what is the good of eating answered good the sooner we die and get it over the better while there is life there is hope said sir henry
accordingly we ate and sipped some water and another period of time elapsed
then sir henry suggested that it might be well to get as near the door as possible and halloa on the faint chance of somebody catching a sound outside
accordingly good who from long practice at sea has a fine piercing note groped his way down the passage and set to work
i must say that he made a most diabolical noise
i never heard such yells but it might have been a mosquito buzzing for all the effect they produced
after a while he gave it up and came back very thirsty and had to drink
then we stopped yelling as it encroached on the supply of water
so we sat down once more against the chests of useless diamonds in that dreadful inaction which was one of the hardest circumstances of our fate and i am bound to say that for my part i gave way in despair
laying my head against sir henrys broad shoulder i burst into tears and i think that i heard good gulping away on the other side and swearing hoarsely at himself for doing so
ah how good and brave that great man was
had we been two frightened children and he our nurse he could not have treated us more tenderly
forgetting his own share of miseries he did all he could to soothe our broken nerves telling stories of men who had been in somewhat similar circumstances and miraculously escaped and when these failed to cheer us pointing out how after all it was only anticipating an end which must come to us all that it would soon be over and that death from exhaustion was a merciful one which is not true
then in a diffident sort of way as once before i had heard him do he suggested that we should throw ourselves on the mercy of a higher power which for my part i did with great vigour
his is a beautiful character very quiet but very strong
and so somehow the day went as the night had gone if indeed one can use these terms where all was densest night and when i lit a match to see the time it was seven oclock
once more we ate and drank and as we did so an idea occurred to me
how is it said i that the air in this place keeps fresh
it is thick and heavy but it is perfectly fresh great heavens said good starting up i never thought of that
it cant come through the stone door for its airtight if ever a door was
it must come from somewhere
if there were no current of air in the place we should have been stifled or poisoned when we first came in
let us have a look it was wonderful what a change this mere spark of hope wrought in us
in a moment we were all three groping about on our hands and knees feeling for the slightest indication of a draught
presently my ardour received a check
i put my hand on something cold
it was dead foulatas face
for an hour or more we went on feeling about till at last sir henry and i gave it up in despair having been considerably hurt by constantly knocking our heads against tusks chests and the sides of the chamber
but good still persevered saying with an approach to cheerfulness that it was better than doing nothing
i say you fellows he said presently in a constrained sort of voice come here needless to say we scrambled towards him quickly enough
quatermain put your hand here where mine is
now do you feel anything i think i feel air coming up now listen he rose and stamped upon the place and a flame of hope shot up in our hearts
it rang hollow with trembling hands i lit a match
i had only three left and we saw that we were in the angle of the far corner of the chamber a fact that accounted for our not having noticed the hollow sound of the place during our former exhaustive examination
as the match burnt we scrutinised the spot
there was a join in the solid rock floor and great heavens
there let in level with the rock was a stone ring
we said no word we were too excited and our hearts beat too wildly with hope to allow us to speak
good had a knife at the back of which was one of those hooks that are made to extract stones from horses hoofs
he opened it and scratched round the ring with it
finally he worked it under and levered away gently for fear of breaking the hook
the ring began to move
being of stone it had not rusted fast in all the centuries it had lain there as would have been the case had it been of iron
presently it was upright
then he thrust his hands into it and tugged with all his force but nothing budged
let me try i said impatiently for the situation of the stone right in the angle of the corner was such that it was impossible for two to pull at once
i took hold and strained away but no results
then sir henry tried and failed
taking the hook again good scratched all round the crack where we felt the air coming up
now curtis he said tackle on and put your back into it you are as strong as two
stop and he took off a stout black silk handkerchief which true to his habits of neatness he still wore and ran it through the ring
quatermain get curtis round the middle and pull for dear life when i give the word
now sir henry put out all his enormous strength and good and i did the same with such power as nature had given us
heave
heave
its giving gasped sir henry and i heard the muscles of his great back cracking
suddenly there was a grating sound then a rush of air and we were all on our backs on the floor with a heavy flagstone upon the top of us
sir henrys strength had done it and never did muscular power stand a man in better stead
light a match quatermain he said so soon as we had picked ourselves up and got our breath carefully now i did so and there before us heaven be praised
was the first step of a stone stair now what is to be done asked good
follow the stair of course and trust to providence stop said sir henry quatermain get the bit of biltong and the water that are left we may want them i went creeping back to our place by the chests for that purpose and as i was coming away an idea struck me
we had not thought much of the diamonds for the last twentyfour hours or so indeed the very idea of diamonds was nauseous seeing what they had entailed upon us but reflected i i may as well pocket some in case we ever should get out of this ghastly hole
so i just put my fist into the first chest and filled all the available pockets of my old shootingcoat and trousers topping upthis was a happy thoughtwith a few handfuls of big ones from the third chest
also by an afterthought i stuffed foulatas basket which except for one watergourd and a little biltong was empty now with great quantities of the stones
i say you fellows i sang out wont you take some diamonds with you
ive filled my pockets and the basket oh come on quatermain
and hang the diamonds said sir henry
i hope that i may never see another as for good he made no answer
he was i think taking his last farewell of all that was left of the poor girl who had loved him so well
and curious as it may seem to you my reader sitting at home at ease and reflecting on the vast indeed the immeasurable wealth which we were thus abandoning i can assure you that if you had passed some twentyeight hours with next to nothing to eat and drink in that place you would not have cared to cumber yourself with diamonds whilst plunging down into the unknown bowels of the earth in the wild hope of escape from an agonising death
if from the habits of a lifetime it had not become a sort of second nature with me never to leave anything worth having behind if there was the slightest chance of my being able to carry it away i am sure that i should not have bothered to fill my pockets and that basket
come on quatermain repeated sir henry who was already standing on the first step of the stone stair
steady i will go first mind where you put your feet there may be some awful hole underneath i answered
much more likely to be another room said sir henry while he descended slowly counting the steps as he went
when he got to fifteen he stopped
heres the bottom he said
thank goodness
i think its a passage
follow me down good went next and i came last carrying the basket and on reaching the bottom lit one of the two remaining matches
by its light we could just see that we were standing in a narrow tunnel which ran right and left at right angles to the staircase we had descended
before we could make out any more the match burnt my fingers and went out
then arose the delicate question of which way to go
of course it was impossible to know what the tunnel was or where it led to and yet to turn one way might lead us to safety and the other to destruction
we were utterly perplexed till suddenly it struck good that when i had lit the match the draught of the passage blew the flame to the left
let us go against the draught he said air draws inwards not outwards we took this suggestion and feeling along the wall with our hands whilst trying the ground before us at every step we departed from that accursed treasure chamber on our terrible quest for life
if ever it should be entered again by living man which i do not think probable he will find tokens of our visit in the open chests of jewels the empty lamp and the white bones of poor foulata
when we had groped our way for about a quarter of an hour along the passage suddenly it took a sharp turn or else was bisected by another which we followed only in course of time to be led into a third
and so it went on for some hours
we seemed to be in a stone labyrinth that led nowhere
what all these passages are of course i cannot say but we thought that they must be the ancient workings of a mine of which the various shafts and adits travelled hither and thither as the ore led them
this is the only way in which we could account for such a multitude of galleries
at length we halted thoroughly worn out with fatigue and with that hope deferred which maketh the heart sick and ate up our poor remaining piece of biltong and drank our last sup of water for our throats were like limekilns
it seemed to us that we had escaped death in the darkness of the treasure chamber only to meet him in the darkness of the tunnels
as we stood once more utterly depressed i thought that i caught a sound to which i called the attention of the others
it was very faint and very far off but it was a sound a faint murmuring sound for the others heard it too and no words can describe the blessedness of it after all those hours of utter awful stillness
by heaven
its running water said good
come on off we started again in the direction from which the faint murmur seemed to come groping our way as before along the rocky walls
i remember that i laid down the basket full of diamonds wishing to be rid of its weight but on second thoughts took it up again
one might as well die rich as poor i reflected
as we went the sound became more and more audible till at last it seemed quite loud in the quiet
on yet on now we could distinctly make out the unmistakable swirl of rushing water
and yet how could there be running water in the bowels of the earth
now we were quite near it and good who was leading swore that he could smell it
go gently good said sir henry we must be close splash and a cry from good
he had fallen in
good
good
where are you we shouted in terrified distress
to our intense relief an answer came back in a choky voice
all right ive got hold of a rock
strike a light to show me where you are hastily i lit the last remaining match
its faint gleam discovered to us a dark mass of water running at our feet
how wide it was we could not see but there some way out was the dark form of our companion hanging on to a projecting rock
stand clear to catch me sung out good
i must swim for it then we heard a splash and a great struggle
another minute and he had grabbed at and caught sir henrys outstretched hand and we had pulled him up high and dry into the tunnel
my word he said between his gasps that was touch and go
if i hadnt managed to catch that rock and known how to swim i should have been done
it runs like a millrace and i could feel no bottom we dared not follow the banks of the subterranean river for fear lest we should fall into it again in the darkness
so after good had rested a while and we had drunk our fill of the water which was sweet and fresh and washed our faces that needed it sadly as well as we could we started from the banks of this african styx and began to retrace our steps along the tunnel good dripping unpleasantly in front of us
at length we came to another gallery leading to our right
we may as well take it said sir henry wearily all roads are alike here we can only go on till we drop slowly for a long long while we stumbled utterly exhausted along this new tunnel sir henry now leading the way
again i thought of abandoning that basket but did not
suddenly he stopped and we bumped up against him
look he whispered is my brain going or is that light we stared with all our eyes and there yes there far ahead of us was a faint glimmering spot no larger than a cottage window pane
it was so faint that i doubt if any eyes except those which like ours had for days seen nothing but blackness could have perceived it at all
with a gasp of hope we pushed on
in five minutes there was no longer any doubt it was a patch of faint light
a minute more and a breath of real live air was fanning us
on we struggled
all at once the tunnel narrowed
sir henry went on his knees
smaller yet it grew till it was only the size of a large foxs earthit was earth now mind you the rock had ceased
a squeeze a struggle and sir henry was out and so was good and so was i dragging foulatas basket after me and there above us were the blessed stars and in our nostrils was the sweet air
then suddenly something gave and we were all rolling over and over and over through grass and bushes and soft wet soil
the basket caught in something and i stopped
sitting up i halloed lustily
an answering shout came from below where sir henrys wild career had been checked by some level ground
i scrambled to him and found him unhurt though breathless
then we looked for good
a little way off we discovered him also hammed in a forked root
he was a good deal knocked about but soon came to himself
we sat down together there on the grass and the revulsion of feeling was so great that really i think we cried with joy
we had escaped from that awful dungeon which was so near to becoming our grave
surely some merciful power guided our footsteps to the jackal hole for that is what it must have been at the termination of the tunnel
and see yonder on the mountains the dawn we had never thought to look upon again was blushing rosy red
presently the grey light stole down the slopes and we saw that we were at the bottom or rather nearly at the bottom of the vast pit in front of the entrance to the cave
now we could make out the dim forms of the three colossi who sat upon its verge
doubtless those awful passages along which we had wandered the livelong night had been originally in some way connected with the great diamond mine
as for the subterranean river in the bowels of the mountain heaven only knows what it is or whence it flows or whither it goes
i for one have no anxiety to trace its course
lighter it grew and lighter yet
we could see each other now and such a spectacle as we presented i have never set eyes on before or since
gauntcheeked holloweyed wretches smeared all over with dust and mud bruised bleeding the long fear of imminent death yet written on our countenances we were indeed a sight to frighten the daylight
and yet it is a solemn fact that goods eyeglass was still fixed in goods eye
i doubt whether he had ever taken it out at all
neither the darkness nor the plunge in the subterranean river nor the roll down the slope had been able to separate good and his eyeglass
presently we rose fearing that our limbs would stiffen if we stopped there longer and commenced with slow and painful steps to struggle up the sloping sides of the great pit
for an hour or more we toiled steadfastly up the blue clay dragging ourselves on by the help of the roots and grasses with which it was clothed
but now i had no more thought of leaving the basket indeed nothing but death should have parted us
at last it was done and we stood by the great road on that side of the pit which is opposite to the colossi
at the side of the road a hundred yards off a fire was burning in front of some huts and round the fire were figures
we staggered towards them supporting one another and halting every few paces
presently one of the figures rose saw us and fell on to the ground crying out for fear
infadoos infadoos
it is we thy friends he rose he ran to us staring wildly and still shaking with fear
oh my lords my lords it is indeed you come back from the deadcome back from the dead and the old warrior flung himself down before us and clasping sir henrys knees he wept aloud for joy
ignosis farewell ten days from that eventful morning found us once more in our old quarters at loo and strange to say but little the worse for our terrible experience except that my stubbly hair came out of the treasure cave about three shades greyer than it went in and that good never was quite the same after foulatas death which seemed to move him very greatly
i am bound to say looking at the thing from the point of view of an oldish man of the world that i consider her removal was a fortunate occurrence since otherwise complications would have been sure to ensue
the poor creature was no ordinary native girl but a person of great i had almost said stately beauty and of considerable refinement of mind
but no amount of beauty or refinement could have made an entanglement between good and herself a desirable occurrence for as she herself put it can the sun mate with the darkness or the white with the black i need hardly state that we never again penetrated into solomons treasure chamber
after we had recovered from our fatigues a process which took us fortyeight hours we descended into the great pit in the hope of finding the hole by which we had crept out of the mountain but with no success
to begin with rain had fallen and obliterated our spoor and what is more the sides of the vast pit were full of antbear and other holes
it was impossible to say to which of these we owed our salvation
also on the day before we started back to loo we made a further examination of the wonders of the stalactite cave and drawn by a kind of restless feeling even penetrated once more into the chamber of the dead
passing beneath the spear of the white death we gazed with sensations which it would be quite impossible for me to describe at the mass of rock that had shut us off from escape thinking the while of priceless treasures beyond of the mysterious old hag whose flattened fragments lay crushed beneath it and of the fair girl of whose tomb it was the portal
i say gazed at the rock for examine as we could we could find no traces of the join of the sliding door nor indeed could we hit upon the secret now utterly lost that worked it though we tried for an hour or more
it is certainly a marvellous bit of mechanism characteristic in its massive and yet inscrutable simplicity of the age which produced it and i doubt if the world has such another to show
at last we gave it up in disgust though if the mass had suddenly risen before our eyes i doubt if we should have screwed up courage to step over gagools mangled remains and once more enter the treasure chamber even in the sure and certain hope of unlimited diamonds
and yet i could have cried at the idea of leaving all that treasure the biggest treasure probably that in the worlds history has ever been accumulated in one spot
but there was no help for it
only dynamite could force its way through five feet of solid rock
so we left it
perhaps in some remote unborn century a more fortunate explorer may hit upon the open sesame and flood the world with gems
but myself i doubt it
somehow i seem to feel that the tens of millions of pounds worth of jewels which lie in the three stone coffers will never shine round the neck of an earthly beauty
they and foulatas bones will keep cold company till the end of all things
with a sigh of disappointment we made our way back and next day started for loo
and yet it was really very ungrateful of us to be disappointed for as the reader will remember by a lucky thought i had taken the precaution to fill the wide pockets of my old shooting coat and trousers with gems before we left our prisonhouse also foulatas basket which held twice as many more notwithstanding that the water bottle had occupied some of its space
a good many of these fell out in the course of our roll down the side of the pit including several of the big ones which i had crammed in on the top in my coat pockets
but comparatively speaking an enormous quantity still remained including ninetythree large stones ranging from over two hundred to seventy carats in weight
my old shooting coat and the basket still held sufficient treasure to make us all if not millionaires as the term is understood in america at least exceedingly wealthy men and yet to keep enough stones each to make the three finest sets of gems in europe
so we had not done so badly
on arriving at loo we were most cordially received by ignosi whom we found well and busily engaged in consolidating his power and reorganising the regiments which had suffered most in the great struggle with twala
he listened with intense interest to our wonderful story but when we told him of old gagools frightful end he grew thoughtful
come hither he called to a very old induna or councillor who was sitting with others in a circle round the king but out of earshot
the ancient man rose approached saluted and seated himself
thou art aged said ignosi
ay my lord the king
thy fathers father and i were born on the same day tell me when thou wast little didst thou know gagaoola the witch doctress ay my lord the king how was she thenyoung like thee not so my lord the king
she was even as she is now and as she was in the days of my great grandfather before me old and dried very ugly and full of wickedness she is no more she is dead so o king
then is an ancient curse taken from the land go koom i go black puppy who tore out the old dogs throat
koom ye see my brothers said ignosi this was a strange woman and i rejoice that she is dead
she would have let you die in the dark place and mayhap afterwards she had found a way to slay me as she found a way to slay my father and set up twala whom her black heart loved in his place
now go on with the tale surely there never was its like after i had narrated all the story of our escape as we had agreed between ourselves that i should i took the opportunity to address ignosi as to our departure from kukuanaland
and now ignosi i said the time has come for us to bid thee farewell and start to see our own land once more
behold ignosi thou camest with us a servant and now we leave thee a mighty king
if thou art grateful to us remember to do even as thou didst promise to rule justly to respect the law and to put none to death without a cause
so shalt thou prosper
tomorrow at break of day ignosi thou wilt give us an escort who shall lead us across the mountains
is it not so o king ignosi covered his face with his hands for a while before answering
my heart is sore he said at last your words split my heart in twain
what have i done to you incubu macumazahn and bougwan that ye should leave me desolate
ye who stood by me in rebellion and in battle will ye leave me in the day of peace and victory
what will yewives
choose from among the maidens
a place to live in
behold the land is yours as far as ye can see
the white mans houses
ye shall teach my people how to build them
cattle for beef and milk
every married man shall bring you an ox or a cow
wild game to hunt
does not the elephant walk through my forests and the riverhorse sleep in the reeds
would ye make war
my impis wait your word
if there is anything more which i can give that will i give you nay ignosi we want none of these things i answered we would seek our own place now do i learn said ignosi bitterly and with flashing eyes that ye love the bright stones more than me your friend
ye have the stones now ye would go to natal and across the moving black water and sell them and be rich as it is the desire of a white mans heart to be
cursed for your sake be the white stones and cursed he who seeks them
death shall it be to him who sets foot in the place of death to find them
i have spoken
white men ye can go i laid my hand upon his arm
ignosi i said tell us when thou didst wander in zululand and among the white people of natal did not thine heart turn to the land thy mother told thee of thy native place where thou didst see the light and play when thou wast little the land where thy place was it was even so macumazahn in like manner ignosi do our hearts turn to our land and to our own place then came a silence
when ignosi broke it it was in a different voice
i do perceive that now as ever thy words are wise and full of reason macumazahn that which flies in the air loves not to run along the ground the white man loves not to live on the level of the black or to house among his kraals
well ye must go and leave my heart sore because ye will be as dead to me since from where ye are no tidings can come to me
but listen and let all your brothers know my words
no other white man shall cross the mountains even if any man live to come so far
i will see no traders with their guns and gin
my people shall fight with the spear and drink water like their forefathers before them
i will have no prayingmen to put a fear of death into mens hearts to stir them up against the law of the king and make a path for the white folk who follow to run on
if a white man comes to my gates i will send him back if a hundred come i will push them back if armies come i will make war on them with all my strength and they shall not prevail against me
none shall ever seek for the shining stones no not an army for if they come i will send a regiment and fill up the pit and break down the white columns in the caves and choke them with rocks so that none can reach even to that door of which ye speak and whereof the way to move it is lost
but for you three incubu macumazahn and bougwan the path is always open for behold ye are dearer to me than aught that breathes
and ye would go
infadoos my uncle and my induna shall take you by the hand and guide you with a regiment
there is as i have learned another way across the mountains that he shall show you
farewell my brothers brave white men
see me no more for i have no heart to bear it
behold
i make a decree and it shall be published from the mountains to the mountains your names incubu macumazahn and bougwan shall be hlonipa even as the names of dead kings and he who speaks them shall die
so shall your memory be preserved in the land for ever
this extraordinary and negative way of showing intense respect is by no means unknown among african people and the result is that if as is usual the name in question has a significance the meaning must be expressed by an idiom or other word
in this way a memory is preserved for generations or until the new word utterly supplants the old oneaq
go now ere my eyes rain tears like a womans
at times as ye look back down the path of life or when ye are old and gather yourselves together to crouch before the fire because for you the sun has no more heat ye will think of how we stood shoulder to shoulder in that great battle which thy wise words planned macumazahn of how thou wast the point of the horn that galled twalas flank bougwan whilst thou stood in the ring of the greys incubu and men went down before thine axe like corn before a sickle ay and of how thou didst break that wild bull twalas strength and bring his pride to dust
fare ye well for ever incubu macumazahn and bougwan my lords and my friends ignosi rose and looked earnestly at us for a few seconds
then he threw the corner of his karross over his head so as to cover his face from us
we went in silence
next day at dawn we left loo escorted by our old friend infadoos who was heartbroken at our departure and by the regiment of buffaloes
early as was the hour all the main street of the town was lined with multitudes of people who gave us the royal salute as we passed at the head of the regiment while the women blessed us for having rid the land of twala throwing flowers before us as we went
it was really very affecting and not the sort of thing one is accustomed to meet with from natives
one ludicrous incident occurred however which i rather welcomed as it gave us something to laugh at
just before we reached the confines of the town a pretty young girl with some lovely lilies in her hand ran forward and presented them to goodsomehow they all seemed to like good i think his eyeglass and solitary whisker gave him a fictitious valueand then said that she had a boon to ask
speak on he answered
let my lord show his servant his beautiful white legs that his servant may look upon them and remember them all her days and tell of them to her children his servant has travelled four days journey to see them for the fame of them has gone throughout the land ill be hanged if i do exclaimed good excitedly
come come my dear fellow said sir henry you cant refuse to oblige a lady i wont replied good obstinately it is positively indecent however in the end he consented to draw up his trousers to the knee amidst notes of rapturous admiration from all the women present especially the gratified young lady and in this guise he had to walk till we got clear of the town
goods legs i fear will never be so greatly admired again
of his melting teeth and even of his transparent eye the kukuanas wearied more or less but of his legs never
as we travelled infadoos told us that there was another pass over the mountains to the north of the one followed by solomons great road or rather that there was a place where it was possible to climb down the wall of cliff which separates kukuanaland from the desert and is broken by the towering shapes of shebas breasts
it appeared also that rather more than two years previously a party of kukuana hunters had descended this path into the desert in search of ostriches whose plumes are much prized among them for war headdresses and that in the course of their hunt they had been led far from the mountains and were much troubled by thirst
seeing trees on the horizon however they walked towards them and discovered a large and fertile oasis some miles in extent and plentifully watered
it was by way of this oasis that infadoos suggested we should return and the idea seemed to us a good one for it appeared that we should thus escape the rigours of the mountain pass
also some of the hunters were in attendance to guide us to the oasis from which they stated they could perceive other fertile spots far away in the desert
it often puzzled all of us to understand how it was possible that ignosis mother bearing the child with her should have survived the dangers of her journey across the mountains and the desert dangers which so nearly proved fatal to ourselves
it has since occurred to me and i give the idea to the reader for what it is worth that she must have taken this second route and wandered out like hagar into the wilderness
if she did so there is no longer anything inexplicable about the story since as ignosi himself related she may well have been picked up by some ostrich hunters before she or the child was exhausted was led by them to the oasis and thence by stages to the fertile country and so on by slow degrees southwards to zululandaq
travelling easily on the night of the fourth days journey we found ourselves once more on the crest of the mountains that separate kukuanaland from the desert which rolled away in sandy billows at our feet and about twentyfive miles to the north of shebas breasts
at dawn on the following day we were led to the edge of a very precipitous chasm by which we were to descend the precipice and gain the plain two thousand and more feet below
here we bade farewell to that true friend and sturdy old warrior infadoos who solemnly wished all good upon us and nearly wept with grief
never my lords he said shall mine old eyes see the like of you again
ah
the way that incubu cut his men down in the battle
ah
for the sight of that stroke with which he swept off my brother twalas head
it was beautifulbeautiful
i may never hope to see such another except perchance in happy dreams we were very sorry to part from him indeed good was so moved that he gave him as a souvenirwhat do you thinkan eyeglass afterwards we discovered that it was a spare one
infadoos was delighted foreseeing that the possession of such an article would increase his prestige enormously and after several vain attempts he actually succeeded in screwing it into his own eye
anything more incongruous than the old warrior looked with an eyeglass i never saw
eyeglasses do not go well with leopardskin cloaks and black ostrich plumes
then after seeing that our guides were well laden with water and provisions and having received a thundering farewell salute from the buffaloes we wrung infadoos by the hand and began our downward climb
a very arduous business it proved to be but somehow that evening we found ourselves at the bottom without accident
do you know said sir henry that night as we sat by our fire and gazed up at the beetling cliffs above us i think that there are worse places than kukuanaland in the world and that i have known unhappier times than the last month or two though i have never spent such queer ones
eh
you fellows i almost wish i were back said good with a sigh
as for myself i reflected that alls well that ends well but in the course of a long life of shaves i never had such shaves as those which i had recently experienced
the thought of that battle makes me feel cold all over and as for our experience in the treasure chamber
next morning we started on a toilsome trudge across the desert having with us a good supply of water carried by our five guides and camped that night in the open marching again at dawn on the morrow
by noon of the third days journey we could see the trees of the oasis of which the guides spoke and within an hour of sundown we were walking once more upon grass and listening to the sound of running water
found and now i come to perhaps the strangest adventure that happened to us in all this strange business and one which shows how wonderfully things are brought about
i was walking along quietly some way in front of the other two down the banks of the stream which runs from the oasis till it is swallowed up in the hungry desert sands when suddenly i stopped and rubbed my eyes as well i might
there not twenty yards in front of me placed in a charming situation under the shade of a species of figtree and facing to the stream was a cosy hut built more or less on the kafir principle with grass and withes but having a fulllength door instead of a beehole
what the dickens said i to myself can a hut be doing here even as i said it the door of the hut opened and there limped out of it a white man clothed in skins and with an enormous black beard
i thought that i must have got a touch of the sun
it was impossible
no hunter ever came to such a place as this
certainly no hunter would ever settle in it
i stared and stared and so did the other man and just at that juncture sir henry and good walked up
look here you fellows i said is that a white man or am i mad sir henry looked and good looked and then all of a sudden the lame white man with a black beard uttered a great cry and began hobbling towards us
when he was close he fell down in a sort of faint
with a spring sir henry was by his side
great powers he cried it is my brother george at the sound of this disturbance another figure also clad in skins emerged from the hut a gun in his hand and ran towards us
on seeing me he too gave a cry
macumazahn he halloed dont you know me baas
im jim the hunter
i lost the note you gave me to give to the baas and we have been here nearly two years and the fellow fell at my feet and rolled over and over weeping for joy
you careless scoundrel i said you ought to be well sjambockedthat is hided
meanwhile the man with the black beard had recovered and risen and he and sir henry were pumphandling away at each other apparently without a word to say
but whatever they had quarrelled about in the pasti suspect it was a lady though i never askedit was evidently forgotten now
my dear old fellow burst out sir henry at last i thought you were dead
i have been over solomons mountains to find you
i had given up all hope of ever seeing you again and now i come across you perched in the desert like an old aasvgel vulture
i tried to cross solomons mountains nearly two years ago was the answer spoken in the hesitating voice of a man who has had little recent opportunity of using his tongue but when i reached here a boulder fell on my leg and crushed it and i have been able to go neither forward nor back then i came up
how do you do mr neville i said do you remember me why he said isnt it hunter quatermain eh and good too
hold on a minute you fellows i am getting dizzy again
it is all so very strange and when a man has ceased to hope so very happy that evening over the camp fire george curtis told us his story which in its way was almost as eventful as our own and put shortly amounted to this
a little less than two years before he had started from sitandas kraal to try to reach sulimans berg
as for the note i had sent him by jim that worthy lost it and he had never heard of it till today
but acting upon information he had received from the natives he headed not for shebas breasts but for the ladderlike descent of the mountains down which we had just come which is clearly a better route than that marked out in old dom silvestras plan
in the desert he and jim had suffered great hardships but finally they reached this oasis where a terrible accident befell george curtis
on the day of their arrival he was sitting by the stream and jim was extracting the honey from the nest of a stingless bee which is to be found in the desert on the top of a bank immediately above him
in so doing he loosened a great boulder of rock which fell upon george curtiss right leg crushing it frightfully
from that day he had been so lame that he found it impossible to go either forward or back and had preferred to take the chances of dying in the oasis to the certainty of perishing in the desert
as for food however they got on pretty well for they had a good supply of ammunition and the oasis was frequented especially at night by large quantities of game which came thither for water
these they shot or trapped in pitfalls using the flesh for food and after their clothes wore out the hides for clothing
and so george curtis ended we have lived for nearly two years like a second robinson crusoe and his man friday hoping against hope that some natives might come here to help us away but none have come
only last night we settled that jim should leave me and try to reach sitandas kraal to get assistance
he was to go tomorrow but i had little hope of ever seeing him back again
and now you of all people in the world you who as i fancied had long ago forgotten all about me and were living comfortably in old england turn up in a promiscuous way and find me where you least expected
it is the most wonderful thing that i have ever heard of and the most merciful too then sir henry set to work and told him the main facts of our adventures sitting till late into the night to do it
by jove said george curtis when i showed him some of the diamonds well at least you have got something for your pains besides my worthless self sir henry laughed
they belong to quatermain and good
it was a part of the bargain that they should divide any spoils there might be this remark set me thinking and having spoken to good i told sir henry that it was our joint wish that he should take a third portion of the diamonds or if he would not that his share should be handed to his brother who had suffered even more than ourselves on the chance of getting them
finally we prevailed upon him to consent to this arrangement but george curtis did not know of it until some time afterwards
here at this point i think that i shall end my history
our journey across the desert back to sitandas kraal was most arduous especially as we had to support george curtis whose right leg was very weak indeed and continually threw out splinters of bone
but we did accomplish it somehow and to give its details would only be to reproduce much of what happened to us on the former occasion
six months from the date of our rearrival at sitandas where we found our guns and other goods quite safe though the old rascal in charge was much disgusted at our surviving to claim them saw us all once more safe and sound at my little place on the berea near durban where i am now writing
thence i bid farewell to all who have accompanied me through the strangest trip i ever made in the course of a long and varied experience
psjust as i had written the last word a kafir came up my avenue of orange trees carrying a letter in a cleft stick which he had brought from the post
it turned out to be from sir henry and as it speaks for itself i give it in full
october
brayley hall yorkshire
my dear quatermain i send you a line a few mails back to say that the three of us george good and myself fetched up all right in england
we got off the boat at southampton and went up to town
you should have seen what a swell good turned out the very next day beautifully shaved frock coat fitting like a glove brand new eyeglass etc etc
i went and walked in the park with him where i met some people i know and at once told them the story of his beautiful white legs he is furious especially as some illnatured person has printed it in a society paper
to come to business good and i took the diamonds to streeters to be valued as we arranged and really i am afraid to tell you what they put them at it seems so enormous
they say that of course it is more or less guesswork as such stones have never to their knowledge been put on the market in anything like such quantities
it appears that with the exception of one or two of the largest they are of the finest water and equal in every way to the best brazilian stones
i asked them if they would buy them but they said that it was beyond their power to do so and recommended us to sell by degrees over a period of years indeed for fear lest we should flood the market
they offer however a hundred and eighty thousand for a very small portion of them
you must come home quatermain and see about these things especially if you insist upon making the magnificent present of the third share which does not belong to me to my brother george
as for good he is no good
his time is too much occupied in shaving and other matters connected with the vain adorning of the body
but i think he is still down on his luck about foulata
he told me that since he had been home he hadnt seen a woman to touch her either as regards her figure or the sweetness of her expression
i want you to come home my dear old comrade and to buy a house near here
you have done your days work and have lots of money now and there is a place for sale quite close which would suit you admirably
do come the sooner the better you can finish writing the story of our adventures on board ship
we have refused to tell the tale till it is written by you for fear lest we shall not be believed
if you start on receipt of this you will reach here by christmas and i book you to stay with me for that
good is coming and george and so by the way is your boy harry theres a bribe for you
i have had him down for a weeks shooting and like him
he is a cool young hand he shot me in the leg cut out the pellets and then remarked upon the advantages of having a medical student with every shooting party
goodbye old boy i cant say any more but i know that you will come if it is only to oblige your sincere friend henry curtis
psthe tusks of the great bull that killed poor khiva have now been put up in the hall here over the pair of buffalo horns you gave me and look magnificent and the axe with which i chopped off twalas head is fixed above my writingtable
i wish that we could have managed to bring away the coats of chain armour
dont lose poor foulatas basket in which you brought away the diamonds
hc today is tuesday
there is a steamer going on friday and i really think that i must take curtis at his word and sail by her for england if it is only to see you harry my boy and to look after the printing of this history which is a task that i do not like to trust to anybody else
